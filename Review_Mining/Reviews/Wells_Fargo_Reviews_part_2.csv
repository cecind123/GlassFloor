rating,review
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells. Very friendly and helpful people. I was a contractor. Salary was not the best. Didn't have any benefits since I was not full time.
good,"A company that provided great customer service, while attending to customer  needs. There were classes  provided to help you learn your job better.  Benefits and pay could have been better."
good,Wells Fargo Advisors is a great place to work if you are lucky to land on the right team. The majority of my career there was rewarding and I made some wonderful friends there. I transitioned to a different team at the end and regretted the move after the fact. The work tasks were the same but the management team was difficult. I had no opportunity to transition to another team and resigned from the company.
good,Had all tools required for production.  A safe and productive place to work.  Support staff was excellent.  A Bank presence would have been very helpful I securing new clients.  Especially for client reassurance.
good,a lot of stress that's not equal the compensation. Job has a lot of ways to get yourself terminated that are natural human mistakes that are monitored and can be corrected .
good,"Hated job and management, the money is what kept me there also the hours were terrible but i gained great experience and made some life friends. Kids are raised and would like to return to try it out again and maybe get into a different department with different people."
good,"Typical day for me would be coming in 30 minutes early, get myself together to start the day(coffee),Sign into my system and start handling customer questions and concerns. Keeping myself on task so that I can perform and produce my monthly metrics. Sometimes depending on the call flow I would be asked to get off the phone and assist other bankers in areas they may be having trouble(coaching sessions), or acting as floor support for my team,"
good,"Besides assisting customers and maintenance of accounts, one must sell products and there's a monthly quota to meet. If your sales driven, I highly recommend this job. If not, then one can still try and decide for oneself."
good,"A typical day as a loan officer with wells fargo was not typical.  Your day was based on a previous days work or appointments.  It was not a 9 to 5 office job, you was responsible for the mortgage needs of branch facilities assigned and organizing and maintaining a pool of customers and realtors that bring you business. It was a time when the mortgage industry was just recovering from one of the largest mortgage crisis in history and business was slow."
good,Great place to work and great  benefits. Would recommend it anyone who was looking to work in finance. Generous paid time off and holiday schedule and health benefits.
good,"The company is good place to start a career with, if you are willing to do so. Beware of a lot of favoritism though. It was the biggest issue I had with the company, beside the lack of raises."
good,"Typical day was slow due to our branch being newer. We ran a productive branch, processing customer transactions in a timely manner. Branches have a lot of favoritism, i recommend not to trust anybody, especially management. Marina Del Rey location was a fine location with many pleasant customers."
good,"I don't have much to say."
good,"ok place to work, high stress level environment, have to work under pressure. set schedule, including weekends and holidays, volunteer hours are schedule twice a year."
good,Typical workday would include answering phone calls to assist team members with password reset issues with a variety of applications or monitoring applications performance.
good,fast pasted high productivity work environment. This was a credit card department for visa and MasterCard. Clients applied for credit and we had to review the applications for approval or denial.
good,"It provided me with banking experience. "
good,This was a desktop migration for Wells Fargo through an outside contractor. The most enjoyable part of the job was I that I was in constant contact with the end users.
good,"Wachovia took over SouthTrust Bank. It was a culture shock to most, but Wachovia was a good company withy excellent senior leadership in the call center area."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I haven't worked here in quite some time so it is difficult for me to accurately star what the culture is now.....When I was there, I enjoyed my work and the people"
good,"boring place to be "
good,"I was only there for a year , I really do not remember much of the company. I was doing data entry , I worked from  6PM to 2AM. It was a job until I could find something more permanently. I dont really remenber anything about the job."
good,It treated employees differently based on age preferences; in my experience.  They kept people who were willing to work for less because their attendance and performance kept their paychecks low and new management threatened to get rid of employees who were exceeding companies expectations and getting their earning raises to the point that they would leave voluntarily as the work place was exasterbating health conditions based on performance stress and pressure would be forced to quit voluntarily.  This kept companies insurance costs down intentionally and with a cold business heart that no longer showed integrity or compassion for its employee's and soon there after their customers.
good,Relaxed atmosphere to work in.  Employees generally liked working there everyday.  Not a lot of stressful days. Worked as a team.  Safety is key like at most places.
good,"I work in Document Custody where we regularly handle documents and files for millions of people. We are expected to pull or file a certain amount of items per hour, which is often easy enough to do. It is not a difficult job and everyone there is very friendly and we get along. Some days can be stressful when there is a lot to do but at least you will always have something to do. I personally rated three stars because while I am good at my job it is difficult to advance and I feel many of us are underpaid. I am unhappy with the recent public image of WF and I think they can do better for their employees."
good,Wellsfargo is a great place to work.  In the department im in there is no more opportunities.  I started in the call center and worked in that department for 6 years.  I then moved on to the Loss prevention department and worked there 4 years.  I'm now in the Quality department  and have been in that department going on 4 years now.
good,There are a lot of opportunities for career advancement at Wells Fargo.  The hours are the major down-side; the schedule can be challenging for a young family.
good,"Working at this bank for your first job is fine, after that it gets redundant as there is not much room for advancement. This job is good if you are trying to earn work experience."
good,"I hear the full timers are pretty happy with benefits and work life balance but in many groups the contractors are expected to ""cover"" for the full timers over the holidays, not given the same work-life-balance flexibility and have no recourse if mistreated by managers - as such managers may abuse contractors while being good to their full timers."
good,"Good branch to work at FRIENDLY customers, the permanent staff a boy to be around not many opportunities for advancement in the bank teller filled but on the call center there is"
good,"Good starter job fresh out of high school. Professional work environment co workers were amazing. There "
good,"Fortune 500 worked there 7 years "
good,"There  is definitely room for career growth at Wells Fargo.  I feel as though if you work really hard, you will be rewarded.  Great place to get banking experience."
good,"The people who work there make the job fun, I went into this job thinking it would be one way but when the lawsuit & settlement came out I feel like everyone is walking on eggshells."
good,"GREAT company to start off in, but Eventually you will want to move onto bigger better things . You will have a great work environment Wells Fargo employees are amazing ."
good,"Overall a good place to work, but like any big company they will cut the workforce as it fits their will. I saw many of my fellow employees lose their jobs through no fault of their own"
good,pay is not equivalent to job duties but the benefit and paid time off is great. A lot of departments have no idea what the functionalities are of each despite working parallel to each other. They are very keen on executing work loads with low staff and less unrewarding pay.
good,"look up wells fargo sales culture in the news, this pretty much sums everything that I could type up in this review. In case you missed it they had a pretty heavy culture of pressure sales"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The ability to be flexible.  In any banking industry the work load is based on the economy.  One things that this company was good at was keeping talent if at all possible.  Moving people to different areas with the bank as to keep talent and give employees the opportunity to learn something new.
good,As an employee was instructed to sell products and services only and guide customers to self serve telephones for customer service issues it appears they may be changing.
good,My manager at Wells Fargo was the best manager I have ever had. She was an exceptional leader and positive influence in my life. She pushed our team to be the best in the area.
good,"reviewing the accuracy of: appraisals, credit reports, verification of employment (i.e. paystubs, tax returns) bank statements, home-owner’s insurance binders, preliminary title reports and final settlement statements.  Reviewed for any possible red flags before submitting to underwriting department.  Communicated extensively with customers, Home Mortgage Consultants, Underwriters and Attorney’s."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with and getting to know different people. Learning different aspect of the mortgage industry and growing professional and personally with the company for the past 7 years. Wells is a good company to work for.
good,Great company friendly environment and good pay with benefits. Good working hours as well as education reimbursement. Full time employee and full time student management very understanding
good,"I provided teller services for complex customer transactions, balanced daily settlements, and met customer needs.   Ensured compliance with financial rules, regulations and policies."
good,"Very competitive, stressful, management not the most caring regarding well being of employees but this does vary by person, very, very high pressure sales atmosphere."
good,"The company had an excellent training program and one of the most user-friendly software programs I have ever encountered. There is a huge support system for every issue you may encounter so, it really helps you feel supported."
good,loved the coworkers and enjoyed the customers management was good. working sales had to be made and met had to b on top of things work was steady and easy going
good,"My day typically consist of coaching and providing feedback to the staff. In additional, I conduct several role play and skill practice to ensure employees understand their roles and execute effectively"
good,It was a stressful position and we should have been compensated for it... I don't feel like the company is a bad place to work for I just feel the position I was in is what wasn't the best...
good,job places were wonderful and most of the colleagues are nice. I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo bank very much during those time while i was on board at wells fargo
good,Wells Fargo overall is a good company. Just like any large organization it has its pros and cons. Management in my opinion should focus more on the employees and not so much the big wigs or higher ups.
good,I worked for Wells Fargo when it was originally Northwest Bank.  It was a great job for me to have getting into the workplace and stepping out on my own
good,"- Typical corporate banking environment"
good,"The job was only meant to provide my way through school and thankfully.  Management is a joke, could never get PTO or Doctor visits off for ultrasounds or anything like that once I graduated.   They work you to the ground."
good,"Wells Fargo really needed to open more opportunities and better training process to either contractor and/or staff. Also, better incentives for yearly performance review."
good,"Ever since the scandal, this place has become difficult to work. No management level support is provided to employees and they don't feel safe anymore working,"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"i worked here when sales, sales, and sales, over powered everything. sales goals were high and at times stressful to achieve. worked on saturdays unit 6 PM!!! the work environment was a plus. incentive pay."
good,"I worked at the Silver Lake Plaza in WellsFargo for a year.  The people I worked with were great, but the position itself is effectively a dead in.  It is great though for getting basic banking knowledge if you're looking to get into the industry, but get out quickly unless you want to stay in the retail of banking only.  The management here treats you like you're in high school, not allowing you to have internet access or cell phone usage at all even when there are no costumers and referrals ""sales"" and metrics are the only thing they care about.  Could get an average of 4.5 out of 5 and it is deemed unacceptable.  Of course there is no benefit for performing well since they will never promote you or fire you."
good,"It was a pretty good environment, always pretty busy, which i didn't mind, I liked Data Entry and I was gaining experience.  The people were nice and I got along with everyone."
good,"If you like to be in the banking industry, this can be a company that you can look into it. Fast peace environment always trying to reach your goal in sales."
good,"There is a good camaraderie in this place. Teamwork."
good,"I enjoy working for Wells Fargo as a financial crimes specialist III. It’s very relaxed and my manger’s really nice and understanding. I also enjoyed working as a teller, although I wouldn’t go back to doing that. I like being in the back office away from customers."
good,"would initiate conversations with customers in order to help them keep their accounts in good standing "
good,"If you want to work for Wells Fargo, be ready to sell. They are very competitive and pushy with their sales goals. I did not like being micromanaged there."
good,"I enjoyed my years at Wells Fargo, The environment at branch I worked was one of great teamwork.  We became a family of friends and truly enjoyed each other's company."
good,Its a great job but is stressful due to it being a good ways out of the city but its a decent paying job. The stress comes from traveling expenses and constantly having to upsell customers. It makes alot of people quit.
good,Helped write some asp.net applications for viewing performance data on their IBM servers at all the Wells Fargo branches. This was an interesting application and I really enjoyed my co-workers when i was there.
good,Its ok.  Im a Contractor and was never hired.  Major layoffs throughout the company.  People are nice once you get to know them.  Many benefits if hired.
good,"cube environment. stressful. unlikely to satisfy a work life balance, especially if you have a family.  can make money if you are willing to put in several hours of overtime.  good benefits."
good,"Typical work day was very busy."
good,"Great company to work at, your growth depends on your work ethic. Con, Who and which branch you work for makes all the deference in gaining knowledge and growth."
good,"The staff in the office was fun fun fun, but there were problems.  A lot of careless use of P Cards for expense accounts.  I found it very disturbing."
good,"Paid Time Off and insurance benefits are okay"
good,Job envioment depends on the Financial Advisor you work for as every FA has their own unique style. Management was very laid back whick would allow some co-workers to take advantage of that opportunity. Over-all it was a decent place to work with good benefits provided you worked for a good financial advisor.
good,"Managed a team of 12-20."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at wells was full of change and adaptability which afforded me with proficient skills in communication, organizing, attention to details, work independently or as a team, monitoring, compiling, high production goal oriented and motivation as needed. The best part and the hardest part of my job was most of the time -change-but  presented a challenge-which I  had to apply one of my favorite skills-problem solving skills."
good,"There were no opportunities of advancement in my position that were given to me anyway. I worked there 15 years and was not promoted one time. Every time I brought it up, they upped the requirements. I got tired of that. Upon leaving I found out I was being paid less than what they posted for my replacement in the new job ad."
good,good place to work.  Good culture. compensation could be better.  management is going through transition.  Made some poor choices.  lucky enough to have good manager and team lead.
good,Exciting if you like meeting new people every week. Very repetitive tasks. Not for those who prefer a challenging role. Best suited for those who prefer routine
good,Great learning experience low pay.  Management was not effective being producing manager.  The focus seemed to be limited. I would recommend new loan officers to get experience and education with this company.
good,not a good part of the company. pretty stressful job. didn't enjoy getting yelled at by people. not easy to convince them to pay bills when they didn't have the money. got in trouble if you didn't get x amount of contacts or payments. but not my fault if people didn't answer their phones
good,at the time of employment Wells fargo was sales driven which made it hard to enjoy a day without feeling the pressure. but as times changed I'm sure it's different now.
good,"Professional environment."
good,"This experience with Wells Fargo went well, I just had to take another position because Wells Fargo didn't pay enough. If I had been compensated appropriately I would have stayed longer."
good,I got laid off from Wells Fargo after being with them for over 4 years.  I would work with Wells Fargo again. I am not sure in what area of the bank. I would consider loans again.
good,"Finance Specialist, I enjoy educating customers of the operation and explain terms of the financial institution, educate"
good,"Currently the industry is struggling to meet the growing demands of technology, due to the complexity of systems and processes yielding from mergers in the past."
good,"This was a great group, but it no longer exists as the remaining members all left and went to Wilmington Trust.  We worked on some really interesting deals that weren't possible elsewhere."
good,"It was okay, but I was there when that market was expanding exponentially.  The types of products that this group marketed and worked on were a major reason for the 2008 financial collapse."
good,"At first, I was in heaven that I was working for Wells Fargo.  What I learned at the company is to never get pregnant and sick or you will get laid off.  My doctor wrote me out for a couple of weeks and when I got back, I didn't have a job."
good,"Was young needed job, seemed like a decent job choice at the time. I was still looking for something a little bit more challenging. It worked while I was there."
good,The work environment was great overall. Needs a little more structure. Every other week i was placed in a different department while being under paid.
good,"I started off in the loan processor assistant, then learned to manage the office by providing staff assistant to their clients.  I helped with seminars and assist clients with loan needs as well as home buying process."
good,I like it a lot. It is a fun place to work. I would reccomend this job to anyone that would like a fast paced job and enjoys handling cash all day long.
good,WFHM was a great company to get started in my professional career. I learned a lot about customer service and a lot about regulations in the banking and mortgage industry.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The work is not hard as a teller. I have had very bad experiences with management staff. The wrong people are promoted and then do a bad job because they don't know what they're doing. The culture is clique-ish. If you want to work in banking as your life career then this could be good if you make friends with the right people, but moving up is not without sacrifice, expect to move if you ever want to move up in the company."
good,"The location I was located was great.  Right downtown in a great NH Seacoast Location."
good,5 years with this company and it was nice until you get a manager that is young and wants to impress his bosses. i was late to work one too many times after being on time for the 4 years and that wasn't enough
good,"Pros"
good,"productive it was alright , didnt really like the job thought it was unfair and bias towards customers especially when it came to upselling even if they were broke we stil had to ask"
good,"Working several jobs in a day to get work completed for customers."
good,There were always company functions going on which kept the associate connected. Very supportive of volunteering and giving back to the community. Training was made available.
good,"A typical place to work. There are some good people some not to good. The benefits used to be good,  not so much any more.  A lot depends on the manager."
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo for actjually one yr, "
good,"It is an ok place to work,"

good,help customer with deposit cash checks welcome customer to the branch always smiling. balance cash draw at the end of day  be able to  identity  fraud check..
good,"The job itself was not very difficult. Volume was very high. Worked on a six person team that was only staffed with four employees. It was a sink or swim mentality. Learned a lot in a small amount of time. Management was easy to talk with, just super stressed. Most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with clients and helping them reach their dreams/goals."
good,"Hard to learn their rules, ................................ Was expected to read the dozens of emails per day..................and also stay on the phones at the same time."
good,Professional environment wth capable team members working together to address customers needs. The company has given ALL of the necessary tools to be successful.
good,"The years I spent with AGE and Wachovia and WellsFargo I experienced a positive and fair environment.  Overall, this company was goal driven and allowed and provided team members to achieve what they were set out to do."
good,"Every department within this company, whether financial or mortgage is different.  Everyone will have a different experience within each department.  What works for some does not work for everyone.  I have worked in great departments with a good atmosphere and also departments that were not the easiest to get through."
good,"Registered Investment Advisor-commission based only. Series 6, 63, 65, I had brought in one hundred thousand dollars in assets. This was under a contracting relationship."
good,"Wells Fargo Ltd is a good place to work. Learning new information is inevitable. The exposure is great for entry levels. However the remunerations are not as motivating and therefore with time, the urge to work with them levels down. Time keeping is a culture of the organization, lateness is not tolerated."
good,Collectors were treated by supervisors like idiots. Emotions were taken out on selected individuals and personality conflicts were dealt with by firing.  Don't upset the boss or your out.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"As a contractor, I worked as a data analyst, using mostly SQL and EXCEL, to review and verify data, including complex calculations, for remediation projects."
good,process requests for payment expectation for chapter 13 plans. I have enjoyed my 4 years in Bankruptcy. My current manager is very open and easy to work with.
good,over all this was a fun placed to work. The customers were over all nice and friendly. and the work environment was structured and fast paced. i enjoyed the products and services they offered.
good,making calls to dealers to ensure wells fargo were secured as lienholder on vehicle titles  verifying lienholder information with dealers correcting discrepancies on titles
good,The company was to focused on their sales goals as appose to doing whats right for the company and whats right for the clients and customers.  Huge company that needs a lot of growing up to do.
good,"As of 2007 when I departed Wells Fargo, the benefits were pretty great. Tons of PTO, stock options, a true 6% dollar-for-dollar 401K match, and affordable health care."
good,Overall it’s a great company although the management wasn’t the best and the hours also were hard to compensate I would recommend this job to anyone that has free time.
good,The experience gain working with Wells Fargo is something that is not taught at any school. you will experience Customer Service at the highest level.
good,"Workplace culture is good. Management knows where the company is heading. Not much of interaction though between different departments. "
good,The environment changed tremendously when the corporation changed to Wells Fargo.  Totally different work ethics and managerial skill sets.  Wells Fargo came in with a totally unethical way of doing things.
good,"Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, ""making"") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning."
good,"you always have to reach your goals at the end of the month , service manager will have a 1 on 1 with you if you don't meet them, you also have to ALWAYS keep a conversation with your costumer always the whole time the customer is standing on your window, service manager will stand right behind you to make sure you are."
good,"Support customers"
good,"Reviewed documents for credit exceptions at time of funding, maintained a 2 day turn around time. "
good,A contractor does not actually participate in FTE benefits. I was part of a temporary team to convert a large Books and Record software upgrade. I cannot comment on FTE benefits
good,"Great location, adequate benefits, supportive staff/colleagues,excellent compliance resources, bank ownership meant a lot of bureaucracy that became really tiresome"
good,I started with Wachovia and then Wells bought them out. The stress and pressure put on us to sell accounts was more than I could handle so I chose to leave the company.
good,Generally well paying and having many opportunities as it is a large company one can do quite well.  Unfortunately if seems that in light of recent investigations and further allegations one might hesitate to work for a company with questionable ethics at the leadership levels
good,This was a rewarding organization to work for but this position did not keep me busy enough. However it did give me a insight into employee benefit and retirement plans that sent me to TIAA-CREF.
good,"Fast-paced environment with complex release schedules."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for if you are in a good group.  Some of the upper management have big egos and can treat others in a very condescending manner. If you are not thick skinned or are a nice person, you should not work there."
good,"Huge company, if you are looking for the sort of atmosphere where you can thrive in the very long haul, this could be the ideal place for you. There is such a variety of positions available, you can really find yourself in any place in this corporate empire but don't take my word for it, try applying today!"
good,I have enjoyed working with this team.  The management staff is amazing.  I like working at Wells Fargo but I will eventually leave because the opportunity for advancement is too stiff the pay is too low.  I can't get a place to live after transferring to a new city because they say I make too little.  It's obvious my skill set is way above my job description but it seems there is no interest in getting me in the right job that would benefit me and Wells Fargo.
good,"Assist callers with banking needs."
good,"Constant learning on the feet required in a fast paced environment. Good team structure and decent hours. Great benefits, market rates with management providing a culture for growth."
good,"Wells Fargo was about as stereotypical as a bank telling job can be. Very boring, transactional, and numbers based. As a teller at Wells Fargo, you are expected to try and sell products as well as perform deposits and withdrawals for customers."
good,"good experience but would never go back, mgmt was unprofessional, pay is low, they often set you up for failure there. I would not recommend working here"
good,It was a great starting place and was able to move up fairly quickly if you are willing to work hard. There is a good amount of sales pressure so you need to be willing to handle that.
good,Wachovia was a good bank to work for.  Great culture.  The issue was when it became Wells Fargo.  Their vision and values did not agree with mine.  You were told to get sales any way you could.  I don't operate that way.
good,Highly recommended for a part time job as a teller.. I learned so much about the finance world and how to deal with confidential informations.  Its a great place to work part time.
good,"Wells Fargo focuses on valuing you as an employee and providing recognition when its due. Great pay and competitive atmosphere, a lot of opportunity to work overtime."
good,it was a good place to work at. Friendly coworkers. Financial Advisors were friendly. Management was easy to deal with and handled quenstions and solved their inquiries.
good,"Good environment to work, training often, good team to work with, fun and lots of employees activities to keep staff together, enjoyable that you felt that you were helping others."
good,"SO, I could write a full review of my time at Wachovia, but it seems like that would be a waste of time, given it no longer exists.  I am not able to offer any input on the company that took it over, Wells Fargo."
good,"A degree to answer the phone in a call center. Very demeaning, I apparently Lacked the tact for Promotional opportunity, so I left. The Pay Sucked, but the work setting was great.... Great meals, Dry Cleaning in-house along with Dental office and nail salon...."
good,"It's been over a decade since I last worked there. "
good,"•	Advise and assist customers with creating new bank accounts at Wells Fargo as well as setting up savings accounts authorizing loans and transferring money. "
good,"A lot of Changes for the Better have been mad recently more customer service based, focusing on what the customer actually wants and needs and not just trying to hit a goal"
good,"The company has difficulty retaining employees because they do not focus on career development enough. There is little education in what is happening in the company, which causes tunnel vision."
good,"This is a good company! The hardest part is that you may work on weekends as the company operates 24 x 7."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The firm is very slow to act and react to information.  Lots of focus on process and procedures.  Takes the fun out of working.  Group think is the modus operandi.
good,"Wells Fargo care about clients , I was never treated at any bank the same way we were treating our customers ."
good,Other than the health insurance and 401k benefits WELLS FARGO IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY TO WORK FOR. Choose another bank or credit union. They have crazy standards and terrible management. The pay is so minute and not even worth the stress that put on you.
good,"The life at wells Fargo is very fast paced the calls come back to back, and it very difficult to get lost. Training is very critical that you pay attention due to there is so many rules and regulations to follow."
good,Each branch have a different culture related to branch manager expectation.  It is not that easy to keep all the managers agreed with your willingness to help them.
good,"They provide classroom training for the job at hand, but the months and year can be predicted. It's a good job if you are a social butterfly. There is always chances to advance."
good,"As a banker you are a seller."
good,"Wells Fargo is a nice company to work for, however they are in the news to much. I work in a productivity department and that can make the days long and hard."
good,Fast paced workplace. Managers provided consistent feedback and provided training to ensure departmental objectives were meet. Full-time and contract employees were treated as equals. Great group of people to work with and I which my time there could have been longer.
good,"I enjoyed meeting the people and they were nice, but I did not like"
good,"The turnover in high here. Not much work in the summer when the NBA & NHL seasons are over. If you hang in there for the first year, you will get a substantial raise."
good,"I am unable to provide a review since I was a temp and signed a contract to not release details of the position or working conditions."
good,Wells Fargo Dealer Services is a great place to learn and grow in Auto collections. Your individual contributions help the team achieve the goals. good base and commission structure.

good,It is an ever changing environment. I don't agree with some of their business practices but over all my co workers/ work family made coming to work enjoyable
good,"My responsibilities were to provide banking support to Wells Fargo customers, up sell products and services that might benefit them and process transactions or requests that the customer had; all while maintaining a referral and sales quota every day."
good,There isn't work and life balance at least in the current team I am in..I am planning on changing company or the team I work with. And also I don't like there pace of advancement.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Sit back and giggle: This movie is just a good, cheesy time. Take a big helping of Hairspray and sprinkle it with a candy-covered version of My So-Called Life and what you have is the totally tubular '80s teen dance movie Girls Just Want to Have Fun. Complete with bad fashions, bad hair, and even worse dancing, This movie features some of today's most popular actors doing some of the cheesiest things you've ever seen. . Watch her doing back flips and practicing dance lifts a la Dirty Dancing. Witness the Oscar-winning actress Hunt hamming it up in some of the most absurd -- but actually worn -- '80s ensembles and big, ratted-out hair. It's Totally Awesome without the irony. And if you love the '80s, it is totally awesome."
good,If you focus it's not difficult I personally think it's very depressing because you're dealing with dead people and people being abused financially if you're in the legal department so as long as you stay away from that then you're good
good,"I acquired this position through a temp agency."
good,I was hired on as a mortgage claims analyst 2 July of 2016 and went through the training and was very hopeful that it would be exciting experience in my career came to find out that right after training we are expected to do a play pipeline of loans which is 6 a week and I did not feel I was getting the support I needed. Plus I feel that a lot of my concerns were not listen to and I feel that I was possibly being discriminated against because of my age
good,"I do not have a review for this job, company or place where I have worked. I will keep my personal opinion to myself. I do not think it matters what I think."
good,"I can learn a lot of how to deal with different kinds of people, improve your customer service skills since WFB is more like a service-paced financial institution. And the quarterly bonus is more likely base on the whole branch customer surveys. If we got good rating from customers we can get higher pay for it. Of course, as a banker, you are also a salesperson, sales goal is required. However, because of the settlement, sales goal is not as high as before, especially for lower level positions."
good,Wells Fargo taught me the operations working of a loan. They taught me different laws on bankruptcy and repossession. They also gave me the opportunity to enhance my verbal and written skills as well as my leadership skills.
good,"The culture at the call center that I worked for was vary lay back."
good,I enjoyed my time at wells Fargo I was able to learn allot about the mortgage industry. I started off in customer service and worked my way up to manager before they started downsizing
good,My job was to further assist home owners in trying to save there home and get caught up with the payments which would proceed in trying to apply for a modification. Greatest part was when I was able to contact them and advised was approved and worst feeling and letting them know was not approved and would be needing to move shortly. It was a stressful job at sometimes and it had its good times my department was the home owners last defense due to the fact they had already tried everything else so they filed bankruptcy so that we were not able to proceed with foreclosure.
good,"worked with student loans and was one of the first call centers I worked at, so was a very good learning experience though I knew that it wasn't the department i really wanted to be at."
good,"It has been 17 years since I left this firm, i do not recall any of the pros and cons of working from Wells Fargo. Though I have met wonderful people at WF."
good,This was bought out by Wells Fargo. Great place to work due to the people and the atmosphere. Lots of incentives. Have to a self a starter and hard worker to advance.
good,"Wells Fargo customer service model is terrible, the only thing they care about is getting a Wells Fargo Credit and Debit Card in everyones hands.  do not recommend."
good,The company at the time consist of sales goals. Calling on current clients to up sell them with other products that were offered by Wells Fargo Financial.
good,Very hard to work at wells fargo because they had crazy amount of account and credit cards accounts you had to open daily and if you didn't you had to stay after work so management would talk to you to see why you haven't reach your goal. I didn't have to because I was top seller but alot of the employees did.
good,I had a great time working for wells. It was really enriching and I learned a lot about banking. The hardest part is the tiresome nature of customer service.
good,"we had terrible management, it was definitely hard to stay positive with such negativity coming from management. but other coworkers and customers were really what kept you coming back. awesome benefits."
good,"As a temp contractor, Wells Fargo offered an easy culture with reasonable expectations of their employees. Pay was low but so were expectations and other employees were friendly."
good,Wells Fargo is a good company despite recent news.  I enjoyed my time there until they moved our center to another state. They did provide warning as to the impending move to give time for employees to seek other employment
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The collection job is difficult but the management and compensation are fair. The hours are typical and flexible if you need to work night or morning shifts.
good,"Customer greeting and sales. Deposits to account, and withdrawals.Have training classes about every six monthes. Morning meeting to let you know what was expected of the day."
good,"They have a good work environment and they try to promote from within the company.  Although they didn't offer specific advancement training, they were willing to look to promote from within."
good,"During the time of employment by Wells Fargo there was a lot of pressure from higher ups to meet quota. This resulted negatively all around. Not fun. Huge corporation, everything to the t. Learning experience definitely."
good,WF was a good company to work for but with everything going on with the company I would not like to be associated with the company at this point and time. I would like to find a company that cares more about their employees.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to grow a career.  The culture values independent thinking and individuals who have the capacity to change as appropriate to ensure customer needs are me.
good,Looking for better work environment.  Bank is too big and has too much red tape.  Very difficult to get good deals booked.  No local decisions made regarding loan requests.
good,It was great working with the customer I did. Helping them with their finances.  I enjoyed working with the teller and being as helpful as I am with them as well as the bankers.
good,"My internship was nation-wide, but I had a very small branch office to work out of. My coworkers there were very nice and helpful, I had different tasks to do each day that kept me busy."
good,I think that helping people with problems on their accounts and researching information for the customer was channelling but rewarding at the same time.
good,It is always important to form your own opinion along with making sure that a job fits what you are looking for instead of going by someone else s opinion.
good,For a part time position this was a good place to work that offered flexible hours and the opportunity to advance and learn the banking industry from the branch perspective.
good,"You earn your paycheck, but it does pay more than most college jobs. There is a high level of competency expected, and you have to be alert at all times. When I worked there we had sales goals, but since they have been removed. I would say that loss prevention, sales and customer service were the top concerns of the company, but what order they came in depended on your manager and the current customer."
good,helpful employees and management. Calm work environment. Management went above and beyond to make staff comfortable and successful. Training was great and precise to the job.
good,"Good learning opportunity. Managers are engaged, great learning environment. Ability to advance across other departments and learn.good balance with work."
good,it was good to begin with and then merged with another bank and it got very bad- people were being let go from Wachovia to make room for the other banks employees
good,"move at your own pace, very independent nobody bothers you, co-workers are very friendly, over all mostly busy and steady day. always have a chance to correct something"
good,This was a learning experience for me. There were many quotas to meet but the training was decent for the employees. I did learn more abut customer service in my time with this company.
good,"For the most part this is a good company to work for. Management was supportive for the most part, but did have to report up to several levels at times. Benefits are okay. Wells is a very giving company and allows employees to give time to community support."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A rewarding job experience, working in a very goal driven environment.  I am required to provide excellent customer service as well as account management.  I am responsible for collecting and entering customers personal account information."
good,Here is where I morphed from marketing to training.  It was the only division in the company I found interesting - online merchant services.  It was a stable company coming from the dot.com era.
good,The goals are logical with adequate support. The pace is quick and focused. Teams change a lot and thd atmosphere is goal oriented. Lots of growth opportunity.
good,"•	Working knowledge of FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, FHA & VA servicing default requirements"
good,"One of the things I loved about Wells Fargo for the 13 years I worked there was the strong culture and expectation of respectful behavior. "
good,"challenging but rewarding. takes time to move up. good PTO. no more monthly bonus only annual. The the bad hype about Wells Fargo has fallen on the baseline employee's shoulder, this has resulted in a poor employee environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job was getting corporation and assistance management when needing assistance. Management only spoke to you when you did something wrong,"
good,"Corporate and accessible banking branches throughout the San Fernando valley, Los Angeles, Orange County, Silicon Valley and San Francisco along representatives agents."
good,Was only there for about 6 months prior to the Real Estate crash in 2008.  My company was acquired by Wachovia late in 2007 and most employees were laid off within 6 months.
good,Wells is one of the largest banks in the world. With this said it is no surprise of the of the plethora of opportunities that one can find within its walls. A great place to start a career.
good,"Busy; banking/IT/labor laws/Local, State, Fed banking laws; mgmnt ok; large org/compliance; work from home; teamwork; multiple locations; compensation package is fair"
good,Spend more time with compliant issues less on generating new business  The didn't deliver quality bankers who were motivated to provide quality leads.
good,"Wells Fargo is what it is. Obviously they have been filled with scandals the last few years. It was an ok place to work, but they didn't treat their employees the best."
good,work load sometimes not evenly distributed; repeated called upon to take over other's workload to pick up slack. management can be difficult to approach.
good,"Pros"
good,Assessing customer needs and providing financial solutions. Helped with administrative duties and spoke with clients on a daily basis. Open bank products.
good,"Love working with a team. I have never played ping pong at the work place. I did love cooking for my team . ,Thanksgiving was great! I wish management would see ME.I am a great employee!!!! This is STUPID I have said all I have too say!!!"
good,The bank is a great place to learn or if you love to work in team groups. Is a great place to accomplish your goals. Very secured with personal information for our clients. Just working with my community I felt great.
good,"Growing environment, fast paced, flexiablity could be improved in many areas for better work/life balance.  Leaderhip is imporoving as well and more opportunities for growth."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells fargo sets high sales goals for its associates, which I believe have since changed. This was my reason for leaving their company but i hope the changes they've implemented have helped their employee satisfaction."
good,"Overall the WF culture is positive, however, the last team I worked in was managed by fear.  All decisions were made based on how certain managers would react--not what was best for the business or the customer.  It became a 'tell-them-what-they-want-to-hear' position, which didn't always include telling the whole truth."
good,"•Worked with design and development of a Group of Trading applications used by Security Finance division. The applications handle the securities lending activities of Capital Markets including security borrows, loans, and REPO trading."
good,if you don't mind being on the phone it is a pleasurable work environment and workplace.  Cant add much more because its been a few years since I've worked there.
good,"Overall good company, sales goals are semi extreme.  Banking center management is great.  Wells Fargo has sales goals for different areas and sales goals are enforced."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was my manager, he was great at communicating and training.  He has since moved on and taken his positive management skills with him"
good,Wachovia/Wells Fargo was a great company to work for simply because you could go far within the the company corporate ladder. You may start off in entry level but with great work ethics and determination you can become very successful as you find greater oppurtunites.
good,"Always good people to work with. Office politics seem to get in the way of work at times but hey that's everywhere you go. Good benefits, and vacation time is great."
good,"Hour long lunches"
good,"Big company, doesn't move quickly but overall very well run. Management is accessible and they seem to listen to input from their employees. Being the size that they are they seem to always be hiring"
good,"Great company to work for but due to economic changes, the banking industry is evolving. The lending department is moving in a streamline process where human interaction is becoming obsolete."
good,"Typical day at work consist of processing transactions, providing customer service, up selling accounts. i learned a lot about bettering my credit. management really didnt know what they were doing, typically they just went with the flow. i loved all my coworkers everyone came from different backgrounds but agreed on one thing"" just trying to provide a good life for there family"". the hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management. they also just go with the flow. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers about there everyday lives."
good,"There are multiple IT locations in North Carolina."
good,Wells fargo is alright if you can work well under pressure and all you do is sit all day taking calls back to back......................................................
good,This employer made very drastic changes in the last few years of my employment there.  Not very fair with their hiring practices. Will overlook a more qualified candidate to hire ones they prefer.
good,It's a bank. The pay is okay. Management is okay. You're definitely a number. There is no personal experience with anyone and all they managers really care about is themselves.
good,It is a sale based job. They stand behind you to make sure your selling to every customer. If you like sales job then this is the job for you and you will go far with the company.
good,The technology for this company is amazing. They just had unrealistic sales goals when I worked there. But not that they cut them out I am sure it is a better environment to work for.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo was a fairly good place to work.  Being a mortgage loan officer had its challenges especially when it came to getting the loans through underwriting.  The down side would be the turn around time getting loans approved.
good,Working in a call center.. Taking inbound calls from people experiencing fraud on their bank accounts. Working with multiple systems simultaneously. Not much growth available.
good,A team environment willing to assist Sales and Relationship management in managing client and consultant needs. Partners work across teams to achieve goals.
good,"A typical day at work, if working in a production environment, is a fast-paced world with team members who identify and route documents. The team function described has been relocated to another location within the company and is required to be done timely and confidentially."
good,"•	Processed mortgage loans for borrowers wanting to refinance their homes "
good,"Worked in many large banks, the culture here is much like a regional bank instead of a national one. Decisions are difficult to come by as it seems there are so many regions or different/opposing methods depending on location."
good,"Typical company where you are one in 1,00,000 people working. The pay raises are small over the years. Lots of pressure to reach ones goals in a competitive job market"
good,I learned a lot working for this company.  My immediate manager encouraged me to further my career and I appreciate that.  It was stressful at times working there.
good,I think that Wells Fargo has a lot of potential with this new direction we are taking. They are taking positive steps to move towards a better Wells Fargo
good,Average is not necessarily bad - I just didn't feel strongly about the company either way.  It is a typical project environment with expected pros and cons.
good,"Need to stop with workbooks, they were needed daily and checked by managers  Needs other ways to help customers. No more using sales to hit bonuses. Customers first"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. It gave me the ability to grow to be a more productive and effective team member. I would highly recommend this employer to others.
good,"My time there was fine although I was not technically a Wells Fargo employee, but a contracted project manager. The employees there seemed happy and were treated moderately well."
good,"Great place to have first job as an entry level worker who wants to work within finance, accounting, general business etc. High pace, medium demand. Good benefits."
good,"for people who like startup culture, this isn't a good fit. People work in small little gray cubicles and feel suffocated. the training was inadequate"
good,"Assisted customers who were in foreclosure or in danger of being in foreclosure in saving their homes, Set up mortgage modifications and monitored modifications to insure customers success in saving their homes."
good,Currently completed project for our military service family. Findings will be taken to court and handled by judge. Locate findings and correct them before going in front of judge. Determining  what we are going to do for the customer.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo from a business analyst perspective/project manager allows consultants to take a project involved with it without micromanagement from senior leaders and the team members are very supportive.
good,"Overall ok company, need more opportunities for growth and development. Also need to increase pay and employees will be more willing  to perform at higher level"
good,When i was at wells fargo I started a a clollections rep I enjoyed working for this company becuase there is alot of opportunity for growth and advancement.
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company. Fun environment. good pay friendly staff. A lot of sells , but fairly easy. The call center is a  little bit ghetto."
good,"I worked with refinancing. It was a high stress environment mostly due to manager. Once we got the company caught up in volume, we were all expendable and laid off."
good,"I would recommend this job to a friend. The pay is good, the hours are good, and the managers seem to really care about the employees. Just have to meet those quotas."
good,The company itself has great benefits and an environment for the employees.  I thoroughly enjoyed working for this institution.  They underpay their bankers but you can still work your way up depending on who your management team is.
good,"Wells Fargo provided some nice opportunities if you were willing to work towards the goals you set. Benefits were fair with decent compensation. Holiday pay was fantastic, since you were required to work certain holidays each year. Overall was not a bad company, I just did not agree with some of the policies."
good,It was a good place to work without a lot of stress for a long time but in the last 3 years or so it became more stressful as they started nit-picking work in order to improve productivity.
good,Long days helping other associates do their job they are either not properly trained or are too lazy to find the information themselves. Makes me rethink who to trust my money with.
good,A typical work day was always busy. The staff are not college graduate and it made it hard to have a decent conversation with them. the bosses were micro managers
good,"•	Working knowledge of FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, FHA & VA servicing default requirements"
good,The management team where unprofessional the hours are great but due to bad experience i wouldn't recommend working there to anyone who would be under the same management.
good,"Co workers are awesome "
good,"A typical day at work involves interaction with team members, business partners, and vendors. I have been engaged in extensive organizational transformation initiatives resulting in improved efficiencies. Workplace culture is collaborative with emphasis on performance and work life balance. The hardest part of my job is balancing workflow priorities with work life balance during peak processing times. The most enjoyable part is seeing the results of transformation initiatives materialize."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great learning experience for me, allowed me to learn a little about mortgages and loans. Typical day at work was always busy and fun making for a great workday."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Typical day to day operations for a Teller or banker position. Handle financial customer service related issues. Also included cross selling functions.
good,"Retail banking is very sales driven with a high emphasis on customer service. If you do not want the pressure of making challenging sales numbers, this is not a work environment for you."
good,"This job is extremely high volume, you can take anywhere between 80-110 calls a day and you have several different goals to meet throughout the day. ."
good,The people that you work with are great the management is not very understanding about personal issues but over all it's a decent place to work.  The training staff is awesome.
good,"I literally enjoyed working for Wells Fargo for the manager I supported, until he decided to transition into retirement.  He left to go to another department working only part time. They don't have admin support where he is - it is outsourced."
good,Great. Typical day was fun. Had a great time. Learned a lot. Met a lot of people. Built professional network. Good working conditions. Great clients. Wonderful staff.
good,Good Place to work. Have good work life balance. The company has opportunity in different domains and encourages employees to grow internally. The company also encourage in investing in the employee.
good,"Competent work place, however, restricted opportunities to move between departments as of my last job role. Compensation is adequate. Work/Life balance is adequate but difficult to achieve."
good,"Family feel office, nice staff, advanced technology, benefits included, ever growing company, with growth potential, clean environment. pay is competitive"
good,"•	Keep records of money and negotiable instruments involved in performing various financial transactions"
good,I think the employees are very nice and respectful they handle customers needs in a timely manner. they have good account benefits. they are always willing to help.
good,the branch level was corrupted to do high management goals. Did not provide support to team.  Their was no work life balance. Pay was not great.  Sales go was too high.
good,working with people and their money. if they have questions you do the best to answer question  and get the right person to talk to them about there account.
good,"Professional atmosphere. Management continued to look for ways to progress and grow the print department."
good,Love the volunteer hours given as well as the family environment. No direct problems with management on any levels. At times the work and expectations were a little out of reach but my mangers were there with kind words and help me through.
good,Good learning experience. Company dealt with subprime market. Helped clients with debt consolidation and refinancing their homes. Opportunity to learn about the housing market.
good,"Retail Banking - Big Bank mentality.  Lots of goals & expectations for cross-sell & number of products per household.  You may find a small bank & avoid these demands but you will discover that all small banks want to grow up to be Wells Fargo someday..."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work for people who thrive in a sales environment. There was always something to do and new things to learn. lots of room for growth if you wanted.
good,A good environment for anyone wanting a start in financial banking. This job is great for a young person who's unsure what direction they would like to go.
good,"rated on referral work, customer service driven, high pressure environment, high turn around. would recommend for corporate type environment. friendly coworkers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,All bonuses are commission based and this leads to a highly competitive environment in the office. This also leads to very questionable practices when opening accounts and credit cards. Service manager would often open credit cards without customer's consent and would often steal employees passwords to access their systems and use their tills without permission.
good,"Bank Merger and New bank computer system caused delay in work processes which Management was very supportive and assisted team in work completion."
good,nothing to review this company is satisfactory. if you need a job to pay the bills that is stable this is a good option. This is a good starter job for the banking industry to be able to get experience to get a better paying job with another financial institution.
good,"I worked with WF for over 7 years in FL and AZ.  Some locations were better than others, however, it was my first time in my life that I was ever laid-off so I'm not too happy with this company.  So many good people that gave 100% and unfortunately, when times got tough for the corporation - they didn't care about their employees."
good,"I held various positions during my tenure with Wells Fargo.  Was given the opportunity to expand my skill set and grow my career.  "
good,"Its okay, its a job..the managers and leads are always on edge.. The pay is okay, the PTO is wack.. But it pays the bills. Its a great stepping stone but that's about it"
good,"retail banking and call center, competitive environment, sales, room for advancement, great pay and benefits as well, bonuses also offered, workplace culture is great"
good,I typical day is working.I have no learning experience. management is not the best. workplace is fine.hardest part of the day is being here .most enjoyable part is leaving for the day.
good,The policies and procedures changed almost daily. It was difficult to know what was expected of you from one day to the next. The job was very sales intensive at first but they later eliminated sales goals which made the job less stressful.
good,Requires a ton of focus. The hours don't change but the environment is very fast pace some times. The managers are all great and the employees are as well.
good,"Havent worked here in a while, sales goals were impossible to reach and I can see why they are in so much trouble now with all of that and their employees."
good,"I worked for Wachovia, not wells fargo so I wouldn't be the greatest person to ask about working for Wells Fargo. Wachovia was a great company to work for"
good,"At Wells Fargo you often felt like a cog in a machine, less part of a team working for the greater good once they changed their mortgage platform. What started out as a place full of opportunity became a place of stifled corporate culture."
good,I did not enjoy the position. There were continuous calls and too much required to cover on a call that had a maximum call handle time of only 4 minutes. I had to try and sell a product to every customer and my sales were being monitored. Wells Fargo later was sued for that exact same requirement that has now been removed.
good,Wells Fargo is a company that only cares about the sales at the end of the day. It doesnt matter if the customer realizes what they are getting or not. If it makes the bank money they want the employees to do it.
good,Benefits are great however management can all depend. The company cares first and foremost about numbers only ...if your lucky you may get a manager that acutally cares about their people and sees behind just numbers . it can be very stressful at times and if you call out sick it can ruin your overall month of getting bonus . very hard to advance you must know someone in other departments to even have a chance . call center is always changing the rules of qa requirement so can be hard to keep up at times . the benefits make it bearable but its not a place you will wake up excited to go to every day.
good,"Had a very loving service manager but that was about it, and was there for almost 2 years, i was super consistent but they didnt talk to me about growth or upping pay i got basic raises but with my consistency and my energy and level 5 CS ability in shouldve been paid much more and tellers at my branch were doing ALOT it was very busy and i felt the company didnt care."
good,"It is a huge company, and sometimes things get lost. Over all they are a good company to work for, I world recommend them to others. It also depends on your manager. There's a lot of bad ones or there, and if you get one, it sucks."
good,"Based on banking sales your job is always on the line,as a teller you don't always get credit for the sale you made because they can only get sold thru bankers."
good,The turnover where I worked was very high. Management would treat entry level employees like a number; not an asset so people didn't ever stay very long.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The specifics regarding a contract position vary with each situation.  This company did not utilize empathy or understanding in my own personal situation.
good,"Senior Teller requires dedication and attention to detail. Everyday you will learn something different. there are different personalities that you will encounter on a daily basis, but overall a fun place to work"
good,"Help people with their baking needs. Was not at job long enough to give a full review. Typical day is assisting people with their accounts, opening new accounts, and offering different banking products to meet sales goals"
good,Unfortunately due to issues within the corporation my department was dismantled. There is a possibility they can rebound but I'd be leary based on my experiences.
good,"Great day to day when talking with customers."
good,The main focus at Wells Fargo was to reach sales goals. This meant that the needs of the customers were not properly met. It was a tense atmosphere - always waiting for the second shoe to drop.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work for. They give you a lot of in depth education on the banking systems. The culture is great. I have met many colleagues that I call friends now.
good,"- log in check email for any protocol updates and assignments, call existing customers to collect on past due mortgage accounts"
good,"Allows room to grow"
good,Retail isn't for everyone and that's me. It's a great job to move up quick and learn a lot of things with good hours and great benifits even if you are part time
good,"The department could have used more training and help from instructors. I found that making calls every day to our customers and even other coworkers in other departments, no one really could explain anything. it was not the best work experience"
good,A great place to work the people are very fun loving and easy to get a long with. They will make you fill right at home and treat you just like family.
good,"The most enjoyable part was networking. "
good,"Company was very professional and everyone I was in contact with was nice, accommodating and understanding. Provided all needed information about contact"
good,In this company you are assigned specific sales goals and these drive the employees to compete in a friendly manner to attain said goals. This sales oriented environment is conducive to monetary gain.
good,"Fast paced environment which requires drive, intellect and effective relationship skills. The job provides you the opportunity to continually learn something new every day."
good,"great leadership roles "
good,"Fast paced, learn something new everyday, work with great people, good hours, salary better than most departments, flexible work schedule, always training"
good,The building is a great place to be working in.  Has fitness center and restaurants right inside it.  Always a clean space to be in and very helpful people to go to if you have questions.
good,"Good work environment with good people to work with. Job responsibilities are well known and clear. Supervision is such to allow you to do your job without being micromanaged. Benefits are acceptable with corporate 401k contributions better than most. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"placed roadblocks at the end based on fear of lawsuits, audits"
good,"My day typically consisted of taking customer complaints over the phone, but that wasn't nearly the hard part of the job. The disorganization of the management would be the worst part however the people employed there for the most part are good people who make the workday bearable to get through."
good,"while initially hired as a temp employee, I was hired as a perm within several months.    Went through several upper managers that would put emphasis on different things which would put the site management in a ""tither"""
good,"I loved the people I worked with and it was a great opportunity to learn about building relationships, understand how to sell and create value in all of my client's relationships"
good,"It was a nice place to work and learn about sales.  I worked at my own pace, with a manager that let you explore your own entrepreneurial spirit.  That was great."
good,Lots of phone calls trying to acquire new clients.  Senior management can sometimes forget to take a look at the front lines.  High lending rates cause a disadvantage to the customer.
good,"Sodexo has stuctured work days, minute by minute, to get production completed on schedule. Always fun and interesting people to meet, vendors to interact with and new projects to take on."
good,"Compensation and benefits were very competitive, but there was a lot of pressure from supervisors to push for sales that customers didn't need and even to fudge sales numbers. While I was there, a banker was fired for cheating on sales. Not the most inspiring work environment."
good,"It was a really bad year for Wells Fargo, probably the worst in their history. It's a dysfunctional company from top to bottom. The are weakening the economy and the middle class."
good,In spite of the recent uncoverings this company continues to pressure bankers in sales. They they attempt to hide it and calling it customer needs it is not about the customer it is about their bottom line. I never heard of offering a homeless person a credit card until I got to this company.
good,For a corporate big bank it was a good place to work until WF acquired Wachovia at which point the culture and technology sector went downhill.  No I would say it's just another big bank culture.
good,"Very well maintained department. Great company to work for. They feed you on some Friday's, who doesn't love that. Strict attendence policy but that's any call center"
good,"It really depends what department you are in. If you are looking into a call center job, find something better. The call center is life sucking environment full with undeserving, uneducated ""leaders"" that back stab you in many ways. If you exhibit some form of intelligence there, many will view you as a threat... Leaders are determined by ""who you know and whoever likes you"""
good,"Job consist of normal teller duties. Assist with transactions and have knowledge of banking products. You tend to become close to the people you work with and can rely on them with any concerns or questions you have about your title. Management is good but can become hit or miss, some banks cycle through managers often and things can get miscommunicated. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the changes within the company relating to policies and procedures. Every since the last major lawsuit and CEO change, customer traffic changed and the company constantly implements new rules that require to keep up with. It is also harder to move up in the company because you have no achievements to present related to sales since the sales goals were removed."
good,I love working with the people here at Wells Fargo.  But its hard to move forward in other career opportunities within the company.  Right now I am looking for other opportunities to help me grow in more of a leadership role.
good,"lots of call procedures and mortgage information. workplace is very structure,must adhere to scheduled time for different duties. Learned a lot about buying a home"
good,"I love my current job and the people I work with but hate the metrics and feeling lost and unappreciated in a BIG company.  "
good,"There are pros and cons to working here, as any place.  This company is very sales-driven, but also has many great benefits and ability to advance.  This company does want you to have a good balance of free time and work, and I would work for them again in the future."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"great consulting experience. this was a short term project. Helped with server installs, and uninstalls. I visited many first union site to upgrade to the Wachovia bank sites."
good,Management is engaged in my advancement. Learning everyday the best customer service to provide my customers. Very nice business casual environment. The hardest part is the mandatory overtime.
good,"I was told there would be leads but they never materialized.  later they said go develop outside sources of business and while I did, it was not enough and the programs were limited."
good,Sold student loans.  Great leadership and training staff.  Management was top notch.  Only left because it was a seasonal job. Solid morale at Wells Fargo
good,"I feel that tellers need to be treated like there more important instead of all the way at the bottom, because with out them the bank cant run smoothly."
good,"I worked in Home Preservation and there was very little common sense used in making decisions regarding processes. So much busy work made it difficult to get through my actual work. The culture is great as are the benefits, just don't expect them to take your suggestions for streamlining processes."
good,Company changes to disburse their processors into individual offices put a lot of employees having to drive over an hour away and a complete inconvenience.  The management team changed and it wasn't about the employees anymore.
good,"Wells Fargo has the well-earned reputation as a sales-driven company. They would make their employees stay late, after they were scheduled to be off, in order to get more sales for the day. Ridiculous."
good,Solid management with strong desire to support team members.  Technology is a key area needed from an investment perspective. Very customer centric organization
good,Wells Fargo cares about Wells Fargo but I did learn a lot working with the company and they did invest in my future. I am thankful to have worked here and learned a lot. I recommend it for the experience
good,"Was a place that was family oriented with a great level of moral. after being acquired by WellsFargo, many things changed. However, it was still a great place to work"
good,Good company to work for. Management is friendly and they do have opportunities in other areas of the company. Training is not the best you can really practice self development.
good,My position is a great stepping stone for someone who seeks a career within the financial industry or human resources.  I service payroll and leaves for Wells Fargo team members.  Working over the phone can become draining and redundant.  My coworkers are the best part of my job because we help get one another through the day.
good,mortgage is always changes. It was a bad economy when working for them. slow moving advancement. No manage accountability for advancement outside their job performance scale
good,"Frequently changing org structure. decent salary. no onsite opportunities. changing management team. decent learning opportunities, changing priorities. dealing with senior management is toughest"
good,Overall working for this company has had benefits for me. I went to this company with no mortgage knowledge and I've gained a lot of knowledge along the way.
good,Its a fine bank to work at I like working there I just am trying to advance my career. The management  is fair to it's employees and the customers are nice.
good,"The only real downside to working for this company is the sales quotas. I feel they rate sales over service which is a shame. As tellers we were to push new accounts, credit cards, etc. This was required even when we could see by the customer's balance they couldn't afford things like that. It becomes disheartening after a while."
good,"Worklife Balance"
good,"Wells Fargo is large, with decent benefits, but your are ultimately just a number.  Its cut throat environment is stressful to work in, particularly when the salary doesnt match the job required."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I have had the opportunity to grow my career in Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo afforded me the opportunity to utilized my skills and recognize and milestones.
good,"I enjoy working as Wells Fargo, they are very employee oriented with the events in the home mortgage department. They try to bring the team as together as they can."
good,"The  day at wells fargo is all bout great customer service, I have learned alot about problem solving and how to make connection with people, the most enjoyable time at work is helping customers and let them to share their life stories with you."
good,"As a personal banker I enjoyed dealing and helping  my clients . As a personal banker you also have an authority to give teller approval for transaction .For my sales goal  I use to get gold as a rank which was on the top. "
good,"Overall, good employer.  Affordable benefits, good paid time-off, flexibility of working hours. Good company culture, volunteering activities, tuition reimbursement."
good,the company also has its downfalls because it is a large Bank no attention to personal details or the needs of its employees because it is a large Bank unconcerning unforgiving
good,"Company has a wonderful work ethic and training and is heavily involved In the Community,  In House classes,  Great company functions and corporate events."
good,"Most of it depends on your direct manager or department manager.  I have had really goods ones and not so good.  Depending on what kind of management you are under will depend on how much you like your job, how many stretch assignments and how far you go."
good,"Very stressful workplace, high turn-around rate, ideal for single people with less responsibility, as schedules offered are typically 2nd and 3rd shift."
good,"My job at Wells Fargo was ok. In my judgment, it wasn't as fun as Goldman Sachs but it was an ok place to start my career. I felt that they were very obsessed with numbers and opening accounts and credit products. However, I learned some customer service skills while I was there"
good,"Loved that company, had excellent in-house underwriting.  "
good,"Client service/Customer service, provided payroll and adjustments as requested by customers. All lot of research and problem solving. Managed reports. filing."
good,"If you are looking for pure technical, I would not suggest this and if you want to enjoy your life with events and fun activities. This is the best place you can be part of."
good,same as before a day of meeting financial needs for our borrowers. to achieve financial goals. to build relationships with our consumers. to meet the vision of the company
good,A work day at Wells is a fast paced productivity career call center servicing retail client with financial needs. I enjoy helping families achieve their financial needs in life. the hardest part of the job is explaining company policy when unable to meet the clients financial need.
good,"It's a good place to learn, develop, apply your skills widely in multiple roles. I got a great experience working in multiple roles, technologies, end to end development."
good,culture reminded me of high school. There was always gossip even among management. Managers always had favorites and people were not treated equally. They were very pushy about sales and it was a very stressful place to work. No matter how many sales you have its never good enough if the store isnt at their goal for the day but sales have been eliminated so it is probably a great place to work now. Sales was the worst part of the job. The pay was good and they have good benefits.
good,Your success depends on you. If you get a good manager (someone who is passionate about what their doing) then you've got it made. But if you get someone who has a power trip it's pretty tough but either way it depends on you.
good,"give great customer service, processes deposits, sales. working to meet client needs. work with others and work securely. follow bank guidelines and regulations."
good,"Once you gain that experience, try to be as mobile as you can. Continue to better yourself and learn as much new skills as possible. This company is a small stop. Don't let it be a place you become stuck at"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Not always a professionally administered work environment.  Work cubicles  distracting with chatter across partitions and call center environment does not afford for confidential environment. Managerial support not always professionally delivered
good,Great benefits and love helping customers and putting a smile on their face.  Upper management is not very impressive and doesn't care about their employees just sales
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo and worked hard to  complete my tasks.   This was also a contract opportunity and gave me experience in another position.
good,The best thing I liked about the job was helping customers learn how to glance there checkbook and providing products to help them feel more secure with there everyday finances
good,The job was stressful but management was there to assist when things became difficult. Unfortunately after working at this job for over 25 years my department was laid off.
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"At Wells Fargo I have gained a large amount of knowledge and experience. Such as: Basic Microsoft Office skill, customer service phone etiquette and fraud prevention and risk management training. Please see my resume for much more."
good,"great benefits, paid holidays, pto, maternity leave, community service hours, growth opportunities, recognition events, 401k, career development, ongoing compliance training."
good,The people in the office were great to work with but the administration kept tying our hands from successfully completing our job with needless policies and procedures.
good,Company expects a lot. Great Benefits. Good company values and morals. Many opportunites for advancement. Possible rewards each quarter. They help you learn and coach you always. Management want to help you succeed.
good,"Too much sales pressure. I'm sure they've changed it now, but back in 2013 that was the work culture. Other than that, good benefits. If you were looking to get promoted, you have to make sure that you have great selling skills. Though they said that there were opportunities for promotion, it was mostly unattainable unless you opened lots of accounts. Bonuses were impossible to achieve."
good,"I Currently work here, still learning the ins and out of the company, will provide feedback once I feel like I have enough information to provide to indeed.com"
good,"Helped people with their home financing.  Reviewed products with clients and worked on selecting the best products for each situation.  Marketed to realtors, builders, title companies, subdivisions, past clients."
good,"typical day included involvement in assigned projects for various duties from compliance and regulation of banking electronic transfer transactions to ensure quality assurance and mitigate risks involved in processing of electronic payments. Following strict guidelines for monitoring transactions for fraud, money laundering, terrorist activity or illegal trading in sanctioned countries or sanctioned activity.  workplace culture was casual and team oriented with a small team of 12 people including a work director.  Most enjoyable part of job was the challenge of learning new things in the position continuously and the feeling of gratitude of resolving problems.  Hardest part of the job was resolving obstacles when ethical issue may arise due to lack of management support on concerns of issues."
good,"working with Wells Fargo had ups and downs, co-workers were awesome and friendly, but during my time working with them they had sales goals that were set at a high rate, and at time bordered on unethical"
good,I liked the discounts for other companies because i was an employee. Good scheduling and pay was moderate. Commission incentives
good,"normal fast paced place to work at, the management was confusing."
good,"The culture was work hard, play hard. In the end, I loved my team and was motivated to work hard for them. At Wells Fargo, I became fast and efficient, driven, and charismatic in front of a crowd. I wouldn't trade my experience for anything. I left because there was a strain on my personal life. Management had changed hands 4 times during my 2 years, so it left us in a chaotic state where we had to manage ourselves. There was no work/life balance--it was all work. Long hours into the night because the vault or a teller could not balance. Or, because there was a staff shortage and there was an overflow of customers at the end of the night."
good,I am a financial crimes specialist in the fraud department and the job itself is nice but dealing with people yelling at you all day non stop gets a bit exhausting. Benefits are great and management helps out when possible.
good,"Big organization. Constant re-structuring of teams. Lots of red tape. Overall a good place to work and grow. There are a lot of mentorship programs,"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Answered 80-100+ calls a day. Fast paced environment. Great coworkers, management needs some help. Customers were very polite. Commission not too high."
good,"i worked independently, management never available with answers just a typical day at work many changes so always be ready for change. Keep everything in writing so when they come back and say they never said that you have proof"
good,"Secretary for credit card department job function required typing, proof reading & answering phones, etc.  Assistant other secretary when they're out."
good,"Growth Opportunities, rate of pay livable, nice work life balance, learned to be a leader and an example, hardest part of job is the changes as of late"
good,I had left the company and came back. Seems to be a trend with WF and the market/industry. Overall good company to work for. I dont mind it. Just had to leave and come back
good,"Management can be improved.  Not sure what caused this review to appear, but I will keep typing until it quits or I have reached the min."
good,"It was twenty years ago, and I remember being really busy and productive. This was before First Security Bank was bought by Wells Fargo. We had great managers, we got bonuses, and good insurance. Those were the good old days!"
good,"I developed leadership skills, a strong work ethic, and motivational skills. I gave the company 3 stars due to its challenges with maintaining appropriate staffing levels."
good,"job was great but it is a volatile market and jobs are not that secure. flexibility was nice, but the position was very redundant. same work all day. very little variety."
good,It starts off great then they bringing in more people and cut hours. On any given day you can have from 2 to three managers so protocol gets misinterpreted
good,"Work/Life Balance was complete off.  Pay was slightly less than comparable industry, especially with experience.  Benefits were good.  Management was supportive and if you work hard, you have lots of room for career advancement."
good,The organization culture needs to improve. More welcoming to new and existing employees. It has great learning potential for people who are starting their careers. It would be like a takeoff zone for them. I would recommend to start with this company and move on to better working environment.
good,loan processing. I broke out in hives on my hands after my first week training. It's data entry turned up to eleven. Good pay but lord jesus help you if you don't reach their high accuracy threshold in the first couple of weeks.
good,"Company has changed a lot since CEO ""retired"". Culture is more laid back and customer service is the center of everything."
good,"Since we handle mostly escalated issues, a typical day can be stressful; however, the people I work with are very friendly and we work well together. We all have different strengths and we use one another to provide customers with the best possible outcomes. Most enjoyable part of the job is simply the people on my team - being able to share similar experiences with customers and have someone either back you up or show you a different approach has been great. The hardest part of the job for me has been adjusting to only doing one thing daily. I am either reading a complaint letter and formulating a written response to a customer or I am listening to a customer on the phone and I have to use my resources in order to resolve each individual problem. It can be become very monotonous when hearing complaints all day. There have not been many opportunities for advancement within my department; however, there are plenty of opportunities within other areas of the company."
good,Working for this company was an experience. I learned a great deal of how managing your own personal finances can play a major role in future endeavors.
good,"Good company, bad management, not enough communication from leaders, pressure goes to the low level employee. Other coworkers had different experience based on location."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Not so happy with the work flow and communication. Pay was ok and hours also ok. Work environment was ok and not so good benefits.
good,Posted medical insurance and other business payments into the Wachovia customer’s accounts and execute daily tasks to key components to achieved quality output to customers.
good,Wells Fargo doesn't do the best when It comes to culture. If you are really good at what you do- they don't want you to change positions. They are extremely sales focused and offer little coaching opportunities.
good,Good benefits; gained great mortgage experience;  met some good people and learned from them on how to work in team environment;
good,"The company needs to improve on hiring better qualified managers.  We need more leaders/  Thank managers need more training on how to run a department, people's skills and communication"
good,"Productive good work place."
good,"Answer phone calls from clients and service their accounts and promote bank products such as saving accounts, loans, CDs, credit cards, insurance, checking accounts"
good,General customer service atmosphere. I don't know that I'm the best person to leave a review for this employer. I can only say that every job is different.
good,It's not a bad place to work or be. My complaint is I haven't really had a chance to be helped develop to what i want to do or where to go. It seems as if no one's really interested in anything or anyone but themselves.
good,The Company is a good company to work for. Wells has a good training program and there is a lot of room to move up in the company.
good,"company has very good 401k match in place. Has other great benefits too, with being so large within metro it has plenty of opportunities for growth..."
good,Since Wachovia was going through a tough transition during the time I was there.  They didn't know who or what they wanted to be.  So you didn't know who you were working for at any given moment.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for there are lots of job opportunities and training classes."
good,A typical day at work was rather steady. The workload kept me busy and enabled growth. Management was hands off. Work life balance was very good. There were too many PMs working on one project.
good,I worked here for two years. In that time the company went through a lot of changes. Most of the changes were positive. I learned a lot while I was employed here. They were good about recognizing accomplishments.
good,great product and place to work. the training was extensive and thorough for a new employee.  Provided customer service to credit card holders all over the world.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for when you're just starting off your career.  But as a experienced hire I wouldn't recommend it. Its hard to get a promotion and the pay is not good.
good,I have actually learned a lot here and been promoted four times in seven years. Company needs to focus in employee retention with better salaries and high revenue products just like the good ol' days.
good,"Good community-focused company.  Good, hard working people (not always recognized as the most important asset). Open, friendly culture."
good,"The typical day includes arriving to work and balancing funds from all deposits f previous night. once that's complete, it is then time to assist customers with their day to day banking needs."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Management was terrible did not care about anyone except themselves. Was required to work over 40 hours a week. Was required to take on head teller jobs without being compensated for them.
good,Productive and fun place to work . Extremely fast paced and high volume environment.Responsible for the research and resolution of escalated complaints including calls and written correspondence.
good,Wells Fargo can be a good company to work for but it can be hard to move up. Wells could work on training preparation for new jobs and the overall culture of the company and departments.
good,"Typical day of work includes an average of 40 + outbound calls a day, to business owners trying to establish business lines of credit. Also business owners who already have credit lines with Wells Fargo."
good,"Good place to work for, you move up fast if you work hard. Wells helped me challenge myself and handle a stress work environment and come out of it stronger then ever."
good,Working at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage it is imperative you have great communication skills and ability to de-escalate situations. Handling people who are on the bricks of losing their home and very upset it is important you stay on top of accurate information and provide clear instructions.
good,"The beginning of my day would look like non stop calls. As soon as i sat down and signed in the calls came in like crazy, i really enjoyed that because i was never bored. I learned how to sign customers up for a credit card and how to process their personal lines & loans so that they would be finalized."
good,"Wells Fargo has giving me the experience to learn how to communicate with others. Its a very productive job, but with limited benefits and often growth within the company is hard to come by."
good,I would recommend this company for anyone that wants to learn the business side of things. The job and supervisors are really laid back. The flexibility of wanting days off is a bonus. Overall the company is a good company to work for.
good,"worked through different mergers: World Savings and Wachovia, there was lots of changes through all of it but I worked with the same team for the most part and that was good."
good,"We had to call merchants  to make sure they have received new applications, awesome boss and co workers, very flexible when it came to work schedule.."
good,Working for Wells Fargo expanded my knowledge and experience on customer service. They work with your schedule but can be unstable if you are working for a part time position. They can come off as too pushy when it comes to the sales aspect and seem to worry more about sales rather than customer service.
good,No single supervisor making it difficult regarding expectation. No career growth opportunity as focus is on staff augmentation and not on skill. Very poor work/life balance
good,"A typical day is opening work tickets and documenting them talking with teammates."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company overall however it was difficult to pursue other internal opportunities. Due to the required work hours, phone time per customer, quantity and quality of work required on a daily and monthly basis, I felt limited to expanding my promotional goals."
good,"But now you are making me do it again. It is a slow place where not much happens. It's nice to work here if you need a safe job during a downturn, but it's not all that great when the economy is booming."
good,I did not like the position of Teller after everything that has happened in the past year with Wells Fargo. The Managers and other employees were very fair and nice.
good,"A typical day at work involves team projects, processing and verifying."
good,"Very busy days, learned overall information in regards to stock market. Management was professional and very knowledgeable. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful.  The hardest part about the job was volume, although there wasn't anything too hard in the job I was doing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I had a lot of interesting work to do and it kept me busy. I also enjoyed the customers I worked for."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I managed an IT services group of 6 technicians supporting over 1000 users. As the original startup manager my responsibilities also included assembling the initial team to support the site.
good,"Enjoy working for Wells Fargo "
good,"I am working on my review and will update as soon s I have it complete. Overall WF has been a great company for me I appreciate all the years that I was able to work and gain exposure, experience, and knowledge through them."
good,Working in the bank is a great place. You get the benefits of having a Sunday off. You become really close with you customers. Something not so great would be the pressure the bank puts on their tellers for opening new accounts.
good,The experience was awesome and it was great helping citizens meet their financial needs.  Opportunity for growth depends on the market you are in which can drive metrics.
good,"I love my co-workers, they became more like family. The job itself was intensive and brutal. Sales goals were extremely high but I almost always made my goals but. Benefits and parties were always great."
good,"It all depends on who your manager is, if you have a good one, life will be enjoyable. It is how you make your time there, make the best of it"
good,I managed 6 direct reports.  In charge of daily schedules of ream members. Was responsible for compliance.  Made 100 calls to customers a day to set up appointments for sales.
good,"got requests for review via email and phone, easy to process up to 10 or more requests an hour if not distracted, most review requirements changed every few weeks, had to keep up to date on the most recent changes and some changed back and forth multiple times"
good,"process transactions and look into possible selling points for products the bank offers "
good,Really enjoyed the co. culture when it was Wachovia.Wells Fargo has a much different culture.Enjoyed co-workers and meeting people.
good,Good to work at wells Fargo. great team and management . excellent work environment with food facilities like sports arena and cafeterias and excellent gym.
good,"I enjoy working at this location because of the diverse and friendly clientele. This is a busy branch but, there are slow days at times. The branch is located within walking distance to may shops and amenities."
good,"Typical day at work included "
good,Love to develop and coach team members to reach their potential career path. Enjoyed helping customers succeed financially. Enjoy the challenges that were presented on a daily basis.
good,I enjoy the role that I do on a day to day basis and thoroughly enjoy my co-workers.  We are all a great team and act accordingly at all times even though my role is 100% remote.
good,They are offering working from home options so they can downsize space. great training hard to move internally because of salary restrictions. HR recruiting is too slow on filling open positions. many teams are remote; collaboration is key.
good,"Sales goals were impossible to reach. Was fired for not meeting sales goals, while other employees were praised for cheating."
good,"I worked for Wells before it was Wells Fargo in San Antonio. I worked there for 13 years.  The pay over the years was very minimal, raises are not good and advancement was difficult."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Typical day at work log into your computer, and began answering calls and assisting customers. Supervisor is always on the floor helping, he cares for his teams not only on work hours but also when it comes to personal life."
good,Wells Fargo is a good company but its hard to move into better positions. I feel as though I am not making any head way and people off the street come in and already are above me.
good,"I have been in several departments at Wells Fargo and your future literally depends on you having a good manager.  Unfortunately, over the years I have seen a lot of people leave the company and come back to get a higher salary."
good,I have learned so much about how mortgages work and discover new things everyday. I enjoy educating and empowering homeowners so they can understand their responsibilities and options regarding their mortgage loans.
good,"Flexible hours"
good,"Everything is decent, but very pushy with incentives and goals. Requires batching and balancing. Daily transaction of cashing and depositing. Management can be better."
good,"assist business customers with an issues that have with their banking or issues with their business that i can help make easier, check business documents, not release information that is confidential, and meet the goals set for that day. Give great customer service and make sure customers are satisfied with outcome."
good,The junior collateral examiner position involves less complicated collateral exams and less report writing than the more senior position. The junior examiner may travel consistently to assist with inventory test counts depending on the needs of the department. The majority of the time as a junior examiner is to observe a more senior examiner interact with the client as well as examine the collateral.
good,Wells is a nice company to work for. Co workers are friendly. Supervisor is nice..  It is extremely diverse. People for different walks of life..
good,The job is very repetitive. Hours work well for full time students looking for flexible hours. Career building is great for the sales side of  the job but not so much for customer service side.
good,"My favorite thing about Wells Fargo is its commitment to community service.  They not only promote it, they encourage and assist all of their employees in finding the time to get out in the community and make a difference."
good,"Wells Fargo strives to do what is right for its customers; good work atmosphere, but promotion can be based on favoritism"
good,fun work place great place to work great staff every time i moved back to florida and moved back they gave my job back not enough hour but great place
good,How many reviews do I have to write? Well I think this job is ok and pays the bill but does not have much growth for new skills sets. Use primary excel and sometimes access to compare data.
good,"It has been over 10 years since I worked for Wells Fargo. I remember it being a good place to work where I learned a lot of good things. Sales seemed to be more important to them then building relationships, but it has been  a while since I worked there."
good,Pay was not good and management as well. Employees were great overall and the environment was okay. They're very unfair with the team and it is a lot of favoritism in the company.
good,"When interviewing, it is not explained the phone sales department is a entry level department. There isn't much room for growth as the department is focused on daily sales. The culture of the department needs true development."
good,"great company and manager.  I enjoy learning new skills everyday and meeting new people. My manager has been very supportive towards my goals. I have great and supportive coworkers. Although at times work can be challenging, its a new experience."
good,"great company, great support system, good place to work, but to get promoted is very hard,.diversity, and flexible times to work. co workers are supportive and friendly."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Admin"
good,"It can be a secure place to work. The company is large, so you can move up.  Work life balance is a challenge the higher you go.  The benefits are good."
good,"This can be a great place to work, however, there are some areas which continually hire people who are incompetent to lead certain business units. Some of this hiring is done on the basis that they are buddies with the current manager. Good and bad experiences in my 5 different jobs, but do your job well and try to stand out!"
good,Wells Fargo is full of fun and driven people. The management definitely has a lot of pride and belief in the company and is contagious with those attitudes.
good,great working environment and get team collaboration. easily adopted to newer technologies. recently started of adopting the agile scrum methodology into various projects.
good,Management was going through some transitions and they heavily focused on sales and meeting your goals. It felt very forced having to ask every customer for a sale.
good,The job isnt hard its management they aren't for the employee at all they are always looking for a way to blame the employee.
good,"great place to start your professional career "
good,"Changes all the time, with no one really excited about the new and great products coming in. Management is terrible, they dont have any true leaders. More of a ""bossy"" type of work environment. Attitudes are terrible"
good,during my tenure many layoff. never felt like i had a stable job. daily layoffs. made you fear for make end meet.managers decent.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers in need of assistance. The hardest part of the job would have to be when there is a problem with the computer and having to wait to get back online to help our customers.
good,The hardest part of my job is trying to assist customers that do not want to be helped. Most of the co-workers are great.  I didnt like the fact that you couldnt get up away form your desk unless using personal time..to which they then wanted you to stop using..to many reports
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to learn and grow into a long term career in many fields of study. "
good,"always alert looking for customer business"
good,"Good Job stability once you are hired, however the pay could be more for all the stress and extra responsibilities each role entails."
good,A good company to work for.  Very friendly team members and surroundings. Managers are easy to work with also. Always a lot to learn and changing environment.
good,This company works hard at making an effort to reflect the communities where they live and work.  They have a strong commitment to social responsibility and giving back to their community.
good,Mainly just do basic transactions and handle finances. Coworkers are rude and very self centered and don't care about most things except getting off work.
good,a day at work consist of being a teller. looking at accounts all day and counting money also my customer service was used daily. I learned how to become consistent and how to meet daily and monthly goal for myself and the company. it was enjoyable just needed something better
good,"Amazed at the depth of services available to develop, protect & expand clients financial strength."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Best part about the job was being able to assist the customers financial needs. Hard part was being short staffed during holiday season and first of the month.
good,Wells fargo dealer services is a great company to work for until unexpected things happen and you cant come to work . this is when the job become stressful.
good,Wells Fargo was not a bad place to work. I enjoyed the work I did and the people I worked with. I was good at my job and there were always opportunities to advance.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for but it has no work/life balance and is not family friendly. They pay the lowest of all financial institutions for twice the work
good,Quickly and professionally serves clients to maintain dedicated client base. I demonstrated the ability to multitask by effectively handling customer service and administrative tasks.
good,"Typical day involved calling at least 25 people to follow up for documentation, additional information, communicate decisions on modification review. "
good,The business its self is a great business but there is no real structure here. The employees are great and the pay is good.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. Plenty of potential for growth and advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is being part of a company that is so widely known and a market giant.
good,overall wells was very good to me. i like ny co -workers and management and the benefits. i like the pearks too. i left because i was getting too comfortable
good,"horrible flexibility not able to do anything outside of work"
good,"ok work environment"
good,I am an OCSR1 and enjoy it overall. Has a decent starting pay as well. Although I am technically an Online Customer Service Representative it is also sales focused. Of course when you're dealing with irate customers it can be challenging sometimes.  I honestly believe our perspective each day shapes the reality of our environment. I've found that days that I go in with a positive attitude it ends up being a great day compared to showing up with an irritable attitude. They also try to keep the morale going making sure everyone is engaged. Give it a shot! Maintain a positive attitude and you'll be fine.
good,"If you like sales this is for you.  The pay is not match the work you do. The people I worked with were amazing."
good,nice work environment and nice benefits.  there is room for advancement.  they move their employees around to different branches around a lot
good,meeting what the focus is on for today and have knowledge  talk to all clients. Team memebers would be team players also aware of everyones goals. To share our success in smal huddles.
good,"I loved listening to my customers on a daily basis, that was the most enjoyable part of my job, along with my daily operational task."
good,"It was a good company but they do nothing to help you with management treating you badly. My manger threatened my job almost daily, did not care when i was sick or if i had family members who were healthy ill and needed my help. My manger is a terror and that's why i want to leave."
good,"This is a good company to work for.  The pay is far, the work/life balance is good, and my team cares about me."
good,Working at Wells Fargo taught me the Wagile experience. I learned about many different lines of business and how to collaborate with the team.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day is meeting the needs of my clients and helping them to succeed financially. I learned to embrace diversity and everyone brings something to the team.
good,Wells Fargo is good place to work.  Can be stressful depending on the role you are in.  Good learning experience
good,"Manage a pipeline of 70-100 loans per day. The liaison between the settlement agent, loan officer and customer. Great co-workers. Hardest part about the job is the ungrateful management and loan officers, and lazy processors. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers-first time home buyers."
good,"Call center customer services loan servicing and collections. Applied auction funds as needed, Annual feedback. Expectations set after review"
good,"There is alot of micro management.  Setting unrealistic goals for sales associates to meet.   This is a HUGE company, there is opportunity for advanacement.  There for 7 years and moved up in positions 3 times."
good,Sales focused banking environment. Making sure that you are matching products and services to customers. Employees are reviewed monthly based on their productivity.
good,"There wasn't a lot of upward mobility, and management was a dice roll because they made you change managers every 6 months and not all were great. It is obviously a huge company and the setting was basically around 200 cubicles in a building, everyone attached to his or her phone, so I felt like more of a number than an asset. On the upside, Wells Fargo takes care of employees with decent pay and great benefits, and it was an awesome learning experience. I learned a lot about how to handle different customers with varying personalities and I learned a great deal about mortgage and finance."
good,"HR is outstanding.  Training could be more structured and the people hired more suitable; therefore, preventing the circle of layoffs that seem to continue to happen with in the company for those who should actually stay and not be laid off. Seems to be some discrimination within the company as well."
good,Wish it were still Wachovia.  It was a great company and I enjoyed being there.  many changes when it merged but it was worth the time
good,"opportunity to grow profesionally"
good,Time went by fast because we always made sure to have fun. I Managed the teller line as well as platform employees.  I ensured all the yearly federal training was completed.
good,I have nothing to say about Wells Fargo. It is a huge company and I have only observed a small part. This small amount of information is not enough to provide an accurate review.
good,"My position was a customer service position. This job kept me on my toes with daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly goals."
good,The culture and people here are great. Some of the best people I have ever worked with. The job is a sales job and is goal driven. You are constantly evaluated by metrics to measure performance.
good,"i loved working at wells Fargo.  Had a schedule and was not all over place as schedule wise.Had a routine which I like to do, but it gets boring and i do not see my self growing within."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to start a career path; however, if you are looking to grow it may not be the best place for employment."
good,"It is very difficult to progress past the lower level positions at Wells Fargo and the company seems to care little about developing talent and retaining employees. It is common to become pigeon holed into a job that is below your skill level. The job can be stressful due to the large volume of busy work that is not challenging.  For a large company, I would have expected more development opportunities."
good,Wells Fargo has a great work environment. They have provided many opportunities to increase one's knowledge in the VoIP world.
good,Overall great place to work with room for advancement. The management team cares about their employees and are eager to help them grow professionally.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Provide great customer service by helping customer cash payroll or personal checks, do wire transfers and offer payday advances for emergency financial needs."
good,"If you are looking to get into the financial/mortgage industry, the company offers plenty of opportunities to do so; the problem is that if you are looking to build a career you will not be able to do so as they rarely promote from within .  Get your 2 years of experience and then hit the door for better opportunities, in a few years, they might consider hiring you back once you've gotten some ""real experience"", but don't bank on a great offer."
good,"I loved my job at wells fargo.With the hours that were worked and the sales goals we had it was a lot to take on. Hard to maintain anything outside of work when you are always gone, never able to be home for family functions. In the end it is not worth going in early and leaving late, the one time you decide not to bend over backwards it is counted against you"
good,The pay rate Wells Fargo offers is a low blow for single parents and married couples. nothing else to share! its a place of employment it is all in what you make it
good,Good company to work for.  Don't be overly optimistic on advancement opportunities or income opportunity. Good place to learn about working in a fast paced environment.
good,Refer bank services and products; deepening relationships with existing customers.  The coaching was great and management was happy to help build on your strengths.
good,Answer inbound calls for Mortgage customers; take payments and refer customers to the appropriate department.  Once your a permanent employee with the company you can receive good benefits.
good,"A typical day at work would be to open up the branch, and get the store ready. When open we would handle transactions throughout the day handling money and checks. I learned a lot about different credit lines, mortgages, being precise with large amounts of money, and the different accounts we can set people up with. Wells Fargo is a great company, however, there was a lot of unnecessary competition between the teller side of the branch. Management was not very great, however the service manager was amazing.  Co- workers from the teller side were very hostile, however from the rest of the branch they were amazing. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the different accounts we could set people up with. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with so many different people everyday."
good,This position was important to the overall sales force. The department was responsible for the overall maintenance of agent licenses and continuing education requirements.
good,at wells fargo was very diverse and everybody got along with everyone easily.  enjoyable coworkers and fun to be with.  never a dull moment working at wells fargo with great people.
good,decent pay with long hours work/life balance difficult at times the people I worked with were great! Learning easy systems were very sophisticated and current with technology trends.
good,"Good Team work and great place to work. Learned about testing methodologies and how to test an application."
good,"In my experience with Wells Fargo, I learned a lot about customer service and sales. With all that I learned it will help me to be a better leader and customer service representative in my future career."
good,Nice place to start off and learn how to be a good banker and teller. Its fast paced environment forces you to learn quickly.
good,Place for a stable job.  Not a lot of exciting new opportunities but work life balance is good and management is pretty helpful in wanting to help establish your career.
good,"I was a personal banker, and enjoyed all the employee's and the customer's I met and helped."
good,Wells Fargo was a great company to work for with great benefits and good compensation. The opportunity for advancement with the company was really good.
good,"The sales aspect of the company makes the job unfavorable. Management is great, but as a result have to push sales as well."
good,Start work at 9am everyday go through emails reply to them follow up with different teams whom we work with tho get updates on the progress. i have learned alot working with 1 of my hiring managers. the co workers are very supportive of each other which is a plus
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good place to work especially if you are sales driven. I learned I like to help people but not too fond of selling services/products. Overall decent place to work.
good,After 20+ years of working in the financial industry I've met some fascinating individuals that I can call my friends. I look forward to working for another company and letting my experience speak for itself.
good,"It has been awhile since I worked as a teller, so things may have changed. What I do remember the most was having to sell as many products (credit cards, loans, ect) as I could."
good,I can say I enjoyed the staff. What I can say about the company is the employees are under paid for the work they do. The company will attempts to seem to do anything that results in them not having to fairly compensate their employees.
good,Worked as a short term employee with an unopened expiration date and was offered a position but did not want to relocate family at that time.
good,Good company to work for would do outbound and Inbound calls. Help customers with getting their acct back to current.  Team Lead
good,"very high paced environment, customers were mostly unhappy with fees. management makes all the difference while working for this company."
good,This was an upbeat place to work.  But my manager did make many remarks that were innappropriate.  I did like that we did community outreach through Relay for Life.  It was very rewarding
good,Great job for advancements.They offer great benefits and help you advance as an individual. The only part that might be a bit tough is balancing at the end of the night
good,I learned a lot about AML Compliance during my time at Wells Fargo. I was employed during the transition from Wachovia to Wells. It was a challenging time but I'm sure it is fine now
good,had the ability to upscale through several positions with including the ability to learn how to close a loan. Lots of over time and ability to make a significant amount of overtime.
good,"very small company"
good,As a phone banker I was constantly stressed about meeting goals. I liked the environment and the people well enough. I might have been happier in another role.
good,I was a contract employee at Wells Fargo but it was a great learning experience. I had good co-workers who was always willing t help you.
good,I enjoyed working with many co-workers and clients. The management and senior management were friendly and freely commented about your work product.
good,"I adored my customers while there, But the management team were very rude to some employees, yet adored others. They had their favorites. Goals set were ridiculous."
good,It was an ok place to work.  Depending on the manager you got. This was before Wells took over. I dont know how it is now.  Management there wasnt all that great in getting you promoted unless you knew someone or you were on the cool with one of the managers.
good,I have been with the company for about 6 years now and working here its really all about sales. They say that the customers come first but in reality all they care about is sales.
good,"Good place to work, High Turn over rate. I was laid off due to my group was moving out of state.Either we went or got laid off. but overall it was a good place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo in the Merchant Services Department.  While it is a very competitive environment, the benefits of success in this department can be very lucrative!"
good,"To review contracts and confirm they are within government and state guidelines."
good,Very high high high high sales goals and very high weekly monthly and daily goals. Great management staff thats all I can say
good,As short term job setting up computers for the bank.  Now they are called Wells Fargo.   They upgraded from Compact computers to Dell Computers.  That has been a few years back.
good,"The most enjoyable aspect of working for Wells Fargo is being able to interact with a diverse customer base, while building strong costumer relationships."
good,Depending on what branch you end up at will determine whether you have success.  They dont have enough training in order to show you how to successfully process a loan.  Depending on if other commission sales people want to use their time to help...you end up not making money.
good,This is a busy work environmenet where there is a lot of opportunity to grow and learn. The hardest part is getting to know the bank because there is so much going on.
good,I am currently the assistant to a loan officer that specializes is manufactured homes.  These loans are challenging at best although I constantly learning new guidelines and procedures for these loans.  One of the things that makes these loans difficult are the guidelines that my lender requires.  These guidelines make it challenging and difficult for us and the borrower.  My position is in flux right now because due to the Trid requirements we are not able to do many of the loans that we used to do so our business has slowed down.  I would be interested in a Loan Officer position or Processor position.
good,fun and fast paced for sure. Training classes are a plus but not too organized. Once you get onto your team you are basically on your own
good,"On the phones, wanted more responsibility/pay, call center environment, management was OK depending on your manager, monotonous"
good,"opening by getting out cash box for the day making sure our cash box balances throuout the day, look for sales leads for bankers, taking large and small deposits and cashing for customers. Working with a well rounded group of people that help eachother makes the job easy and well the hardest of the job is working with difficult customers that don't except no as an answer."
good,"It was a great experience working for a such a big bank.  Wells Fargo is a solid bank with a solid infrastructure.  I was responsible for developing new business opportunities while managing"
good,Take incoming calls and provide excellent customer service. Review accounts and suggest products that would be beneficial for customers. Do transfers for customers and perform other banking functions.
good,You are trained and are ready when you get to work around customers. The CSM's want to see you succeed and move on to other positions in the company.
good,"I have a learned a lot during my time there and met some great people. In my role I have to be very detail oriented, know current policy and procedures and to stay up to date on any audit updates."
good,"At Wells Fargo I was a Print technician working among eight people.We serviced many clients in the Wholesale end of Wells Fargo. Working off a que we produced books,RFP's,sell sheets and small booklets for many WellsFargo employees in many states and sometimes overseas.I won many awards and letters of recognition for producing jobs that were tedious and time consuming with all deadlines met without overtime.With ample years in the printing trade, management knew I was a self starter and needed no help.I taught as many people that would ask for my help.The rewarding part of the job was when the customers came back to me and told me that Wells Fargo was awarded an account."
good,"o	Manage new accounts received via inbound/outbound calls from team members or customers; offering specialized plans to customers "
good,"I deal with title updates for foreclosed properties to ensure that they are clear prior to conveyance. I learned alot about foreclosure and bankruptcy. My co-workers are a pleasure to be around, and we are a solid team overall. The hardest part of my job is getting through the massive amount of title updates that come in daily. The most enjoyable part of my job is the team work and dedication of myself and co-workers"
good,"sales quotas are tough with little pay out"
good,You have a lot of responsibility and accountability. My co-workers are friendly and easy to work with and always willing to help. the hardest part of my job is working third shift. The most enjoyable part of my job is to make sure we meet our SLA's without any major issues.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,the company overall is great great place to work in... great friends.. great location by the freeway.great wirj giyrs as wekk
good,"it is a good place to start out and cut your teeth. they licensed me and got me ready for the industry. pay is decent, just still working in a call center and not where you want to end your career"
good,operation deficiencies was the one downfall  at this organization other than that it was a great place to work. In our particular division of mortgages the frequently would change guidelines deny a loan and then buy the same loan from a broker we just denied.
good,A typical day consisted on filing claims in an effort to recoup money from Fannie Mae. I  recouped over a million dollars each month. This was a fast paced job. Your goal was to processed claims with little or no errors. I enjoyed working with my co-worker. We always worked as a team.
good,Working for a bank has its pros and cons. Pro you get off most weekends and holidays. Cons are they make you a sales person and that you only get 30 hours a week.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for with good benefits. I have worked for Wells Fargo for 12 years and have learned a lot. I have had several positions within the company and each one prepared me for the next one. "
good,"wells is chill, I work a lot, get paid good money for the work I do. I gain lots of knowledge and gain great experience. very cool job. blessed"
good,Sales job based around customer experience. Building lasting relationships and navigating the problems of the consumer financial industry.
good,great management and terrific hours. the bonus was great and the hours are very flexible. I love the staff. the benefits are also great
good,Loved management and the hard working staff.  Management was great.  I only left for better opportunity.  I loved meeting and helping so many customers meet their financial needs
good,Although no job is secure however I felt like I had a job at Wells Fargo for life. Wells Fargo paid for travel and training. Wells Fargo did have monthly bonus plan in place.
good,"I really enjoyed what I did, as far as banking goes. I did not always agree on their tactics and stressful environment to get a sale, but I really enjoyed the work that banking entails. I would really like to get back into banking."
good,Good company with newer management staff.  Since some of the management was new they were not as trained and delegated as you would expect to have within an underwriting department.
good,"I wouldn't recommend working in Home Mortgage but overall it's a good place to work. Once the internship ended, I didn't feel like their was any opportunities for employment."
good,"It was a great job to learn social skills as well as specific programs to record and track customer information and accounts. The management section is poor, but the people in the work place make the difference."
good,This was the first bank company I worked for in California and they treated me nicely and had me promoted quickly. The pay as competitive but the wholesale division had to be shut down.
good,Micro managers.   Great benefits but pay is sub par.  Advancement can be near impossible some times.   People are great to work with but can be over worked and under appreciated.
good,"As a Supervisor, I coached sales technique and customer service while maintaining within compliance to my team members through in the moment coaching as well as team building call calibrations. The hardest part of the job was continuing to motivate through positive recognition rather than negative reinforcement. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the success of my team members through promotion or bonus."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"In my department, you had your own accounts to work and you knew what needed to be done each day unless a special project came up and may take you away from your normal job duties.  I liked working on the phones with different people everyday. In my field things were continually changing. Our deptartment was displaced and moved out of state."
good,If you need a bank and travel a lot I suggest banking with them.  You will be able to find locations coast to coast.  You can get all your needs met in one big bank like Wells Fargo.
good,I learned a lot working with Wells Fargo. I had to learn how to multitask and keep up with continuous change in our daily work process. You have to learn how to be very flexible with your everyday work. The hardest part of the job I would say was dealing with the customers. Majority of them were not very happy hearing from us so you had to learn not to take things personal and keep the call deescalated. Management is always looking to see what they can do to make it a better work environment and help the employees excel in the workplace or move up to a better department. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to socialize with coworker surrounding you. Also the team meetings to lighten up the mood.
good,"-overall enjoyed working for this company just found something better"
good,"I truly  enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. A general work day included  aiding and coaching agents, taking calls, and ensuring that  reports  were  completed in a  timely manner."
good,"I was able to utilize and develop my skill set more efficiently within my time with Wells Fargo. Compensation though was based off Business knowledge more then Technical Skills, Knowledge."
good,"my responsibilities included processing transactions, cross selling bank's products and services, performing branch clerical duties , promoting business for the bank by maintaining good customer relations."
good,"Lead mail services staff ensuring work went out in a timely manner and within departmental goals, utilized Intertrack system to track accountable mail, such as certified mail. "
good,"Good company. except does not move you up fast like they say."
good,"Great place to work, but I felt the environment wasn't up to my standards. But that's easy to over look, it's not that bad. Great people to work with and work for."
good,The hardest part of the job is to come in and do the samething over and over again. Does not feel like I will ever move up in this job. Work my tail off for minimum pay.
good,Fast pace environment. No flexibility and daily standards set to high for a quality based production department. Most enjoyable part of the day is at the end of the work day.
good,not paid enough for the job  8 long weeks training and testing. Then on the floor receiving phone calls while being monitored.
good,Wachovia was a great place to work but Wells Fargo came in and changed it all. No more small bank feel. It was all about sales and not the employees anymore.
good,Great place to work. Very supportive group. I respected their core values. Not all about the numbers. striving to provide great customer service
good,Mission is outstanding Customer Service. Educating customers in credit and any banking needs. Being able to multi task is a must. Fast paced environment. Developed important relationships with co worker and customers. Enjoyed the positive energy and support with Team members. The hardest part about this job was being short staffed most of the time and advancement within company was limited.
good,"Great 401K"
good,Wonderful co workers and managers. The company is too focused on sales and goals and not about making our customers lives better. The most enjoyable part of my job to be able to really make a difference when I can really listen to my customers and find out what they really need and be able to help them get help even when it does not result in a sale. Just to see their faces light up or see the stress roll off their shoulders is rewarding.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Micro-managing of time.  Unable to learn new things.  Stringent on work hours.  Coworkers are pleasure to work with.   Documentation is lacking.
good,"At first, it was a fun place to work. But then, teammates were not motivated to reach goals.. seemed like they were there just to collect a paycheck."
good,Good place to work but wouldn't want to make a career there. High pressure sales with no clear career path process. They are good people but not a place to stay long term.
good,"Securities   Operation Service Specialist 2/ New Account Opening And Maintenance"
good,"Enjoyed co-workers, but routine work with little change. Typical day consisted of creating daily output, checking quality and preparing for delivery. Management was distant."
good,This was a great place to work in my 20's. Excellent benefit package. Good work conditions and good coworkers. Little flexibility
good,"The type of work done in this particular part of the business is unique, and provides the opportunity to understand the background processes in basic transactions, and the association rules that govern those relationships. There was not much room for advancement in the department, and the mandatory 20 hr/wk overtime that went on for 3 months was difficult to deal with."
good,the only constant is change.  no one really knew what their roles were or much of anything with bankruptcy in general. I feel we have done the best we could do with minimal training.
good,Good opportunity to start your career and learn hands on skills. I would recommend this company to new graduates. Great management.
good,Wells Fargo provided a pleasant work environment for their staff.  Customer service is always challenging. My co-workers were always courteous to customers.
good,"I have been here for 2 years, it's not terrible but it could be a lot better. Wells Fargo has a very agressive sales culture. Management seems to only care about the sales quotas and not about giving good customer service."
good,a typical day here is answering banking questions and upselling bank features. however the benefits of learning the banking industry is very valuable
good,"I learned so much there, formally Wachovia bank. I started as a teller then was promoted to customer service and then a manager and loan officer. It was a great company."
good,A decent job for students as they are flexible with hours.  Sales goals are really difficult to meet.  Daily observations are quite overwhelming.
good,Really good on establishing a healthy work place environment.  Open to listen to concerns and work through issues. Most enjoyable part is learning with new people.
good,Worked security desk at a IRS location contract the company had. Signed people in and out and maintained a safe area for workers.
good,Great company to work for if you are into sales. They are a very aggressive company that pushes you to generate as many sales for them as possible. They only care about how much money you can make them and are always changing their products in order to profit the company more than their customers.
good,I use to work independently daily even though i was part of a team of 9 employees. I had my own pipeline of 60-80 files to review and decision for closing. I learn a lot about mortgage and banking with the countless training we received monthly. Hardest part of my job was advising clients of denials but always enjoyable to help them find a solution.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was paying the clients medical bills. It got me use to medical terminology, medical claim forms, and coding such as icd-9 and hcpc codes."
good,"Some managers and departments are great, some are not. Researching the leadership in the department is essential to satisfaction"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,There was no room for growth within the company as well as a fixed schedule. I did not typically like this position. I did not like going to work at 6am everyday.
good,Very strict environment.  Not suitable with someone with alot of creativity or outside of the box thinking.  Management in the department I was exposed to was not very diplomatic but more of a dictatorship.
good,Not enough back end support and operations. Hard to close deals their. They need more support with better quality underwriters that know how to properly calculate income.
good,Huge company to work for growth is available if you want it.Company is all about the numbers in most departments. Cafeteria on campus makes it better so you wont have to leave for lunch and lose parking spot.
good,Taking calls from wells fargo customers and assisting with any banking needs of clients. Learned to work as a team. Management was very confused about their roles and had weak leadership skills. Not bad co-workers. Being on the phone 8 hours a day. Helping clients money work for them not them to work for their money.
good,"Mailed out statements, mailed out escrow account paperwork.  Sorted checks by account numbers .    Sitting down all day was a bummer ."
good,was a pretty mellow environment. pretty average job. coworkers were nice and welcoming. managers helped in areas of need with good coaching
good,Wells Fargo is a very good company which there is opportunity to grow in. Some of the lending practices were slow as they further learn ways not to make loans harder.
good,Management stresses for sales and doesn't put customer's ahead of goals for the branch. It is compromises employees work ethics.
good,Good company to work for. Has gone through a lot of change with the Wachovia Wells merger.  Some of the changes have been for the better and some not.
good,"very helpful. gave a chance.  too big"
good,The work environment was very stressful for the employees.  It was not a fun places to work.  In most cases upper management overlooked this aspect of the job.
good,There wasn't enough time in the day to work and go to school full-time. I chose to finish school at this point and had to leave this opportunity as I could not work 60-70 work weeks (on a regular basis) and go to school full time.
good,Taking calls on a daily basis and servicing those customers while at the same time looking for ways that will save them money.
good,"I work daily with many customers with all kinds of personalities so I am very adapting to any situation and or issue. I have goals to meet which I have never had an issue meeting any sales goal in any of my careers. I get along with all coworkers and we learn a lot from each other as we work to learn new things daily. The hardest part of my job is when small things effect our work ethics or environment, our customers should always leave happy and when that can't be done i feel like the day wasn't as successful as it should have been."
good,"Large size company, very well run.  Would still be work if the company never downsized.  Training was very thorough and detailed.  Would recommend this company to others for employment."
good,"It's a fun place to work and my team members are young and full of energy.  As the oldest member of the team, they keep me on my toes."
good,"Managing teller line by providing feedback and mentoring all tellers. Working with store manager in sorting day to day routine. Managing foreign exchange, TCD machines, ATM's, Bank Vault, Confidential paperwork, etc. Doing approvals for tellers for any transaction above their cash limit."
good,"Typically we have tickets in the Remedy/PAC2000 queue to look at and as well as emails we receive from our lines of business.  Terminations are a priority.  I basically am responsible for sending tickets I receive in our in house ticketing system and route them to the appropriate team based upon the issue and system.  If it's something I can resolve directly I will do so.  I mostly support the Online Customer Service bankers and supervisors, but also setup New Hire Retail/Sales and foreign language bankers up as well as part of an ongoing cross-training opportunity as we are in the middle of transitioning our work processes to a more streamlined approach. I have learned how the processes on both the OCS and Retail side of things.  My co-workers are very hard workers and assist when they can. My direct management is very helpful as well most of the time. Until recently though due to some business unit realignment, I really didn't have the opportunities in my area to advance. We were pretty much at the top regarding our positions. Also it seems that communication is an issue they are working on as some things that affect our job is changed but not adequately communicated to us at all or on time to help us ensure we give effective and quality work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Most enjoyable thought is having a job and being able to meet my financial needs."
good,"I was just getting out of high school when I started as a teller with Wells Fargo. Their sales requirements were high and difficult to meet. The people there were great to work with and most of the time, the customers were happy to see you."
good,Wells Fargo is an average company to work for. They have many good qualities as well as a lot to improve on. As an employee at Wells Fargo I would recommend this company to individuals who like a sales driven environment.
good,"learned new forms of customer service, people were awesome to work with. handling cash was difficult but i was able to get the hang of it."
good,"Well fargo wants you to sale everything but the kicthen sink. They are very pushy on their goals and expectations. Their sales team often slams people with products and services, they dont need."

good,"Great company to work for.  Fair pay, benefits, and lots of opportunity to learn and grow within company.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time there."
good,It just wasn't the job I was expecting. It was a very high stress position with all of the little ratings that either help or completely destroy your numbers for the week.
good,"Job work was good, management needs improvements, hours are inconvenient, over work you and not others who are doing nothing, favoritism with co workers"
good,"a typical day at wells fargo was servicing checking, credit card, and savings accounts. Help customers go over their account balances, activate cards, replace cards, go over different product and services to help better manage their accounts. wells fargo was very team oriented, the co workers and management was fair. the harderst part of the job was selling products that did not help the customer situations. the most enjoyable part of the day was when i was able to find a product to make that customer life easier."
good,The company was great for a while until they brought in a new district manager then the company starting going downhill from there.
good,A typical day at wells fargo was to assist customer with their finacial needs and also monitor accounts to make sure the bank is not at risk of a loss.Managemnt was really helpful with my growth and development as an employee.  My coworkers have become family outside of work and very supportive with my progression.The hardest part of the job is the mental challenge  of  remaining consistent on a daily basis and the most enjoyable part was to be able to come to work and be surrounded with such positive coworkers.
good,"Great company to work for, great benefits, very knowledgeable employees, would to continue to work for Wells Fargo."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo as a phone banker at first was very enjoyable. However over time the sales goals was becoming over whelming. The demand to sale products and services while keeping a smile on your face when the customers yelled at you over the phone at times was unbearable. However, i did learn how to control my emotions, seperate my job from my everyday life as well as learned how to motivate myself and achieve what needed to be done everyday. I did also enjoy working with my co workers. we encouraged each other as well as helped one another with the customers needs as wells the sales. I increased my leadership skills while working there in which i believe will help me in my future goals."
good,Our department handled customers who defaulted on their mortgages and wished to be reviewed for loan modifications.  We analyzed and reviewed income and other documents and make decisions for approvals or denials.  We were given goals and objectives to achieve on a daily basis.  One of our objective was to make decisions on approvals or denials prior to appearing before a court mediator.  The next objective was to make the decisions within 30 calendar days or less.  The decisions we rendered were presented in court in clear and concise manner regarding income calculations and appraised valued along with investor's guidelines requirements.  The hardest part of the job was making decisions for repeated denials to the same customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having had the opportunity to work with a bunch of wonderful teammates.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good enough company to work for, but I took a sizable pay cut in working there and it wasn't worth the trade off.  They try really hard to manufacture ""fun"" at the office with overly enthusiastic supervisors and that was hard for me to buy into.  My job was at a call center so the caliber of coworker was also lacking, I realized so when one of my coworkers informed me they had graduated high school a year ago, no college, and had worked for directTV before.  As a college graduate with 5 years experience in customer service,  this is too big of a step backwards for me. "
good,"Everyday I go in I check my emails, check my scheduled breaks, log on the phone and start taking calls. I got 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute lunch break. I learned how to reach sales goals by performing in a structured environment. Management was very cool. My supervisor is was very down to earth and very understanding. Young co-workers like myself filled the building which made it an enjoyable place to work at. The hardest part of the job was reaching the sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new young professionals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The quotas can be unethical. Managers can push their employees to stressful limits. Company never takes the employees opinions
good,"I felt that that the training was a little hasty, and that I while I enjoyed being exposed to the financial world I wished that I had a chance to offer our customers a higher quality or better range of financial product."
good,My typical day at work was to assist customers by phone. We made sure there system was compatible with the new system. It was an easy job to do and days were long sometimes but having easy going co-workers made time pass.
good,Long hours with high stress but also rewarding with building relationships with customers. Co-workers are great. Bankers are really more sales driven. Overall its fast pace.
good,"Good benefits, great PTO plan, secure environment. Worked with some very great supervisors, lots of growth potential."
good,I worked in 4 different departments. I learned many different functions with the default mortgage process. From processing HUD claims to the Foreclosing on a home.
good,Sales is the key! Everything else is secondary. Great co-workers in most branches. The employee is very expendable and the bonuses are sparse and stingy.
good,It's a stepping stone to get out of working retail and with customers. I  was able to use my experience here to get a better paying job in an office later on.
good,My day from beginning to end is extremely busy and can run into the late hours like 7 or 8pm.  My co-workers are wonderful.  Everyday in Mortgage is different and changes occurs all the time so this can certainly keep you on your toes.
good,"I am the lead teller and am supposed to be in charge of the tellers,  I help some customers, I balance the vault and prepare and accept shipments.  Help manager with various tasks"
good,It was pretty productive the workplace was always coming up with new ideas to have better customer service management was very fair and understanding. You dealt with several types of characteristics among the co-workers who tend to clique up and gossip which made it harder for me to fit in but the enjoyable part of the job was the customers and helping them.
good,"Great for someone who wants to climb the corporate ladder, repeatedly performing the same task day in day out. There is little interactions with Co-workers."
good,Pulled reports and analyzed them. worked closely with team members to keep everything updated . Assisted others when necessary. created spreadsheets.
good,This was a great group to be in and helper build networking platforms for future positions within the company.  I would recommend

good,Great company that offers time to help others.  The career growth is not easily found and to be promoted is very hard. The holiday time off is great.  A lot of changes are going on with the selling of the bank so unsure of job security.
good,"My tenure at Wachovia was nice in terms of the people I worked with."
good,I worked for Wells Fargo for 7.5 years. During that time I gained valuable knowledge and experience in both customer service and management.

good,Working for Wells Fargo was a very stressfull expeience. The customers were always nice. The co workers were very nice and helpfull. The hardest part of the day was with a customer that no matter what you try to please him or her it wasnt enough. The most enjoyable part of the day when a customer was satisfy with you at the end of the transaction and was please for being so helpfull.
good,I was able to attend college while being employed with this company. This company provides their employees with appropriate training to complete their job.

good,Good employer.  Fast paced environment.   Stable executive leadership.  Strong visionary approach.  I enjoyed the clients.  Great Brand.

good,"The thing that I enjoy most about working for Wells Fargo is the customers. Helping them succeed with their finances and assisting them in any issues that may arise will always make my day. Most of the customers I encounter, I see weekly and sometimes several times a week. I have thoroughly enjoyed building a relationship with them and getting to know about them on a personal level."

good,"Shifting files onto another shelf "
good,"I provided excellent customer service and conducted various financial transactions every day. "
good,I have been with Wells Fargo for almost 6 years. It is a decent place to work. All of my positions have been fairly easy with no complaints.I currently work as a Legal Operations Specialist and the position is new to the Charlotte Area. The management and the peers are all learning together. Wells Fargo is always changing policy's and proceedures for the betterment of the company and employees. The hardest part of the job is not knowing when something will change but I enjoy the fact of always meeting new people and engaging in volunteer opportunities and the different diversity networks. I enjoy the overall work but it is really hard to move around and get a good salary. I wish we could get market raises. The merit raises are one to three percent. I'm a single parent and it is a struggle to pay bills and keep decent credit when the benefits increase every year and the merit raises are very small. I don't feel I'm paid my worth and a lot of my talents go unrecognized.
good,the company does great recognition for their employees. The employees are valued however the goals are too high so many employees are discouraged
good,"very large organization, branch has had lots of employee turnover cannot keep employees that makes the clients very upset"
good,During my short time with Wells Fargo I had my 6 month contract position almost reduced to 3 months.  The building I was in was two thirds empty and my boss was almost laid off.  Lay offs continue there.  I would give caution to working there.
good,"Its a nice place to start off your career but management is a little intimidating. It was nice as an Intern, However I would never want to work there again."

good,Working with current and new clients each day is a joy to me personally. I enjoy taking care of their needs and making them satisfied loyal customers who prefer to come inside just to speak with us. Creating life long relationships is what I do best. I also enjoy teaching my team little details of how to treat customers and how to ensure they are exceeding the needs of our clients.
good,"A typical day at work consists of 8 hours on the phone taking customer service requests everyday.  If the supervisor likes you, there is a possibility of being able to do the activities necessary to get a promotion.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the daily metrics such as handle time, product referrals, warm transfer to sales and other customer satisfaction metrics."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a pleasure because of the knowledge I received in my course of time working there. It assisted me in becoming a better problem solver, customer service agent, cash handler etc."
good,"A typical day would include being on the phone 90% of your shift. I worked swing so it was non-stop inbound from customers all over. I learned that majority of my calls may be customers who were very upset because they were unaware of how certain accounts and policies worked. It can be stressful but making those people aware of different options to resolve their issues was always the best solution. "
good,"Great benefits, flexible work balance, and fun people to work with. The challenge was the commute and strong sales initiatives. It can be difficult to achieve sales quotas."

good,Wells Fargo Advisors is a good place to get started with your career if you're willing to put in the work yourself and work long hours trying to jumpstart your career.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day would consist of doing prepareing the office for the work day. Maintain good customer service while completing accurate financial service and money accountability. Upper management out of touch with reality of operations and compliance on a real life basis. The co-workers are hard working people trying to make a living the way way they can. The hardest part of the job is the sales and the goals set for each employee. Majority of the time the goals are unrealistic and inhumane. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and helping people.
good,"Great, good, can be fun, opportunities for growth, management varies depending on line of business, competitive, sometimes volatile which can result in downsizing."
good,well too many policies and politicks and small employees get caught co workers very cooperative hardest part on job was gallop survey
good,"I have had the opportunity of growing within this company and am truly grateful for the doors opened to me. However this job is not for everyone, the most enjoyable part of my job is the challenge everyday of getting 20+ team members to be on the same page working towards the same goal!"
good,"The training was fun and interactive, the people were lots of fun the work seemed easy because you enjoyed being there. It was  good work environment and the ability to learn was endless."
good,"This environment is one that you end up leaning things on your own. Team members are in production and managers are too busy to help which makes a very frustrating training experience.  Perfect quality is expected after delegation. You are just a number in this department, there is no one to confide in and no one who truly cares for you as an employee."
good,"My day consist of resolving Bankruptcy loans that have incorrect interest calculations. I have learned that this is a very involved process which takes a lot of research due to the different scenarios for each customer."
good,I have learned what great respect Wells Fargo has for its customers. The management team will do their best to work with you when family issues arise. The co-workers seem to bond and grow relationships beyond the work environment. The difficult part of the job is when there is overload. The most enjoyable part is not being micro managed.
good,Great Workplace to work and network. I have been working at Wellsfargo since January 2011. Wellsfargo offers different opportunities in all departments that i have experienced.

good,"Its a nice place to work, it very relax environment to work in. a cool and relax code. their are plenty of team players. understand management"
good,"Although understandable, company has trouble keeping up with not only current, but technology from as long as a decade ago.  Can hamper productivity and very frustrating.  They used Windows XP until 2012.  Company intranet slower than DSL speed. At times, procedures and policy improvements are discouraged unless initiated by at least a VP level.  Employees very dependable and knowledgeable but only a select few receive promos or awards.  Major dependence on long term employees, most extremely set in their ways, some with close to 40 years, to carry the load. People refuse to retire not just due to ""job security"", but mainly because they've allowed WF to push them around, and work with a ""punch in/punch out"" mentality. A ""squeaky wheel"" hears about it."
good,For the amount of work you do the pay is not on par for those in the banker position. Do not believe that leaders are matched up with what they are telling other to do.
good,Great while I was young.  Good experience as first professional job.  opportunity for growth.  Meet long lasting friendships and gained experience.

good,"Working at Wells Fargo was definitely one of my most enjoyable time in my life. I got to develop wonderful relationships with my team members along with the costumers in Wells Fargo. We would have our regular customers which we would joke and laugh with them. My branch was a small, close and intimate. It was easy to get along with everyone and anyone. I had a great experience with management there. We would have individual goals in which I would consistently  made every quarter. Hardest part of the job is getting to your individual goals. Luckly for me, I was able to work at different branches that helped me get to my goals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Learning is a key role to success. Bankruptcy laws and rules are constantly changing. Wells Fargo offers training to support the updates of the laws and rules.

As in any company, some managers are better than others but I have always been lucky with my team leaders and team members. Also, the company is very dedicated to their communities and offers many volunteer options. "

good,Good place to work. Hardest part of the job meeting sales goals. Learned a lot about the products they have. Typical day would be a very busy non stop. Always something to do.
good,I would work with home owners on trying to save their homes. Working on new loans for the home owners to make the loans where they can make the payments.
good,"Over all Wells Fargo has been good to me and I have made many friends for life. the compensation is not the most competitive, but the benefits are great. at times the expectation far exceeds reality. Job advancement is not really available for most, and sadly it becomes a  department with no advancement."

good,Good place to work for with great opportunity to grow within the company. Benefits were very good and the people were awesome.
good,"We all know Wachovia (Wells Fargo) is known for their sales pushing, but my manager was one of the best managers to work for because she was very passionate, personable and kind. The hardest part of this job for me was the pressure of having to get a quantity of accounts, not quality accounts. Long as you made that number, that's all that seemed to matter to this company. The most enjoyable part of this job, was helping other people, whether it was suggesting the right financial product for them, giving a listening ear or just putting a smile on their face after a rough week or day."
good,"I can truly say there is a strong work ethics by workers here. I think there is room for improvement in every area. However, this job does offer advanced opportunities."
good,Prepare for a lot of hard work with low pay.  Working at the capacity is like working on a conveyor belt.  Expect to be constantly busy.  Management uses a scoring system to review your productivity.
good,A lot of sales to do. Everyday you have to meet a certain goal. It is up to you t complete and finish. Good bonuses though. You have to meet a certain requirement monthly as well.
good,"Typical day: assisting mortgagors in curing their delinquencies and avoid foreclosure; "

good,"A typical day is filled with a variety of customers and handling their concerns as well as recommending products or services to meet their needs.The co-workers were an enjoyment to be around. The hardest part of the job was waiting for other departments to connect, and the most enjoyable part of the job was having the customers utilize the recommendations of products and services you give them."
good,While I worked there regional managers found ways to stress employees on sales. My coworkers were the only reason I enjoyed my job.  Its was difficult for my branch managers to impose their management style because regional managers found ways to stress managers.

good,The most important part of any job I do is helping others reach their goal.  I am by nature a 'helper' and 'consultant'.  I am a strong team player that will take the time to help others and volunteer when needed. I walk in with a smile each day and leave with that same smile on my face at the end of the day.  I would like to think if I am not at work I am missed in the office by many of the team members including management.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers via phone with their basic banking Questions such as balances, claims, and just general questions. I have learned good communication skills and consistency is the key to success. Management is good but there is always room for improvement for everyone. Co-workers are kind to one another.

A typical day at Wells Fargo consist of pipeline reporting on a daily basis, working on loan submission while analyzing borrowers documentations for accuracy, loan approvals, and interacting with underwriters based on their loan decisions (approvals or denials). Time is an essence. There is never enough time during the day to get everything done. The environment in the work place is very fast paced. There are many nice and helpful team members as well as not so nice ones. Your set goals and projections are very important and must be met monthly. The hardest part is being able to discuss conditions required with the customer in order to facilitate them with loan clearance. Month end becomes very stressful due to closing/funding number."
good,"If you enjoy working at a call center, this is a great choice. Lots of calls to take, people to help. Self explanatory, they provide a script. You get docked if you don't follow it though. Very friendly employees, manager are helpful and always willing to help and answer questions"
good,This is a call center atmosphere. You are tied to your phone all day. Not very flexible with work schedule.
good,"data entry, keyed and proof of customer account and amount make sure customer transaction correct. Mangagement and co-workers fun and friendly."

good,Well sponsor your 6 and 63 while teaching you basics of retirement plans such as IRA's and 401k.
good,"Average of 70 to 90 calls per day, to assist customers with banking concerns.  I became well versed on reading someone's voice and tones to determine their mind set."
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo for a very short period of time.  I was temp hired to ""catch up""  that meant I did everything from file records in the filing room to upload the latest files so they could become paperless.  It was a tedious job but was temporary so I didn't have to much to gain or lose from this job."
good,"fast paced"
good,"Wellsfargo provide great training class. And I earned great experience in  customer service. "

good,Entry level experience lots of opportunity to move up. Great leadership and countless opportunities
good,"Teller manager was too young for the position and it went to her head.  She would tell me to perform duties out of line with company policies-- making me process ATM deposits to envelops that someone else opened. (one example)  Then she blamed everyone else for any discrepancies.  Branch Manager was awesome though, as were most of the other co-workers.  Pay was mediocre for all the hoops the tellers have to jump through."
good,Taking phone calls to assist with banking issues. Management is fun and upbeat daily. I enjoy my co-workers because they are always ready to help in any situation. The most enjoyable part of the day is removing a customer's concern with a matter.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A very fast-paced job that is great for those looking to move up from an entry level position to one of management. High pressure sales tactics can be very stressful while also trying to perform the basic functions on your job. If you enjoy sales, this will be a great position for you."
good,"Pretty good company to work for, but job advancement and salary was not competitive enough for myself."
good,Too many daily tick marks.  Good pay and good benefits.  Great opportunity to build relationships and work way up the ladder.
good,"Professional environment, Great Management team. Co-workers are team players. The hardest part of the job was the distance to far from where I live. I enjoyed learning new skill."
good,"This company's compensation and benefits were decent. I was more micro-managed than trained on assigned tasks. At the time, the department was unsure of the direction it wanted to go, making it hard to please management or fully fulfill tasks."
good,"Prior to Wells Fargo taking over Wachovia Bank , it was a great place to work.  They understood employees needs and reconized their strenghths and weaknesses to help them improve in their daily working environment"
good,nice place to work the best thing is u hardly have to work overtime and over 40hrs a week and hour lunches are the best good working environment.
good,This was a job I wasn't excited about. Seen people hang up on customers and being very rude to them. Felt like customer deserve better. I also closed my accounts I held with company after work for the company.
good,Overall great company but you stay busy . Enjoyed my coworkers and management.
good,Just hard sales every day and OD fees cust and this place has a bad co workers and managers.
good,"responsible for managing negotiators, monitored incoming and outbound calls made to customersm, reviewed decisions made by the negotiator, responsible for having daily huddles and performing one on ones with the reps."

good,"Ideal work environment for self development"
good,"The company was very demanding and moral was low. You were required to work long days and even longer days for month end closing."
good,high pressured sales to benefit the business not the customer. call center environment with inbound sales. Long term development is only opportunity to advance. not based on performance
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,We came in and helped the customers.  I was in charge of the vault and running transactions.  At the end of the day I balanced the teller window and the vault.
good,"I was based at a call center. I would receive inbound calls from customer from all 50 States wanting to refinance or purchase a property. The environment was good. Management always sets up fun competition games for the employees to reach our sales goals which kept things interesting at work. My co-workers were amazing I consider them close friends. The hardest part of the job is the constant grind, at times the calls are just keep coming and it may get overwhelming especially coming to work from the next day disappointed that you didn't achieve the goals you set for yourself. The enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers you work with. They were fun to have around and a great resource because you are not going to know everything off the top of your head or if you are second guessing a loan, you would have their input at the tips of your finger."
good,"-fast paced sales"
good,This was my first corporate job other than a fast food joint. It was different and enjoyable and I learned alot
good,I was fired wrongly. Then brought back with a small amount of money if i would not sue them. Worked for 6 months then i found a better job with better job security.
good,"Good place for women employees to work."
good,"I love building rapport with customers, discovering their needs so I may make a recommendation on our products and services."
good,"At Wells Fargo, it does not matter how well you did yesterday, last week or last month! It's all about what you are coming in with today and how you are going to meet you daily goals. The goals at Wells Fargo for sales are exceedingly high. They want you to pressure people into things that they don't even want. We focus on different things every week. The only good thing about Wells Fargo is the pay, it is very very very good, and also the PTO that we receive. You will need all the PTO you can get working this stress long day of a job."
good,The sales pressure is pretty extreme. Expectations are set at a standard that isn't really what's best for the customer...although that's what they try to clam.
good,"Wells fargo don't care about their employees, they hire you as part time but make you work full time without the benefits"
good,"As a teller you will assist customers with making deposits, withdraws, payments and to sell to them products that might benefit them in the future."
good,"I began with Wachovia before the merger. After the merger they made it harder and harder to reach a realistic goal. If you didn't meet a bonus goal you were scorned. Upper management forces branch manager to discipline their employees on a regular basis, causing localized issues. Verbal harassment problem was swept under the rug rather than reprimanding."
good,Incoming constant calls with any type of questions at all from customers as well as sales goals that has to met along with a lot of other very stressful things. While still having to maintain a smile on your face and on the phone no matter the situation or what is said to you.
good,good place part time hours gives you your cdl b no charge.  They only offer pt hours so if you are looking to get cdl it is good.

good,I loved to go to work everyday to wachiova Until wells fargo bought the company
good,"Working at Wells Fargo I was able to make bonuses, work overtime, take customer service award trips and work habitat for humanity.  It was a fast paced work environment.  I worked in the Reverse Mortgage department.  It was a challenging position with large pipelines and they were closely monitored. The hardest part of the job was requesting documents for the underwriter to review.  It ranged from ordering title, appraisals and documentation.  Management and co-workers were supportive and helpful. The company no longer offered Reverse Mortages.  We were moved to lost mitigation then to appraisal reviews which then lead to the entire office being laid off."
good,"- Plain monitoring of calls."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of being courteous, attentive and being able to move at a fast paced, Recognize opportunities that would benefit customers accounts."
good,"Love the people and the work, very rewarding work. Cant make a living on this wage"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,working within  the deadlines that is set by the depositories  at DTC and the FED. Working in a team where everyone was aware of what  was expected of them .Days that were a challenge was when the FED or DTC would constantly keep extending  their closing time. This would effect when we would be able to balance our client accounts. A good day was when we had no extension and we balance  on time.. Having co-workers that understood that there are days when we had fun and days when we were all on edge.
good,Dealing with upper management was a hassle and they always drilled the sales goals even if you were doing great.
good,took inbound calls from reverse mortgage customers. helped them understand there monthly statement. Transferred funds from there Reverse Mortgage account to there bank account upon request.
good,Typical call center environment. Able to move within departments.
good,Can be slow at times with some tedious work but overall a great job to broaden your banking horizons.
good,Solid company but working inside the actual bank can be very stressful. My experience on intern/mortgage and analyst side was absolutely great.
good,"As a teller, your day consists of running repetitive transactions for customers. The software is easy to learn and understand so it makes it simple to balance your drawer and check for accuracy."
good,"Good organization, but needs to be more ""Lean"", ""Agile"", Transperant"
good,"Typical Teller transactions and daily bank activities were very enjoyable. The company is very heavy into sales and making numbers, to the point where it became very stressful. Enjoyed meeting and maintaining regular customers, and genuinely finding solutions for customer needs."
good,"Great coworkers"
good,"It's a good place to work at, but not good of management. I worked as a temp. Did a lot of training. I was mainly in charge of shipping."
good,"took deposits "
good,"High turnover in staffing at the branch level. Training has decreased from 2 weeks full time in a classroom setting to 1 week part time. When employees come to the branch, they are not fully trained."
good,"Keyed IRA's into the computer"
good,It was fun talking to people all over the United States. Sales goals were very high but if you could meet them the reward payed off.
good,as a department we concentrated more on a daily numbers than truly helping people...too much going back and forth with sending documents.

good,"•	Manage existing client relationship and handle all necessary related paperwork and changes."
good,"A typical day for me is getting checking emails, prioritizing conditions and new files and attending meetings.  I have learned a great deal and been able to advance my authority.  Some of the downfalls are that managers are often in meetings.  Hardest part of my job is finding management to help on a difficult file.  Best part of my job is the problem solving."
good,Typical day answering phone calls regarding customer issues and troubleshooting as needed.  I learned a lot about how troubleshooting over the phone works and how I could help people over the phone.  co-workers and management were good.  Hardest part of this job was balance as this is something that is needed but is up to the individual to really learn.  most enjoyable part of this job was the atmosphere
good,Did not enjoy the high pressure call center environment. Did not feel the managers tactics were professional.
good,stressful; with changeable goals. Minneapolis location.  management was posturing to upper leaders.  coworkers were afraid to speak candidly to their managers.
good,Very intense job without many breaks.  It was a very busy and the phone never stopped ringing.  It was very hard to get off the line and take your scheduled breaks.
good,I started off as a regular rep and made my way up but over the years i have learned that with my education i will not be able to advance my career with wells Fargo because they are more focus on people with experience than education.  I enjoyed helping others succeed but it is time for me to focus on my success
good,Busy with customer service and account opening had the support of the manager and learned alot abour running a branch
good,The life of a Service Manager is a challenging job. There is a lot of time dedicated to working this position. It is definitely not a 9-5/M-F. It is a salary position and it is expected that one must work at least 50 hours a week.
good,"Work with bank partners, acquired new personal and business accounts, grow profitability in our market share"
good,I can't give an honest review since I was only there a short time and it was quite awhile ago.
good,"Not sure if Wells Fargo was a good or bad place to work.  It was a job that paid the bills.  Growing within the company was challenging, but not impossible."
good,love working with the customers and getting to know the community. love the challenges that everyday brings. Nothing is the same day after day
good,"A typical day at work involves customer interaction over the phone, helping customers overcome financial concerns by offering and suggesting financial products and services to help better their needs. The work environment is very busy and does not give you time to interact with many employees, however I would say coworkers and management are very professional and courteous."
good,Loved every person I got the pleasure of working with. Always stayed busy and it was always a good atmosphere to work in. Would love to maybe go back to the company some day.

good,Good workplace.  Good ethics.  Nice environment.  Good work hours.  nice co-workers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is an overall good company however they have a difficult performance matrix to live up to. Sales seems to be put before customer service.
good,A coaching enviornment. I love this place!! Handling customers accounts and offering additional products and service to benefit customers banking. This position can get stressful if you don't produce enough at work.
good,"Great experience and training in customer service and the financial industry.  Merger after merger makes one leery to work in this line of business...with every merger, something closes."
good,"It's been a long time since I have been with Wachovia, which is now Wells Fargo.  While I was there it was great."
good,"If you want to do the same thing over and over and constantly be pressure by sales, than its the job for you."
good,Wells Fargo is a fast paced work environment. It requires team members to be flexible in skills and open to learning new things. It is a family type work environment where everyone is always willing to help one another. What I like most about this job is helping others be successful at what they do.
good,Got to meet tons of people that I got to help and guide in the right direction. All the co-workers looked out for each other to help make sure the day went by smoother.
good,"I had a good experience that I had with involving different field that from my previous experience, the management not helping to accomplish you goal."
good,"On  daily basis I work with a team of four tellers and five bankers. I review reports on a daily basis in order to see where the branch is at as far as sales and service goals.I have a great team that is motivated about 85 percent of the time. The other 15 percent where they lack motivation is mainly due to day to day stresses when it comes to customer service. "
good,Didn't have enough time to enjoy working there.   But while there it was fun.   People were nice and a very good job.
good,"as a banker position you do a lot of work and not enough pay, health care premiums too expensive , not many options and high family deductible"

good,"Wells gives good benefits, including 5 weeks off and 6% match on 401K"
good,"This job was a challenge for me when I first started, but after the training and the fast paced, hands-on environment, I became a professional. Professionalism was the first objective I learned to always have and always follow. Time management also played a part in quality control and quality care for every person and their transactions. Management moved all around, but when I needed them (for whatever) they were always there. They showed great care about our work and less care about overtime hours. (The needs of the store were more important than anything.) The hardest part of the job was freeing up the busy line that waited outside the bank before start time even began. Keeping up with the count of my money was the easy part however, it was not rare to fall short every now and then. The most enjoyable part of my employment with Wells Fargo was the co-workers. Even though our job was to be done in an firm way, we all had different personalities that would brighten up even the cloudiest day. Counting money was also an excitement for me. I had the opportunity that many people will never have: counting and holding multiple FDIC strapped cash and foreign currency."
good,Worked as a team for closing loans. Prepared loan docs with accuracy
good,"I think it depends on where you work and who you work with.  I know when I was at wells fargo, there was 2 dept on either side of mine that were very strict, luckly my manager was pretty flexible and nice."
good,"The company has a very good idea of the balance between customer service and sales, which isn't as easy to maintain as assumed. The sales in our district are very important, which usually decreases customer service. The sales integrity is not the best and the customers' usually don't understand what they are being signed up for."
good,its a good job if you have a sales background and like to hustle its all about the numbers
good,stressful work environment. learned to work through stres
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"•	Processes default and/or non-defaulted loans"

good,"Good Team membership"
good,nice place to learn and pressure for sales pump up is always on your head
good,"The campus is beautiful and spacious, and you get to talk to a lot of interesting people from all over the United States.  You also get a lot of free lunches!  Can't dislike that."
good,Fun workplace to learn about the mortgage world. Coworkers are great and the hardest part of the job was the short breaks.
good,"Always busy, day went by very fast."
good,"My job is customer service and sales Wells Fargo  products."
good,"•	Handle compliance of audit operations and regulatory issues"
good,"Overall, this is a good, solid company to work for. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers.  My team truly knew the meaning of teamwork and would go above and beyond to assist when needed."
good,"Investigate potential fraud on Wells Fargo credit and debit cards"
good,My review on Wells Fargo varies I think they are a great company with amazing benefits but I think they are too close minded to employee recommendations that could easily improve work conditions for employees and managers alike.
good,"I was not with this company long enough to actually form an opinion, but for the short I was employed there, all those I dealt with were friendly and very helpful"
good,I wore many hat at this company! And for all the hats I loved processing the most!
good,"good company, stayed busy and had the highest top cross sells."
good,"My contract and project also completed."
good,"Wells Fargo’s CORE (Common Opportunities, Results and Experience) Project is an end-to-end approach to real estate – secured lending. It’s aimed towards improving the overall customer experience and to satisfy all their financial needs. CORE is a new outlook to better and replace existing legacy applications with the ambitious aim to take over all their workload."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,if you love being coached and a working enviroment that is all about the customer this is the place for you!
good,"Overall a great company to work for.  Great benefits, friendly staff."
good,I came on thinking I would be modifying peoples loans... but the guidelines Wells Fargo had in place really didn't leave much room for that. I ended up being a collector... which I can't stand
good,"work in default department, audtiting attorney firms (BK, Eviction, & FC)."
good,"low paying wages,no opportunity for advancement. pushy sales enviroment"
good,"A typical day at work consist of being very busy all day long.  I work in a very high volume department- managing many projects at once. There are 90 bankers that I work with daily, along with a team of Business Associates, I proactively support and train. "
good,I was responsible for taking calls and helping the customers then referring them to products and services that will benefit them or save them money. I get about 20 referrals a day I have to keep a adherence of 91.99% as well as keep a aht (handle phone time) to 250 seconds a call I get all 100% on my QAs (company surveys). I also get all 100% in my KDM (customers surveys) Most of all I am responsible for assisting customers with their credit card needs before anything. I’ve also trained and coached new team members that come to the company on referrals and handle times as well as on customer service.
good,It becomes repetitive but at the same time helps you be better in math too
good,Lack of stuff to do throughout the day. Only was part time at 20 hours a week.
good,This is a SALES position.  alot of people think banking is customer service but it is a HIGH LEVEL sales position.  being a banker or teller was a great opportunity to develop sales skills but management  has terrible work/life balance.  normally worked approx 60 hours a week at the bank. they close at 5 but I was frequently there till 8pm doing all the office work I couldn't do throughout the day because of various reasons related to the high sales goals.  it was NEVER ok to have a slow day or not have customers at bankers desks
good,"•	Production for 2008 was $ 8.9 million in SBA loans and $ 5 million in commercial loans."
good,"A typical day is staying quite busy taking phone calls.  You learn to be patient with the clients, understanding their needs and what you can do to make things better for them.  "
good,This company only hired temporary employees for the loss mitigation dept.  I liked helping people with other avenues in staying in their homes.
good,Managing a teller line in a store with low production the district manager comes out and fuss all the time because the store isn't meeting goals. Hard to reach goals
good,I believe that this company lacks organization and the training to have their employees succeed.
good,"Within this workplace, one has room to learn, advance, grow and retire. Heavy workloads at times but not overbearing. Decent management. Opportunities to learn different aspects of indirect banking. Decent benefits including insurance, vacation time and 401-K."
good,Training was great service manager not so much  she wasn't the nicest person goals are hard to meet you have to have at least 6 people open something like an account credit card loan and you have to have walk overs! You have to have at least 3!!!!!!  A walk over is when you walk a customer to a banker to open an account or some type of product or service if you dont get anything open your job is on the line and you may get written up possibly fired..
good,"its always good to get the experience, for upcomming carreers"
good,"Wasn't the best job due to high call volume and stressful"
good,This was a short term temp assignment through Kelly Services.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Learned to provide excellent customer service. Developed customer service language. Learned to handle customers through the drive through. Company is sales driven, so it is important to sell the benefits to each customer. Customers were good to work with. The team was great as well. The hardest part of the job is the sales. I learned that I am not a sales person. The most enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers and customers."
good,"learned a lot. worked on various modules of banking applications. coordinated with dev,pdm daily basis."
good,"I review and verify income for home equity loans. It is a production environment where we manage quality, customer service, and production goals to meet business needs and customer's expectations."
good,"Review 50-75 loans, each day, to ensure that deadlines are being met and conveying files that have interest curtailment dates approaching. Ensure that, for each loan, bills and fees are being paid, up to date, to minimize interest loss and unnecessary risk is avoided."
good,"Good place to work, best if you come in at a manager level vs. trying to climb the ranks."
good,The environment is fast paced and sales driven.  You have opportunity to promote as long as you meet all sales goals and maintain good customer service levels no matter where you want to go in the company.  The company has changed since the merger with Wachovia and is now bottomline focused.
good,great enviroment work long hours had to meet a goal each month love counting money
good,Review customer account changes to prevent possible fraud or identity theft.
good,"great learning experience with good coworker "
good,"Again I prefer not to discuss this. "
good,"Customer service job for the most part. I don't see the need to review a past job. It is in the past, I learned things that I can apply to future employment."
good,"Wells Fargo is an ok place to work, just depends on what department you work in."
good,"My current position allows for a fair amount of self motivation and management.  I spend a large part of my day helping retail banking traffic customers with account services or cash transactions.  When traffic is slow, I must work lead lists and my own book of business to solicit additional sales.  My team and manager have recognized my attention to detail and organizational skills and have appointed me as an unofficial assistant manager, giving me access and responsibility for making the daily (and sometimes monthly) schedule, organizing team events, and tracking and researching corporate required training schedules. I love my co-workers and having the opportunity to work at my own pace, but am finding that I don't particularly enjoy the sales focus required in my position and there is not much room for growth outside of sales. I have also found that management is promoted based purely on their sales performance and, therefore, may or may not have the human resources skills one prefers to have in their supervisor."
good,"The job entails communication via email and phone to the settlement agents, customers, and state counties on a daily basis. Must create documents for signing by customers and also make sure that current documents have correct information. "
good,A day at this job pretty much goes by quickly because even though it's claims all day each case is different.  You can learn everything about a person if you just listen.  Management at this company does need to be around more and would be nice if the managers knew who the programs worked and knew how to work a claim. Most of the co workers there are great! It is hard to get a quick answer because you either have to wait or an assist agent to help which can take up to 25 - 30 minutes. I loved being able to help someone with their account and to have their money back within 24 to 48 business hrs.
good,Depending on your position and management team will greatly sway you opinion on the company.  I am thankful for the opportunity given but there was minimal growth potential within the department I was initially hired within.
good,Industry leader in mortgage lending with innovative mortgage products and services
good,"Great place to work"
good,"If you want to work in an environment where you feel like family this is the place, however it can be very stressful and demanding in a call center."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Answered the phone for customer inquires. Met deadlines and sales quota's.
good,"The work environment was very hectic and there was a lot of pressure to meet ridiculously high sales goals. As one of the larger banks, it is to be expected. My main issue was actually the inner-office cliques that formed. The branch manager would take cigarette breaks with other employees (myself included) and she would rant and rave about how she wanted to fire her bankers or hated what another teller did. She gossiped and talked behind their backs and then made crucial career decisions based on her feelings. That was not the kind of office I wanted to be at. But I was one of the highest producing tellers at my branch, so she made it impossible for me to transfer to anywhere else in the district because she wouldn't sign off. The DM just wanted her numbers high and didn't care. So my only was out was to resign."
good,Was able to promote and move to different departments.  Was able to work with various managers and team members
good,"I had been with the company for many years and ended my last job as a conventional mortgage underwriter 3.  Four layoffs in a six month time period.  Highly unstable,  LIS system is forty years old and terrible.  Management is not open to employee ideas.  Sink or swim mentality towards all.  I developed high blood pressure from all the stress.  Limited resources available for assistance.  Frequently people crying from all the stress.  All other areas of the company I had been in prior to home mortgage were great."
good,Wells Fargo Financial Advisors- See Resume.  Small Branch-little room for growth.
good,job would be better if management new what they were doing and had better information to perform the job
good,"I am responsible for my own schedule and production, I like this style of management, although it is not the way things are handled in all departments.

We will work from oldest to newest with a deadline that each week we underwrote 12 to 15 loans a week. We had automated system which was new to me compare past experiences were manually. As an underwriter we used their systems to approve and denied loans and reviewed documentations based on policies and procedures. For example, we had to be in detailed about their residence, if had a true hardship and proof of income statements were correct that matched and made sense overall of the loan. Co-workers were great we will work as a team and help each other achieve our quality and production goals. I would say hardest part of the job when contacting our processor to interpret or communicate in a way that they will understand what and why we are asking for such as additional documents if necessary or verbal verification.

Then throughout the day, we will help customers, coach team members on the fly, set up meetings, have one-on-ones with team members and help them to succeed by leading as an example. we spend more time with our coworkers, so I as a manager need to make sure to create a positive, fun, friendly atmosphere in order to be able to handle the challenges and provide a balanced business throughout the day. "

good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo and learned a lot about how to be a professional during my time there.  The two things I enjoyed the most about Wells Fargo were the people I worked with and the fact that there was always something to learn or a challenge to overcome.  The hardest part of my time there, as may be the case in a lot of jobs or companies, was dealing with people issues and figuring out how to navigate those situations and handle the relationships/interactions in the best manner possible."

good,"Assisted head loan closing agents."
good,"Reviewed, verified and/or identified customer transactions to detect/prevent financial crimes."
good,"The job itself is easy and you're trained before starting in your store, but the main focus is sales, so there are many errors made by tellers because of this. Management doesn't care about you as a person, everyone is just trying to climb the corporate ladder. As long as your making your sales goals, which are ridiculous, and treating your customer like a number, you'll get along just fine. The environment is cutthroat and there is a very high level of turnover. The only benefit is having somewhat of, what is supposed to be, a set schedule, with some holidays off, and getting health benefits."
good,"There is a lot of pressure for sales and little return for reaching the sells goals. I coach tellers during the day, of how to assist customers in a timely, professional manner. We look for opportunities to help the customer succeed financially. I make schedules, manage risk/loss with customer service. The best thing about this job is being able to help customers with their industry questions, concerns and their overal financial wellbeing. The least favorite part here is that no matter the goals you shoot for, and reach, the bank always wants more. They do not set you up for success in terms of development."
good,Appreciated the experience I received from working at WF as one of my first jobs out of college
good,I have learned many different skills with the different jobs I have obtained within the company. I enjoyed that each time I moved up within the company I learned something new within each job and each job was challenging.Management in each department I worked in was really good. The company was great to their employees and they really help you to achieve and succeed at whatever job you did.
good,"Love working with the public, efficient, dependable."
good,the job was deadline based noone bothered you while you worked unless you had an error or was not processing your work as to what the standard was. the hardest part of the day was taking up the slack of other workers who did not do their part of the team work for that night. It became stressful to the individual who did what they were supposed to do that day
good,ubna empresa en la que brindad grandes oportunidades y apoyo para desarollar tus habilidades
good,"Its a good company. "
good,Wells Fargo has plenty of product to offer a wide variety of clients. Wells Fargo's atmosphere is not something that I will miss because it's sales structure often pushes great employees to become immoral and unethical in their sales practices.
good,Accurately process 800 or more home mortgage loan documents per hour.

good,Typical would start will working your pipeline reviewing loans with a full underwrite from income to property. Benefits to the Borrowers and the condition of the property appraisal to title.

good,Decent place to work. Highly sales oriented and fast paced.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. "
good,Demanding sales goals can be demanding at times. Great growth potential. Great people.

good,"Pro - Somewhat Flexible Position, laptop to work at home provided, good benefits, abundance of sales & mortgage training avaliable"
good,"Sales culture is a lot to handle."
good,"This is a high paced place to work, and new work is continuously coming down the chute, which can be overwhelming at times depending on your current daily or month end work load. Coworkers take pride in their work; most have been at their jobs for 8+ years so advancement can be difficult. Management needs work, most are results driven which is common in the financial sector, but they need to realize relationship building with their subordinates would go a long way in employee retention and people enjoying their career."
good,Wells Fargo is just what it is...  a huge organization with a too many people doing the same thing and not communicating very well...   Overall - it it what it is - and it is probably no different than any other bank experience.

good,"•	Batched and keyed an average of 150 large deposits daily"
good,Answered calls for banking inquiries. I learned a lot concerning banking practices.
good,Very stressful if not in high traffic branch. People will open accounts that are not necessary in order to meet quotas.
good,"While working at wells fargo, I met some great people.  The people and the branch I worked for were great.  Also had some great customers. Working with customers in regards to their money is not an easy job, however, it did teach me how to deal with difficult customers. The hardest part of the job that I did not enjoy was the sales requirements for the job. I felt we were pushed too much on sales, and not really focusing on the customer. This was supposed to be a teller job (handling deposits, cashing checks, etc.), Not a sales job."
good,"• Opened and closed branch making sure each entry and exit was secure"
good,"I worked 3pm to 9pm Monday thru Friday, I really enjoyed working those hours and this is where I learned all about banking and the inner workings of a retail lockbox. My co-workers were all experienced in this field so they taught me alot and since I'm such a quick learner I went on to train the new hires. Training people was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"A work day at Wells Fargo consists of assisting customers with what they need and selling products and services to the customers. Management will get on your back if you are not making your sales because this is an extremely sales-based job where one can only advance if they are truly dedicated to sales and will go out of their way to sell our products to customers. Management has the experience of either a teller or a banker or both, which makes them a better team since they know what is going on and can help you with what you need help on. All tellers follow a script for every customer interaction which can get a little dull because we sound like robots so we try to throw in our own personalities to the script and make it sound more genuine. The best part of the job is having a big team and knowing that everyone that works there needs help from the next person so my branch has good team players."
good,I learned a lot working for Wells Fargo. Co-workers are friendly and helpful.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is very pushy when it comes to sales, whether the customer needs the product or not, associates will open accounts just to meet sales goals"

good,Working in bank operations can be stressful. There are deadlines and production goals to be met
good,"Wells Fargo is fast paced, it was a very good learning experience for me. they have a very good management team and a great group of employees. Most of my income is earned on incentives, this is on a matrix that changes based on performance, there are some parts of that matrix that you have very little control over. The best part of the job is helping people get into the home of their dreams!"
good,I like how they let employees wear jeans on certain days It is a good company to work for.
good,"I learned alot with my time at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, however I feel like there is no place for advancement at this time and I am ready to move to the next level"
good,Goal oriented and friendly helpful staff always there to assist you with your needs.
good,"To provide exceptional customer service and close loans."
good,"Typical, corporate environment with common workplace challenges."
good,great advancement opportunities. the supervisors and co workers were friendly and helpful. the hardest part of the job were the rude customers.
good,"High pressure to sale, but to be disqualified from incentive is very easy."
good,"My day to day events incuded being organized to plan in advance and follow up with customer regarding the loans and new accounts.  Daily made proactive calls to get new business and review customer service experience.  A schedule to greet every customer entrance in the bank.  In addition, we made business calls outside the office to get new business.  Also, we covered coverage for other employees who called out sick or vacation.  Dual control was apart approvals needed for negotiated items needed for customers."
good,This was a good company but being a teller is just like any other customer service job. You are dealing with customer's being angry about things out of your control.
good,"While I thoroughly enjoyed and was good in a Help Desk Analyst position the company does not hire full time for this position, contract jobs with a 6 month gap where they re-hire the contractor afterwards. This leaves it an unstable way to earn a living"
good,"Work day starts at 8 and ends at 5 with a hour lunch. I interact daily with processors, managers and sometimes customers."
good,"•	Involved with ordering, receiving, verifying, and distributing cash"
good,"I have held 3 positions at Wells Fargo. Last position as a Insurance Agent was in the call center and it was very rewarding, fun, and challenging workplace. There are over 120 employee and I can point finger and name every singe person by firt and last name. Money was great but nowhere to further my career in that field as the home office is in Minneappolis, MN."
good,I was responsible for meeting sales and customer service goals quarterly. I was also responsible for keeping my cash drawer in order and making sure it was balanced at the end of each day.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They are very demanding with what the require from their workers. Most of the time it is smooth sailing but sometimes it can get pretty bad. They are hound dogs when it comes to offering options with customers.
good,Moral is low and the company places high emphais on sales goals rather than their employees.
good,This position had some flaws in the management department and had little room for growth within the department. The most enjoyable part of this job were the benefits and salary.
good,"Processed bank transactions, cash handling, customer service and account sales."
good,Reviewing of all fraud claims for debit and ATM claims. Processing of all claim payouts.
good,"A typical day in the life of a corporate trainer for Wells Fargo included prepping for the day's class and agenda, spending 8 hours training new hires, spending lunch and half hour after work following up on emails and preparing for the next group to attend new hire training.  What I learned the most was if you don't like change, then Wells Fargo is not the place for you.  Management is set up in many levels and someone is always available to help.  Keeping open communication with your leaders on what is going well and not well is critical.  All of my co-workers were a delight to work with.  The hardest part of the job was finding the time to do the administrative things we were required to do and still be in a classroom 8 hours a day.  The most enjoyable part of my job was training new hires and helping them feel confident for their new roles."
good,"customer service"
good,"Daily Work Schedule is Development,Estimation, Review,Document,"
good,"No room for advancement, collect on home equity, but dont talk to many customers"
good,"Would sell checking, savings, loan products on a day to day basis with a sales quote for each day. I learned time management and different sales techniques."
good,In the collection department it was all about numbers. Management tried to give us balance with fun activities in between collecting. My manager was friendly open and fun. My coworkers were Great.
good,A typical day is a good day. Interacting with customers providing there every needs
good,A typical day at work would be on the computer the entire day working on mortgage loans. I learned about mortgage loans and I learned how to use 10 key by touch. The hardest part of the job was not knowing if you were going to be empolyed the next day because everyone is contracted in.
good,Alright company if you like to be left alone and just do your job. But its made pretty clear that youre replaceable and just a number in there systems.
good,opportunity for bonus. no required overtime and great hours.
good,Take and make calls to potential mortgage refinance  costumers from around the United States
good,The issue with their retail and commercial banking teams is the high pressure sales approach they place on rookie personnel.  The atmosphere is fun as long as you perform above goal.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed working for WF when I started as a teller last year. But then when I moved up in the company things took a turn for the worse I was always in my managers office because of my ""lack of sales"" my sales were not bad they were quality. My co-workers were great management took the power to their heads and treated the other employees pretty bad. The only part I really enjoyed was when I helped someone with an issue that they couldn't and i put in the time and effort and got it done. But the problem with WF is that they only have one thing on their mind and that is to SELL SELL SELL!"
good,Enjoyed working for Wachovia.  Did not have the opportunity to work for Wells Fargo that long.
good,With Motivation and hard work you'll amount to anything with this company.
good,Working at Wells Fargo has been a mixture of good and bad. The work load is not too taxing and apart from occasional stress from busy branches/unsatisfied customers I like the job. The management however makes me and others like me cringe. The management has a hard time utilizing it's team members to the fullest. I often felt under-appreciated
good,"They aren't always trying to make sure things are right the first time or providing their customers with excellent service. They're more worried about the money in their pockets. Employees get treated poorly by management, while working 40+ hours a week. Employees are also bothered outside of work with sales questions and work-related questions."
good,Didn't have the best experience here.  Good company but was a contract employee.  I felt no loyalty and when the contract ends your done.  No benefits no vacation.  Pay was ok. I need a more permanent position.
good,Nice place to work but we were each given over 100 loans in our pipeline and couldn't possibly give the clients the service they deserved.  Many people on our team quit because of the stress.  It would have been better if we'd had a few more underwriters to get the loans reviewed.  Had to deal with a lot of unhappy people not due to any fault of my own.
good,"High turn over, pay is terrible. not a lot of room to move around."
good,Hardest Part of Job is cross selling products while working in the detached motor bank.
good,"I found out that selling cars takes less skills than I expected, due to the fact that I'm a people's person. I enjoyed working there for the summer to earn extra cash for school."
good,"Although not a desirable place to work for me, the people I worked with were wonderful!"
good,"Never a typical day (new assignments almost everyday)"
good,This job taugh me proper inventory techniques. I would ocasionally repair cash handling machines.
good,Company is okay Co-workers are great they have been very helpful
good,"This was a call center that we was a inbound and out bound center. I worked in collections so I would call customers who behind in thier mortgage and see if there was any way that we could get them caught up. Maybe put them on payments plan. I also took payments over the phone. I learned how deal with all differents types of walks of life. I've also learned that you have to be able to communicate to with those are upset, take control of the conversation, consult the customer, and still be able to conduct business. The hardest part of the job would be that you would have upset customers that you would have to calm them down and figure out a waty to still be able to set a payment arragement for them. The best part of the job was just that were able to help some of the customers get back on track with their mortgage."

good,"Overall, Wells Fargo has an excellent corporate structure that really encourages advancement and job success. My co-workers are wonderful as well as my manager. A typical day at work is high pressure movement of files. Hardest part of the job is the constant change in guidelines, coupled with the constant internal auditing combined with pressures from management and sales to still move files as quickly as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom of making decisions on high level portfolio loans."
good,"Like any financial institution, confidentiality and sharpness are a must.  One must maintain the integrity of the customer's information while keeping sharp eye for potential fraud."
good,Its ok but very stressful and demanding. Long hour cut away at your personal life and the demands are never ending.
good,Wells Fargo stresses making referrals to their bank products. It could get stressful because your job does depend on how many bank products you sell. It's no longer about doing your job as a teller-it's a sales job.
good,I worked for Wells fargo as a temporary employee until I found permanent work. I enjoyed working for this company and hoped I would be put on as a permanent employee but that didn't happen.
good,Fun job with good people. Typical day is very busy being organized is a must.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company overall to work for. Even though they are big company they try to not make their employees only feel like a number. They recognize hard work. There is room for advancement and cross training opportunties.
good,I enjoy working at Wells Fargo. I'm just searching for a place I can make a difference.
good,"Even with the strict management and sometimes impossible-to-reach sales goals, working at Wells Fargo while I was obtaining my college education really helped me understand the ""real world"" of employment before most college students do."

good,It was an honor to work with Wells Fargo.  When I started at Wells Fargo it was a fun family oriented company as the years went on the company seemed to get more into the money making aspect of things and didn't care what it was taking away from their employees family time.  I learned a lot about banking and loans and enjoyed everyone that I worked with directly.  The company never hesitated to reward you for your sales and service.
good,"• Handle cash transactions while introducing customers to new services and products"
good,"Overall a good place to work for advancement."

good,"Management need some serious work.  I got to interact with new people, with regulars and learned some great selling skills."
good,"I really enjoy what I do as a personal banker. I enjoy working for a company who seems interested in putting their customers needs first. One of the main reasons I wanted to work for Wells is something John Stumpf said. He said, ""We want every team member to be able to say, “I chose the right company. I’m valued. I’m rewarded. I’m recognized. We work hard, but we have fun, too. I can improve my professional skills here. I can reach my career goals. I enjoy my work.”"

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,a typical day at work would consist of a fast paced enviroment. I learned a lot of material on a day to day basis. Everyday was a new day with new situations that I would have to problem solve. The work atmosphere was great thanks to amazing co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when customers weren't listening when they were upset. It was hard for me to communicate effectively when they were in a wrong state of mind. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had my customers come in that always came into the branch. They made me love what I do by the great positive energy they brought in. 
good,"Lead Teller and Customer Service Representative"
good,"Working at Wells Fargo provides a good platform for learning the banking industry as well as learning how to multi task in a highly stressful environment. The salary is average, and you are expected to fulfill the responsibilities of several different positions. This certainly did build character as well as help me to develop into a self sufficient, well rounded and knowledgeable employee.  My co-workers are good , hard working people and are a big reason why my day is enjoyable."
good,The company is very sales oriented. If you aren't looking to sale..look elsewhere.
good,"Overall I love Wells Fargo as a company."
good,"Wells has all of the resources needed to be a great place to work, but they seem to focus much more on growth rather than the success of its employees and customers."

good,"Create an environment oriented to trust, open communication, creative thinking, and cohesive team effort"
good,"a typical day at works includes answering the phone for close to 100 customers helping them with their accounts and finding a product or service to sell to them after servicing their call. On a daily basis you learn how to handle different personalities. Management scrutinize sales numbers throughout the day and expect all employees to hit their sales goals. The hardest part of the job for me is the sales, and the most enjoyable part of the job is helping people understand their accounts. "
good,"Busy high foot traffic fast paced envirinment, learnt all aspects of banking such as sales and customer service, my co-workers were helpful,best part of the job was meeting great customers and learning banking methods"

good,Loved my coworkers and bosses. lots of room to move up in the company if you are willing to put in the time.
good,when changes and /or updated training became effective managment and coworkers joined togerher to create a fun and bonded learning experience sharing knowledge one with the other.
good,"The hardest part of this job was having to sell banking products to each and every customer, even if you saw them on a daily basis, all while completing their transaction in under five minutes.  This was the banks mandatory time limit, anything over that, and you were not being efficient with your time or the customers.  Needless to say, I didn't enjoy this brand of customer service, it was too impersonal and pushy."
good,"A typical day at work is to service customer's request with their account information, handle escalated calls, coach team member, research and provide administrative support to management.

good,Good training but a tough business to start from scratch.  The toughest part is prospecting.  Co workers are great but home office employee can be tough to work with.
good,the most enjoyable part about my job is working with customer everyday. Collecting is a passion
good,"meet new people everyday"
good,Its a great job if you like to sit at a desk for 8 hours at a time. I suggest a gym member ship because its not natural to sit all day long

good,"-Team work driven environment "
good,"Wells Fargo was a family setting within the branched that I worked in> Believed in exceptional customer service and in there customers. Co-worked were great to work with and very helpful when needed. Management was a draw 50/50 with me....had 2 service managers a branch managers and 2 lead tellers than can talk service managers say if they werent around. just thought there was too many management at one time but if so at least be on the same page.For the most part i enjoyed my time at wells fargo, the environment i was in and loved my co workers. Teaches you a lot about money management, met different people and learned a little Spansh while i was there since the clients were mostly Spanish."
good,"Great Analyst program which allows you to learn the foundations of credit. The banking industry is highly regulated so working in credit requires a lot of reporting. The bank is VERY conservative and slow to react and does not pay as well as other competitors. "
good,very corporate company. not a good feel between coworkers. everybody is working for the man
good,"Walk into a full days of work before the day even begins to have the numerous advisors you work with continue to pile it on. You learn how to pace yourself, manage time, and organize yourself to make things easier. The Sales Assistants are very close and make the job fun. The hardest part of the jobs is the stress from being overworked and under appreciated. Most enjoyable is the relationships built with co-workers and amazing clients. "
good,very busy fast pace environment. time management is a must. i learned a lot about time management as there a lot of different functions.
good,"Overall, I was satisfied with my working experience at Wachovia Bank and Wells Fargo. Before and during the conversion, my work load was busy which I enjoyed. I had a good relationship with each of my co-workers, team leaders and managers. I learned and maintained my skills with various systems. Towards the ending of the conversion, my work load was very slow but we managed to stay busy with other tasks and assisted other departments. My only concern was there was not much room for advancement."
good,"The company had good benefits. The management was great until they changed it like it had been for 35years. The Wells World is very sales oriented.... which became very stressful when the branch started to slow down, "
good,"come in to work and pull up my personal task report and work my task report to the end of the day.  "
good,I enjoyed communicating approvals to home owners. The most difficult aspect of the position was adapting to the constant change.
good,"Great place to work. Excellent training, prepared you for the job."
good,company is very sales driven and production motivated. can be very stressful.
good,"Overall, Wells Fargo is a great company that provides many benefits to their employees. One of the downsides is their high expectations and almost unreasonable goals."

good,"1)Typical day at work consist of operations, meeting deadlines, department goals manage daily pipeline."
good,"A typical day at work included analyzing and resolving cited deficiencies; contacting home mortgage consultants and settlement agencies to assist in timely resolution. I learned to function on the job as a team player, assisting associates when needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to assure a resolution when much of the outcome was out of your hands (i.e. final inspections on homes, appraisals, etc.). Most enjoyable was knowing you were appreciated when a job was done well and you have reached a successful resolution to a problem."
good,I was able to get in the door with the mortgage industry. It was hard to be commission based only.
good,"100 calls of problem solving, critical thinking, and education of policy. I've learned how to communicate and diffuse hostile situations. The expectations by upper management are unrealistic but the ground floor continues to push the bar everyday. My co-workers are the reason I've stayed so long, the close knit atmosphere provides a family like situation. The hardest thing is knowing that the person you just let scream at you for a half hour could be responsible for your stats and job. The most enjoyable is my co-workers"
good,"The mortgage customer service department is a call center. If you can handle being on a queue all day then this place is for you. Day to day there are numerous policies being implemented with mortgage options, very informative and on most days you feel you are really helping customers finding the best mortgage options for them. To make the office environment fun and uplifting the managers put together motivating events or just to celebrate the quarter."
good,A typical day at work was fast pace and full of providing the very best customer service.
good,did transactions for customers and sold bank products. it has a great training program for people new to banking.

good,Similar to other banking businesses. Professional and enjoyed my time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Working in this fast paced call center is rewarding but can sometimes be overwhelming. The overall environment is pleasant and they try to make the experience fun. I have learned more sales techniques and have become quite successful with my sales goal. My co-workers were very supportive and friendly and genuinely made me feel like I was part of a team,"
good,Truly loved the small office environment. It was a great learning experience.
good,"A typical day is reviewing files for accuracy. Communicating with authorized parties to obtain additional required information and documents. Fellow co-workers are wonderful, hardworking people."

good,management was very good
good,Wells Fargo offered a friendly work environment that was high paced and provided employees with opportunities for advancement.
good,"It depends which department you work in. I work in closing you can't plan your day head of time. Any minute things can change from putting out a fire to jumping on calls. We work with many departments internally and all kinds of individual externally, so coordination and being organized plays a big role. The best way to fit into this role is to be flexible."
good,No much connection with their environment and employees. People seems nice.
good,Work is never dull at Wells Fargo. The management takes care of its employees.

Restocked liquor, restocking linens, set and stock silverware, and cleaned tables for arriving customers. Night duties included waste disposal, sanitizing floors and cleaning dishes for the next business day."
good,Good company
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, I like helping people. A typical day was focused on sales and getting customers to open accounts weather they needed or not was the tone set by management. I learned that people will sometimes accept an untruth. Management was not always fair in there decision making process.They often took advantage of customer who were not mentally stabled, just to get a sale. Favoritism was very prevalent. My co-workers were afraid of management. They expressed being intimidated by them. The hardest part of my job was after being employed for 11 years, being told that I was fired. I really enjoyed working with the customers to help then find solutions suited best for their financial needs."
good,It was a great bank to gain experience and knowledge. Now has become Wells Fargo.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"You are on the phone 90% of the day speaking with clients who are wanting to refinance their homes. You collect financial documentation for income verification, call employers for employment verification, and collect documentation if there are any issues with their title/deed for their home. I have learned a lot of new information regarding the mortgage industry when it comes to interest rates, escrow accounts and application processing. My co-workers are great to work with and be around; there are different personalities around that keep everyone going. The hardest part of my job is having to decline anyone of being able to refinance their home plus it can be a very stressful job given the goal and quotas that have to be met every month. The most enjoyable part of my job is speaking with clients after the entire refinance process is over and they let me know that they have thoroughly enjoyed their experience that I have given them."
good,"A typical day at work consist of phone calls for follow up with Customers and processors. Calling on new customers and working with Realotrs for additional business. Building relationships for future business. I have learned that the Mortgage business has changed a great deal from 5 years ago and with continual education I can make the process much easier for the customer and myself. I have a good repore with my co-workers. We bounce ideas and skills off each other and in doing so we have a great Teamwork attitude. The hardest part of the job is when a file doesn't make it to closing on time even though we have provided everything asked for in a timely manner and I have to call my customer to break the bad news. In doing so I have to keep the call positive so the customer stays calm. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a first time home buyer sits at the closing table and the ""American Dream"" of owning a home just happen for them and I helped make it happen."
good,"Typical day would consist of managing bulk loan deals to be scanned into the system, reviewed by underwriting, and bundled for sell review or placed in file storage."
good,I was not there long enough to give a fair review. I decided to just give 3 stars which falls in between. My assessment of the company
good,I learned at this company the ability to work fast and make sure you are detailed with your work as it involves customers finances.
good,"Bank account management including deposits, withdrawals, and cash handling."
good,"I was able to use each and every skill and bit of knowledge as a Financial Specialist while at Wachovia Bank. As a FS you completed banking transactions, completed loans, completed investment transactions, and much more financial services transactions."
good,Great workplace with a variety of products to service customers.
good,Temporary Assignment as assistant to accounting department.
good,I worked for Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) which was hard hit during the financial downturn in '08.
good,"My responsibilities at F.S.N.B. include prospecting for potential customers, opening customer accounts, processing customer paper work, updating and processing any maintenance on customer accounts, as well as taking teller transactions. I was also given the responsibility to assist in training peers when new duties were introduced. I was allowed to challenge myself with the wide variety of responsibilities I had to execute. I understood that doing my job correctly was a significant part of the company’s success."
good,"For a teller position, this was a really heavy selling job. I hated bugging customers about products that they had no interest in. The management would like you to try and sell to every person that comes in regardless of what they came in to do."
good,Interaction with fellow employees for reimbursement situations
good,"Your average day at the CIC call center consist of being on the phone for 8 hours taking inquiries from customers. Through out the day you may have quick team meetings and individual coaching to discuss the goals for each week and quarter. Its a very casual enviroment but very fast paced. There typically can be over 30-50 in calls that are in que when there is a rush. Even though it can be demanding, you have may have fellow co-workes to help you get through the day by making the enviroment a fun place. Management and non-management staff would create events and games to help motivate each other to meet thier goals."
good,"focuses on sales, so if that is your thing then you will love this job!"
good,A typical day involved reviewing and spreading customer financial information.
good,Typical work day is reviewing financial paperwork!
good,Wachovia/Wells Fargo was my first experience working at a bank..
good,"Very deadline oriented work environment with large volumes of incoming work, with all team members working in tandem to achieve daily objectives."
good,Lots to do. Everyone works overtime. Formal methodology followed.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"if you don't look into what your selling too much, you will do fine. I just couldn't sell products I didn't believe in."
good,"WFB is overall a good place to work at. I don't really like the hours, but I shouldn't complain at least I have a job and plus work is just five minutes away from home. =)"
good,Great Benefits some days are very long. This is a Sales job! Does include sales incentives. Work hard and you will advance.
good,"Daily, Monthly and Quarterly quotas. Great people, but the retail side of the bank has much to be desired."
good,Managed full service Retail Branch. Working for Wells Fargo has equipped me for the step in my career as a financial sales coach/leader. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help every customer. The part about my job I enjoy the most is developing my team to be the best at what they do. I also pride my ability to develop a culture in my banking centers that the client is first in everything we do. My saying is P.O.P (people over paper).
good,"Financial industry requires sales of banking products. As a CSSR, I was the front line of sales partnering with the tellers. Focus involved servicing existing customers accounts (high risk and confidentiality) and recommending new products relative to needs and acute listening skills. My goal was to provide customers (new and existing) with a positive interaction and results. Teamwork was crucial as I was the bridge between the bankers and the tellers. Having organizational skills and attention to detail ensured my day at the bank was profitable for me and and Wells Fargo. Profits were hard to obtain if we were not making calls to customers and pushing products. Our regional and especially store manager were all about the sales numbers versus the service. I was there to bring back the service and this was enjoyable and challenging. Quickly became accustom to traffic fluctuation and maximizing my day. Enjoyed greatly the legal requirements and training involved with banking."
good,A good company to work for but little opportunity for advancement.
good,Wells Fargo get repetitive after 2 years. The hardest part of my job is not letting everything get under my skin. Customers come in and tell you how to do your job or are on the phone. You get criticized more than you get praised.
good,I enjoyed the job packaging promotional items to send to bank branches.
good,"I worked for a manager who had absolutely NO EXPERIENCE as an underwriter. Totally unrealistic goals. Would not recommend this company to anyone if just for that reason alone. Other than that, it was the people I worked with that made working with that manager bearable."
good,I worked a four lane drive through. Loved the customers did not love the employees. Learned that most bank associates are very unhappy.
good,"Processing New Business Life Insurance Applications. Multiple carriers underwriting requirements. How to report to management and financial advisors - strong communication required. Working with multiple carriers, vendors and doctor's offices to complete the Underwriting requirements. Great Team to work with and a lot of variety."
good,One of those few companies that seem to treat employees better than customers. Not that that is a good thing.
good,"Bad management, un realistic priorities"
good,they are too much politics and they will squeeze you until you can not bring any sales for them.
good,"Prepare and process paperwork, handling client service issues, taking phone calls"
good,"Wells Fargo is a large corporation, and with that comes pros and cons. They compensate their employees well, both with pay and vacation time, but they expect a lot in return. They encourage continuing education and advancement. The hardest part of the job is juggling conflicting priorities and coordinating with many different areas. The teammembers are the best part of the job."
good,"Managed banking service agreements, develop, and advise clients on Wells Fargo Banking financial products."
good,Working in a fast paced environment finding the right solutions for customers. Providing excellent customer service working as a key member of a team. Recognizing referral opportunities and cross selling products and services. Always meeting and exceeding quarterly goals and helping team members to reach their goals. Also handling daily inbound calls from customers and making outbound calls.
good,A typical day at work would be making different types of transactions for personal and business accounts. Building and maintaining relationships with clients and cross sell multiple products that would benefit the client. Managers and co-workers were very helpful. In my opinion the hardest part was explaining to the customers the change in policies and why they cannot make a transaction the same way they have been making the transaction in the past.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"On a typical day I would sort the incoming mail, match documents, answer and prepare prepare daily outgoing physical mail. The management was too relaxed in my opinion bordering on unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was making sure I was able to get my mail out daily because I never knew what the volume may be for any given day."
good,"A typical day at work would be on the phones aswering questions by customers that call in regarding their bank accounts. What I learned was that there are many customers that have varrying issues with their bank accounts. Management was not so manageble about their duties and would just brush them off. The co-workers were excellent to work with, some were more knowledgeable than the managers. The hardest part of the job is that it can be mentally draining at the end of the day having to solve so many account issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help the customers that were in need."
good,You process customers transaction as well as sell products and services we have.
good,I enjoyed working for the company until they begin to be bought out. With change of the company came change for each department. I did not like the fact that tellers had to sell so much. Always asking customers the same thing became aggravating to the customers and it made us feel bad because we were required to do it. I also didn't like that they took away the bonuses. The hours were fine and I was able to help people which is something I enjoy doing.
good,A regular day consists of reviewing documents and contacting customers in regards to their loans and communicating information needed and mortgage loan statuses. Good co-worker at Wells Fargo but the work can get monotonous. The position is constantly changing in policies and procedures.
good,Was a nice place to work while they where open. Other than that a lot of emphesis on quotas.
good,Working for a call center like wells fargo is a lot to handle. You have to make sure that you are a good sales person because thats what this job focuses on. You have to have a good balance of everything if not you can lose your job.
good,It was every bit of what was to be expected entering the IT workforce.
good,"A typical day was based on a bunch of new and continuous customers with questions about their accounts or better ways to manage their accounts. I learned a lot about sales, which was a challenge at first. Things became a lot more comfortable when I understood the environment better."
good,I answer a high volume of calls in English and Spanish. The focus is to service the call correctly using quality customer skills and providing offers to customers on other products or services that will benefit them.
good,"very busy for a bamk felt like could be more organized. Learned alot about banking,management was ok could be trained more,co-worker were the best part of the job. The hardest part was selling, but i enjoyed the interation with the customers."
good,great place to work. nice people. good managers.
good,Great co-workers and work ethic within the organization. Wells Fargo is truly dedicated to the task at hand. Company has great time off benefits. Hardest part of the job is the day to day repetition of the grind.
good,A typical day would consist of helping customers open accounts. Servicing existing customers. Making outbound sales calls. Management was okay. Co-workers were always helpful and on the same page. Hardest part was to meet quotas. Enjoyed working with and helping customers.
good,I enjoyed this job. I had the privilege of working with great colleagues.
good,This position was very challenging and rewarding at the same time.
good,"I come into work and instantly I begin. I control all the mail and 11,000 Home mortgages. I catogorize all files alphabetically and keep a detailed database as to where every file is at, by team member and other various locations. I keep a structured enviroment to keep balance with all employees. My work directors are efficient and maintain communication, but the management needs work on this. My job is fast passed and can be stressful as I am needed by many people throughout the day. I am the only person allowed to control file movement so the pressure can be high, but this is why I like my position. I like the outline of being ""needed"" and because of this, it makes a common respect for one another. It drives me to do a exceptional at my work."
good,"Typical day at wells fargo for me would be running team huddles getting people ready for the day, learned how to cross sell products and interact with customers"

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great place to begin work in bank culture. Schedule adaptable for those working and going to school as well as rasing young families.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and satisfying the customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is selling products. Company is very big on selling products.
good,"Running a teller drawer which included making deposits, withdrawals, home loan payments, initiating term and rate changes for Certificates of Deposit, processing ATM Deposits."
good,"Fair company to work for, very sales oriented , must be highly organized and detail oriented"
good,Nice always busy! Been with the company for 13 years and I worked all 3 shifts. Great place to get started
good,"A typical day at work tends to be very busy, productive,and very competitive. I've learned over the years about lots of products and services that have helped me and customers to better our financial needs. I have grown alot over the years and have managed many individuals on my team, I have sat in on interivews/made schedules and have hosted huddles to map a typical focus day out. My coworkers are all a go getters and are always up for a challenge. The hardest part of my job at times is trying to please every customer with perfect customer service and to make sure they are in right products and have great services that fit there needs. The enjoyable part of my job is knowing I gave great service and my customers are satisfied."
good,I did not learn much! It was a very playful atmosphere. There was not very much room to grow unless you have been with the company for like 6 years or so
good,This company was new and managed to complete all there tasks
good,"fun place to work, moving to a new location is going to offer alot of new postitions."
good,"Great company to work, the hardest part of my job is leaving my kids"
good,The company as a whole is great. I would recommend Wells Fargo to a friend. High pace environment .
good,"A typical day at work is, on the phone as soon as I walk in. Phone calls are main about bank fees, and questions about their account. I have to handle the call in a timely fashion. I pay attention to details. Look for products that will benefit the customers needs and offer them to my customers. I have to set a daily goal of how many sales I can get . Management will sometimes go over a call and let you know how the call went. The calls are rated based on your active listening and product knowledge. My co worker are great and very understanding. The most hardest part is, not knowing what the customers rate your call. The most enjoyable part is making the customers happy"
good,"Over all it was a positive place to work, you were face to face for the whole day, great customer service"
good,I am more than happy to go over the details of my job on a phone or personal interview.
good,Handled the refinance process for customer's mortgages. A bit stress being on the phone all day but enjoyed working directly with clients.

good,"I process mails, letters and notices using pitney bowes inserting machines series 8, 8.5, 9, APS, FPS and MPS. I learned to multitask to meet production goal. The management and my co-workers are just okay. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I'm challenge to fix machine due to set up issues in order to reach my production goal."
good,This company developed and strenghtened my skills in customer service working with people by way of face-to-face contact.
good,Provided project and program management consulting services.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting customers and helping them their financial needs, it was a routine that involved a lot of repetition of the duties performed. I somewhat about sales while working at the company. The management could improved but the problem comes from people/management at the top of the pyramid. The co-workers were the only part of the job that made the job a little more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was to meet the high sales expectations."
good,I enjoyed working in teams and the training was awesome. Really great trainers and team coaches
good,"A typical day at work is providing a great customer service to customer, balancing a cash drawer and the vault. I have learned alot about the banking industry as well as how to cross sell products. The moste enjoyable part of my job is helping customers understand their checking accounts and finding better opportunties for them."
good,What I loved most was the casual dress environment that made wardrobe selection easy everyday; on-site cafeteria; extremely professional co-workers that never hesitated to help.
good,They have good Benifits but very Corprate in relation to how they treat thier people
good,High sales requirements at Wells Fargo. Managers are hard working and create a very high stress environment for the employees.
good,"• Efficiently handle large, complex high-priority customer/commercial bank transactions for deposits, withdrawals, official checks, money orders, bonds, international wire transfers"
good,"Highest in my team to sell products and services and achieve aggressive sales goal which are measured daily, quotes. We also handle each customer with a friendly courteous touch while following strict procedures for handling various types of inquiries. Also taking care of the customer banking concern which can include some escalated issues."
good,I have a lot of customer interactions and customer issue resolutions at work
good,Wells Fargo was a very good job with great benefits. The scheduling however is stressful and non flexible.
good,I learned to deal with many different types of people every day it was a learning experience. And the importance of saving money and how to manage your money.
good,"High pace sales environment, with high turnover. I would not work for them again."
good,"Handled customer concerns with their mortgage , gave workout options and collected mortgage payments stressful environment , nice people to work with"
good,"My job function as a Teller is to provide ""top notch"" customer service and acknowledgment about each one of Wells Fargos banking products, As a teller I really enjoy interacting with customers on a day-to-day basis and and ilke being able to help each customer with there financial needs and services. One of the most important parts of dealing with the public is to always smile and hve a positive attitude, The customers like to see that you love what your doing and that you are eager to help them."
good,"Very good training program, take 80-100 calls per day, Pay is good, Getting assistance on calls was slow, Management needed more cohesion and a better method of contact if you had a escalation call."
good,"When entering the company I enjoyed my time as a teller. After six months at that position I was promoted to a personal banker. The people I worked with are amazing except management. The schedules are always made at the last minute and can change the day of. Which is difficult for a person who maybe pursuing a degree or has a family at home that they must care for. There is also entirely too much personal problems between people in certain branches which tarnishes the professional image when at work. Plus the company keeps making changes to their products which is pushing away people who don't have as much as higher class customers. Making it hard to help every single customer succeed financially,"
good,I enjoyed working for the company as a whole. I learned how to manage and coach employees to reach goals. I met and exceeded sales goals. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"Busy, goal oriented, productive, fun, very diverse environment, get to meet all different types of individual everyday."
good,"I work there for 25 years and I real like my job,I made friends and we still call and talk now. The 25 years there was good for me."
good,Many rewarding times and some challenging ones throughout the years.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,* Consistently have to be alert to give best customer service
good,"High call volumes with growing expectations was a daily part of the job requirement. Management watched well, those under them and offered several solutions to more complex problems. The thing I enjoyed most about the job was the people you helped, unfortunately this was sometimes the worst part of the job, but overall you're constantly building a repertoire with those you work with an the clientele base."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo consists of logging into systems and immediately begin taking calls. We use a phone system that allows calls to be routed from all over the country. It is only an inbound call center. Each call can vary from balance inquiries to disputes of charges to tax related questions. Each call varies the amount of stress and duration of the call. Because each scenario is different for each call each phone banker is measured based on a series of metrics. The most important metrics is Average Handle Time, Quality Assurance, Referral Rate, and Compliance (time on the phone)."
good,"Great company to work for while it lasted, but it is no longer in business"
good,Stressful and demanding. Love the people i work with but sometimes not who i work for. Very demanding sales
good,"In the customer support area, the mantra is Customer Service is Sales and Sales is Customer Service. The sales goals required by the company make this position even more stressful than it should be. Other than that, I love my customers and co workers. I give 300% every single day. Compensation is very low for what we do. My last raise was ten cents per hour, even with an excellent review."
good,A typical day would spend at my desk skip tracing delinquent customers via all types of skip tracing tools and software.
good,if your good at meeting your quota each quarter you can do anything.
good,As a teller sales and customer service would be the most important thing to focus on and assuring that my cash drawer balance daily. My co-workers worked as a team and always made work a fun environment.The part I found difficult with this position was the sales part of it. The most enjoyable part was meeting so many different people and building a relationship with some of the customers. I learned to have patience with so many different personalities.
good,"Although I learned a great deal about banking and finance, there was little room for advancement. Management was often overworked and unhelpful ie little support in dealing with difficult/complex issues and/or angry customers."
good,"Highly personable professional with over five years of experience in account management, processing and call-center operations within the insurance, financial, and mortgage industries"
good,"This is a High sales job! Apart from dealing with alot of cash and sales sales sales and multi tasking, you must be detailed oriented! Quarterly sales and service surveys inncentives can be earned! Southern oregon market is a joke! You need to kiss you know what for a promotion! Scheduling at some branches is terrible! Tellers are the face of the bank and are the least paid!"
good,I had many good years in operations and was promoted quickly. Then I made the biggest mistake of my career by accepting a job as a personal banker in a branch. It's like working as a car salesman. You have to pressure people and get them into products they dont need.
good,"I liked working at Wells Fargo, i have been a customer long before i started working there. Unfortunatly i think I rather keep beong a customer then employee."
good,I enjoyed working for this company but just don't work in Lockbox. They are treated like slaves.
good,"I wouldn't like to speak much about a job I felt wasn't me because of my career choice but if finance is your major then you might enjoy yourself. From what I've experienced you are constantly hounded to get everyone and anyone over to a banker and for no legitimate reason other then selling them products. Constantly threatened to get ""solutions"" which are products or your job is on the line. Not my cup of tea, from what I've noticed even the customers hate getting solicited every time they come in. Decent pay but when I started 2 years ago it seemed like the work I did was equal with my pay, not anymore by literally multiplying the work I have to do at least by three."
good,"once you get there , work begins and it is learning and growing,"
good,Co-workers/Peers were wonderful to work with
good,Working for this company was a great fit for increasing skills. I feel that this was one of the toughest position i have worked.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Was very stressful trying to get customers interested in opening new accounts. Had sales goals that were impossible to reach.
good,A typical day would include setting up cases for ER issues. Great team of co-workers but management was a little too hands on.
good,I enjoyed learning how ATMs worked and enjoyed the challenge of getting the new processes to work on the ATMs.
good,"management was decent, didnt enjoy how platform and tellers weren't involved with eachother"
good,Their training is very extensive due to all the different products they offer.
good,Large company with diverse departments. It depends on the division you are in. Retail banking now in most corporations isn't the best place to be.
good,"I would say the best way to get promoted in this company is by the people you know not the way you work. You can be the best employee and get as many closings done as possible, but if you're not in good with the manager(s) you won't excel. I was with the company for a little over 3 years, since I started as a temporary employee, I have been discriminated against. The departments don't know what the other departments are doing, and the employees won't even do business with the company because the company treats customers better than their workers. Being there for 3 years have been nothing but stress, I was diagnosed with minor depression, and have anxiety and panic attacks at work. Even if you're there everyday, and working overtime, the managers won't acknowledge the hard work you do, and put in."
good,Filed and reviewed real estate loans and uploaded information into Wells Fargo computer system.
good,Greet and seat customers.
good,"Typical work day starts with processing canceled, reinstated, or changed carrier policies."
good,I have been able to grow with the company for over 10 years. Scheduling has been flexible and I have made many friends.
good,"Everyone who works here has a professional attitude. Most co-workers are creative and fun to work with. Managers can and will put pressure on sales quotas, however must quotas are not unreasonable. Advancement is hard to come by."
good,"Besides the pay, benefits, and co-workers, Wells Fargo is a horrible place to work. The management is unprofessional and don't know how to do their jobs. Additionally, there is not much room for advancement."
good,"The Data warehouse testing group of Wellsfargo Advisors deals with the complete scope of applications for retail banking starting from web / desktop applications to support new accounts for new customers which are offered with a very vast options of products, online banking, SQL reports, internal web applications, process automations and application maintenance."
good,Over accentuates sales goals and neglects customer needs. Management is no more knowledgeable than employees
good,For me sales was too much pressure specially when I care about my customers more than offer a product they dont need.
good,"manage accounts and banking needs, as well as satisfy customers using customer service scripting, meet daily goals."
good,The management's focus was on the opening of accounts. Most activities and promotions were a means to accomplish this primary goal.
good,"Project load was very heavy, but training received to complete tasks was second to none. Management changed too much for consistency."
good,Wells Fargo is a leader in the industry. Benefits package is good but just doesn't start immediately upon hire.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Company focus is CUSTOMERS FIRST! if you like a customer oriented atmosphere than this is the job for you but if you have a non-pushover personality then I say consider otherwise..
good,"After 16 years with Wells Fargo, I don't think I would ever go back. Your job is always on the line if you don't meet your sales goals. Its not just being a teller any more."
good,"In past years this company had more of a team orientation. Unfortunately, that environment no longer exists."
good,"No Comment, I was at Wells Fargo for a limited time and the company as a whole is a nice place to work"
good,Great company to work for. Hard to make your numbers.Very sales oriented.
good,Minneapolis RCG team is being displaced as the company consolidates operations in St Louis. As part of this displaced team I am understandably rating Wells very low
good,Very family orientated Its a good pace to work for well it was they have changed to Wells Fargo now so i don't know if it is the same.
good,"I thought I could be extraordinarily successful with Wells Fargo. Unfortunately, I got linked with the wrong Branch Manager. He has been demoted twice."
good,"It got to the point where you couldn't be yourself, enjoy chatting with your customers and processing their transactions any longer. It was all sales driven with quotas, competition among ""team members"", and pressure on middle management."
good,"As a teller you are also rated by the amount of referrals for new accounts. This includes giving them information on family and friends. They also use telephone surveys to rate your preformance If you don't get score 100% you are rated ""0"". If you get 24 points out of a possible 25 it is still a zero."
good,The Branch where I worked was a laid back easy environment.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo, the staff was friendly and I gained a lot of knowledge through using their training courses and hands on training."
good,This is one of the most un productive work environments i could imagine to be in. Management is always shooting themselves in the foot with bad practices which falls back on the employees. Currently working more than 50 hours a week with another required 5 hours on Saturdays. I would never suggest this company to a friend or family member for employment.
good,Very emotional demanding on employees without proper training. Customers that call are very rude and demanding that could be bearable if not for the call metrics that need to be hit or you would receive a demerit.
good,I enjoyed the majority of my career until the end. The company got into trouble with a bad sales culture that made it's way to the east coast. Leaving worked out for the best.
good,"This company is going through very difficult times and as a previous employee, it was limiting my goals and ambitions. Wells Fargo has been laying off individuals as they redesigned their priorities."
good,I can't speak for all areas of the business but bankers are not trained enough before they are faced with customers. The pay is ok and the benefits are great. Training is not much of a priority but that could just be in the area of business that I am in.
good,typical day was either busy or dead. Management had unrealistic goals for customer satisfaction and sales. Management clearly showing favoritism. most enjoyable part is the pay is slightly above minimum wage and having sundays off.
good,"This is a national bank that had once outage in a server farm, and took every one off-line. They are implementing new protocols to prevent this in the future. The last CEO resigned under a cloud. The new CEO is much better. Programming security should be improved, but at least there have been no (to my knowledge) major data breaches. I worked as a contractor, so I do not really know what it is like to be an employee. One good thing: we got off all banking holidays!"
good,"Wells had great benefits. Unfortunately, the environment that being so sales driven creates is toxic. Management no longer sees the hardworking staff that provides excellent service as an asset. You were valued by the numbers that you provided."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A good  bank and place to work but there is no room for financial mistakes. a long time teller got terminated for one loss because of a transaction that was set as a withdrawal instead of a deposit. She had been there for 6 years and was immediately terminated.
good,"Wells Fargo was a decent job for someone to begin a professional career.  There is a lot of customer service, sales, account management, and relationship building that develops."
good,"The best place to work , I have learnt many things and I can able to manage the work life so balanced."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for, it offers you a stable job as long as you do everything that is required on your part. They do not pressure you on selling but they give you hints to do it anyway. Whis is fine because they have to make their money some how. The bank is structured good and they have a good system going on. The only thing I can provide feedback is the way the company treats the employees. All the managers I have had were always great and ready to make me grow. However from corporate, it would be nice if team members were more valued. I never had any problems with Wells Fargo, I found a better opportunity."
good,Love the company and benefits but don’t really like the internal hiring process for moving to higher positions. In branch management really lacks and no real teamwork.
good,"Like any call center. Training is definitely well organized to help you once you are doing your duties. Spanish speaking agents do not get as many choices for shifts as English speaking agents. No opportunity to work from home.  Dealing with customers, no doubt about it."
good,Has a good work life balance. Career advancement is ok but not that great. Benefits are good. Salary reviews and raise not that great. Social work culture is pretty good.
good,"A typical day at work for a part timer was very stressful, not enough opportunities to grow with the company. Wells Fargo is very strict when it comes to policies and procedures but does not apply the same law for every employee."
good,No comments at this time. Branch Manager was difficult at the times her disposition was not pleasant. The service manager was awesome which he is now a branch manager. He was very helpful.
good,"This was a goal driven position, with many policies and procedures, which I enjoyed. I also enjoyed attending job fairs and working with others. The managers I supported were knowledgeable."
good,Their a good company to work for and have great benefits. They have gone thought 2 re-org since I've been there. Pay is good. They maybe be going thought another re-org soon.
good,"Lenient with lateness, friendly but constructive supervisors, ability to chat with peers during slow periods. Can be stressful on the eyes if relying on computer use."
good,"Too much managerial restructuring as of late, makes employees uneasy.  Most of the people are wonderful to work with and very helpful/accommodating.  I do like that WF supports a work/life balance."
good,"Very traditional, not a good place for technical people because your manager or the boss of your manager are probably business man, know nothing about tech. So the management is not good for tech guys"
good,"Some management was great, some was horrendous. Clearly defined job duties. Exceptional training, I have never had better training than I did when I was here. They really are willing to teach you almost anything you want to know."
good,Great group of professionals to work with in the mortgage industry. On-going training is good.  Colleagues were extremely knowledgeable and I learned a lot.
good,It could have been a better workplace if they had proper management. Now I’m sure a lot has changed. It was kind of an unfair work environment because the management was not following rules and it fell on all the employees.
good,"I felt like my manager did not posses the skills to manage a team. She was too immature and I had no respect for her. "
good,"The company was going through some difficulties at the time of my employment,  which made my job harder, as customers were rather upset at times. I would do my very best to calm them and get through the process. Majority of the time I was successful."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was ok. It was all i knew when i was going to college Got promoted several times which was a positive; however, didn't see a future in working their."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I have no further comments at this time. you do work Saturdays. "
good,"I really enjoyed the team I was first a part of but, as is common in the banking environment they reorganize and cut roles every 5 years. This shifts dynamics and how work is done for about 18 months. That can be really frustrating for getting results. Find a good manager and you can peacefully do work and get support learning and growing. Advancement opportunities are rare depending on group you work in."
good,"I have been at Wells Fargo (Wachovia/AG Edwards) for 31 years. Many changes are happening in the Risk space due to the current environment."
good,An alright place to work at. Great people to work with but the process to work their was a struggle. They need better recruiters. I didn't hear back from the recruiter for months. Quicker responses from management.
good,"Every day was always different in figuring out how to solve problems.   The huge company presented opportunity to move around, but could also be very siloed."
good,Great company excellent benefits. Management can sometimes need additional training as well as sensitivity to the nature of their employees. Room for growth and advancement.
good,"I would give more stars, I absolutely LOVE the team members that I have, the culture is awesome and there are so many great benefits with the company. HOWEVER! Due to certain higher management, it has been a nightmare working there. These certain people have stressed out Branch out to the point that we are all scared to do anything so we do not lose our jobs. My coworkers are family to me as well as my customers. There was once a time that it did not even feel like work, but now it is not a healthy work environment due to certain management."
good,The culture of the job is a bit stressful but very relaxed. The management team varies ane I can only talk about mine and she was unyielding and doesn't help you to improve but I will not say that of all management.
good,"The rules are strict unless it's for management (Unless the company doesn't like the manager then they'll get fired over the littlest things)"
good,"they like to keep you on your feet, this company has great benefits but you are just a cog in a huge operation. If you are lucky, you will move up the ladder. If you are not, you can be stuck doing the same thing daily for years."
good,"Very Intense Non-Stop work.  Little Recognition and insufficient tools for job.  Pay was ok, benefits good.  Worked at Wells for 10 years.  Morale was an issue when I left, the scandal and associated changes were tough to swallow for many."
good,"Working for a financial institution is very rewarding. It starts with community involvement. You encounter many people that live in the area, that trust you. This is their hard earned money that you are dealing with from day to day. The company had values that empowered you to display behaviors and characteristics that you learn throughout life in a good way. Building rapports, problem solving, making someone's day are just to name a few."
good,This sales jobs was really good. We spent most of the day talking to potential customers and educating them. It was not hard and I enjoyed working for this company.
good,"Typical day of work consisted of answering and helping a large amount of our clients over the phone."
good,"Overall is a great company to work for but management and atmosphere were really bad! Benefits are great, bonuses not too good for those on the teller side."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work.  It provided me the opportunity and skills to advance my presuit in management.  I went from an entry level position to middle management (5 promotions) in only 5 short years.  This was under the tutelage of great leaders who took the time to coach, attract and retain top talent in the industry..  After the market crash in late 2007, the business changed along with the morale due to many middle and upper management lay offs.  The business just didn't seem the same after that in regards to the treatment of team members.  Although they value their team members,  I believe they missed the mark on how they deployed the layoff's and handled misplaced team members during the crash."
good,"Assisting customer with their day to day finances. "
good,"While I liked the overall culture of the small team I worked with, their drive for sales led to micromanaging and activity that wasn't always ethical. Even as a bank teller, you're expected to have a sales mindset which is difficult to maintain while delivering good customer service. They also have strict regulations that can get you fired for easy-to-make mistakes."
good,"The job is not bad but managers make it worse than what it already is. Never give schedules in advance, no breaks, if pto is required it has to be put in 2-3 weeks in advance otherwise it’s an unscheduled pto absence and counts against you."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Job was good until several months before they closed the office.  Liked helping the customers.  More and more was piled on daily duties until impossible to keep up and then the work was sent to other sites. On a typical day, you would come in, sign in the computer and phone. Start taking incoming calls, and process the notes and paperwork between calls to send he files to the underwriter.  Monitor their plan activity (if approved for a plan to catch up the mortgage) and make follow up calls as needed."
good,Working for Wells Fargo is okay. The benefits is great. Every team I've been apart of has had a family feel. You have to know someone or kiss butt just to advance in the company. There's not much benefits for those who commute such as myself. I commute 200 miles a day and there is no payback for such a commute.
good,"The company is going through a consolidation and i may lose my job soon. When the consolidation is over, hopefully not too many jobs are sacrificed. not much else to say."
good,"While the work is mostly rewarding, sometimes it is difficult to manage one's workload and balance the many meetings scheduled on any given day. Conference calls and meetings are unwieldy at times due to the large number of participants."
good,"The job is really stressful and very demanding of keeping your numbers below a certain level. The management changes frequently and the teams, so it is hard to keep up with everything. The great thing about the job is the pay rate."
good,"Wells Fargo was my first corporate job, I learned a lot and it jumped started my career.  There were opportunities for growth, furthering learning was important, but management was poor.  It created a toxic environment of burned out employees who were over worked and under paid during the worst time of the century."
good,"You must be willing to work long hard hours ."
good,Great potential for the company but the Leadership is too committed to preserving their history and outdated policies and culture. The insurance business has now been sold.
good,I really did love working for wells fargo just wasn't willing to move out of Alaska or become a teller...I liked being in the backroom and helping the customers that way with their deposits
good,"typical days consist of assisting customers and learning new rules and policies, software and info. With  opportunities for fun team and workplace outtings."
good,"Not a bad company overall, but I feel the pay is less than other companies and it's hard to advance.  The benefits are lower than what was offered from the previous mergers."
good,"The company is unstable. my job along with many others are being sent offshore to India."
good,"The typical day sees me arrive at 8, and once you log in its off to the races. You are reviewing files at this job, so when your ready to go that is what you will be doing every day."
good,"A typical day involves, proposal, presentation, partner meetings, pipeline reviews, internal calls etc. Wells Fargo provides excellent training courses. Upon my arrival, I have been able to attend over 6 different Sales related courses, including Client Messaging, Challenger Selling, Working Capital along with many others. "
good,Working there was okay. It was an average day in an office. Training takes  two weeks but after the first couple of days you'll get the hang of it. Everyone starts off as a temp. and after three months the management re-evaluates you to see if they want to keep you.
good,"it was a learning experience and a short term place that was told to be long term possible. The location is like a campus and has doctors, dentist, eyecare, etc on location."
good,N/A nothing to really say about it. It’s a nice job if you can deal with mortgage & no benefits. If your hired through an agency there are no benefits.
good,"Working with great people make the job fun. Management need to be more open with the employees and make them feel as team, and family. Managers needs to have more fairness."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great pay and Great benefits, that's the key here. This company expects overtime in my experience, but they pay well.  You cannot beat the benefits but there are cons to the environment, pressure, management."
good,Some interesting work. Able to work from home. Learned inner working of a major bank and also gained exposure to digital marking data and analytics which is an interesting area
good,Great place to work great culture love volunteering and meeting such wonderful individuals in the workplace daily!  Ive been with the company for a couple of years.
good,"You will be expected to generate your own work in an environment where there is no internet or phone data access. Think that over before you commit, if you aren't used to generating the time you spend during the day outside of your phone or the internet it can be excruciating."
good,Wells Fargo is a friendly work environment for anyone who wishes to work for them. They offer PTO and financial assistance in tough times. As well if you had a school schedule they will help accommodate you the best they can.
good,"I really enjoyed interacting with customers, but my managers put sales pressure on us and if we didn't meet their expectations they did not offer promotions. They would always say that we wanted to focus on helping the customers, but if you didn't help them by giving them additional products then it didn't really matter. Management also played favorites with previous employees and friends when it came to promotions. The pay was alright but the benefits were great."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work , being a bank it is a bit conservative when it comes to technology and only adapts something after it has been tried and tested. The motto "" we are too big to fail "" is ingrained in every employee and the the company works to achieve the goal as a collective unit."
good,"The time spent at Wells Fargo was an overall pleasant experience. There was a good amount of floor support and most of them were absolutely wonderful. When you need help more often than not you receive it. While I enjoyed most of the job, there were some downfalls. The direct supervisors of the agents were very much arrogant and acted as though they did not want to deal with most agents. This was the case for most supervisors except a select few, which luckily I had one of them at one point. Everything is always changing as with most call centers. The best part of working here was the pay upgrade."
good,They try to get the most out of the least amount of people.  If you do a great job you get more work.  If you don't do well your work is shuffled to those who excel.
good,Great pay and benefits. Typical call center environment. Would recommend as a good company. Defined and achievable goals set for employees. Casual work environment
good,"too many Chiefs not enough Indians nothing else to say please stop."
good,Job was a good experience. Had to transfer due to family emergency and company was respectful and prompt with transfer. Helped me earn the experience and some license that I use everyday.
good,"They have good training. Good place to start as a teller/banker. I had an amazing manager such as a branch manager. The team I worked with was also amazing! I had an amazing experience, learned so much."
good,"At first it seemed like an exciting  job, but the manager at the branch I worked at expected to be super fast and have everything down when I had only been there 3 weeks after my training. The managers made me feel useless and bring me down with their snarky comments. I’m hoping it was just at the branch I worked at. I did not enjoy working there at all."
good,"Overall pleasant and professional.  Lots of middle-aged employees who have worked there for many years.  You can definitely spend your whole career with the company.  You may get laid off now and then, but once you've been on the stagecoach, you can usually get back on."
good,"Must be able to sell anything and everything you can find to a customer or you will get written up. "
good,I would never work here again. It was a horrible experience from the day I interviewed being told to go to the wrong building and it is like a college campus.
good,"Sales culture was too much. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I had just turned 18 years old when I started working for the company, however, over the 3 and a half years that I was committed to this culture, I began to see their ethics change. It transitioned from a great job opportunity with a vibrant future to cutthroat competition, and I didn't see the opportunity for growth that I once did. I still value the opportunity extremely, but the position and company was no longer serving my best interest."
good,"Apply to this job with the knowledge that advancement within the company may not be achievable. Don't get your heart set on getting promoted to leadership positions. It's competitive. Be content with being a phone banker (or other entry level job) when you apply, because most likely that's all you'll be for a long time. If you get further, then great."
good,Overall I enjoyed working there. Wells Fargo got into some trouble with pressuring their employees to make sales. This damaged their reputation. However they are doing what they can to rectify it and employees no longer have that pressure.
good,"My location is a heavy and busy branch. Diverse clientele, thats for sure. the hardest part of the job is putting yourself out there and trying to do many things at once to make sure everything runs smoothly and it not being noticed by management."
good,"I enjoyed the individuals that I worked with. When applying for advancement opportunities, I was constantly overlooked and never acknowledged that I even applied. "
good,"5 day work week with own time after hours"
good,Wells Fargo was a great company to work for for the mortgage program I was writing for. Great employees to. It made it a lot easier when everything had a process to get loans completed
good,Depending on your job position. There is a morning huddle / review of the branches goals and agenda for the day. Mostly positive and sales oriented. It also depends on demographics for the culture experience. Customer service is one of the biggest parts of your job and if your not good in that area it could be the hardest part of your job. You have to be able to reach all people.
good,"My department has too much work and to few people to do it. Leads to a lot of long days. We keep getting promised more help, but it never happens. Management has added an approval layer that doesn't approve anything, so we never get to update production."
good,"Okay place to work. They talk work life balance, but it's not followed nor driven by leadership. Trying to boil the ocean vs developing strategic road-map."
good,"A typical day at work was monotonous. I sat in a cube all day and looked at a computer. I loved my team and supervisor, but I did not feel that there was a lot of room for growth."
good,"It was well structured and they did have extensive training, the only thing I can really say is being a single parent did not mix well with working for Wells Fargo's call center.  There was no flexibility during training and I understand why, but when you have two children who become sick and you yourself end up sick in the hospital, it is a little stressful worrying whether you are going to still have a job going into work every day.  Overall the environment is positive and supportive."
good,"This is a Call Center job doing customer service for the bank. Understand that people WILL yell and be mean and every other bad thing u can think of. Money makes people very anxious. Also, there is almost no time between calls. so on average, u are having over 120 calls per day...doing mostly the same thing...and then there's the management. "
good,"Pay, bonus, personal time off, sick time and benefits are great. But in some branches management needs a lot of improvement and monitoring, or REPLACEMENT"
good,"It used to be a fast paced environment with stressful sales goals, however they have changed since acquiring a new CEO. The benefits are competitive. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard."
good,"Wells Fargo has lost it.  Executives should get rid of those mid-level Executives, Region/Regional, and DMs that created and followed the sales culture and practices that got the company into deep trouble as they benefited from those games and are in the position they are now because of them.  As they try to clean up their act, they are punishing those without power for something their management push them to do and rewarding those who created the issues.  HR/Employee Relations need to be accounted for passing information over and creating a retaliatory environment."
good,Nothing to Say Here I'm just looking for new opportunity and growth. Wells fargo is one of the highest paid banks when it comes to its employees that I have found
good,"Not much to say, it was a nice work place for a few years and then a lot of awful issues happened. "
good,"We had a small but great team with little turn over for a long, long period of time.  This is the reason I stayed at this company in this position for so long."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"They are primarily relying on contract jobs. All FTE positions are still for those who were still there before the late 2016 scandal."
good,"Very cliquey, like high school. It's obvious who the favorites are. Managers do very little in resolving conflict with that 'one person' everyone has a difficult time with."
good,The manager over the tellers was less than effective. Would not handle irate customers at all and would let other employees do as they please and not enforce any discipline actions when needed.
good,"Not only do you have to be responsible for tens of thousands of dollars, you have to sell products to people how either have bad credit or have a lot of accounts already. Co-workers were friendly."
good,"Good Work Place and good management"
good,The culture is a good mix and work life balance is ok. Didn't like the work structure Having to work on Sundays isn't something I like doing because of reglious background.
good,"I love the people I work with in my department, but the pay has me looking elsewhere, unfortunately. Great volunteering opportunities and paid time off."
good,The particular group that I worked or was completed neglected by management.No structure. No strategy.No guidance. WE were told deadlines and encouraged to lean on our peers for trainng.
good,"Learned a lot from the FA who dealt with high-end clients."
good,"Flexible working hours and remote, driving for long hours about 3500km a month."
good,"Very friendly, Staff is very respectful. Manager are very helpful and supported. Training is giving very intense and long but helpful. Enjoy working at Wells Fargo"
good,"Great place to work for overall, not the greatest place when it comes to work/ home life balance.  Management not sympathetic at all when children are sit. Great benefits and training programs"
good,"Well rounded company that offers a lot of financial services to their customers. Whether your working on the retail side or the corporate side of banking, the company is consistent in their vision to succeed."
good,Company did not create extensive  career advancement and growth. Decent work life balance however salary was not consistent with area of living. Very.
good,"I start my day with a plan set in place of what I want to accomplish for the day and how I can build my customer base by making outgoing calls to my contact events and outbound leads for the day to have set appointments come in. I assist customers with all financial needs and issues they may be having with their accounts. I provide friendly customer service and multi-task with uncovering needs and taking care of what the customer initially came in for. I open new checking/ savings accounts, apply customers for personal or business loans, lines of credit, and credit cards. I assist tellers with overrides and buying/selling cash to the vault and with the daily vault balancing. I keep up with my daily outcomes and have a goal set weekly of what I need to strive to get by the end of the week far as credit applications, new dollars coming into the bank by appointments set, and referrals sent by myself to the Business Banking department, Mortgage Representatives, and Financial Advisor. I also work on daily risk task such as reading over policy and procedures to make sure I'm doing correct procedures for Wells Fargo customers. I work very hard to make sure I reach my goals every week and have successful outcomes to report to my manager. I strive to make sure I am helping my customers with all of their financial needs and doing everything right the first time. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and helping provide my knowledge to someone whom may want to build credit, consolidate debt,  buy a new home, or start a business. I love to be able to help customers in"
good,"Best part of Wells Fargo was the amount of paid time off! "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would be having the ability to help our customers save their homes from foreclosure. Wells Fargo does a fantastic job finding resolution to support our customer's needs and making it right when an error has occurred. I respect this focus that they diligently map for the team members. This says a lot about the company as a whole.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I was happy in my job, Had a good boss who was available and committed to guiding his team. Good volunteer program and team member networks. Good emphasis on diversity and inclusion.  Enjoyed working with a team most of all."
good,Depends on your manager. Can be a good spot to learn customer service and sales skills. You have the stability of a corporate company behind you but if you want to leave the branch it is hard.
good,Wells Fargo is a decent place to work if you don't mind bureaucracy. Senior management seems to be stuck in the old ways with difficulty implementing new ideas seamlessly.
good,"Company is steady and solid, but is not equipped nor prepared to change fast to meet market or customer needs,. It is bureaucratic and extremely risk-adverse to try or embrace something new. Poor customer centric and minimal investment on innovation and technology."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work at if the manager is understanding and proactively seeking for its subordinates well being. I love working here. My department is head by an extraordinary boss lady.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work, however the salaries could be a little more competitive with other companies in the industry.  Would also like to see better incentives for the team members who actually perform the day to day processes to keep team members engaged and feeling great about coming to work.  The benefits increase every year yet sometimes the pay isn't as great even if you have years of experience."
good,Was difficult to get out of a contractor analyst role and into a full time role.  Was a great opportunity for 8-9 months but eventually went somewhere else when it became apparent it would take months if not years to get to full time employee status.
good,"Things have changed since I worked at WF. But when I did, it was full time and very stressful. Take the job if you need to. I don't recommend staying at a teller position for very long. If you stay there, then work up to banker, manager, etc. It's hard work but it can  be done. "
good,A lot of positions are heavily production driven and was inflexible.  Management was driven to micro manage based on bank goals.  No room for work life balance.
good,"Found Wells Fargo to be a very structured company, environment. Very little autonomy at the time I was there."
good,Work your way up the in the company! Make the goals and you'll be set. you have the opportunity to make money off of sales. Great for a sales person!!
good,I enjoyed the work I did at Wells.  Because of the environment my peers became less team oriented and more competitive.  Loved my manager but she was often restricted in what she would allow us to do because of the corporate policies and culture.
good,Hard to advance from entry level. Extreme micro management . Training was fun and motivating. Hard transition from training to being on the phones. Way more isolation from employees on the floor. Hard to meet metrics for bonus. Fun employees and incentives/activities for top performers
good,Upper management was not to helpful on development of bankers and tellers. Not all upper management was like that but it was hard to advance to different role when I was working there
good,"very slow underwriting and processing times,"
good,"disclaimer: i was a contract employee on a 6-12 month contract to hire."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I have no complaints of the work place. Well Fargo provided all the tools needed to be able to do my job. Management was good because you would get weekly updates on how you are doing.
good,Worked from call center customer service to Sr.Business Relationship Manager and Investment Advisor. Called on existing and potential business clients on the phone or in person.
good,"I learned alot of how a typical mortgage process works and how to assist customers in the area of payoffs, escrow and all other areas of customer service."
good,"Overall the company is a good company they seem to care about employees offering tuition reimbursement and 401k match with good healthbenefits, however, I experienced extreme stress when working as a teller for Wells Fargo while in college. Management seemed to only care about how much you cross sold per shift. They were constantly on your case. They would do observations to let you know how you are doing and areas of improvement and what they can do to help you but instead of helping it seemed they only cared about you meeting their goals. I had a branch manager even suggest to advise customers to open secondary accounts to protect themselves from fraud or as spending accounts,which if it had came from a genuine caring place I wouldn't have mind at all but all they wanted was to meet their goals and it seemed like they would do whatever it took to do so which did not agree with my personal ethics therefore I decided to resign. I preferred peace of mind to constantly be dreading going to work and dealing with inconsiderate management that degraded their employees instead of effectively extending themselves to aid you. I've heard the company has eliminated goals from their retail banking so I hope that sparked a change in their management as well, after all appreciated employees perform better."
good,"Day to Day was somewhat hectic, short shifts through the week. Room to advance is a possibility,. Goals are to complete transactions and build rapport with clients find financial solutions"
good,"The biggest problem for Wells Fargo is the decade plus of success and growth it had under it sales centric culture now leaves it trying to turn the ship around and find a way to be successful without pushing needless accounts and products on customers.  "
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to establish a long running career. There are so many avenues and ways to move up in the company. You're surrounded by your team and customers always.
good,"Policies varied too much and sells were pushed to struggling customers, we had to offer products to the customer that we had no knowledge of or were trained on"
good,"I was very excited to work for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage as I love sales and working with people of all of kinds. The issue that Wells Fargo has is their poor training classes and options. They don't offer good training to new employees that are new to the industry as that's why I left the company. I really liked my manager and people I worked with, but the training was very poor."
good,I enjoyed the job until I had questions pertaining to the job. Everyone only cared about their work load yet always talked about team environment...help each other out. This was not the case in department I worked in.
good,really passionate about developing team members so expect constant constructive criticism. customer experience focused for compensation and benefits are pretty decent.
good,"Customer focused, production driven and diverse workplace. I have experienced great leadership. Competitive wages, however, its better to negotiate pay because raises are not great. You can be with the company for years and a person hired off the street can come in making more than you without experience."
good,Working as a teller at Wells Fargo there was always the added pressure to cross sell an addition item to the customer before they left the window.  Management started coming much more aggressive with the need for sales and it become more and more uncomfortable.
good,"Not the Worst but Certainly Not the best....."
good,"Fast paced so days typically go by pretty quickly."
good,"I enjoyed the work environment and the substantive work at Wells Fargo. I also took advantage of its flexible schedule offerings."
good,"good place to work, wish it was not so political. You have to know someone who knows someone to get a good job there, and it should not be that way. Your resume and stats should be what they go off of, but they don't."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work with a very comfortable work environment. However, there was very little offered that allowed employees to de-stress or relax. Wells Fargo had a good training program, but did not have any mentor-based guidance for advancement and promotion. You were on your own once you achieved your licenses. Other advisors did little to help each other out, and share best practices with others."
good,"If you can set personal ethics aside, and have no problem being apart of the big corporate bank system it's not too bad.  Benefits are standard, not very impressive.  Their cost of living increases doesn't even match the rate of inflation. CEO's get bonuses and payouts but the average worker does not.  They like to outsource a lot of their work as well.  Like most jobs, if you get a good manager it can be a pretty solid experience, but with a bad manager, it can be awful. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,wells fargo is a great place to add to your resume due to being a large company. the Benefits are a plus and paid vacation when you first start is always good
good,"Performed daily: Issued cashier's checks, cash/checks count, check endorsements, deposits, withdrawals, payments, money orders and temporary checks;"
good,"Health insurance is expensive with a high deductible "
good,"it was ok, i was there for too many hours. It was very stresseful since all they focused was just on sales. and my brach was not busy at all. so if you didnt meet your requiremnts they fired you."
good,"A typical day involves working files from an assigned queue. Procedures are provided to help you decision the costs involved and whether they can be submitted on a claim for re-imbursement from the government for an FHA foreclosed mortgage. You get to chose the pace and method you work, once trained. But you must meet quality and production goals in order to stay on the team."
good,A good start but has very limited IT support and progress tends to be very slow to get application deployed and tested.  Workplace is quiet if you are in application development.
good,"8 hours in a cubicle, two 15 minute breaks per 8 hr shift, sitting all day."
good,"It was great working with Wells Fargo Bank, I love my Manager and the benefits was also great. I leaned a lot from Wells Fargo Bank, including customer service and communicating with customer."
good,"Due to the legal battles Wells Fargo Bank was going through, the work environment was stressful. The management had knee jerk reaction to problems or challenges that arose. There was lack of foresight in planning when business decisions were being made. Favoritism was rampant, so career growth was not always available, though often spoken of in a favorable light."
good,the good thing from this employer was the diversity they had.  it was great! I always felt that I was able to be myself around others who I would be working with.
good,"This company is so caught up on sales that their employees sometimes do unethical things to get customers to get credit cards or other services. The pay a decent wage, but the bonus for selling products is so low that it's not worth the effort. Management was childish and rude."
good,"It was nice working their management sucks though. The environment is nice, the pay is good, the food is sometimes good, you learn a lot. Training can start off overwhelming but it all gets better and great opportunities to move up as well."
good,I did enjoy my time at wells but I am not interested in going back to this type of job. I am looking for a full time admin position   I enjoyed working with my customers and enjoy customer contact. Customer service is paramount
good,Responsible for performing duties related to the processing of mortgage loan applications in a call-center environment.  Maintain a high level of customer service through proactive communication with external and internal customers and vendors.
good,"Had good experience in learning Yahoo UI MVC framework. Developed 60 screens using corporate customized framework. Fun learning new framework, language and always been a outstanding player was recognized with my product delivery from client. "
good,stressful but good benefits.Worked before the changes were made. Impossible goals but if yu made it compensation was nice. Lower management was good. .
good,"Wells Fargo provides great pay and benefits, as well as PTO and other types of leave. Very quick paced and cutthroat environment with high standards. It is hit or miss with the management and I don't think they take certain complaints by employees seriously when it comes to complaining about management and the unethical things they do or say. It can make your job miserable that even if you made 1 million dollars a day, youd still want to leave."
good,"I didn't struggle with the goals there at the time but when you hit your goals that bonus structure wasn't too great. The benefits were very nice because of the dental, health and retirement plans."
good,Wells Fargo was a good company to work for. Management was the biggest downfall in the company in my opinion. Pay was goof and the teamwork flowed very well.
good,"Huge partitions keep people from getting to know or see others.  Strict compliance rules and regulations enforced.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical bank workplace, nothing to really define. Solid company but with some media attention that made some days hard. Some customers attitudes towards the work product was defined by the media reports."
good,"No job security for temporary employees. Felt very disposable, got a handshake from my manager and escorted out of the building when my contract ended after 1.5 years. Work wasn't bad and coworkers were nice."
good,"Jobs okay, if you don't mind working for a big bank. Lots of inconsistencies from location to location. Very difficult to move up if you don't know somebody."
good,"The pay, benefits, and schedule were pretty good when I was working at Wells Fargo, but there were a lot of problems with the work itself. The biggest issue was micro-management. Managers are motivated strictly by sales numbers, based on the previous quarter/year. Unfortunately, high sales numbers at the time were due to unethical behavior, so the rest of the company felt pressured to break rules to reach their own sales. Customers can be cranky in the financial industry, but most negatives came from inside the company."
good,"Great Schedule with good pay and benefits. "
good,"I really enjoyed working with the Agriculture Department within Wells Fargo. They were a diverse group of individuals. Management from 2012 to 2014 was great. They communicated well with their staff, appreciated education and acknowledged hard work. I appreciate the benefits Wells Fargo provided. I feel that Wells Fargo can be a great company to work for, however, you just need to find the right department that fits your goals in life."
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. As good as it gets for time off and flexibility with work life. Only two major negatives are they pay lower than they should and you never know when your department can be cut or moved.
good,Working with customers on a one on one basis trying to give the best possible customer service and help them find opportunities to enhance their life style
good,"Management is hit or miss. The manager has a lot more infulence than at most other places, so if you get a pretty chill manager, it can make the job a whole lot of fun. If you get a by-the-books micromanager, they can make a pretty easy job into an extremely difficult one."
good,The company has done a lot of bad things to its customers and employees.  It's getting better with all the changes but still has a long way  to go.  I hope the company continues trending in the right direction.  I was sad to leave but it is for the best.
good,At Wells Fargo you will be given many opportunities to learn and grow.  Your position in the company will be directly tied to how much you and your manager are liked more than a high quality or volume or work you produce so interpersonal skills are necessary for advancement along with self-promotion of what you do.  Highly suggest mentorship in the tone and key words to use during meetings.
good,"Overall the management is easy to work with. Expectations from the company on getting customers to a banker is ridiculous. If I had known ""sales"" were involved, I wouldn't have applied."
good,I was a teller for Wells Fargo during the time they have been investigated for falsely opening accounts in members name to reach extreme sales goals. It was also was a low volume branch.
good,When asked what I can do to better improve my ability to move up with the company I was told I should kiss peoples butt so I can have a better opertunity to move up.
good,"Watch the news and you'll know what I mean, In SLC there isn't a lot of opportunity to advance since all of the jobs are pretty much the same and all of the best paying jobs are outside of Utah"
good,Open communication and hardworking with the opportunity to achieve company and personal goals. Friendly environment that support each other. Potential to be successful and awarding
good,More often than none call centers are under rated. Working at this company provides extensive knowledge and how to learn and advance technological skills and enhance and develop people skills both internally and externally. I have learned so much here. Would recommend for those who are willing to put in hard work!
good,"Wells Fargo has a great system in place for learning customer service, sales, and problem-solving through interactions.  They emphasize training new and continuing tellers on how to manage customers if you have an enthusiastic, driven manager like I had."
good,Provided training to help you grow your career. Willing to help you grow your skills and provide training to help you grow into your current role and set up you for success.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Work Life Balance,"
good,"Crazy work environment after 2008 housing market crash.  Worked through a temp agency.  Stressful, yet fulfilling at times.  Only worked there for 9 months."
good,Wells Fargo has been going through many changes since the account fraud scandal in 2016. The organization is restructuring and the corporate culture is changing in a positive way. Good time for some team members within the community bank for advancement however for partner/support teams very little advancement and job security.
good,"Job culture is different from what it was a few years ago due to recent lawsuits against the company."
good,Productive is limited when you when you are not focus on the folks that keeps calling in. Far as fun workplace Wells Fargo will do put in more time to reward the ones who comes to work and not calling in all the time... Productivity is the key thing when you have a full team to work with verse have the team calling out then your work load is doubled.
good,Wells Fargo had training monthly quarterly yearly. Hardest part of job was the sales goals. sales goals were astronomical. Wells Fargo took pride in there products but reviews were too much.
good,"spoke with customers on a daily basis to update them on the status of their loans "
good,"It was relaxed, fast paced, management worked with you, everyone friendly, and you got to do weekly meetings with learning games of each other activities."
good,"Every day was a different experience and an on going learning experience, however, towards the end turn into very stressful position due to low work volume and not knowing the reason."
good,"The culture at Wells Fargo Bank was stellar. They tended to hire top tier type A personalities that took responsibility for doing great work. The leadership, however, did tend toward extreme micromanagement."
good,"The company itself is a great company. The pay is above average for a basic entry job. However, it is clear that advancement is difficult and higher education is not valued. You ask peers how they got their positions, and no one wants to say anything to help you potentially advance. The lack of opportunity to advance is shown in the multiple branch and service managers who worked for over 6 years."
good,My immediate manager was very fair.  The culture was very relaxed.  The hardest part of the job was keeping with up with the never ending changes in compliance.  What I enjoyed about the job is my dealings with my co-workers who were very professional.
good,"Management was a revolving door, upper management focused on not hitting the goals rather than helping us find different ways to be successful.  Never took ideas from the employees on the front lines."
good,"It was very hard to balance work and a family, they did were not flexible with their hours. The parking at this location also made things difficult, the parking was offsite."
good,the job culture was amazing but I worked there years ago so it could have changed I worked for dealer services not the bank so I think it may be difrrerent
good,"Wells Fargo is such a large corporation that it is always busy and getting back to clients, processors or managers is required. I reviewed loans and need to have a good turn around time and certain amount of loans reviewed for final decision."
good,"Working for Wells was a different experience. The environment was fast paced and you meet new people everyday, maybe even hundreds per day if you work in the Phone bank like I did. The management was nice, no complaints but there was nothing that made them stand out. The training was easy. The pay and benefits were great. The only downside is the attendance policy and their ability to accommodate. Make sure you don’t take any unscheduled days off or you may be out of there!"
good,"Over all I learned a lot working at Wells Fargo. It was a very diverse and laid back atmosphere. If I could change anything it, it would have to be the staff."
good,I really don't have too much to say about this company since I dedicated 3 years and was let go due to having too much money in my cash register at the time of my third robbery as a store manager
good,love the benefits and peers recent toss up in management has atmosphere strained. Training has been improved. A lot of changes are taking place now due to management changes.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Inbound call center atmosphere. You are required to work one day out of the weekend so it's hard to get 2 days off in a row. There is a lot of micromanagement.
good,Closed the entire office 8 months after I started as part of a consolidation of offices. Hard to understand why they hired 5 Underwriters only to shut it down?
good,"They paid well, and the team I worked on was good and got along well. I was a contractor, so I wasn't privy to a lot of the things happening within the company."
good,The company is an ok place to work depending on the department you're working in. Try not to get a position that involves talking on phones e.i. customer service. Analyst positions pay well.
good,qa goals were unreasonable there was no job stability the pressure to  open additional checking accounts savings accounts credit cards loans certificates of deposit were not in the customers best intrest
good,"I worked with Wells Fargo as a contractor for 18months with the marketing team, which was great group of people to work with. Very highly motivated and knowledable, and always willing to assist and include me as needed (being a remote)."
good,I enjoy working for Wells Fargo and the people i worked with as well. I learned a lot  with my time at the company and really hoped i could have had the opportunity to move up within.
good,"it really is ok, not much to say, not see at as a life long career  the team was ok, the office I would say is a 2 stars out of 5, some days they don't even have coffee"
good,"I've worked with many contract companies and TEKsystems was the only one that really put forth that effort to get me in a position and stuck with me until they found me something.   From my experience though, once you're placed, you're stuck.  If the job isn't working out, they talk like they're looking for something else, but don't actually appear to attempt to find you anything else until you're 2-3 months from the end of that contract.   I understand this is pretty much all contract companies though."
good,"When I worked at Wells Fargo, the culture was sell, sell, sell. Unfortunately, that led to many unethical behaviors, including the well publicized opening of unnecessary accounts without customers' consent."
good,Wells Fargo phone bank is your typical call center. 8hours shift 2 15-minute breaks and 30 minute lunch. You do have to work one day of the weekend either Saturday or Sunday you have to bid on your shift your calls throughout the day will be mainly problem-solving calls complex issues angry customers you should average between 60 and 80 calls per day the culture and environment is very good if you like diversity the best thing that I can say about working at Wells Fargo would be the bonuses we did receive a bonus every 3 months if you had good attendance and good quality scores on your calls you would get a raise every 6 to 12 months is not a large raised were talking about maybe some added change on to your hourly wage. The job overall is very stressful in the phone bank you have to have patience to deal with the angry customers and you have to know how to manage your numbers and you have to know how to deal with your coworkers and management.
good,"Provided growth and advancement for my career"
good,WF continues to come out of regulatory issues. It's internal projects get prioritized after regulatory issues are addressed. This leads to slower than desired internal improvements.
good,"I started work at Wachovia call center, and stayed through the transition to wells Fargo when they merged. The sales aspect of the job increased in importance as the customer service aspect seemed to diminish. However the pay is good, and great benefits."
good,I was not a big fan that is why i no longer work there. the pay was good and the benefits were great. other then that it is who you know to advance no matter how well you do
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if you are on the sales team. If you are part of the support groups there is no opportunity for growth.  
good,Typical day at work would be to seek out business with the tellers and personal bankers. Set up appointments to speak with clients for refinances and go through  meeting to know the latest products
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I worked at several different branches of Wells Fargo over the course of several years. Pay was on the low end of competitive and work hours, even for part-time, were generally pretty fixed which was nice for predictability and work-life balancing. The people and leadership with whom I worked were great at all locations. I learned a lot and was afforded opportunity to develop as I wanted to."
good,"Since Wells Fargo has been hit with some heavy fines the work atmosphere has changed, We are now on Hiring Freeze in my business of work. Merchants are hesitant to sign with us ."
good,"It depends on team you work in."
good,"I thought this was a great place to work for, I learned a lot. Both about the way banking is done as well as learning how to plan for my family's future."
good,"Overall the company was great to work for,  "
good,When I joined this company it was very employee friendly they did lot of things in favour of employees. Now because of the new management and their bad decisions it is getting difficult on employees and the average wages are also come down every year and standards are getting very low to achieve cost saving
good,"Think of a Call center in any movie depiction, it's that. You take calls all shift, having to put on a nice smile when people tell you their life stories or start yelling at you for how corrupt the bank is. It's a great place to start your working experience, and to get experience dealing with difficult situations."
good,"Alot has changed in the last year and a half, tired of being in the news everyother day. Lots of talk of change but nothing that actually puts customer and team members first. Same story different day."
good,"Worked during the time employees were pressured to meet ever increasing account goals, pressured to sell sell sell no matter what customer objections were or the best interest of customer."
good,"Loved the people, management was not so great. Crazy rules about verbiage, comparable salary, promotions only based on sales not work ethic, dedication or doing the right thing for the customers. In the end, I hated the job but I made a few friends."
good,"Even though I love to make sales, Wells Fargo was a company of unethical practices and leadership. They want their team members to push sales on customers, even at times, they upped the sales quota even though, the branch may be ahead of others in the district. The hardest part of the job had a manager breathing down my neck to perform top sales while remaining in the branch, but the job description indicated that all Business Specialist must be able to obtain new clients through outside sales calls."
good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful company to work for as far as their benefits are concerned. WF, in my opinion, does a wonderful job at compensating their employees.  The pay is wonderful, and there opportunities for raises every year. The Benefits are outstanding and inexpensive; this should be a major draw for people thinking about working for Wells Fargo. However, the different levels of management, that every employee will have to deal with, is frustratingly inconsistent. Expectations are constantly changing, and there seems to be some hypocrisy from the direct management. Customers dominate the average work day which, depending on the area, can be extremely irritating. If your customer relationship skills are lacking this is not a job you will enjoy. Overall, I am glad I had the opportunity for this experience, and I built some very strong relationships with my team members. I was not impressed with the opportunities I was given to grow with the company, but some of the blame is certainly on me. Doing your job correctly and working hard is not enough for recognition, and asking for help with career growth is like pulling teeth. Management is all smiles and helpful when its an idea, but are never available when the employee wants to put it to practice. There is A LOT of employee turnover, and, as a result, it seems like management is more worried about keeping current employees in their positions rather than seeing them succeed and move upwards."
good,The atmosphere is competitive and slightly hostile and management hounds you constantly for not making your quotas. I was highly uncomfortable most of the time because I felt like my performance was never good enough.
good,"a typical workday, relaxed environment, teammates help each other"
good,stressful to work at and not enough training for new employees.  Layoffs happened but there was no notice and employees had had been there a long time were let go
good,"Felt I was being targeted by certain people."
good,"It was all about sales and little appreciation. Very busy and not enough time to breathe. No teamwork, it was about who could open the most accounts and brag about it on Friday morning meetings."
good,"In the phone bank, you go in, go to your desk, get your system up and put your headphones on and take call after call. Then you read a script, help the customer then sell to them if they approved it at the beginning."
good,Fast pace working environment learned a lot about banking management was great having to leave to work place have to find a better paying job . The enjoyable part was the hours
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,work life balance very attainable.  Almost all the staff members were very easy to get along with.  Promotions were easily attainable if you  achieved your key metrics in your performance evaluation .
good,work life balance very attainable.  Almost all the staff members were very easy to get along with.  Promotions were easily attainable if you  achieved your key metrics in your performance evaluation .
good,I was first to arrive ..opened the doors turned on the lights and made the coffee..learned how to deal with hostile people with professionalism and learned how to work with others to achieve our goals. management was supportive and it was a fun environment
good,"You have to be logged in by a certain time or you will get a tardy.  if you call out sick, it effects your adhearence numbers and you will get an occurence which if you exceed a certain number , it's grounds for termination.  "
good,"Extensive exposure to and partnership with the debt capital market (investment grade, leveraged, and high yield) and other IB product partners to provide comprehensive capital solutions to large U.S.  corporate customers (with revenue >$500MM)."
good,"It's a good place to work for the benefits but the pay isn't the best. Also, it's difficult to move around internally. Especially if it is into a different area than the one you have been in."
good,"Sort and process check and payment to proper lockbox account,I have learned how to multitask and the laws of banking and the repercussions of not following hippa law. Management good people to work for. Employs different cultures of people who speak or read different language. The hardest part is drive from house to work, and the pay."
good,Working for Wells Fargo was okay I just didn’tike being a teller. Maybe if I was in a different position I would’ve enjoyed it more. I didn’t like the inconsistency of my schedule.
good,"A typical day at work would be me usually opening and I'm usually set up in our merchant services area which is really cool because I get to help our customers that own businesses in the area. I see them almost every morning mon-sat and I've become very familiar with their transactions to the point where when they come in they don't have to tell me what to do. Which my customers love because it makes the process of their transactions go smooth and fast leaving them satisfied with my service."
good,Manager not so much . But great benefits. Was on a traveling team and that was amazing. They do lay off a lot but that’s the mortgage industry. I would say they are a pretty good company.
good,"From every department to every floor, management was extremely inconsistent.  Some manager were tough and by the book, others were the complete opposite and actually drank during office parties.  It was not that the job was tough, it was that there was so much inconsistency in the directives, it made the job tough.  The best part was the benefits.  My HRA paid for a lot of my medical bills, the dental and vision were also top notch."
good,Right now I don't work for them and when I did the micro managing and sales goals were high pressured.  It has been over 3years since I worked for them.
good,Great place to work. Laid off hard to get back in with a centralized HR. All was good until Norwest Management took over they are cold and heartless. Some great people still working there.
good,"It's good. I was working as site engineer for tower-3. The management is good, gave me lot of chances to prove myself. we can speak its a college for freshers rather than company."
good,"Ultimately the opportunity to grow in the company is really based off of what you put in. If you do not see it as a life time career there is no point of staying. I learned lessons that I will take with me for the years to come. I learned that I am accountable for my outcome. I learned how to be an ultimate leader and that I will get what I only put in. Management depending on who you have will push you to your limit. At least that was how it was for me in a good way. However, the pressure to sell is still there even after everything the company went through in 2015. Stress is high. There is no other way to say it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I met along the way."
good,Loved the benefits! Great place to work. No issues with the place. Fast paced and customer service is key. Must be able to multi-task. Enjoy working for this company.
good,I am no longer at Wells Fargo and feel that it would not be fair for me to give a review at this time.  I do not feel that my review would be biased at this point and time.
good,I enjoyed working for the company for over 8yrs. The banking experience was helpful for my next career move. I enjoyed helping the customers come up with solutions in keeping their homes and getting them set up in workout options . There were several options offered.  I resolved payment issues settled account balances and set up liquidation options. We cured loans and zeroed out balances
good,Content Management is fulfilling job!  Excellent Supervisor who was very knowledgeable in the job we were performing.  Our Manager was not very knowledgeable in what we were doing and made for stressful situations at times.  Overall a very good work experience.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Typical procedure driven environment. Learn mostly about internal policies with little logical explanation. The management is struggling to let go of the mentality that got them in trouble two years ago.
good,"Sales are heavily pushed. Management is good however, I felt that daily interactions were less about the people being encountered during transactions and more about meeting a quota. There are bonuses given for meeting your quarterly sales goals. Overall, this wasn't the job for me and was glad to move on after graduating."
good,"Currently Wells Fargo is not a stable company to work for.  They in the in process of reorganization due to all of the bad press and miss management.  There is no certain career path, and my position was moved to another state."
good,"I love the people I work with, however, the company does things regularly to drive customers away. After bad press the company will correct what went wrong and actively do something else to upset the client base."
good,Not a lot of upward mobility opportunities. People are in the same roles for years on end and when a new opportunity opens up who you know plays a big role in whether or not you get it.
good,"customer relationship work handling transactions, account openings, credit applications etc. Problem solving and information providing on services offered"
good,not the worst job I've ever had but no the best either. The hours are great and pay is decent. but your experience is totally dictated on your manager
good,"Hey kids, do you like to work 6 days a week and only make $35k/year? Then Wells Fargo is for you! Want to advance in your job? Good luck and wait at least 5 years!"
good,"while working here of course there will be bad days but overall the fellow employees and customers are really nice. the pay is really good especially has someoe with no prior banking experience. the management is the worse part as there is no structure, repsponsibility, communication and empathy amongst the manager to employee relationship. a great perk is also that you are alloted an hour lunch break along with paid training."
good,"I liked the job itself very much, but too much focus was set on goals instead of customer service and quality.  Management did not focus on positive - mostly negative and there was always a difference in opinion regarding policy and procedure among the Supervisors/Managers.  It was a very competitive environment and all employees were not given the same opportunities.  "
good,"Everything was fine until they decided to "
good,"Small branch for a larger parent company. Nationwide financing of used vehicles. Dealing with dealer partners, forming relationships, leveraging deals for business, set goals and targets. Strong leadership focus. Good partnership between supervisors and front line underwriters with timely decisions on transactions."
good,"I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo, there are a lot of opportunities for growth within the company. Working with the company in different departments, really gave me an idea of how the company runs as a whole."
good,"During this period of my life I achieved my series 7 and 63 license, this industry well far less secure than the larger banks such as Wells Fargo or Bank of America. For this reason this work environment was more of managing your own business and on your own maintaining and secure a book of business/clients."
good,"It was a learning expense, at the time I was their you had sell a lot . then on top service the account for the customer in timely frame, they get on you about your time. I work at the call center that wasn't for me.."
good,With this job I was able to explore multiple positions with the company which was able to provide me valuable work experience.  This job was able to train me to be professional and handle customer needs.
good,"typical day. great team, everyone was a team player"
good,My last manager and I didn't see eye to eye and so I had made the decision to leave WF.  I loved my customers and the people I worked with but when I was constantly being told that I wasn't doing things right because I wasn't selling to every customer; I finally said this is enough.
good,"When you work there over 10 years and make $4 more than when you started, it seems they don't care about paying you for your time and dedication to the company."
good,"it was an ok place to work. it was clean at the hr were flexible, would never take another job there, i would tell a friend about it all depending on the department and manager. loved we dint have to work on Saturday,"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,If you were not close to a member of management your chances of advancing in your career decreases greatly. I reached out to management several times and asked how I could go about moving to the next level in my position and I was always given an excuse. I was not the only one this happened to.
good,Typical day at work:
good,"Wells Fargo is an easy job to do. "
good,"Not much to say about working at the company. Fast paced, very strict schedule. There are chances for promotion every quarter, but they are few and between."
good,"I'm sure some of the jobs there were legitimate; however the release requirement for my job (I was a temp) was the equivalent to knocking something over on the desk."
good,"you were a 100% commission and out of your commission check they took out your draw (which is ok)  but all your over time, PTO, insurance (you paid whole thing) they took out your holiday pay pay as well. Basically you worked for free"
good,"sales based, high pressure.  emphasis was on selling products not servicing customer, constant turn over of associates made it difficult to supervise coach and train"
good,"being a service manager is a very demanding job. You must have good attention to detail skills, patience, and a good team player. There a good slow days and other days are very busy and sometimes stressful depending on what needs to  be done on the operations side."
good,The first 1.5 years at Wells Fargo were great!  I worked for an incredible team of managers who worked so hard to help their employees be successful.  I eventually became a trainer for this department based on the fact that I had the highest sales  in the nation as well as excellent numbers across the board for what we were graded on.  The only reason I left this department to go to REO was because the pay in the Credit Card department was waaaay too low.  I loved what I did but I couldn't pay my bills.  I had just come from living in San Diego making over $100K a year to a $28K a year salary.  When offered the job in REO as an Asset Manager I was beyond excited since it came with a large pay increase and I was going to be back in the field of Real Estate which I am very passionate about.
good,Far too many hats to wear and no work-life balance without the proper compensation. Job security always in jeapordy with deliverables and KPI's are ridiculous
good,Can be a good place to work if you find yourself in the right department. The recent troubles WF has gone through in the news have definitely impacted more LOB's than just the bank side. No longer a lot of growth opportunities
good,"The hardest part of my job was being able to provide the service my customers deserved because it was a very busy location and we were always short handed.  "
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. You can grow and move to different departments very quickly. They also offer good benefits. Management is very professional.
good,"The average day I am under my own supervision. There is very little Micro managing going on which is nice. My immediate manager is a great person. He is available to help and give guidance, but also allows employees to do their own thing."
good,"Everything about the company is about sales. It was never about the customer needs nor the employees. Management puts a lot of pressure so that you can offer everything in the computer screen. No matter how busy the customer was, in a rush or already told you he's not interested; our job was to insist and get the customer mad and get treated bad by them. Not fair I had to leave for this. I saw an opportunity to grow within the company, but their goal and focus it's just not right and I believe employees don't deserve this. Believe me, it's not true when they say sales are over... either you sale or won't get paid bonuses plus management will harass you. HR never cared, yes, they are part of it too."
good,"I enjoyed work and the customers.  Too many times management did not follow through with their promises. And we were understaffed more in the almost 5 years I worked there, than were properly staffed."
good,Working at Wells Fargo in the collections department was stressful and very competitive. The collection goals seemed all but attainable no matter the amount of effort that was put into making sure that the customers stuck to the payment arrangement. The hours that I worked were tough to raise a family on and unless you did amazing you could not change departments or even shifts to help make personal/family life better.
good,Typically you had requirements daily to achieve as well as monthly and after so many months if you weren't one of the people in the top collecting money they would write you up. In the beginning this job was my favorite then as the economy went down the stress went up in this job. I believe things have changed within this company and actually wouldn't mind giving it another chance. The benefits within this company were amazing and the pay got me through on my own. I believe it would be better now and would love to work for Wells Fargo again.
good,Wells Fargo is strictly all about sales to the point where it could be stressful to work there. There secret shopper grading system was also very unfair. Only thing when i worked there was they had a very good benefits
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I learned a great deal about money management, customer service and laws to protect the bank and the consumer. The hardest part was the unrealistic sales goals and the best part was the hours."
good,I loved the customers but management at the time was horrible. insensitive to employee feelings.Depending on the manager they will not help you work on your goals.
good,It was Very Hard it came in a very different time for the world so the company put a lot of things on us as team that was not being handle well because the time of the world and the place its in
good,"Wells Fargo Advisors, can be a good place to work there are options to move up, but they are not often made available. There are a few issues in the chain of command where in items do not get completed i.e. One employee creates a work item to be completed and then the person who is to complete the task drops the ball. This happens quite a bit. Efforts have been made to improve there systems but, they take very long to implement, while many of the tasks on a daily basis require a work around."
good,"Great job if you're looking for something to get into the world of finance. The teller position is stressful, high stakes without the reward. Can be a great learning experience for a first or second job."
good,"Wells Fargo is a nice place to work. They focus on diversity and community involvement."
good,Wells Fargo allows a WFH option for flexibility with a work/home life balance. Well Fargo also gives the flexibility to utilize the campus for meetings and on demand IT support for issues.
good,WF is like all big corporations. Lots of positions available and at times areas to move up to but there is a huge lack of communication; frustration with culture of personal. Impossible to move individuals that are not there to complete the task.
good,"It was an over the phone job. As simple as it was, the job did have it's stressful moments. If it wasn't dealing with the people you spoke to on a daily basis, then it was the goals that were required to meet."
good,Call center based environment.  Learn about helping customers with any banking request. Workplace culture is driven by management.  The best part of the job is helping the customers.
good,"If you're looking for something fast paced and all consuming and if you are competitive Wells Fargo is great. If you have children and family it's not really for  you. It's a show up and be present kind of job even when you're not on the job and although management is encouraging and excellent, there is a lot of pressure to perform."
good,"Daily duties are assigned"
good,"This company is a great place to work if you have Tenure as well as a student just graduating college.  This company is also great with Culture.  The pay for the work expected is extremely low, only beneficial for Tenured employees."
good,I was a Client Associate.  Provide assistant to the clients as needed.  Also provided assistance to the Brokers.  I set up a Special Events program that showed a 10% increase in our client base.  I set up committies annually for holiday donations.  The working atmosphere was  a busy one.  I enjoyed working with the clients and their needs.
good,"The local environment at Wells Fargo was great; the people and management were friendly and extremely good at their jobs. However, it's Wells Fargo. They've always been in the epicenter of unethical practices whether it be sub-prime tactics or creating bogus customer accounts. A great place to work for due to the people, but I wouldn't return based on their business practices. It's difficult to rate this company."
good,I have worked over 22 years for Wells Fargo. Different entities and departments. Upper management needs to be around more and involved versed dictating what they think should be done with changes.
good,The job itself is good. The environment is a little on the negative side.The job does require a lot of attention and detail. I do like working there except for the negative work environment.
good,This job was very easy. You were expected to work 40 hours a week and some weeks you had enough work to be busy the whole time but most weeks could be completed by noon. Credit analysts with wells fargo are mostly younger people who are nice and easy to get along with. The pay isn't great but it was great for the amount of work. Very low stress once you understand the job.
good,"I learned so much from Wells Fargo about the banking industry. I interacted with a multitude of diverse clients all over the country each and every day. We were the help desk for all employees of Wells Fargo and we were highly trained to assist them  with all issues. I dealt with anything from a missing deposits to how to title and open many types of trust accounts. We were constantly training to keep up with the ever changing banking rules. I helped about 100 clients per day and the pace was cut throat. My computer had 3 large screens, I felt that the extra screens allowed me to be more efficient and excelled my pace."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"If you are a true seller, this position might be just for you. Very uptight on sales. Must try to extend a product out to each customer whether its opening an additional savings account, credit card, loans, etc. no matter if the customer truly needs the product or not. This too is a team oriented job, but the added pressure to force sale a product was too overwhelming."
good,"When I worked at Wells Fargo, sales goals were high and only getting higher.  I went through 6 managers in my 4 years there.  I did appreciate the flexibility of my shifts.  They worked around my school schedule."
good,There is not a good career growth pathway there. The pay for each position is not equal to the responsibility of the job. They monitor every minute of the day.
good,A typical day consisted of me obtaining correct documentation from the borrower to be able to get their file to closing.  I learned a lot in this company.
good,"It was hard to work with home office in St. Louis, MO.  Some tasks took too long since waiting for home office approval. Most of home office staff was nice but too many rules that needed to be followed."
good,"Due to the scandals coming out in the press over the last couple of years, Wells Fargo is trying to come out of the darkness and reposition itself. I wouldn't recommend working for this employer right now due to all of the uncertainty. Wells Fargo was a great place to work at one time, but within the next couple of years I expect there will be massive layoffs that have already started to reach a total savings of $4 Billion dollars for their shareholders. Front line employees are paying for the sins of top management and will continue to pay over time. New business across divisions has slowed due to the damage to their reputation."
good,The bank is going through some significant changes and it need to change it's culture immediately.  It is obviously a large company with many different departments where people can get lost.
good,"A typical day is to check emails, attend meeting, document requirements, update BRD/FSD, Complete Onboarding Application processes, Communicate with technical and business teams to ensure requirements are met, conduct meetings, document enhancements."
good,"I've met alot of great people working for Wells Fargo. I feel that they know the right people to hire, not only as an individual but great as part of the team. It was very stressful, however, competing for sales goals (which I think aren't a factor in the company anymore). I feel that Wells Fargo employees deserve more pay. But overall, still a good company."
good,"I did not expect the turn of events that occurred which ended my career with Wells Fargo.  Dealer Services was centralized and we were only given 4 months.  "
good,Great career advancement but do not promote hard working people. Managers only care about numbers since they like to compete with other teams. Very numbers driven.
good,"This is the only company I have ever worked for where the company doesn't pay its' employees bonuses. You have to rely on the individuals you work for. So good luck finding a team that treats you well. The woman who hired me flat out lied about compensation structure and I ended up taking a $10k paycut upon relocation. One year later I transferred to a different team that treats me very well. "
good,"Wells Fargo Bank, National Association has a good retirement plan.  They will match your 401K retirement account contribution dollar for dollar up to six percent."
good,Wells is a good place to work if you fall into their system of how things should be done.  Out of the box thinkers will not do well because of the processes in place.
good,So wells Fargo is about the culture and honestly it's no where near about the  customers or workers. I feel like it's about the benefit to the company.
good,Working for wells was one of my more rigorous sales opportunity that I have had. It was a major introduction to a true sales worlds. It was a decent opportunity.
good,Work environment is good... But salary is not that great... No pressure at all... People work so much but they will not get incentives.. Culture of company is nice.
good,""" I feel working for this company would be a lot better if they worked on their management teams to improve them and their relationship with the staff.I feel that if you are someone that needs all the information of your job and the tools to do a great job provided to you this is not the place for you. Higher up management is great, just wish that it would spread down to the lower management."""
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work. The benefits are wonderful and they are very good with the work/life balance.  The company is going through some restructuring right now and there are changes all the time.
good,Pay was not good. Lack of advancement is a huge problem. Manager was not very understanding and expected alot out of you in order to get the task done.
good,"They gave me no time to go to school, would not accommodate my schedule in any way, and HR was not of any help. They offer tuition reimbursement but don't give you any time to actually pursue your education. That's why I'm leaving."
good,lack of training on core. Stressful and too much emphasis on audit and not enough on training. Favoritism evident and moral is weak through out. Team work is not encouraged.
good,Well known bank with a culture that asks a lot of its employees but also generally pays accordingly.  Executive management has changed a great deal in recent years and new culture may be forming.
good,"Good place to work. Wells Fargo is a very fast paced environment, a very productive environment, a very challenging environment and an environment that offers many opportunities. Management expectations are very high and very demanding and excellence is the theme."
good,"I did enjoy my time as a teller and lead teller with Wells Fargo. They had some of the most progressive benefits policies I'd seen to that point, covering ""domestic partners"" as well as spouses and the like. If only they could work out the rest of their customer relation kinks."
good,I think the overall atmosphere was really good but everyone was always on edge because of the changes.  They had a lay-off a couple years ago and should have asked who wanted to go and who wanted to stay.  Things would have been a lot better.  The people that stayed never wanted to be in the department we were thrown into.
good,Wells Fargo's culture and management style is very different from the rest of the industry. Wells Fargo has created a system in which every single individual in the company is considered a sales person and is expected to sale banking products in situations that may not be a full match for the position.
good,"I worked here for 5 years and management was always standing behind your back making sure you followed a script and that you offered a product to every single customer. Very stressful to work here, employees where going on stress leave left and right."
good,"Worked with a good team of people who I became friends with.  Never took work home with me physically or mentally, which is always good!  Very busy environment."
good,This was not my favorite job. I only accepted the position because I needed a job. I felt like a number not an employee. The culture was awful and no one was cohesive
good,Corporate work environment with reasonable work life balance. I had a good manager and enjoyed my time with the company. The experience was a good introduction into Equity.
good,"I would sit at my desk & get right to work.  You have a quota to meet every day.  I was already ahead of the field in the position that was offered, so I didn't learn anything new.  My manager would constantly hover over everyone & even followed me to the restroom & the break room on numerous occasions to make sure that I wasn't wasting time.  All of my co-workers joked about working there, comparing it to the movie ""Office Space"".  The hardest part of the job was non-stop staring at a computer screen & keeping up with the required quota.  However, the upper management was a delight."
good,"Large, diverse organization. Able to learn a lot about the financial services industry and a variety of detail about banking. Several opportunities to start and build one's career."
good,Call Center schedule sucks. Hard to get a schedule with two days off in a row. Have to work every weekend. Attendance policy sucks- Do not approve PTO which forces you to call out at times.
good,a new adventure every day some managers showed favoritism whether the team member was a hard worker or not the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to and assisting the different bankers that called into banker connectiion
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The location of my workplace was not lively, and I think improvements could be made. It was very virtual, and this made connecting with other employees very difficult. I thought the company did not put a focus on staying current and developing new methods to run their operations."
good,Great career in back room.started as teller worked my way up over the years with growing knowledge and experience in multiple facets in the organization.
good,Wells used to be a great place to work but now management does not value their employees. A stressful workplace has been created since the scandal last November.
good,Wells Fargo provided me with a good base to start my career in mortgage lending.  It is a large machine that works for some but was not as personal customer oriented as I like.  Exceptional benefit packages.
good,Very detailed with money not really flexible with school and  has managers that play favorites with promotions  not really secure if you are not good with money
good,"The expectations of my day are as follows which I surely meet with consistency. It consists of 3 face to face appointments with business owners with efforts of moving them forward in using our service, 2 visits to two branches to coach bankers, discuss best practices, do skill drills and assist in making effective calls. In addition, make my own prospecting calls to keep my pipeline full with good merchant services opportunities.  Keep communication frequent with leadership as far as in the branch manager, district managers and area presidents in regards to the branch's progress in business activity and any trends that be occurring. "
good,"Help customers with their transactions,Great Customers and benefits,  bonus incentives, good 401K, Most enjoyable part of my day is helping the customers."
good,It is a great place for work life balance. I am able to work from home if necessary. they understand that the balance is needed in order to have a productive team.
good,"Very sales oriented and transactional. We had a script to follow and were suppose to offer products to every customer we worked with. This company definitely valued sales over everything. There was a lot of pressure to make your sales quota, which wasn't too hard if you were a pushy salesman. Felt like I was always pressured to push sales on to people (this company would do anything for someone to come open a bank account.) Overall management was pretty good. You do get close and become friends with everyone you work with. Were very flexible with my schedule when I was in school. There are good opportunities for advancement if you want to follow the typical path in the branch world (teller, banker, service manager, etc.). But I had a very hard time finding an advanced position when I received my college degree. Which is why I ended up leaving the company."
good,If you like banking while trying to keep your composure throughout constant pressure from managers and customers then youre in the right place. I wish you best of luck.
good,"Typical day at work starts with a morning huddle to set the tone for the day. Customer experience is the most important part of Wells Fargo's culture as it should be. "
good,"A typical work day began with a meeting about changes, updates and recognition."
good,"Typical office environment, large company, many employees - I'd rather not review the company I work for, different positions have different experiences."
good,The company is a great company to work for if you're looking to start out in a call center. This job was not located at a bank. It is a call center for wells fargo.
good,"The work environment is laid back, but not that social if you like to go to happy hours or team outings."
good,I loved the opportunities that I had with this company. I was able to advance to other departments to get to know different aspects of the company and what other options were provided for customers.
good,"Wells Fargo is an average company with which to work.  It strives to meet employees' and customers' needs.  However, at times falls short in several areas.  "
good,"A good place to work but just not for someone that is young.  It is an old school company with an low energy environment.   Nice earning potential, and advancement opportunities."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I loved working in the refinance processing environment in Tempe AZ! I loved who I worked with and the ability to grow into leadership. They have a great leadership program and mentoring program at this location.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, but most of all the relationships I built with coworkers!  I met my husband here and several friendships were built during my time here.  I still see and speak with many of them."
good,"Good place to work"
good,Company has a very well built infrastructure in Mortgage Lending.  The company provides plenty of tools to assist the business development process.  The company's main goal is to achieve sales volumes to hit their targets which translate to stock value going up.
good,"Wells Fargo is a decent place to work. The management staff should take more time to know their team. Also, management should be more motivational towards advancement; and actually listen when their team members speak. Team members should be able to transfer to different positions within the company without having to apply and be interviewed like someone outside the company. Also, any employee who may be in a position not well-suited for them; should be able to ""post-out"" without meeting the 12-month requirement."
good,"It was mainly a customer service, bank teller, sales position.  I learned supervisory and sales skills.  It was a busy position, very challenging.  I started working as a teller and ended on the lead teller position, I learned alot."
good,I have enjoyed working at Wells Fargo.  The only drawback is that it is hard to get promoted just by the quality of your work.  It is VITAL that you know the right people to keep your job and advance within the organization.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo. I enjoyed the work a lot and many of the other employees in which I had interaction via in person, phone, or electronically. There was always plenty of work so as to keep us all busy and I felt that my contributions were recognized by many."
good,I started working at the bank as a teller and moved up the company but it was very stressful but I had a great time. The sales goals where always in the back of your mind and your manager would not let you forget them. We had said they needed to change years before the scandal and I am glad they have changed so far. They need to pay their employees more because the company does great but they continue to cut benefits and pay.
good,Cash management and customer service main priority. Learned team building and financial skills. Management changed frequently and varied from fair to excellent. Culture of team was fun yet lack of accountability. Hardest part of job would be handling retention. Most enjoyable part was team bonding.
good,"It was a fine company to work for, unfortunately I was laid off do to the joint venture between wells and Edward Jones not lasting. The pay was more than fair."
good,Good place to grow in your career. Leadership is good. Work Life Balance is manageable. Employee benefits are good. Training are given equal importance. Both internal and External.
good,"Great overall company to work for, management is great and will help you advance your skills. Benefits are great and they have excellent accommodations if your going through family or heath issues."
good,"It was so easy to advance. Since Wells Fargo is so sales driven, all you have to do is blow your sales out of the water and beat out the competition and you can pretty much make your demands. "
good,"Wells Fargo offers a competitive benefits package. However, management isn't very helpful or knowledgeable. Also the work atmosphere is very inviting to all employees."
good,A position that allows you to be up close and personal with a person and their banking needs. Building lasting relationships with people  and outside business clientele
good,"Like any large company, there is a mix of good and bad managers. But, process gets bogged down by too many middle managers who provide conflicting targets/goals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Very conservative company. The raises are low par. You get a larger compensation when you change titles. This company is not made for risk takers and people looking to be heavily compensated. You have to stay in a position for a year before you can transfer to a position in the same state.
good,"Working for wells was fun at times, they definitely try to cultivate a friendly and enjoyable environment. But there are so many gaps in management, communication was so broken between corporate and branch level management. I developed a wonderful friendship as well as workplace relationship with a few of my coworkers and one manager. But there was just so much B S that came with working for this company trying to reinstate its good name that Ihad to leave."
good,"High turnover. No more sales, just more activities that aren't productive to the typical work day. Quarterly bonus structure is unclear. Hopefully more improvements to the changes that's been made."
good,"Always a fun time at work.  Coworkers were awesome and the person I reported to was great.  Some expectations were unrealistic, but just did what you always did and seems to be fine."
good,Great place to start your career and learn in a safe environment but be ready to move on once the progress plateaus. No perks. Not a real technical company. Old methods.
good,"Wells Fargo teller is  A very fast-paced job that included me multitasking constantly such as, answering phones, cashing personal checks, making money orders cashier checks,sending money to foreign countries,dealing with merchants from different businesses, making executive decisions,customer service, staying aware of our surroundings at all times, problem solving, counting money to myself and back the customer, cleaning work station in between customers, balancing your drawer at the end of the day, listening to your manager and trusting there judgment."
good,"Worked with people in numerous positions, learning many aspects of the mortgage industry for sales, appraisals, processing and underwriting.  I still miss all of them."
good,"I spend my day assisting clients and servicing their financial needs. Day to day, we handle clients, checking, savings, and credit accounts to ensure that they're succeeding financially."
good,The pay isn't great but not bad.  It's a good workplace culture.  The hardest part of the job is something is always changing.  However management is fair.
good,Pofessional environment. Great benefits. Could use some improvement in pay such as raises. If you are looking for something long-term may not be the best place. 1 mistake can get you out of the door.
good,"lack of true management left positon to be idle and caused loss of interest. With no direction, grew tired of trying to find things to do. Seemed to penalize employees that attempted to have the desire to learn more and be great at their positions"
good,"- The Contractor vs Employee behaviour  is unacceptable "
good,"They will work you until you break. Learn to play the system so you can grow internally otherwise there s no chance..."
good,"Don't really have much guidance or work to do, but the co workers are really nice. Its difficult the fact that we don't have a bank in missouri so i get a lot of the same calls and walk ins"
good,"Overall a pretty good company to work for, unless you move and request a transfer, got stonewalled pretty hard on that front. Besides that, great people, decent benefits, plenty of room for advancement."
good,Average experience (nothing special) . just typical financial company with average benefit and salary. Slow to change and adapt with the latest technology.
good,"Company has top industry training programs available for team members at anytime for career advancement and also improve banker knowledge.Work place culture is fast,"
good,"Wells Fargo is a company that does not care about neither customer's satisfaction, nor employee's. All that company cares about is people with money (rich)."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is secure. However the work environment is very dramatic and political."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Working at Wells Fargo taught me a great amount about customer service and forced me to brush up on my interpersonal skills. A typical day included processing transactions such as cashing checks, deposits, withdrawals, and cash advances. Management at the location was decent, I did not care for the service manager due to the fact that she did display favoritism and did not handle training to her best abilities, by yelling at a new employee versus simply correcting their mistake and helping them to not repeat it. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management and scheduling. The most enjoyable part was the environment, professionalism, and the constant learning and growing."
good,"can be a wonderful place to work, learn and grow however it all depends on the management you have and the department or business unit you are employed within as it is not at all consistent across divisions of the corporation."
good,"Developed and maintained a high degree of positive visibility for Wells Fargo Bank brand in the marketplace. "
good,I started at the bottom of this company and was able to rise up through the ranks and find success in area's I never dreamed of.  I appreciated their promote from within mentality.
good,"inconsistent demands when working at times, but fair when decisions are made for displacement. "
good,"learned alot of management and relationship building."
good,This is a Wells Fargo branch so my answer remains consistent with my previous reviews. The lawsuit is very much affecting branch culture in a negative way.
good,"It was a great company to work for, and my direct team was fantastic! The issues came in with upper management. They had been in my managers role 10+ years ago, so they weren't able to relate to the modern customer. "
good,typical customer service bank we have a lot of work behind the scenes a lot that can sometimes feel like busy work more than anything productive currently in transition from sales based to more customer oriented
good,"They could use an overhaul in managers throughout many departments. They have a tendency to hire heavy in the manager department, then they all have their favorites. They all run in packs. When one leaves, the next crony gets advanced. When one gets pushed out to another department, you sit back and watch three or four of the favorites get taken along, over more of the deserving employees who may have taken the correct steps and posted for the positions through the proper channels. Makes it next to impossible to advance."
good,It's important that you interview the department as much as they are interviewing you. Make sure you sync well and it will all be ok.
good,"customer service---customer is greet and offer opportunity--sales and goal. learning about saving, ira and investment. I learn educate customer and myself about retirement"
good,"Training is overwhelming at times especially if you are new to banking and financial concepts. After practice and repetition you'll get the basics down very well and you'll start to be very smooth on the phones. Management was okay , they didn't seem to invest in you, it's more of if you want to move up you have to show that interest . Put in the work and you'll get good results! Some of the Quotas asked to meet made the job stressful , but other than that shift was good and the people who I worked with were easy to relate to and have conversation with!"
good,"Joined the firm and within months things changed.... the core team of people I have had the opportunity to interact with are great. Some leaders are great, most aren't, it's unfortunate."
good,"Although I loved all of my coworkers, the pressure from management to meet sales goals outweighed it. The constant stress that management would put on you was very uncomfortable."
good,When i worked at Wells Fargo the culture was completely different then now. All the things that came out in the news about their sales practice was true. From what I have heard from my former colleagues who work there it has now changed.
good,"Loved working with the people that I got to know. good company to work for pay could be a lot better if you got the experience, if you looking for a company to grow with and move forward into another position then this is not the job. seems like you had to know people and it was a lot of favoritism."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for with endless opportunities to grow and learn multiple businesses across the bank.
good,"Working at wells, made me connect with some many costumers. Before coming into this company, I never expected to connect with this many people and working with great staffs. What I learned about this job was being responsible and owning up to my own actions. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know everyone (customers and team members) as an individual."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day is 8 hours long, but on Fridays, they are cut a little short for this weekly event called, ""Beer and Share,"" when everyone in the office has a beer and shares their week."
good,"I really enjoyed helping customers re-build or establish credit, get themselves into better financial situations or debt consolidations. Financial stress can be overwhelming. At Wells Fargo it's not about helping customers, it was about sales, sales, sales. I understand that a business needs to work at a profit to stay in business. However there was no satisfying their appetite for money."
good,"Good coworkers for the most part, learn a lot about the financial industry, decent benefits, great time off to start. "
good,"very sales oriented environment, stable bank, national bank with alot of branches, team environment, community involved, opportunities for advancement, training is mostly done through virtual process"
good,If you are from the LGBT this is a very open and accepting company to work for. With everything thats going on with the company in the news they are working hard to rebuild the image.
good,"Days are long and tedious, but the whole building is very inviting and pretty. The break oasis is sleek and modern with a very efficient design. The managers are very nice and helpful, also. On the downside, however, the job security is an issue and you can be let go at any time, even once you're a full employee."
good,"Great co workers and overall, a good place to work.  Too much fat around mid market managers who really have no say. Working at Wells is good but you can expect the unexpected."
good,"I was promoted to banker after graduating from college. I did not really enjoy the job. You will build a few transferrable skills, such as lead generation, sales, customer service, and some marketing techniques. However, retail banking is sort of a dying industry and I would not recommend that anyone stay in this position for more than a year. Most people will find better rates and little to no fees at a credit union or non-brick-and-mortar bank. This is extremely disadvantageous to a sales person. Additionally, you will be faced will moral quandaries on a daily basis, as many economically unfortunate customers will receive $30 service fees that you will get reprimanded for reversing. "
good,"Our team provides a convenient, disciplined, and accountable process for providing a financial plan for our clients, their friends and family. Each plan is customized around the clients tolerance to accept risk."
good,Managers were very immature and the overall job atmosphere was very laid back. The company was disorganized and had a lack of integrity regarding upper management's treatment of team members.
good,The financial services field can be very challenging and rewarding at the same time. I found the people that you deal with on a day to day basis to be professional and helpful.
good,"large area of growth "
good,"Good company, awesome benefits, but the jobs for downtown Lebanon in 8th street has a very unprofessional manager that's has caused many employees to quit and more are to leave soon. Stay away from that branch unless you are planning on been there for a year at the most. Try for other branches like Quenting road branch awesome place to work!"
good,"Overall Wells Fargo is a great place to work for but at least in this district if they stop giving management positions based on favoritism staff might not feel like they are apart of a dictatorship. If it was more about the job and customers and less about politics, sales, and who likes who it would be even better."
good,"Enjoyed the location of the the job, but had no opportunities for growth. Wells Fargo had a great ability to provide fun morale boosting activities, but felt stuck in my position."
good,"Get to work, start morning procedures, branch opens a couple minutes early, and in comes a swarm of business to start the day. With a year of experience I help many of the other tellers, everyone is very helpful. I've learned how to multitask as well as talk through those ""hard conversations"" with customers. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company in that there is a lot of room for advancement. However, tellers, lead tellers and bankers are extremely underpaid for the amount of work they have to do, and the customers they have to deal with. There's a lot of pressure on sales, and your managers only care about your numbers. They also always have their favorites."
good,Wells Fargo brought tight structure and a firm day to day routine. Routine day brought many interactions with clients and an opportunity to assist them in their financial need.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"i learned a lot of skills around language and professionalism, how to coach others and how to advance my skill set in selling products"
good,A typical day was servicing the customers with a high level of customer service. I learned a lot about being a good listner and showing empathy. My co-workers were typical people and were team players. Management was typical to each day.
good,"Great place to work! Management was a tab bit all over the place but otherwise, a decent place to work. Co-workers were helpful and kind. Hardest part was all of the customer traffic that this particular branch collected. So many customers, you have to beg your manager for a 5 minute break to breath."
good,"Work was very oriented to maintaining quotas regardless of whether the loan was time consuming or not.  My immediate manager was very helpful and supportive, though, as well as co-workers being helpful.  Completing a difficult loan was very satisfying."
good,"I processed daily cash deposits and withdraws for customers and businesses. "
good,"Great benefits provided by this company, unfortunately full time was not offered. Had to travel to different locations just to earn a few more hours each week."
good,Definitely a company with a lot of growth potential. I began as a Monday/ Friday teller and worked my way up to Store Manager.
good,Learned new things everyday! Very much enjoyed  the interaction with customers everyday. Co-workers very friendly and willing to help in any way.  Hardest part of the job is not being able to have time off because of the turn over being so high.
good,"Work is usually very stressful and tiring but with the help of management and coworkers it makes the day go by easily."
good,"I worked the banking industry my entire career. I really enjoyed working with my various teams. I learned that you have to treat employees with respect and they will give their best to perform and complete their task. The hardest part of the job was having to layoff an employee. But when done with no surprises, it generally worked out okay."
good,"Wells Fargo Dealer Services was acquired when Wachovia was obtained by Wells during the bank financial crisis. The environment at Dealer services was completely different than the environment of the branch. "
good,"on the phone constantly, couldn't even breath in between calls. "
good,"I've signed a ton of NDAs so i can give basic answers"
good,"Opening the branch and getting ready for your day is usually hectic. It is rare that everyone gets there on time so usually only two people are doing the majority of opening procedures. At certain locations the branch manager is unavailable. However, there are opportunities to move within the company. But once you move in the company, you can't move again for 12 months."
good,"hard work will only get you far Must be a  business oriented must always be thinking on how and when you can make a deal. Always keeps you on your toes, always looking to make a deal even when they tell you no. Must have a thick skin."
good,"It was good unless the Management changed and everything seems to be really akward, for one point of time it will be good but for longer period"
good,"I've stayed for over 10 years due to the benefits (medical, time off, etc). Since ObamaCare ruined medical, there's one less reason to stay. "
good,"Typical work day as a supervisor would consist of side by side and call review coaching with bankers, Coaching also consist of role playing products and customer service skills. Each supervisor is also has a champion role ( ex, quality assurance, lending, diversity, mentor program) You would attend various meetings daily such as compliance, performance metrics, call productivity to understand business needs. As a supervisor you are also respondsible for delivering corrective action, monthly/ quarter/ annual reviews, updating payroll and mentoring Team Leads for a supervisor role"
good,Answer customer calls.  Heavy emphasis on pushing new products.  Co-workers are great.  Management a little week.  Lack of follow through and imagination.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"•	Handled and processed customer mortgage accounts"
good,My particular location was a DUD. The Manager was a Duche and didn't care for our personal lives or families. There was a time I ask to go home early because i was feeling ill and felt a fever coming on but it was a rushed/busy day so i understand they want all hands on deck but i literally stood there for another 1.5-2.5 hours shaking and sweating trying not to throw up. and all the service manager and store manager had to say was- good job- that wasn't so bad. they didn't even offer me a chance to go home when i ran to the bathroom and threw up even if i asked again.
good,"Access Secured Collateral Accounts through In-House Server. Confirm Vesting, Parcel Identification Numbers and Legal Descriptions using In-House Scanned DOTs.  Research Parcel Tax Schedules, Payments and Delinquencies, Tax Sale Dates and Redemption Periods, using Internet, E-mail, Facsimile and Telephone.  Update and Enter Payments and Delinquencies via In-House Software.  Report Delinquencies, Tax Sale Dates and Redemption Periods To Foreclosure and Bankruptcy Departments when Applicable.  Analyze Equity Report to Determine Feasibility of Payment, Order Consent for Payment and Checks.  Prepare and Federal Express Appropriate Payments."
good,This job doesn't allow for incremental training but does allow for schedule changes. Some managers are approachable and Human Resources is helpful
good,"I still can't believe how management managed to hire racist or bigoted individuals who were in charge of groups of people. Nor could I understand how co-workers were given free reign to treat each other very badly and even while on the phone with clients. Then again it was not my choice to work in Mortgage Collections. I was told the only remaining openings were in Collections. There was no such thing as a typical day. For almost nine months I had a ""group leader"" who was easy to work with, except for the time(s) when I had to deal with other employees on the phone with clients in 3-way calls. Abruptly I was moved to work for another person who was just plain impossible"
good,"Fast paced work environment which helps you deal with alot of tasks at once, with a high focus on sales. Management was decent the hours were kind of odd."
good,The company as a whole is great. But I think the Management team in some departments should sometimes look at the person and not just the bottom line.
good,"work life balance is okay, goal are obtainable. training could be a better and more hands on. learning the system was fairly easy and the trainers are amazing!"
good,Wells Fargo offers great pay and benefits. But does not put customer first. High focus on selling customers products and services and getting the customer off the phone as soon as possible.
good,"My day as an account manager is a very busy day and everyday is different.  My day begins with opening my Outlook and see what I have scheduled for that specific day.  My day consists of multiple meetings, answering emails, phone calls, schedule training classes with my housing agencies and handle any escalations that come in that day.  For example try to stop foreclosures, address any issues that the counselors might have with client relationship with Wells Fargo and avoiding Wells Fargo to be reported to the attorney general for mishandling of the borrower and their property. Having to prioritize my day so that I can finish everything that I have to do within my regular work day."
good,"Excellent work place and helpful in learning new things everyday."
good,I loved working here but they laid of a lot of people frequently. The management doesn't help you really. Their all about money & that's it.
good,"Always understaffed, mandatory 8 to 10 hours OT plus most Saturdays and some holidays for well over a year and still in place."
good,"I worked in a call center environment. This is not a good job for someone who really likes to take the time to help people. Everything was based on measurements and this does not allow you to achieve the best results for your customer. It does not prevent you however, from doing your best in a difficult situation"
good,"I am currently a Managed Resouce through Palmer group, working at Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo doesn't treat their Managed Resource employees very well."
good,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage offers an excellent Benefits Package (medical, dental, matching 401k, Profit Sharing, etc.).  The Compensation is not the greatest, but management does distribute Leads and provide opportunities to partner with a Wells Fargo Bank and/or Real Estate Office in order to generate more leads. The management in Colorado Springs is excellent and offers a Mentorship Program for those wanting to advance within the company."
good,I worked for the company when it was Wachovia Bank. So I don't have a review to offer about Wells Fargo. I continue to bank here and have a mortgage with the company...
good,Typically the average work day was nice. I think the company focuses entirely too much on sells rather than focusing on the customer. Benefits were nice and if you have a well working team with good management you should be fine. I didn't have that type of experience though.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"If you are still in school or just looking to get your foot in the door then Wells Fargo is the place for you. It is a great place to work during the summer for college kids looking to make some extra money. It is relaxed, casual attire, fast-paced environment. Perfect place to start a career."
good,"It was a busy branch so we stayed busy. I learned how to give 100% customer service. I loved the team members, I made many friends"
good,"Fast pace detailed work environment, process are "
good,All about the numbers and Core Values. Willing to listen to and work with it's employees. Very big on growth and personal development.
good,"For as much money, and profit the bank makes every year, the company keeps lowering their pay to bankers, and making compensation plans even more difficult, and out of reach."
good,over all working there it's a fast environment to work for. co workers are great people to work with. new changes all the time.
good,"Fun place to work with supportive managers. Every one is treated with dignity and respect."
good,"I loved being a teller. On the other hand I wish the sales were not so detrimental, it grew very stressful for my tellers I supervised. Don't get me wrong it can be done, I led sales for 2 years consecutive. Unfortunately, its never enough for this company."
good,"I managed REO properties not only in my local area, where I was able to be directly involved with the asset from beginning to end, I was also in charge of REO properties across the country. I handled properties in 7 different states with a wide range of values. I had a great management team, as well as co-workers that were always there to share ideas and help out any way possible."
good,"I have learned many things at my time with Wells Fargo. I have been employed with them for almost 18 years. The company started out as 1,500 employees, and now they have grown to over 90,000 employees. I have been through several mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. I have learned to adapt to each company each time, and continue to learn about new technology, as it changes daily. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the people, and the environment. I work with some extraordinary people, and that is what has kept me here. There are some downfalls, where there is no room to grow anymore. I would like to continue my career growth."
good,most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help custimers who was actaully in need the fact i could make sombody day with one phone call talking to me and getting them the help they needed.
good,Call center environment. High Pace work flow. Management are more concerned with meeting goals than helping employees grow within the company. Diverse group of co-workers in call center. The hardest part of the job was taking 100+ inbound calls a shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my co-workers.
good,Wells Fargo had great benefits but when it comes to pay they are behind the boat. Even top performers in the department only would receive a 1% yearly raise. This causes many people to leave departments after a year to seek out higher salaries.
good,Good benefits.  A good amount of politics that makes most days stressful.  Telecommuting opportunities are not part of the culture so it is not my ideal workplace.
good,The typical day is what you make it. I learned a lot about banking and regulations. Standard co-workers. The hardest part of the job was doing redundant task that hinder efficiency. We had cool office parties and worked together.
good,Working in a banking environment you are required to be accurate and meticulous at all times. There were many financial and money management strategies I learned during the time of employment.
good,"Too sales focus, not focus enough on compliance. Too often saw ""sales stars"" be rewarded just to be fired later for gaming. Co-workers all seemed to be easy to work with, occasionally had confrontation but always easy to resolve."
good,"it's a retail job like any other, only with a more consistent schedule. advancement is both politically and socially charged; who you know and what you've done to highlight your work experience/made them look better."
good,"the work to having a life ratio can get a little rocky "
good,making sure that customers did have their accounts in order and when needed they would have me do floor support. I would make sure that the customers account fees and service charges were explained and reversed if at all possible
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Feedback loops are faulty for job performance review. Performance reviews are given indirectly, rather than receiving direct feedback from management."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company for work for, but they are always looking for ways to let people go for the smallest things. "
good,Supportive company that hires within.  Employees are encouraged to seek development opportunities to obtain career growth.
good,"Great place to work for if you don't mind being micro-managed. They push sells harder then any other company i have worked for. Don't get me wrong, I'm use to the demand of sales, but this company breathes different metrics and sales."
good,"Overall good company to work for with opportunities to network, volunteer in the community. Fast-paced environment with multiple task through out the day."
good,Wells Fargo provides thier employees with the best training and provides the tools/ resources necessary to get the job done.
good,fun place to work at and to start. just make sure to keep your option. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you have a great connection with regular customer.
good,"8 hour shifts answering phones. "
good,"Great company to work for. Corporate America setting sometimes make it seem like opinion doesn't matter. Excellent benefits, and compensation."
good,Logged into computer and spent the day reviewing imaged documents and calling merchants regarding any discrepancies. Received and distributed mail . Completed online tasks within the allotted time frame as assigned. Tracked volume of information on spreadsheets. Helped to load level for other departments when necessary.
good,"Online customer service is a great way for Wells Fargo to determine if you are good enough to work for them in the long run. They do this by keeping the OCS team severely understaffed constantly. Why is it understaffed? Well when you need high sales numbers, low handle time and constant referrals it causes a high turnover rate. THE whole infrastructure is doomed if they continue this way. They make it so that you have to deal with that job for a YEAR before you can go to a new department. The thing is though, you have to have good sales numbers to go anywhere. IF you are like me and just want to provide great customer service to make sure the clients problems are all taken care of well go somewhere else... the business model here is to cross sell to everyone regardless of what has been going on with their situation."
good,"a good day to day staff. "
good,"This was my 1st bank and compared to other banks that I've worked for, this was not that impressive at the branch level. Worked there for two years. Experience was good with management. Regions doesn't seem too aggressive just seems happy with the market share they currently have and willing to hire whomever just to fill up certain slots."
good,"A typical day at work is hard, dealing with customers who don't know how to manage their own bank account. Being yelled at and being told you don't do your job correct or the company sucks. Having to meet a monthly quota is quite ridiculous, since not all customers can pay off their accounts."
good,"Intense sales pressure makes this company a tough one to continue to work for.  Some shady business practices in an industry known for these kinds of things.  Management is well trained and very supportive, but company limits on where you can go."
good,"Production numbers can outstrip possibility, and you may be micro-managed by someone who does not know your job and its limitations very well. Co-workers were friendly, however, and you will spend a lot of time with them. Not a lot of freedom. Close to the definition of drudgery. At the time, though, they were hiring when few companies were. Jobs are very subject to market rises and falls, so job security is tenuous, but they will try to move laid off employees to elsewhere in the company if they can, and severance packages are available if you have been with the company long enough."
good,It's a big company to work for. Management is a little all over the place. They don't treat temps well. Stressful department
good,It was ok but too much pressure on sales it is a great job to start off with. Have to make sure your giving and recieivng the right amount of money
good,at this time there have been so much changes with the department it puts a lot of stress. however once you can over come all the new changes its pretty fun.
good,Wachovia is a banks call center I worked for. The supervisors and lower managment made it a great place to work. They were bought out by wells fargo and everyone got fired
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Worked with other employees as a team to help get our goals met  The team worked well together and that meant that we were able to have rewards from out manager if we got info in for the goals that were set for us.  Sometimes the environment could be very stressful but with the upbeat attitudes of my teammates easier to handle.
good,"A typical day at work is about 80 calls, of these we have sales goals to meet while servicing. Ive learned that no matter what your bank account looks like we all live the same only that some bills and clothes are just pricier but same people underneath. Management is ok, co-workers, hardest part of my job here is not having the in person interaction, not having the opportunity to help people as much as I'd like and at times feeling like a machine and not a human being, it only counts when youre there. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to people from different parts of the world."
good,"Managed first and second level support desks, with daily interaction between customers and employees.  Daily administrative duties along with technical knowledge were required."
good,"do the work and you will see growth in the company, dont and you will be relieved of your job. plenty of opportunities to advance but only with aggressive sales goals being met."
good,"Good place for work/life balance, but not if you are looking to advance your career. They are not good about continuing education and work environment is poor."
good,"its been very long time, where people staff left and went to work for Broadcom."
good,Typically my day consist of customers service with an emphasis on sales. The management team is very helpful. I think the hardest part about the job is not being able to help customers when you understand there situation. The most enjoyable part is finding creative ways to wow customers.
good,"Brokers were very competitive with one another; not a learning atmosphere for recent graduates"
good,"engaging in customers in a fast paced work environment, easy to make mistakes so you have to be on top of everything you do and double check your work. pitch sales to every customer and use scripting."
good,"I love being a bank teller but as soon as Wachovia moved to Wells Fargo they were more about getting accounts open, selling products and referrals. I'm not a sales woman and hated that part of the job. The hours, vacation and benefits were great but the pressure of selling was horrible."
good,I've learned a lot in my work experience with my current company. There is ample opportunity for growth and promotion if you work hard.
good,"It was a nice place to work until you found out the management team is lackluster at best (does not include everyone). The site manager was disconnected from the ""Laymen."" Also if you want to get hired for no reason and laid off less than a year later, by all mean join"
good,This is a great place to work for.  It's a casual dress which makes it easier to work.  Management is always on the go and you gotta keep up your stamina to keep up with their schedules.
good,Work is steady and the job hours are pretty consistent.  Many times there seems to be a disconnect between upper management and employees.
good,Learned a lot about customer service. Did a lot of multitasking which made turned you in a fast thinker. Learned a lot from a banking aspect.
good,"Majority of the department works from 7-3:30. It was a small but friendly department."
good,"Greeted customers and helped with whatever brought them in. Being"
good,"This is a good company with great compensation. They try to help you as much as possible at first. Then when training is over on the floor you are pushed to perform and press referrals of products onto customers. Which is against the company code of ethics, but in Salem if you don't force a product on the customer you are threatened with your job. So if you can handle this type of job atmosphere have at it."
good,"Support Infrastructure for 31,000 Market Data customers "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Process customer transactions, maintain customer interaction, be positive and friendly.  Sell products that the customer may need.  Resolve difficult customer issues."
good,"4 promotions in 6 years, compensated generously for them all; however, still couldn't find the enjoyment of retail banking so I decided to look for a career change.  The retail side of banking had lost its ""customer focus"" and decided to go towards more of sales based incentives and I feel as if Wells began looking at their customers as pieces in a puzzle, not the valued customers that they needed to ensure a healthy business model.  When I left I was at a level where if a customer came in and wanted to empty every asset account they had, I wouldn't even bat an eye if it were under a 1/4 million dollars.  My point being, that Wells is too big for their own good.  I also managed a location that made over $50,000 a month in fee income from their customers, I personally think having that money back in the economy would be more beneficial that padding Well's bottom line.  That was a single location, when I left there were 59 locations in the Denver metro, you do the math."
good,"On the phones constantly.  My immediate supervisors were very helpful.  Hardest part of the job is having someone ""over your shoulder"" all day."
good,"OK place to work, development is highly encouraged but not much room for growth."
good,"good company, but the salary doesn't match the work load.  I've been in the industry for a long time so policy and procedures do change but they change almost daily there.  I think everyone there helps each other to get through it and management is fair.  Just underpaid for what is expected."
good,"I enjoyed my job with the contest they had each week for us to meet out goals."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place for advancement when you do well in sales. Sometimes it is a good but it becomes ineffective when that great sales person is NOT a good manager.
good,"Great job before I enlisted in the US Navy.  I worked with great people and had great bosses.  It was a very friendly work environment.  If I never would have left for the Navy, I would have kept my foot in the door at Wells Fargo."
good,"Open accounts, maintain accounts daily, replace debit cards, call clients and sell them upgrades on their accounts, work with the tellers to open new accounts and upgrade account holders with a higher account balance"
good,"a typical day at work was never a relaxed moment, information was hard to come by that was needed to do the job, unfair management, the hardest part of the job was not having the info needed to do the job timely, you always get info needed after the fact, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with a diverse group of people learning how so much alike we all really are"
good,"Wells Fargo is a mix of a bunch. Sometimes you have great people working and other times you don't. They push sales - even if there's no opportunity to. Job Advancement is great if you are hiring within the district, if you hit your numbers you will be promoted right away- but I applied for jobs in the Los Angeles area from Bay Area and it has been a pain. I was told that I wasn't even guaranteed a job in that area even though I've worked for Wells Fargo for years."
good,"Wells Fargo is a place where you really learn about sales. I've been in sales a little while and I must say this has been a most educational experience. But, the bottom line is Wells doesn't reward it's employees like other companies did.   Over here on the East Coast, Wells Fargo Purchased Wachovia. Bank.  Wachovia Banker 2 could make a 6 figure salary.  Wells Banker 2 Makes 55k at the very best. Banker 1 makes 40k at very best payout.  "
good,"its a great company to work for they just want you to push sales and I am not a sales person. so that the mangers can bonus. lots of regulars come in on a daily basis including merchants and lots of older customers that need something to do. we have lines we don't have enough tellers all the time so keeping customer happy is hard sometimes because who likes to stand in a line the hardest part is trying to keep non customers happy by cashing there checks sometimes they dint have the proper i.d. etc... and after they have been standing line for 20 min or more they are not happy. I have learned to tolerate demanding management and customers. and most of the other employee speaking spanish around me which i feel is rude you feel your being excluded from converstaions, it's also frustrating try to care of non- english speaking cust. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the relationships i have made with my customers."
good,"It was a good job--the pay was awesome, there was a cafeteria with great food, the people were cool, and the job was a good mix of phone conversation and data-entry. Unfortunately, I was laid off (temp assignment terminated) without warning with no counseling to improve or anything. The manager told us Monday that if we weren't making the goals by Friday, we should contact him a reason for this...and then I was laid off Tuesday. It hurt because I had finally gotten all the equipment set up (I didn't have a callback number until about 2 days before I was laid off) and my numbers were already improving as a result."
good,"Overall, Wells Fargo attracts good talent and smart people.  However, there is little collaboration and they are set in their methods and ways. The strict culture is demoralizing, lacks motivation, and results in talented people leaving after a short time."
good,"A typical day went by without a hitch, the environment lacks stimulation. The hardest part of the job was figuring out exactly what to do."
good,"I had the opportunity to work with very experienced and professional individuals. This has been great in developing my career, and understanding of the retail banking. My manager and Private Banker have over 55 years of experience to share with me, and I certainly have utilized that."
good,"This company for me was an ok company to work for. Day to day work varied sometime it was slow and others were busy. I learned a lot as it pertains to the how a bank functions, rules and regulations and mostly how to maintain my  own accounts. Management was supportive although at times completely unprofessional. My co-workers were easy to get along with and were always willing to help. The hardest part of the job was meeting my daily quota of getting new accounts, the reason for that was almost every customer were repeat customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the different people and hearing interesting stories about them."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company, however the call center environment is draining."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I provided customer service and banking sales to a high volume of Wells Fargo customers.  I learned to service a wide variety of calls and customers, along with tons of banking knowledge.  My coworkers were like comrades and an excellent support group.  The hardest part of the job, aside from difficult customers was meeting a very demanding sales quota.  The most enjoyable part of the job was fellowship with my coworkers."
good,"Trending analysis, risk, AML.  Conducts investigations, audits, and submits recommendations to management concerning customers and industry risks."
good,Have been lucky to be working a great and diverse company. In the time with Wells Fargo I have been great opportunities to grow within the company. I have been promoted 3 times in the last 2 years.
good,"A place to work.  Micromanagement depends on supervisor, with one office being drastically different than the next."
good,"I worked with an amazing team, I loved banking, I hated the sales culture and requirements and the threat to my job if my team were unable to meet unrealistic sales goals"
good,"On the Phones all day, had great co-workers hardest part turning down Customers for help with Mortgage."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job: co-workers"
good,Employees do get lot of opportunities to explore themselves to be more productive and enthusiastic towards work.
good,If you like to be Micro Managed and someone constantly talking to you about numbers to make the company successful and not care about you as an individual. Then this is the company for you. I do all job requirements for my job but still do not receive the managerial support needed for my job.
good,"Good place to work for"
good,One of the big Financial Company. Good place to work with very good work-life balance.
good,"Typical day included opening branch store and securing night deposit bags and processing workable bags, preparing for the customers whether with a branch meeting of products and services or any necessary security measures that needed to be discussed or reviewed.We processed customers deposits, cashed checks and processed a variety of transactions and discussed other bank services that would benefit the customer."
good,Management expects more and more out of employees but no incentive. Ianagers cannot do my job if when asked to. I like my co workers. Answering phones all day and being on the phone all day is mentally stressful.
good,"I performed financial transactions as a teller here."
good,"I liked the people I worked with; I got along with my coworkers and the majority of customers, especially the usuals. The social interactions were the best part. However, I did not enjoy the high sales and customer service pressure that was enforced. Also, it is very difficult to move up in the company. I had many coworkers who worked very hard for the company and hardly got anything for it."
good,"Everyday my primary tasks would be assisting members with their financial needs. This included monetary transactions, opening accounts and  credit-lines, and providing bankers with necessary information to further assists Wells Fargo's Members. In this environment I was exposed to the financial world in both a individual and business aspects. The most difficult parts of the job was dealing with extremely irate customers that demanded things I could not provide and driving sales for the bank. The most enjoyable part of the job was having that face to face interaction with people."
good,"You will take about 50-60 calls per day. Ever changing environment so being adaptable is a must. My position was online customer service representative and I was surprised at how strong the focus on sales was. Overall Wells Fargo is a decent place to work they have a strong values, one that stands out is their view on diversity,"
good,Job Review-worked in the operations hub for the Kansas City Market. We processed the daily deposits and activities of assets for clients.
good,"~ A typical day at work in this particular department was painful. You never know what incorrect information you will receive from the Department Head "
good,A typical day consists of many functions that allows me to multitask. The most difficult part is getting all assignments done in a timely manner. I enjoy working in a team environment and there is room for growth and oppurtunity nationwide.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I did mortgage loans in Dallas, Tarrant, Johnson, Ellis, Hamilton and Somervell counties. This required a great deal of traveling."
good,"Feels like managers are on ones back all day about sales and numbers for the pipeline. "
good,I received inbound calls from customer that had there identify take plus money was also taken from their accounts. I would take anywhere from 30 to 60 calls a day. I enjoyed helping people get their money back.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the fact that could help people to improve their financial situation.
good,"I enjoyed my stint at Wells-Fargo. Great meeting and talking with varying types of people, which was perfect for someone such as myself. The only gripe I had against working there was the difficulty in being granted Paid Time Off when it was requested. Depending on the location/ branch you're employed, there can be a possibility that the staff you work with is not enough for the work flow. There was a trickling down effect of the company's inability to delegate roving tellers to the places that need them the most. Which would require schedules to be made on Fridays prior to the upcoming week, working more hours than you agreed to upon starting with the company, and schedules to be changed on the fly. This can pose some issues, as it led to why I no longer work with the company. For anyone who begins working with the company, make sure you keep a copy of all your PTO request and the schedules made. Cover all your bases."
good,"Ok place to work, nothing I can really think of that will make me do a review."
good,As an consumer loan underwriter have various resources to complete your daily work.   At times the work load can get crazy but that really makes the work day go fast.   Co-workers are very friendly and eager to help one another and share best practices.
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo  was great. I had the best co-workers that stuck by me and helped me through the day. I learned Home Preservation and how to manage home loan accounts. The hardest part of this job was to see a borrower go into foreclosure and lose their home.
good,Underwrote conventional loans and communicated with processing and loan officers
good,"Wells Fargo is too big with far to many employees to pin down and label good or bad.  Management, staff and even culture will differ between business units and offices.  This company values commitment and hard work.  This company is good place to cut teeth and jump to smaller company with a more caring and intimate atmosphere.  Too easy to get lost and subdued in large outfit."
good,Co-workers are very friendly and we have great team who works well with each other. The hardest part of the job is referrals and meeting goals which same throughout the company and when the branch you work at is slow one it is very hard to meet the goals and expectations. Meeting service goals can be very tricky too. Most I love about my job is meeting new people and great team who supports you.
good,Process documents eight hours a day. I learned that large banks have to many computer programs that don't talk to each other very well. I also learned that you are micro managed. I did learn a lot about loan documentation and also met some great people.
good,Always full of work and most of the times we had to stretch to complete the targets. In every quarter there would be one outing or team lunch.Management is good and they are supportive. If you are not happy with current manager you can escalate to higher manager. Learning and development courses would be there to learn new things and team building activities.Most enjoyable part free to express feelings if anything goes wrong.
good,process deposits and withdrawls for customers. I was also responsible for balancing my cash drawer daily as well as the vault.
good,"Wells Fargo's name is notorious with great banks.  It's a huge company that you feel proud to work for.  The resources and training are bountiful.  The company is so far reaching you feel as though you can help anyone with anything.  It was wonderful working in finance, there wasn't a single product you could offer someone that wouldn't help them."
good,"Typical day is spent holding appointments, originating loans, referring business, and coaching tellers. I learned the basics about retail banking, residential credit, and investments. Change in managerial structure from Wachovia to Wells Fargo. Good co-workers. Hardest part was micro management."
good,I have only worked for this company as a contractor.   I was not overly pleased with the culture  or the management at the time prior to its purchase by Wells Fargo…
good,"Assist customers with financial needs, find products that cab benefit each individual to help them succeed financially. I have learned a lot about finances, learning about each product and the benefits of them, so I can sell them to our customers. I have worked at two different Wells Fargo locations, management was different from my first Wells Fargo to my second. My first Wells Fargo, we were like family, they cared about you as an employee and we had many team get togethers. At the current Wells Fargo, management is very unprofessional and they do not seem to care about you as an employee or their customers, all they care about are sales. The hardest part of my job is selling, I am not the best fit for selling products, although I know how and I have been in retail most of my life. Selling is very different from clothing stores to banks, when a customer says they are not interested in a product I will sell it to them in a different way and if they are still not interested then I let it go. The reason being is because I do not like to be bothered with a product I am not interested in. You can sell it to me a million ways and I still will not be interested, so I that is what I think about when I am selling to a customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people, I love working and conversing with them, I want to help them financially, not necessarily sell them something."
good,I would start off by saying that my time at Wells Fargo has been spent learning and understanding the process for which I was hired to do.  While it gave me a broader perspective of what has gone on in the mortgage industry it has also made me see that there is still a lot that large banks and lenders still need to learn about doing the right thing.  I was able to sharpen my skills as a QC analyst but quickly realized with politics and too many hands in the cookie jar.  A process that should be streamlined was complicated by a lack of understanding and knowledge.
good,"Fun place to work, provided opportunity for growth. Management was supportive and friendly. Training was ongoing which helped build a very strong and effective team."
good,"If you're looking to make Wells Fargo into a career this is a great please to look. If you do what is required of you and you do it well, you will be recognized. Always hiring within the company and opportunities to advance are greatly given."
good,"Busy, and productive days that sometimes could be stressful due to performance guidlines."
good,nothing to say but i got laid off after almost 5 years becuase i didnt hit my sales goals for 2 months in almost 5 years. I always exceeded their goals by double prior to this temporary slump.
good,A reasonable work environment. Large company with chance to advance technically.
good,"wells argo was a great experience, people were friemdly and customers was very homely but no chance of advancement"
good,A typical day at work starts off with sales and ends with sales. Wells Fargo seems to have alot of turnover. Most enjoyable time i have at work is getting to know my co workers and customers.
good,"Demanding environment"
good,It all depends on who your leader. Had a great manager but when she left we lost leadership and was not able to get it back with the new manager.
good,Wachovia/Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. Never a dull moment
good,"This job focused on sales to our clients and assisting them with their banking needs. I learned many things about general banking practices and how to assist our customers in the best way possible. Management was back and forth and was heavy on favoritism. The hardest part of the job was meeting the required sales goals when my interest was in supplying our customers with the services they needed. We had a great team at our branch which can be hard to find, very enjoyable group."
good,"If you like an aggressive sales goal environment, this place is for you. It's not a hard job, just mentally stressful. They provide you with great vacation time, as you will need to take it in order to stay engaged throughout the year."
good,"good when busy."
good,"Wells Fargo is good place to work to get your foot in the door, and along with that you learn a lot in relation to banking.  It is not a company that you can work for the rest of your life because management creates a lot of unnecessary stress that is unhealthy for any person in this environment."
good,I work at Wells Fargo for 5 years where I extended my knowledge in the customer service area. there is a lot of opportunity for growth because I started as a teller end up the lead/teller manager and a training coach for the new hire
good,The people are great and customers are interesting. Learning more about banking and health care is a big plus.
good,"Being  a Teller the day would start early by pulling the ATM, night drop and getting ready to wait on customers.  I gained a great deal of customer service skills.  My co-workers were a great team, we accomplished a lot during the day.  The hardest part of the job was having to deal with mean customers, but the most enjoyable was our fun customers that made the day."
good,"I loved to work with the customers, however I didn't like ""selling"" them things they didn't need just to meet a sales quota."
good,"Provide customer service to a wide variety of customers and meet their needs through open new accounts, loans, maintenance and referring to other banking partners."
good,"Gather information from prospects for insurance quotes, prepare presentations, meet with clients to discuss insurance needs, process new groups as well as terminations, maintain confidential health records and private information for over 100 client groups, help resolve claim issues, inform clients of changes in the health insurance due to PACA act.  Enter data into the computer system to maintain all information regarding our groups and individual clients Am a self starter and don't require a lot of supervision.  Work well as a team to achieve the correct end results.  The company has many tools to help employees achieve the results desired, but is hard to find them on line.  Lack of training for new employees is their biggest downfall.  However, I am happy with the job I have and feel most satisfied when I can help resolve issues or make a client feel better in some way.  Many of my clients and I have become good friends over the years mostly due to the services and help I have offered in the past years."
good,Main objective is to collect money on accounts that are delinquent/past due. Skip Trace is necessary when customers are not available. I learned how to be a team player and how to help customers cure there accounts by setting up proper payment arrangements. Co-workers were diverse and had different ethnicities and ranged from different ages. Hardest part of the job is when your not able to help the customer and have to repossess their car. The most enjoyable is when you help the customer get current and hang up knowing you did everything you can to help them
good,Make and receive phone calls all day and collect money on past due accounts.
good,Same type day became very long and tiresome after to many years.
good,There was a real struggle for work/life balance. My co-workers were fine but we were all stretched to capaity
good,"Working with Wells Fargo was a wonderful start towards my career ladder. I had great teller training. I also gain so much experience from it. I am capable of running the branch and managing it when is needed. My coworkers were an awesome team when we work together. A typical day at work would include coming in, opening up the branch, get my cash draw set up along with my station. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing new customers and being able to assist them financially. In my opinion, there wasn't a hard part of the job. I was with the job for a year so I became accustomed to the transactions and environment."
good,"Although I enjoyed working there, there was always a sense of nervous energy. The systems were relatively up-to-date but suffered from poor user friendly screens."
good,Wells Fargo is a well oiled machine.  Enjoyed people to work around.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for, but a lot of pressure. Average 10-12 hour work days."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cashing and depositing checks, depositing cash, currency exchanges, offering products to customers, encouraging non-customers to open accounts, open/close procedures, providing great customer service to both new and regular customers as well as creating relationships with the routine customers."
good,The difficulty with Wells Fargo is their management style and lack of constructive criticism.  Very few managers are willing to tell you what steps you can take to become more effective in your position in order to move up within Wells Fargo. With a well put together team the job can be enjoyable and the benefits and pay are about the best you can find for an entry level position
good,Wells Fargo is well known for working in the community and giving back.
good,"a typical day consists of sending out and receiving paperwork from clients. processing forms, opening accounts etc. it's a fairly easy job, but you have to be organized since there are a lot of things going on at the same time"
good,I enjoyed training new people because it gave me a chance to break off from the normal 8-12 hrs of sitting still and entering in information on the computer.
good,"Busy"
good,"I would lead my teams morning huddles and get everyone engaged and prepared for the day ahead. My main job was to coach and mentor tellers and prepare for the yearly audit. I have learned many things in my career at Wells Fargo such as learning exceptional manager skills and time managament practices."
good,daily cash balancing. dual and sole custody opening and closing procedures. meeting daily and quarterly sales goals. meeting customer service expectations.
good,Took over 100-120 calls per day learned to listen to what the customer says probe for questions to get a better understanding of the situation.
good,"A typical day at work is non-stop and while working non-stop I have learned that just when you think you may be caught up, your not. Management is management is management.  My co-workers are talented and determined. The hardest part of the job is balancing quality and productivity.  The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Work with customers, Making customers happy was the most rewarding."
good,"Wells Fargo is a nice place to work. It provides a comfortable (almost living) environment to fit your sechedule on and off the clock.  The benefits packets are pretty normal and considerably decent. Now depending upon which department your are in and what you like to do you can become seemingly trapped in one department. Another thing is, its the bank it could be gone tommorrow.(some departments do a lot of layoffs)"
good,"I was not with Wachovia long enough to accurately review them. However, the company seemed to be okay. Unfortunately it was not a good fit for me. "
good,We deal with a lot of personalities a day with different financial needs I've learned on this job you can not judge a book by the cover. Management is very approachable and helpful and my co workers and I work very well together ... The hardest part of my job would have to be keeping myself up to date with all of the changes that take place working in the financial industry as well with all the updates on the products and services we offer. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the customers I have some really funny customers with great personalities and that's the part of my job that I actually enjoy..
good,"A typical day working in the Insurance Licensing Dept starts out with a call from an agent.  The agent would usually need assistance with either needing an appointment with a particular carrier, state license is not current, or his CE would not be completed."
good,"Work/life balance is a reality at this company."
good,"It's a very organized company, a good place to work where employees are appreciated, respected and nice work-out area after job. Wells Fargo has a good compensation/benefits for his employees and help people for advancement."
good,"Great people. I learned a lot over the past 9 years. I worked with great leaders and an amazing staff. The hardest part of my job was spending long hours at work. "
good,"Good comp and bonus, not a lot of understanding about organizational culture dynamics - silos."
good,"Great company to work for and good group of diverse employees. Everyday is everyday is differant, you will have your good and bad days. You will learn how to work with different levels of managment and how to work / manage a variety of customers."
good,"Great co-workers, but management could be hard to work with. Customer focus wasn't always top priority from their perspective."
good,answer incoming call to assist borrower with any questions.
good,"Inspite of a good work life balance, the culture at the company is not oriented towards advocating new ideas/risk takers. It seems to me that people have been here for years doing the same thing over and over again and they don't want to learn new ways to do things. Frurstraing for someone with new ideas."
good,"Over all this is a great company to work for, I just started feeling like it is more about the company and less about the clients."
good,Meeting dayly very nice people!
good,I enjoy working with customers and building a relationship with them. I am self-motivated and love to take on new challenges. I have the ability to mult-task in a timely and efficient manner.
good,Anyone who has worked in a call centre probably does not need much more info.
good,At Wellsfargo I learnt how to solve the critical issues under all circumstances.Management is good and looks after the welfare of the employees in all domains.co-workers are very friendly and co-operative
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to start a career but they are a meat factory. What I mean by that is not much attention is paid to an employee's development or well being once they are in the door. The company will let you in, provide you with the bare minimum of support and benefits, then happily shuffle you out. It is the prime example of a large corporation where an employee is nothing more than a number."
good,Has been a good employer to me. Worked a total of seven years with this company.
good,Each area is different with regards to culture and work environment. It's easy to move from job to job within company.
good,Wells Fargo is a very diverse company. I have met so many people from different walks of life. I have built many great friendships with the people I work with. Advancement happens quickly. I enjoy working with my coworkers. We have a good time and laugh alot.
good,"Heavy call volume, I learned banking skills. working with co workers was great. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers."
good,Paper pushing job that I talk to customers. My favorite part of the day is helping new customers on the phone understand our policy and procedures.
good,This job was the most rewarding job I have had. It made me so happy to help people get their mortgages down to a better payment.
good,The people are great but the processes are inefficient and almost impossible to change.
good,Wells is a solid company to work for but didn't provide adequate career support when laid-off.
good,Work is as fun as you make it. I love working for this company!
good,"Sales, sales, sales! Management at my specif branch weren't exactly all that helpful to new team members so you definitely are required to be an extremely fast learner."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but the job kept changing which made it difficult to continue. Sales for this job when I started was required but they did a total over haul and it was difficult to reach the goals they require.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Wells Fargo, I got along real well with my coworkers and alot of supervisors. However, the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers yelling at you around the clock. Over time you learn to deal with it and still perform to the best of your ability. At the end of the day its all about making the customers happy and providing outstanding customer service."
good,A typical day at work for me depended on what mood my manager and supervisor were in. I love the job for just that the COMPANY was a great place to work for. I built great relationships with the co workers we had to stay postive. It was a small office setting with one floor manager who made it hard to work without walking on eggshells.what I learned is no matter how well I succeeded in setting and exceeding job goals because it was goal based. The hardest part was not being recognized until you have done something below standards.the most enjoyable part for me was to exceed company goals eventhough the work environment was so stressful.
good,Overall I enjoyed the company but I was not receiving the mentorship i desired. The earning potential is high but It is difficult to gain clients with little experience being 24 years old.
good,Wells Fargo has great products and services that it offers to its customers. However how they treat their employees is not as top notch. It is a very stressful micromanaged environment that leads to very high turnover and many disgruntled employees. They also do not have good benefits for their employees nor do they give raises.
good,Extremely aggressive sales environment. You are expected to meet daily solution goals by any means necessary. Must open several new accounts on a daily basis each customer must walk out with 5 or more products. Micro managed and threatened daily. You have job security as long as your hitting your numbers. Advancement can be rapid as long as you are eager and sell. Co workers are best part of the package . You will be expected to cold call prospects as well as do door to door solicitations to neighboring businesses. Micromanaging is an understatement. Daily calls huddlesand badgering come with the territory. It is what u make it
good,Great place to work at learned a lot. Loved my customers. Loved my manager she was very encouraging loving caring. Cared lots for her employees. District mngr not so much. Many co-workers n I agreed this company overall does not care bout there customers. All they want is sales!
good,Great place to work at learned a lot. Loved my customers. Loved my manager she was very encouraging loving caring. Cared lots for her employees. District mngr not so much. Many co-workers n I agreed this company overall does jot care bout there customers. All they want is sales!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day is rushing to get everything ready before the doors open. I learned no matter how hard you try or how much you produce its never enough. The management didn't care that some of our customers just could not afford what we were offering, My co-workers felt beat up. The hardest part of my job was begging clients. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone cooperated."
good,"Learned a lot about loan originations, website applications, etc."
good,"Typical, people are cool. Very diverse and always changing environment. A lot of hard work, never predictable."
good,Typical day at work - sign in for the day and read the log sheet for my assigments. Record how long it takes to preformed my assignments in the giving time frame and turn in a log sheet with that information at the end of each day.
good,Very sales oriented. Everyday they were pushing us to get customers to sign up for something new whether they needed it or not. The branch where I worked was fun. I had a nice and caring manager and I wouldn't trade her for the world. She was very helpfuk and understanding. My fellow coworkers were nice and fun to work with for the most part.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo consits of being able to talk to customers and handle there day to day needs. While doing so you learn how to help with there finaces as far as loans , credit cards , accounts , etc. My co workers and I have a good realtionship and help eachother when we can as well as learn from eachother. I enjoy helping my customers and building realtionships. Wells Fargo has made it hard to want to stay working for them , they have takin away many free accounts away as well as charging more fees which has caused many customers to leave. Management does not motivate, but demotivate which has caused a hard work place."
good,Learned a lot about collections...and enjoyed working the co-workers.
good,I accept approximately 60-70 inbound calls per day for high asset customers. Handling any maintenence requirements and/or disputes for customers in a timely manner. Challenges in the position are dealing with disgruntle customers and not having proper resources to resolve issues.
good,"At Wells Fargo, I gained experience in the loan process. Helping customer's reach their goals in home mortgage. Cold calling, working with branch partners to reach goals. I enjoyed the flexibility of the position. The hardest part was the state of the economy, coming in new during a rescission was a difficult challenge."
good,"This place sucks, has mandatory overtime. Upper management allows the brokers to walk all over there employees. They only care about numbers. They over hire then layoff, instead of leaving the jobs in the USA they send them to INDIA. There is favoritism amongst the management."
good,Was on the phone 100% of the time. Learned how to cross sell and service calls in 2 minutes. Coworkers were great and fast learners and teached me as well! The hardest part of job was call servicing with little resources. The most enjoyable part of job was time off the phones for meetings and training.
good,Walked it with no knowledge about home mortgage and within three months they’ve provided a great deal of education on the mortgage industry.
good,"It has been a very nice learning experience from the aspect of learning technical skill( Access, excel(marcros)) and understanding the financial industry."
good,"I was responsible for making sure that all work regarding trusts for three cities were in compliance with the policies and procedures of Wells Fargo. I worked closely with all Trust Advisors and their Associates to make sure that any errors were corrected on a timely basis per the policy and procedures. Various aspects of the job had to be done on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis. The hardest part of the job was getting matching answers to questions from those that supervised the Operational Risk Consultants The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure that all accounts were established properly and working with the Trust Advisors and Associates on a daily basis. I feel that I learned a great deal about the policies and procedures by have daily contact with them in the job I was required to do. Even though I had trouble at time getting the answers I needed I found that my co-workers were always willing to sit and discuss the situation so that a solution could be derived to correct all errors."
good,"This was a nice company to work for, I enjoyed it. The company was a bit far for me to drive from where I use to live"
good,"Inbound call center. Most of the inquiries were very similar thru the day. Most co-workers were responsible and helpful. All management team members were well trained,"
good,Typical day at work consist of reviewing and responding to emails for the day regarding closing out cases for charge off.
good,Lots of fun people great training. hardest part of the job is being on the phones all day and reffering the products. other than that everything else is good
good,Wells fargo is a pretty good place to work. I really enjoy the culture surrounding the company and the people I work with.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo does its best to undervalue its ""foot soldiers"", i.e. bankers and tellers, by constantly increasing production goals and decreasing base/incentive pay."
good,Designed and delivered training to newly-hire financial advisors.
good,"They have many strict sales goals which sometimes interfere with the quality of customer service, but overall it was an enjoyable atmosphere to work in."
good,"Sales are extremely important. A lot of stress daily on meeting goals without much guidance. They just want you to get it done. If you're good at sales you're in, even if you are completely clueless about everything else, they just make lower employees take care of that"
good,"I was a little upset with the way they push products on their customers. After reviewing of the acct. If the customer did not qualify or need an added product that we offered, they were very insistant to push the product on the customer. I lost many customers and many customers complained on a daily basis. Being in the banking business for the period of time I have, this is not what customer service is. You need to assist your customers with what products they can utilize not hurt or make it overwhelming for them. I always met my sales goals monthly."
good,"High sales goals, alot of pressure, good chances of advancement."
good,It was good until expectations went up and compensation went down.
good,"Typical day at work would be returning phone calls in the morning, emails as well, then making outbound sales calls to referral partners."
good,"Overall Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. I had the opportunity to meet with and help hundreds of local business to exceed their business goals. The compensation plan is more than fair. One thing to know about Wells Fargo is that there are many different departments and, although it should feel like one team, it can be fractured at times with individual departments battling against each other. I am looking for a business that works together at each stage in the process."
good,"Intense stressful position taking customer calls regarding multiple issues that you handle to resolution through research or, if necessary transfer to a specialized dept. All phone bankers required to adhere to detailed requirements such as call length, handle call to resolution, sales referral, branding company name, utilizing required and verbatim scripts read to customer, very strict and detailed verification/authorization of customer on all calls before assisting or providing any information to customer. Phone Banker has access to computer data base of all subject matter believed to be necessary to handle customer requests. Phone banker must be able to work fast on computer and be able to do research to answer or handle customer question or request. Research time is taken into account of AHT (average handling time per call which is a critical means of measuring phone bankers goal requirements.) Strict requirements to adhere to regular breaks and lunches and that they are taken at time designated for that phone banker. Failure to adhere to to phone banker call requirements are measured and taken into account of employees review. Failure to meet requirements lead to formal warning then dismissal of job. Goals are set in above requirements with incentives for quarterly bonus if phone banker meets or exceeds goals. PTO or paid time off is allotted to employee as a ""pto bucket"" of so many hours allocated per month for the year with total listed in pto bucket. PTO is used for vacation, sick days etc. Time off for pto must be authorized prior to using pto, otherwise employee acquires"
good,- typical work day was 7-7
good,If you can sale anyone anything then you would be great for this job.
good,"I managed day to day activies fullfilment team of underwriters, processers and closers. This includes not only the flow of files, but management of the team members and their development. Each day I am also involved in relationship management with JV partners and working with them to acheive their goals, increase their business, and provde high quality service to our customers. Partnership within the fulfillment site and other co-managers is also a daily activity, due to sharing resources, assisting with projects and supporting each other as a team."
good,"A day at Wells Fargo alway consisted of change and new challenges. What I have learned working for this company for the past six years is to never let the possible seem impossible. They are alway going to be employees who are alway going to complain about the process and change, but to me I feel that process and change happen everyday, whether it is at work, school or in your own personal life. Regardless of the situation, you have no choice but to adapt to your surroundings and make the best of your day. The hardest part of the job at Wells Fargo is tha lack of communication between manager and their staff. The most enjoyable part of working for Wells Fargo is the appreciation that is shown by managers and between co-worker. Everyone always worked as a team."
good,I would preferr a perment position not contract and the limited time is hurtful
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is helping people reach their goals.
good,"Although a well known company name, did not have much of a presence in the Jacksonville area at that time. Intially managed by knowedgeable reverse mortgage managers, Ultimately changed management under forward conventional mortgage managers who did not understand the needs of the reverse mortgage consultants."
good,I learned a lot. Great company to work for but the department was not the best. Management needs more training.
good,"Typical depended on the project that was on hand, I was a financial advisor, loan processor, and underwriter. Management was up and down depending on the department, but overall my experience was positive. Loved my co-workers as some are still my friends today. Hardest part of the job was learning and differentiating all the guidelines of underwriting."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A company if you know the right people you can go far.
good,Wells fargo is a great company to work for if you love to sell. They provide reasonable hours and good benefits.
good,This is a great company to work for if you are sales driven and live to work. The scheduling is not conducive to a functional life outside of the work place.
good,Wells Fargo was a great company overall. I loved working with the customers everyday. Building a relationship with customers making working with customers fun. As a teller my goal was to at least make one customer a day experience the professional and worthy experience as a possible. With this compant there were lots of incentives for great work performance.
good,Need to pay more. Awesome co-workers. Helping people reach there financial goals made me feel great. Helping people get out of debt to help provide for family is amazing.
good,Overall working here was a decent experience. I mainly loved the people i got to meet on a daily basis. The specific group I worked with generally had good people.
good,"I interned there and had a great summer. However, I worked for Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which had a very different culture than the bank so it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment too much."
good,"It would not be fair to say that my  experience is what Wells Fargo is about across the board. Each line of business has its own culture, depending on the management."
good,This company is fresh overall however with the many changes at times one can feel over worked. Unfortunately when trying to promote into the higher salary jobs politics play a huge role
good,Micro management at its best.  The culture is one of favorites over abilities. The manager is socially awkward and conducts business in that manner. He has been quoted as bragging about not being a people person.  Since he moved into the position the department has been on a downward spiral.
good,Team members are friendly and helpful. There is not much ore that I can comment on as I was a contractor. Being a contractor I did not have the opportunity to experience the work environment like a full time employee.
good,"Great company to work for with good benefits, work life balance, opportunity to further your education and many company supported programs to help you remain healthy"
good,The firm is still in flux from the sales related issues.  There has been turnover at the CEO level which has made some feel unsteady.  There is a focus on strengthening the risk culture.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the needs of the customer and communicating the benefits to serve them.  The job was challenging with various task to achieve each day.
good,"My first professional job, fun and personable while productive and laid back. A typical type of office job with a close-knit feel of a team. At times could be fast-paced and a little stressful."
good,The job comes with lots of risk and being a teller you need to learn how to manage it well and fast. There policy’s are always changing so it’s hard to keep up. Is an okay job.
good,"Overall a good work environment with potential to grow as long as you are in the right team.  A little hard to navigate due to decentralized operations, however senior leaders have done a great job on communicating vision so that everyone is on the same page.  Some teams have flexibility on hours/work location while others don’t."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great company to work for, they compensated their employees accordingly. I always felt respected, but not necessarily valued. I didn't feel there was much room for advancement, at least not in what I wanted to do, which was commercial or agriculture lending."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It was a great atmosphere to work in. Was able to gain more skills. Didn't provide that many chances to move up to other departments. Management was there when needed.
good,"Company made dramatic shift from daily sales goals focus to risk management, team member development, and growth focus over the past 3 years. Changes were made for the better!"
good,"Would somewhat recommend. It is a stressful job. Management just depends on what sup you end up with, some are great and the others aren't too great./"
good,"I have enjoyed working here overall. Pay isn't too bad considering the cost of living and you get a decent amount of PTO. Only thing is that its difficult to schedule PTO sometimes because it has to be approved and that can take a while and it has a high chance of being declined. Hours aren't bad and the day goes by pretty fast. SUPER tedious in regards to risk management due to Wells Fargo's reputation. One bad thing WF needs to work on though is employees transferring. I am currently trying to transfer to Orlando and I was declined for the job at another branch that I currently work in... Yeah, they need to work on that because it looks like they do not support their employees."
good,contract job.. not really what i signed up for... need more to do... pretty bored here... and i think everyone else is too... really no motivation to get things done
good,The company was a good place to start out after high school. I learned how to work with money and customer service. The company offers opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"training provided for whatever position you are hired. usually there is managers that will observe and give you feedback, currently don't have a manager now"
good,"Didn't have bank branches in Oklahoma, only mortgage and financial advisors. Leads were few, if any, so there was no benefit to work for a bank that operates like a broker (since you must generate your own leads) but get paid 1/3 the amount you would at a broker. Benefits such as health and time off was good but would only recommend mortgage at Wells Fargo if you live in a state where there are actual branches."
good,"This company puts a magnifying glass on your every minute through Workforce Management. "
good,"Wells Fargo have give me many years of experience. I have learning external and internal banking industry. I be able to review documents, analysis and investigate customer banking."
good,"Good Company if like to keep moving forward in your career , they will give you all the tools to be successful. Provide training every quarter and you can be your own leader as long as you do things right"
good,It has is ups and downs as with any other company.  It does have an inclusive culture however the company being in the headlines everyday is the downside.  The company has a tarnished reputation and I don't think it will be fixed anytime soon.  The company made some critical mistakes in the past and they will be paying for it well into the future.
good,"Great company but management is not, overall good wages, great to interact and help the customers reach their financial goals. The benefits are some of the best I’ve seen"
good,"Nice place to work , very friendly people"
good,"Decent place to work, but a bit stressful. Metrics are crazy and pay is not enough for the type of work you are doing. Good benefits and training. Management was meh."
good,When I worked there they made you suggest product that customer would be interested in and if you didn't you lose your job later they were sued for this
good,"Being a Collector at Wells is pretty stressful. It's not so much dealing with the customers but all the required things you have to say or you get dinged. Also how quickly you can make outbound calls. "
good,"High pressure to meet goals and deadlines, significant offshoring of work, not a place I would go back to. very political, top down management approach"
good,"I love how diverse they are. They really try and make you comfortable and feel supported. I don’t really like the chair sides, when the supervisor has to listen to your calls. It gives me anxiety and I don’t think it’s an effective way to coach. I got hired as a PB1 and was promoted after six months to PB2 and got a pay increases. Pay is good. I started off at 16.00$/hourly and went to 17.67. Demanding job tho! Policies change. Rude customers. Need tough skin to work here."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This  job will benefit you most if you have limited outside obligations. Other than that, fine opportunity if you wish to get onto banking as a career."
good,I found that working at Wells Fargo is extremely competitive due to the sales goals. If you have a good manager you will love this job. Great training
good,"Normal 9-5. I learned more about company specific systems and processes. Management and culture changes, overall a learning experience. Circulating employee talent needs improvment"
good,"Wells Fargo is such a large corporation, that the experience working there is largely dependent on the part of the company that you work for.  Overall can be a good place to work."
good,"Have to have your mind right to perform well in the Wells Fargo environment. If you have the correct mindset, you'll be a winner at Wells Fargo. Make sure you're on time for work EVERYDAY. Very important!"
good,I learned alot about mortgage but did not necessarily agree with how customers were treated. The company also seems to be behind when it came to technology and making things easy for the borrowers.
good,"Bad middle management, would not recommend working there. People were promoted to middle management that had no good reason to be there. Lack of experience and formal training."
good,"Wells is a Decent Company to work  for . With always changes in management and Strategy , it does us leave confused . Technology Stack is quite old with still desktop applications being used"
good,The company isn't very family friendly when it comes to having children who are sick or you yourself is sick and have doctor notes. You miss a day it counts no matter what. It was hard while my husband was deployed so I had to quit before they fired me after missing 3 days in 6 months. Other than that I loved the job and the people I worked with.
good,"The people were great and the environment was very nice and relaxing if you did your work and stayed on track. Parking was good because in the St Louis Park, MN location there were 2 parking ramps. The cafeteria's good as well with 2 different location (smaller and bigger location)."
good,Well Fargo is a good place to work and I enjoyed my time there.  I grew a lot as the work I did was challenging and stretched me. I meet and collaborated with some really great people.
good,Wells Fargo is a fantastic community-oriented financial services company that has a proven history of taking care of its employees as well as its clients.
good,Working here was great until management and training only focused on getting business and did not care about the customers needs by helping the employee succeed correctly and not only focusing on who they want to see succeed
good,My experience was pleasent working for wells Fargo the time the I have been employed.i have been e.o for 3 years an have seen changes for the good an the bad.
good,Work would start around 8 in the morning. We would process night drop. The doors would open at 9. We helped customers throughout the day. We typically had a 45 minute lunch sometimes longer if there was overtime.
good,"Your everyday tasks will vary from cash handling, to communicating and establishing a regular basis's with clientele. While providing a smile and following rules/guidelines. I learned that its okay to have a repetitive job. While management isn't always what you hope for nor the culture. They do try, or did. The hardest part of the job is being asked for more then the job is willing to compensate or even recognize. The most enjoyable part would be the colleagues i've met and worked with."
good,"Management was nice and supportive. Time-off was often a fight to the death. The wage for this position is not a livable wage if you wish to live independently. Opportunities for ""advancement"" arrive often however they come with either minimal or no income increase. Aside from the above the corporate culture was pretty good in comparison to other large financial companies."
good,"I enjoyed my time there to a certain point. I liked my prior team, people move around a lot so you have to adjust to the new team. The new team I had got toxic, I had to leave because they were changing how things were when it was ran smoothly. It can also get pretty stressful with customers & during audit time (they are random). I do like my manager was flexible with leave and if we had to take off for certain things. Tenure does trump PTO but it's good that they provide them upfront."
good,We were productive I enjoyed the environment and the customer interaction. We worked hard to make sure that are customers were knowledgeable about the product and services that they were receiving.
good,"I have worked at Wells Fargo for 3 years now. I love working there the job opportunity is kind of hard to find especially if you want to work within the company. The current branch I am working at right now is tough the Service Manager over there is very rude to the Tellers and how she does the scheduling is not fair. The full time teller do NOT get a break. Example, all full time tellers have the right to have a Saturday off but it does not happen unless we have a week off from vacation. But yet the manager have every other Saturday off even when they do not have vacation time. Currently, my service manager was on vacation and it was very relaxing all work was done and it was not stressful."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I loved it. High pace, busy. Your paid what your worth. No salary."
good,"Often management showed obvious signs of gender bias and often narcissistic behavior. Much pressure and no inspiration.  However, upper management was great and people oriented."
good,"Great technology, not great processes. Loans would sometimes be delayed. Many processors and closers do not care about client experience. Underwriters are very quick to cancel and deny loans."
good,"Good work environment. Seeking full time position. Can't seem to get it at Wells Fargo. I enjoy my job, However need to be able to financially support myself."
good,Good company to work for but management needs a lot of training. Has great benefits and would go back if needed and with the right opportunity to have a work life balance.
good,"Great pay and autonomous flexibility, disorganized structurally and operationally, low opportunities for advancement for contractors.  Progressive tools but reactive culture."
good,I had a great boss and the co-workers were top notch. The job was at times challenging but manageable. Closed for all National holidays which made it nice for home life.
good,"You can move up as fast as you want to with Wells Fargo. I have worked in credit card customer service, and now in the fraud department. Two totally different atmospheres."
good,"For the two divisions I worked for, both allowed for multiple opportunities for cross training and advancement, with good mentors and excellent benefits."
good,Working in Home Preservation sets the tone for what an office job will look like. It is a call-center environment with some opportunities for growth down the road.
good,My biggest issue was changing shifts. I was working nights. I needed to switch after some time for my kids and the option wasn't available. And management was not very helpful with making that option easier.
good,Work days are easy and I learned a lot from management that prepared me for future roles. The workplace culture was awesome and the people were amazing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people.
good,The training at WF is top notch which aids in giving all new hires a great foundation for which to build upon and grow in any way you desire.  They offer endless online development classes if you decide you want to try out a new career within the company as well as having a free library that you can look at online and the books will be delivered right to your desk.  WF promotes that they are a very diverse company supporting all different lifestyles and people but in my experience that has not been true.  It is unfortunate because with all they have to offer and the amount of money they have they should be able to invest in a far better educating process for those who need to learn the importance of accepting everyone for who they are while at work.  The overall moral would increase tenfold which would then improve productivity and decrease absenteeism because those of us who are mistreated for being 'different' will look forward to going to work everyday rather than fearing it.
good,Other than some minor issues it was a really good place to work with lots to offer. Timing was not right for me but I may go back down the line if there is an offer.
good,"Corporate environment, a lot of banking compliance guidelines adding steps to processes. Benefits are above average. Once in the system, expect the 3% raise unless find the next level job."
good,"My salary was great, lots of overtime , friendly people, you make lifetime friends, however, you  cant get very far in your career unless you know somebody."
good,"I have seen ""parties"", where everyone comes to the party, gets the food and goes and eats it at their desk. Beyond that, the pay for FTEs is fairly low compared to standard in the bay area (the pay scales depending on the part of the country so this is still the highest they offer). The management is great though."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Every day was a new Day in the Store, Very Sales Oriented company. focus on Home Equity and the credit card sales. Loans from the Consumer side. thank"
good,"Because WF is a large company, you have excellent benefits, and ability to advance or relocate within the company.  Down side can be the stress of responsibilities and the ability to balance Life/Work."
good,"A lot of security with the assets, which is good because of the private information they have, work environment is fine, it was exciting to work with sev 1 tickets."
good,"Besides being a call center, the people who work here are fantastic. Management definitely works with you when you need help and they are flexible to make sure you are taken care of. If you like being on the phone and providing great customer service, I would suggest looking into Wells Fargo."
good,"At wells Faro, it was an expectation to be quick, organized, knowledgeable and above all a seller. There was constant coaching and it was very fast paced and energetic."
good,"Great company even with things going on within. Great benefits. They should train their management better because I honestly now know more than them. Other than that, great hours. Advancing can be a bit hard, but you can get there if you really let them know and stay on top of it."
good,Not a lot of opportunity. A lot of focus on sales. Wells Fargo does have good benefits and starting pay is higher than minimum. Does not give good raises
good,management is good but job security is not a as well established. lay offs happen. they hire temps to promise them a job but they lay them off as soon as its not as busy anymore
good,"There certainly has been a culture shift in the past 3 years. Our operating model has changed to a more centralized system of process. Great benefits, still a culture trying to define itself after the scandal, but strong team members and strategic minds at work to bring harmony in an otherwise unforgiving industry."
good,"During my tenure I was afforded multiple opportunities to demonstrate meaningful change to the company. This was realized through multiple, high profile projects to manage."
good,They could treat their employees better.  Especially when they lie to their employees. Then a month later they tell them something else. That is just wrong.
good,A typical work day is busy depending on the day of the week. I've learned how to handle satisfied and dissatisfied customers. Management is always available and assessing you. Workplace culture is normal and can be fun on holidays. The hardest part of the job is remembering all of the continuously changing policy and procedures. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and building genuine relationships with customers.
good,"The procedures and rules of the banks are more complex some confidential, the most fun was to make the ATM's valanse and count the money and de security"
good,A good place to work and lots of career opportunities. Great management and organization. The career path is really fair and is based on performance and attendance.
good,"Most of the people in retail management and below are awesome, the real downside is the corporate requirements and inconsistent scheduling.  Also the pacing of the day tends to be either super busy or totally dead."
good,Great in accommodating work life balance and ensuring folks have options. The hardest part of the job is playing to the political agenda with management.
good,"going in not really knowing what my job is as an operator processor. the person that train me didn't really train me in what I needed for the job. Picking up my skills was not so bad, but they could have done more of introduction of the software to get the new employee before starting."
good,"Typically, Wells Fargo doesn't make accomodations for commute.  You are assigned work hours according to their need, not yours.  Beyond that, I found my co-workers to be generally unhappy about policies and proceedures.  Credit guidelines seemed to be fluid and could be debated with sales people.  Our direct lending managers have no authority, they just seem to be there to assign files and field questions to the Lending Officer.  The hardest part of the job was trying to appease different personalities in the Quality Control Dept to defend a decision you've made.  Some may agree with your decision, some may not.  The best part of the job was the competitive pay and benefits."
good,"The culture among the team members was family oriented while maintaining professionalism. Management was barely sufficient at best. It felt like the there was no concern for professional growth and were consistent in implementing one on one conversations about growth. That being said. If you're interested in applying for this company be very transparent about how you want to grow within the company if that is your intention, otherwise it wouldn't be in your best interest to invest your efforts to."
good,Great diverse workforce with many leaders being women or people of color. Excellent diversity of thought and firm initiatives are followed in many of the departments.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day would be 8 straight hours of talking to customers whom may or may not have wanted to speak to a sales specialist.  The job was rewarding when you would help someone fulfill their financial needs, however, it was also stressful.  There would be many times when customers would blame you for their problems, or they would be angry from the unwanted referral from a customer service associate.  Compensation structure did not align with the needs of the client."
good,"Loved the company. wanted to learn a lot. management was sub par in Holmes Beach, and Lakeland FL. Waiting 2 years in current position is ridiculous when you're young and trying to move up and make enough money to live."
good,"Being a Mortgage Closer at Wells Fargo has been a very educational experience for my career growth. However, there is very little room for advancement within the company now. My current income is about half of what I have made previously in sales. I am hopeful that more income is possible as well as opportunities for advancement with another company."
good,"Wells Fargo was not a bad place to work.  Nice co-workers, just did not receive the tools to succeed.  Commission was low and it was tough to get business unless you had an assigned account."
good,They pushed sales goals to hard which made the work environment seem hostile the bonus structure was difficult as well and the bonus pays out quarterly vs monthly.
good,"If you can get in and do a good job without them outsourcing your or cutting your position, WF likes to promote young folks (Under 40) who have proven themselves."
good,online business banking with business customers resetting passwords and online banking assistance with navigating through the online banking system for online banking business customers.
good,"productive place to work, offer coaching sessions with sup to help you get better. friendly people, managers and supervisors caqn be micro- managy at times. typical for a call center."
good,Great place to work with lots of supportive and like minded people for career development. Balanced work assignment to all team members with  attitude of learning with doing.
good,I found the mortgage industry to be very competitive and rewarding. It was challenging many days because of expectation and requirements for completing a loan package from start to close.
good,"Too many quotas and scripts to follow for people who may have different situations and issues.  Everything you do is timed, micro management is not the greatest."
good,Good benefits and working environment! Needs improvements on career development. Promotions and annual raise are ridiculous. Easy to set foot in if looking for entry level office experience.
good,"I loved working with nearly all my coworkers from all walks of life. Met some familiar faces and created lifelong friendships with people I could've never expected. "
good,"At Wells Fargo (Philippines), the workload is very light because resources are easily acquired even for back-up purposes. However, the organizational structure appears to be ""different"" than the usual, specially in terms of administrative and functional teams."
good,My time at Wells was more productive than the outside world seemed to think. Company experienced negative press that dampened some of the good we were doing
good,"I did not like it very much because it did not offer that much future, there was times when it was kind of stressfull, the only thing I liked was working with customers."
good,"I do  not choose to give my opinion, I was very happy with my Branch Manager but the sales requirements were ridiculous at times. It seems redundant at times when you deal with the same customers everyday"
good,"it has independent work environment with deadline work, which need to complete on timely manner. I liked the flexibility so I could come in and leave on my time frame. which helped me to balance my work and personal life."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I wasn't there long enough to get a good idea of how the organization (and my department) ran. Unfortunately for my area, there were a lot of unnecessary office drama but I do realize that is something you can never truly run from. I enjoyed having on-site facilities."
good,"My WF experience has enabled me to expand my skill set and raised my pay expectations. My supervisor entrusted me with the option to sometimes work remotely, I have appreciated the quiet, friendly, focused atmosphere, and feel that I've benefited considerably from the assignment."
good,"A typical day at Wells consisted of working with a team of usually fun and goal oriented people. Human Resource assistance is available, but it's frowned upon to ask HR for guidance or help,  while in the manager role. Made for very awkward coaching environment. However, most team members took pride in performing well so coaching performance based and rarely for behavioral based habits."
good,I worked there before the recent changes due to the sales requirement. I liked my hours and the training. The training assured you were equipped to perform your job
good,"Service-oriented Service Manager with 5 year background in Retail Banking. Core competencies include developing others, building relationships and solving problems, as well as, excellent communication and time management skills."
good,"The pay was great and it is a consistent and reliable income however it is a high stress level job. It’s hard to to leave work at work. Management needs a lot of work, the high management doesn’t treat those under them as actual people."
good,"Your experience at wells depends on your manager, their manager and so on.   They talk the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk - there are issues.  "
good,"It's a job, not a career. Most people don't last as long as I did unless they get moved up to a management position quickly. Once people are managers they tend to stay in that position due to job security and benefits."
good,"A typical day for my position is fairly independent and I get to work at my own pace as long the work is done properly and timely. I learned a great deal about banking and regulatory compliance. My immediate manager is excellent. I can not say enough good things about him. Upper management; however, has a lot left to be desired. The hardest part, for me is the commute and sitting in a cubicle. The most enjoyable part is the work itself"
good,"I worked there at the time they had unrealistic sales goals, which we now know caused the scandal of fraud going on there. It was a harder time to work there, I liked it, but many did get fired for not meeting goals, and or were very stressed at the time. I hear now it is very different."
good,"Left back when the shady things were happening. Over bearing managers asking for hourly updates. Getting customers to sign up for things we know they didn't need just to meet a quota. "
good,say they promote within but do not compensate you fairly for being promoted.. Will use your previous salary to determine next salary at all cost in my opinion
good,"downsizing by 2019 by 10 percent, would recommend to anyone, some managers better than others, love teammates, gave back and volunteered all the time and got paid for 16 hours a year"
good,Main complaint I would have and I think it is with all big corporations is they don't pay enough for their employees. the area I worked in was in my opinion difficult just the customers and the vibe of the area. Again most jobs don't pay a wage you can live on.
good,Strict adherence to policy and corporate structuring. Daily critique on interactions with customers and job performance. Encouraged to recite scripted verbiage when dealing with customers.
good,"Company has undergone a lot of changes from the time i started to the time i ended, huge company tarnished issues and law suits to their ""culture of maintaining clients and upselling."
good,Wells Fargo was an enjoyable place to work. The management team was knowledgeable and easygoing. It was a fast paced environment. Each day was different from the next.
good,Wells Fargo can be a good place to work if you have the right job and people around you. Sometimes job security is an issue. Management is usually pretty easy to get along with.
good,As in all jobs there are things you are happy about and things your not. All in all it was a great place to work with some really good people. They company has a lot benefits for both full/part time employees.  Great opportunity for a career and/or transfer.
good,"There's good and bad in every company.  Wells tries real hard to keep the increased cost of benefits to not dent the paychecks too much.  However, the push to make the mega share holders money causes burnout easily.  The current CEO seems to be steering the ship in the right direction after the near Titanic like sinking done from previous wealth driven misdeeds.  Some upper management really goes all out to find new business line to lessen the impact of decreased ""traditional banking business"". Many of the ""local"" managers work hard to keep morale higher when the $ figures point to job loss.  Despite the efforts of management, there's some friction between some departments as an ""us versus them"" attitude overtakes collaboration.   Though many free training opportunities exist, it can still be difficult at time to move between various business units (such as Banking to Insurance, Mortgage, Investments, etc.).  However, this has improved over the years and continues to do so. Overall, it's been a good 20+ years, but time to move on."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Ever since the litigation issues they only care about their image and not their employees constant budget cuts to make the job harder. No employee appreciation or recognition anymore
good,"Make sure my Computer was running,"
good,"Lots of possibility for growth if this is your chosen career path. On site training. Team oriented environment, not highly competitive. Lots of Locations."
good,Most of the supervisors really could care less about the advancement of their team members. Office gossip and belittling the employees by management is pretty much what we deal with on a daily basis. Coming to work used to be fun but now it seems like we're walking on eggshells because of multiple policy changes with no clear explanation (grey area) or facilitation to the employees.
good,"Good pay, Bad schedules. The call center schedules are not the best but the pay is good. If you are able to withstand a call center environment this job would be a god fit."
good,Work environment was stressful with back to back calls and constantly making sales pitches to the customers. There is a game room that you can enjoy on your breaks and a cafeteria so that you don't have to leave for lunch.
good,Great company to work for left because i had to relocate. felt underappreciated hard work often went unnoticed. Salary employees are expected to work longer hours than hourly employees.
good,Wells Fargo was more so in the business of obtaining existing mortgages rather than originating them. I had a better opportunity elsewhere with a company who was really trying to amp up their mortgage business in a booming market
good,I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo.  I felt supported when I need instruction at all times.  I liked how much training the company provided.  I worked well with all my team members.  I liked location
good,You are on the phones all day everyday. Don't get much time to do anything else. You have some good training. I always liked my managers and the people I worked with.
good,"very structured workplace.  Sitting at a desk answering phones all day makes for a very long workday.  Not much interaction between employees, monitored very closely."
good,"n/a"
good,"Handled spanish calls, slow-paced, friendly, strict but still a good environment.Left for personal reasons, still be working there if it weren't for that."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work! Team members are more often than not very kind and inclusive, upper management sometimes puts the needs of the company over the needs of the employees but that isn't always the case. Wages are pretty fair but sometimes not worth the customers that get upset and berate you. Very diverse company that usually provides equal opportunities to all."
good,Worked for Wells Fargo for a year after college.  Work was fairly easy as long as you had strong customer service skills.  Did have high-pressure sales goals which were hard to meet.
good,"A typical day was being on the phone - answering calls - to the tune of 100 per day and saying the same thing over and over. They are big on micro managing. There was not much in the way of advancement but opportunity to move laterally was there."
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits, but could be very demanding and stressful at times.  Its a very large company, so there is a lot of opportunity to transfer to other locations and positions around the country."
good,"Fast placed, night time cold calls, high expectations, felt forced. I was a top producer and had a following, so I  never felt fear for losing my job, but I saw good people do things ourside character, because they thought they were going to lose their jobs.  It was sad. Now there is a new CEO, so I have no idea what the culture is like to work at Wells, but back when I was there it was kind of scary."
good,system needs upgrading and improvements. manager was always gone but expected everybody in branch to do exceeding and abundantly. Forces to push products on consumers even when they clearly state they are not interested
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,work with scheduling with college. good benefits. long hours. can be stressful. pay was not sufficient with all the tasks we had to accomplish. sales goals were too high for a teller.
good,In my almost 4 years with Wells Fargo I have always felt very respected. All of my managers have been supportive and welcoming. I have had three different positions and have always felt some sort achievement in my positions.
good,Advancement is good but management isn't. Sales goals are high but can be achieved. Award for meeting goals is good. I would recommend job for someone who is fast paced and goal oriented.
good,Call center hours a crazy advancement is based on who you know and not the work you produce. The work you do and the stressed impose is worth the benefits but definitely not the pay.
good,"I'm at the office an hour before the actual shift starts. I  run through my emails, and start listening to calls of my focused (4 to 5) bankers. I then prepare my coaching for them and discuss what they need to sustain, and what needs improvement. I check if everyone in the team are on time and present for the day. I then validate if my Team Leader is able to achieve his deliverables: Coaching requirements, other admin tasks, etc. I then check if payroll of my people are up to date, and if corrective actions are needed to be filed for disciplinary measures. I then perform other tasks: Analytics, engagement activities, and joining management meetings. At the end of my shift, I stay a bit longer, 30 mins. to an hour for any last minute concerns from my subordinates. I had been under 2 great managers, and been handled by a bad one. None the less, I still performed as expected. The workplace is great, the people I collaborated with are awesome. and the other 2 managers that I've worked with are great people. Hardest part of the job is being with a really bad manager."
good,"There were instances where the work felt that quantity over quality was valued above all else. This was a contract role, so there was room for improvement at all levels of the organization for this area."
good,"Holidays and schedules are great.  The team dynamics are good, the compensation could be better for such a large financial institution.  Overall great place to work."
good,"They offer no base, so you're on a $12 recoverable draw which is brutal to say the least, especially when times are tough. If you have a solid amount of recurring self generated business then this could work out great for you, but if not, I'd look elsewhere."
good,I'm grateful for the opportunities that they gave me. The manager was easy to get along with and the people was really nice and the convenience of the building
good,Great Job fast place good job but not a lot of money. You either are standing up for a long period of time. Or you are sitting down for a long period of time.
good,I worked there when sales goals were out of control so it may be different now. There was a lot of pressure from higher up to force products on customers they may not need. Benefits were good. Time off and 401k were GREAT! there was even some discounts to retailers.
good,"when my kids missed the bus home, they didn't want to allow me to go pick them up (total time 15 minutes). they don't care about their employees. pay isn't enough for the stress."
good,The situation at Wells Fargo is different for contract workers of course than for Team Members.  Contract workers experience a Russian roulette of experience from good management to truly terrible management. It is hit or miss.
good,"Wells Fargo was and has been going through some difficult financial issues since before the market crash in 2008 and after.  What I appreciated about Wells Fargo, was they kept all employees informed about any impending law suits or issues.  All the bad apples shall I say have been gone for years now, and the management team I feel is exceptional."
good,I loved working for Wells. My manager made it difficult to advance without leaving the company. I would like  to get a chance to return to the company in the future.
good,Love that you can go school full time and is able to work at a department that has flexible schedule.  But position moving forward is almost unavailable.
good,"I had been working for this particular bank for more than 8 years. After 6 years in commercial lending as an assistant and managing one particular customer during that duration, the customer portfolio was removed from our local banking group.   Another banker in another area thought he deserved the portfolio.  This was against the customer's repeated decision to stay with the group that was doing an amazing job of managing their accounts."
good,If you missed a beat you could fall behind. Not a lot of job security but a nice place to work. The training was excellent and supportive. Have to be alert an willing to work hard.
good,"A typical day would start with starting up my computer and my phone line. Prepare any notes I may need and making sure I have my schedule breaks and lunch were written down, so I was able to go on time. Time adherence was very important at the Wells Fargo call center. The call center was always very busy and definitely never a dull moment, which made the day go by quickly. Most of the management was quite helpful, but some were nicer than others when we had questions that needed to be answered for the customers. The workplace culture was very busy and hard to make many connection because of how the business of that building worked. The few connections that were made was through mostly the training process."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Being in production can be difficult, depending on manager. WF hires from within but not from department to department. "
good,"I have enjoyed working in the QC department. There are a lot of opportunities to acquire more skills and learn new processes, which  makes you more valuable to your team. In this department no two days are the same which is great because that breaks up the monotony of the day. It keeps me on my toes and challenged daily which is what I look for in a position. I enjoy assisting my team members with questions or concerns, conducting new hire/refresher training and being able to assist in any capacity"
good,"I had the good fortune of working with and managing some great people. Mostly hard working, career oriented, putting our clients first kind of folks. I would be happy to go back to Wells Fargo."
good,"Work balance is good and they have very good volunteering opportunities."
good,Wells Fargo provides and strives to build leaders within their company.  This is through development and mentoring.  They also will pay for tuition reimbursement to continue your education.
good,"Management can be very unprofessional, discussing your business with everyone. Loved the day schedule, paid holidays, Events provided for employees..."
good,"Wells Fargo is one of the best companies that I have ever worked for , what I enjoyed the most was the communication with customers and the way our management staff trusted it our work."
good,The company has given me many learning opportunities and I appreciate management and their ability to coach. My favorite part about the job are the customers. I really enjoy seeing them every day and helping them with their financial needs. I preferred the more difficult service requests because it gave me an opportunity to do research for the customer.
good,"Good Working Enviroment. Since you see the same people, you create great relationships.The pay isn't that great though and I Needed to find another job."
good,"Wonderful Place to work as long as you get along with your coworkers. I loved my time there, it was only difficult once I started facing health problems that weren't so easily dealt with."
good,Good place to work despite current events; management can be good at times and understanding. Many different areas to excel in and move around within the company. A good trait to have is to be a self starter and extremely motivated and determined.
good,"I chose Wells because it was a opportunity to learn and develop in a new industry, but it was also an opportunity for me to develop my skills in sales and customer service. I recognized that in order to develop a skill you have to challenge yourself and Wells Fargo was the opportunity. I worked closely with my management team to not only understand the ins and outs of insurance while connecting with underwriters and customers to develop a strong relationship in which customers and underwriters knew I had the best intentions for each. At Wells Fargo I worked in a fast pace office environment. I had all business over the phone.I would say the best part of working for Wells was that they encouraged employees to encourage each other."
good,"Clock in and count your drawer at beginning and end of day. Order any cash, coins or stamps you might need. Talking with customers and being in sync with bankers. Supervisor or bank manager was always available for any customer or employee concerns. But i enjoyed being around my coworkers because they were close by for any help or questions i had. It was challenging to make sales getting the customer to sit with a banker. But i enjoyed reaching my goals and the recognition that came with it."
good,"Typical work day is to come in do your round and sit down all day, monitor the CCTV system and go home in 8hrs, hardest part of the job is staying awake."
good,"Great company to get a sense of what retail banking is like and limited opportunity to advance, job pool are high. High level management still far and distant to know what is happening at local branches"
good,Call center environment; management was friendly as time. Micro managed; short breaks and lunches. Full support was provided by management. Somewhat of a cold work environment.
good,Good pay for jobs that are mid-level and above.  Not many chances to change jobs or advance even if you express interest.  Frequent layoffs have people on edge and the feeling of job security is lacking.  Management varies from department to department but most areas seem to be flexible with hours (although no telecommuting). Good company to start a banking career but just not a lot of opportunity after that.
good,"The company was a great place to work, aside from the sales, which was the reason for my quitting.  The sales expectation is way too high and interferes with the concentration needed for balancing and assisting the customer with their present needs."
good,"Better than most financial institutions to work as project management  contractor... Your contributions, expertise and  interests, effort  level, not considered when wanting to convert to a full time position."
good,Good place to work if you are starting your career or seek a career in sales. Management is spotted but when management is in place correctly this can be a great opportunity for someone young.
good,"Contractor , Reviewed FHA loans for accountable and to ensure that each loan closed was without errors"
good,"my typical day at Wells Fargo consisted of performing transactions, coaching tellers and doing observations on tellers. vault custodian, cash handling experience ."
good,"If you enjoy customer interactions and standing all day this is the job for you! It can be fun at times, and stressful at times meeting sales goals and dealing with upper management."
good,"•	Research and solve clients issues related to trading and trading accounts "
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo was not necessarily stressful. Yes, you did speak to clients who were upset to be getting the calls sometimes or who were stressed because they DIDN'T make the purchases. When the purchases were fraudulent, the client was usually thankful. Team meetings were kept at a minimum, too, so there were not too many distractions from what you should be doing: analyzing client purchases and deciding if there was precedent or if they were out of the ordinary. You both take inbound calls and make calls out to clients."
good,"Signature Consulting is a company that helps you find Contract employment only. No contract to hire available that I could find. They have a large connection with Wells Fargo,"
good,I worked as a consultant. They were very focused and really provided the resources to optimize the productivity of the team. They did what it took to get the job done.
good,The job was slow and boring till it wasn't... then it got crazy and no one had a clue what they were doing... Every... Year.................................
good,"no communication at all. put a lot of stress on there bankers. they make is hard to hit max bonus. they never help bankers with career development, easy for mangers to get promoted within the company than bankers"
good,my auto finance department was helpful and customer focused. it  allowed cross training in credit departments and I was able to use that information to correct my own credit.
good,"Thought it was a solid career oriented company, but they closed our location, displacing thousands of workers. This was after a large town hall meeting a year prior where the company stressed that they don't do closures or layoffs, they re-purpose locations. Culture was fantastic, with lots of diversity and everyone got along well. Charity campaigns were continually shoved in your face, which was not appreciated. Some managers were the best I've had in life, and some were the absolute worst. Phone teams are extremely numbers driven. Training was well above standard, and continued. There were perks to help drive employee morale, such as food days and catered lunches. They pay you to volunteer, and the benefits were outstanding."
good,"I was only there for a year as a teller and honestly it was bad because the company is all about sale. This was during the year 2015 so I don't know how the company is now. The only good thing was the co-workers, benefits, and possible careers advancement if you're good at sales."
good,"Great job and opportunity, lots of drama - not a professional environment and supervisors getting too involved in situations as if we were still in high school. Very easy to do well and get money when not being distracted"
good,"no one day is the same"
good,"Nice to be a part of the team. As a consultant - I was included as an employee.  I was treated fairly but noticed when it came for time to be extended or brought full time - this didn't happen because of ""change of direction."
good,"Wells Fargo is not my cup of tea, but many of my co-workers love it and many of the employees have been there for over a decade! They offer amazing benefits, but I don't like the job itself. Wells Fargo only wants the best of the best!"
good,"While I was a teller, sales was a huge thing. it was very stressful to sell products you felt the customer really didn't need. as of now, sales is no longer a requirement due to the lawsuit. but, I doubt it will stay that way for very long."
good,overall my time at wells fargo was stressful but fun. if you want a fast pace job and competitive then wells fargo is the place for you but if not then i would not suggest that kind of work
good,"I work in the Contact Center for BPS. My day's of work are receiving inbound calls from clients and stakeholders across the United States. I resolve issues and process requests. I learned how to manage my non-verbal and verbal communications. I learned how to be patient and to multi-task at a high degree of effectiveness. I suppose I have been learning about the Payroll industry as well. They don't pay for you to train to be a CPA, but there is a non-official internal test system for payroll knowledge. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day places strong emphasis on promptness to get down to work, respects and honors the need for taking breaks, frequently involves meetings to keep the team members informed of any changes in products, services & procedures.  The culture is one of the best in my opinion; it embraces diversity, inclusiveness, helping each other improve, team effort to meeting goals and earning positive accolades, offers many opportunities for upward advancement to those who want to move up and reasonably devote themselves to learning, promotes social interaction and team member bonding through many company sponsored groups & clubs offered outside work hours."
good,"I like the company and my co-workers, my only issue is that the company's compensation is less than that of other companies for customer service positions"
good,Over all a great place to work. The mid managers are micromanaged to the point of it being absurd. Easy to promote if your stats are good. We did have a lot of fun at times. Then I got promoted to a boring job that just didn't fit me.
good,"Trying to balance work and life is difficult, overworking employees then what hired. Management always finding an employee to blame for bad services, branch is a hostile environment to work in, overall wells fargo is a good company management is what makes employees not want to be there,"
good,"It's a fine company to work for and I am quite content with salary and work/life balance, but the company has its drawbacks, mainly around advancement and poor management.  If you're not placed into a program right out of school, you may find yourself forced to create your own path and while the company is massive and spans many LOBs, finding the right fit that provides ample opportunities for growth could be difficult."
good,"I feel that, management could be better, and more supportive towards their employees. Being that my role carries a wide verity of responsibilities I believe better compensation would be a great motivational boost. Along with better working hours."
good,"It depends on which department you work in or which manager you work for."
good,"In my early days, when it was Norwest Bank, I felt like a valued member of a team with coworkers who all shared my commitment to good work and good customer support.  Through the years, the company has morphed into the typical soulless corporation that can tell you with a straight face that there is no money to give raises, while touting how they've gained record profits for yet another quarter and the upper management is walking away with millions in bonuses."
good,Enjoyed meeting new people and handling there banking needs everyday but didn't enjoy having to sell products everyday.  Took away from the enjoyment of the job.
good,I was trained to process security invoices. Processed invoice scanned in by Accounts payable for the security and corporate properties division sent in by vendors through website and email.
good,The environment is fast paced and competitive with plenty of room to grow if you can keep up.  Lots of opportunities to improve your skill set with training and tools.
good,I liked working with my coworkers. My manager was great. i learned how to work under pressure. Succeed under stressful situations. Hardest part of the job was dealing with an unhappy customer.
good,Employees are not fairly compensated in community banking! Other than I don't regret ever working there :-) Also regional leadership/ management and HR are out of touch with the daily operations of branches and managing team members.
good,I have worked at Wells Fargo for two years. It has taken me 12 months to advance from that possition. They require me to work in the same department for 12 months before you can apply for jobs in other departments.
good,"I've worked here for many years.  Great people work at Wells Fargo. I've worked on the bank side, then moved to Brokerage.  Wells Fargo encourages their employees to move within the company."
good,"Great opportunity to engage with customers and fun work culture with team members "
good,A normal day at work was fast paced.  The company enforced everyone learning everything. From closing to set-up to processing.  The hardest part of the job was communciation between staff and management.   The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different thing about the business.  And meeting different person.
good,"I would recommend working at Wells Fargo - A lot is determined on management.  The practice was changed since I left, which should make the environment more conducive."
good,"However, most are in the night shift and does not typically fit the profile of a family man with growing kids. New building is almost done constructing and hopefully there will be more roles to open in the morning shift."
good,"Salary is low as a contractor. Managers are good. The location is remote, which means you can't find any restaurant around during your lunch break.  The lunch break is too short, 30 mins only."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Coming from a call center, this is a culture shock when building a pipeline.  The training did not prepare me to function their internal application input system.  Felt overwhelmed and underwhelmed all at once."
good,Each day was filled with something new and the balance of work and working with others on projects and the understanding management was what made it a great place to work.
good,"Slow pace, high expectations, average pay, bank hours are great for work life balances. Corporate pressure can be high. Generally found super nice co-workers and customers"
good,Working for Wells Fargo was a very fast paced experience. The training itself was very short and was not very helpful. The phone conversations were kept short and sweet even when the customer needed to be assisted more. The management was very non existent and would be quick to lash out if something was done incorrectly.
good,Wells Fargo provides great advancement opportunity from within from the entry level teller position to Branch Manager. This culture is very promising and motivating for someone starting out as a part-time teller.
good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work while I was there.  I only left because the career path wasn't for me.  I think they developed talent well and there were definitely opportunities for advancement.
good,Typical corporate office cubicle setting. Worked in a team setting with about 8 people. Very quiet atmosphere where everyone worked on computers. Great job if you like your team/manager.
good,"Much like working at any company, working at Wells Fargo & Company has its ups and downs. The culture is changing at Wells Fargo, which is a good thing."
good,"this aforementioned play baseball with employees use strike one strike two ,question: is this correctly under federal law  for employees in (us)......"
good,"fast paced environment with banking. Opportunities to advance career. there were a lot of robberies, but that comes with the territory. coworkers were friendly."
good,Enjoyed assisting customer will their financial needs. My customer service background enabled me to establish a wonderful rapport with old and new customers
good,"Laid off after 6 years with wells.  My experience was good there I started as a temp processor, and worked my butt of and when I left I was an underwriter.  Lots of lazy people were around me so it was easy to move up the ranks.  Since I liked my job the lay off was devastating"
good,The biggest thing you'll have to deal working at wells is that you're working with multiple woman. Which means the teller line can get messy. Drama is inevitable and their mediation techniques aren't the greatest. You'll put up with difficult customers but the company's benefits and incentives as a whole are great. They start at 12 an hour and go up over time in GA.
good,The job involves collateral and bond processing. Culture is great among co-workers. Management is dated. They need to hire more people with technical expertise. Work hours are tolerable.
good,"This is why the company is in the shape it is now, lack of leadership presence. All they see is $$$ and not the real people!!  Company overall is great (Benefits wise) but the people are the sad part."
good,"Good work/life balance, good culture.  They are good about quarterly meetings with upper level managers to update you on what's going on.  Employees seem to get along well."
good,"WF was a good place to work.  Lucky to have some great managers locally.  Hardest part was the distance between ops and sales.  Systems and processes changed often, some due to the market, some due to the leadership."
good,my time at wells Fargo was educational and enlightening.  I was an assistant to a mortgage consultant that focused on Harp refinances. We had a great team and was top of our branch for a year. Rates went up and our business suffered. I try to focus on purchase business now.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Was a very stressful work environment dealing with the public and with large amounts of money you're handling. The whole company is very micromanaged. Everything felt scripted the way they want you to talk to people. The company itself has great benefits and paid time off, but in the end they don't pay enough for what you have to put up with."
good,While I enjoyed working with the staff I did not like that I felt like I wasn't a value to the company.  there isn't any motivation for the employees.
good,working at wells fargo bank was a very good experience and the management and supervisors were very professional and very willing to help anyone with any issues
good,It has been a pleasure to work for such a good company. I always will be very grateful to the group of managers that recognized my good work and gave me the opportunity to be promoted to team lead and eventually to assistant manager
good,"Wells Fargo has many positions available to advance. If you are interested in mortgage or dealer services loans. The environment is nice, people are friendly."
good,"Fast paced, stressful work environment that could be rewarding at times.  Compensation was indicative of work environment.  Co-workers were the best part of the job."
good,"Aside from the management seemly taking their job far to serious, not allowing flexibility in schedules and keeping you from taking breaks when its busy... its fine."
good,"When I was initially hired for Wells Fargo, I thoroughly enjoyed working as the team I had was great. We had a great time together and got along great. However, when that changed, things went bad. I was passed over for an opportunity even though I was already technically doing that job and trained for it. Overall, I wouldn't recommend due to the fact they don't advance those that truly deserve it and instead promote their friends from within."
good,To much mandatory overtime 
good,"The job was pretty simple. You come to work, sign into your workstation with your headphones in...do your work. Maybe call a branch or two to verify info. As long as you are doing what is asked of you, life is fine."
good,The organization is too large a employees are not recognized often.  Lay offs are often and moral was not always great due to lay offs and management.
good,"Like all companies there are stressful situations but the pros out way the cons here . Great benefits with career advancement opportunities , you get what you put in and if you truly believe in what you are doing then it will pay off."
good,They have a long way to go before the public forgets about the legal troubles. I will miss being there. The call center was fun and they cared a lot about my success and my advancement.
good,"Well Fargo is an OK place to work, but while I was there the pay was fairly low and the standard that had to be met to get any kind of real raise was unrealistic."
good,"Not bad place to work just high turn around like all call centers but the whole problem is they raise the goals and add to your job without bumping up pay, and if you cant keep up with the new goals they will hire somebody that will because they dont know they goals changed and not the pay."
good,"Fast paced, constantly changing so you have to stay up to date. Pay was ok but could be more due to the high stress nature of the position. All in all a good place."
good,since Wachovia merge to wells fargo was a big hit for employee was forced to do unprofessional sales. ask  to stay after hours and make calls for clients and oiffer new products.
good,"Very stressful before and after holidays. Have to be very fast to get all work done and typically day is working until the job is completely done, non-stop, except for lunch or breaks."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great benefits but work environment was often stressful with strict goals and short breaks. Some in management treated employees like children without the respect they deserved. The best part of the work environment was fellow employees.
good,"A typical workday at Wells Fargo was very high paced and nagging. Management on all levels were overbearing and insecure most times. The social culture was typically one sided and special interest focused. There seem to be unequal recognition for work well-done. Demands were always being increased, but not the pay. Qualifiers for performance incentives were constantly tweaked and manipulated to ensure no chance of achieving them it seemed. Everything you do and or say was always being censored and monitored by Corporate Trolls."
good,Wells fargo is a large company. Unfortunatley its all about who you know and not what you know. Maanagent isnt very helpful and can create uncomfortable work enviroments
good,I like the new culture Change for the Better! I believe that focusing on customers needs will get Wells Fargo far and will retain customers and bring new ones.
good,"great company put 5 years with them, just having a hard time finding a job in a new location with them. Very competitive and was sales based since there was a settlement things are changing where its not too competitive."
good,"While working at this job I saw many different situations first favoritism among manager with workers. unfairness to some employees as well as higher management dating other employees in same work area. in all to not make this way to long the environment I was working was stressful and unprofessional as well as there where differences on policies between different branches causing conflict with many customers.  This review is specifically based on my branch located in Opa Locka 13100 nw 27th ave opa locka, fl 33054"
good,"A place for learning, but no advancement. Good hours and benefits."
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"poor management,  all they care about is themselfs other then that its a fun work environment i loved how relaxed it was each day and the professionalism ."
good,"This was a very interesting experience since the team work was excellent. However, I worked during a great demand on the Industry, and Wells Fargo lacked the ability to train new employees. Since I had plenty experience in Finance, it was not very difficult to do my job. Nevertheless, I sow many co-workers leaving the Company because it was very challenging to do our job without experience."
good,i was pt teller working full time i asked for a full time slot and was told no even tough we had slots available. i also left wells fargo because another institution offered promotion ft hours and more money
good,"To me, Wells Fargo was your typical call center. I went in as contract. I never met my direct manager, pay was good, hours were day shift. Overtime was optional. I’m not familiar with their benefits or paid time off as I was not with the company long. The office was located in Frederick MD and my family relocated to Hedgesville WV, resulting in a 90 minute drive for me one way."
good,Unreasonable expectations are set on team members which generally dragged down the morale of employees. Very fast paced and busy. There is a healthy competition for promotions. Starting pay is set so low so if you excel you will be capped at 10% making it difficult to reach position midpoint salaries. Management is arrogant and detached from reality of the work load setting the team up for failure more often than not.
good,"expect lots of pressure from upper management. Benefits are excellent, but a lot of favoritism from supervisors. This affects how they do performance reviews."
good,a typical day at work was a balanced day depending on traffic of customers. The people who I worked with were amazing people. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"There were times too much emphasis was on meeting quotas, over quality customer care. I enjoyed the environment for the most part since I am a people-person."
good,"Where I worked it wasn't friendly, co-workers were never social or had their group. I left because I hated the job, not saying its bad I just like sales and customer service more."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Despite how difficult the work demands for deadlines were, the teams were great to work on. It was very collaborative and I felt well-supported. When I asked for more challenges, those opportunities were provided to me."
good,Managers should actually have the experience in managing there employees and being able to work well with everyone to get there jobs not because of the people they know.
good,Environment of job culture has slowly diminished over time and place for advancement has been washed. Every person seems to fend for themselves and teams are dismembered.
good,"My peers are wonderful to work with but there's a lot of poor management. It's a stressful environment to work in. There's a lot of ""here some work for you"" but not enough training to do the task appropriately. I believe the upper management is trying to improve the company as a whole; however, I need to change."
good,"There are opportunities for advancement at WFA. The compensation is not up to industry standards, but the benefits are great. Most offices, depending on the management in a particular office, have a great culture."
good,"Call Center Inbound call between 100 to 130 per days, customer service with there account like balance, transfer money over, explain there accounts, overdraft fee, using Hogan system to log in for your jobs performance. helping the customers issues, fixing the problems."
good,"excessive sales drive,very competitive,and a popularity contest,if mangament did not like you you did not move forward in the company no matter how well you did in everything."
good,Liked the job for the advancement opportunities but hate the fact that they're very sale driven. Very competitive in my opinion and not so much culture.
good,Working at Wells Fargo is a great place to work at. The company itself is a really great company. They have amazing benefits that I believe no one can ever beat. Although I feel that some aspects of Mananagment need to be better trained to make the work enviroment run a bit smoother. But overall Wells Fargo is a great company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo, but it has turned into a cut throat bank business, not a customer service based company, anymore. You can't get good customer service anymore. It is very disappointing."
good,Good organization but recently struggling to revive its reputation. India location is good. Innovative work culture. Some managers are ruining the culture and playing around with companies same employee friendly values.
good,"It is a good job while you want to figure out what you are doing with your life. The hard part though is meeting the sales quota and the forced conversations with customers, while handling their money."
good,This was an ok place to work. They have a lot of lay offs. The processing department was laid off.It is a fast pace company. The position here was a fast pace position.
good,"Working was fast paced but a lot of fun if you enjoy a little competition, which I did. You had to work hard to capture deals before another bank came in and stole it. You had to build strong relationships with dealers and your buying parter."
good,Good company to work for however management at my site was not great.  I do not know what happened to the company however because I left due to a family emergency and when I came back after months the another company had taken over the site.
good,"The benefit of Wells Fargo is also its biggest setback.  Opportunities are bountiful but definitely limited to geographic locations. For those settled in a non-headquartered region, it is difficult to develop professionally.  However, the firm is definitely committed to providing a work-life balance that is second to none."
good,"good working environment, with good, and competitive talent. learned a lot from one of my many managers. helps the team with personal time off and allows to have family time"
good,"Fast paced environment with a lot of regular customers. Unfortunately, it is a small town and difficult to reach sales goals due to the amount of repeat customers and the fact that corporate expectations are so high. When you do reach your goals instead of being rewarded they just raise your goal for the next month. It is an in store branch and very small but accommodating with easy access to the beach for lunch breaks."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Culture not always as good as it could be.  Employees are afraid to reply to internal inquiries regarding work due to the 5,300 employees fired. Due to ongoing investigations at Wells Fargo, my preference would be to limit my review of management and workplace culture.  Benefits are pretty good; and flexible time off and work from home is home."
good,Assisted customers to provide the best possible service. Demonstrated efficiency by multitasking with customers and associates. Assessed customers’ needs to deliver the best solutions for their needs. Productively assisted each customer during busy and peak hours.
good,i loved it! every day work consists of working high fast paced environment 60-80 calls. YOu on a teams and pretty much compete against other teams in the facility to make your day fun! management is great !
good,but compensation is poor great benefits i give them that. but bonuses are based on your scoreboard and if you dont meet their expectations then you wont get bonus.
good,Many issues with gaming to reach individual goals. Great management team overall good company to work for with advancement opportunities if you are willing to work hard.
good,"The staff was great. We actually did group activities outside of work together. The company wasn't so good to work for. You must have good customer service skills, be able to multitask, be willing to refer products & services to clients even if you don't feel like it's the right thing for the client. The sales tactics from upper management was very hard & stressful."
good,Worked on the ATM and the vault.  Opened the store every day and closed in a timely manner. Helped management with sales drive. Performed the necessary daily procedures.
good,Great training and advancement opportunites. Work/Home life balance was a challenge as a manager. I was able to take many classes and my growth was in my hands which I loved as I am an over achiever.
good,"Excellent Benefits Package Offered "
good,The day to day role was more administrative depending on who you supported the how quickly once could adapt the rigor  of the environment. Be open to multiple request at any given time based on priority and urgency.
good,"Overall, the work environment set by the managers was a positive experience. The company, however, was only interested in sales goals. The pressure from the sales was a threatening factor on job security."
good,Direct manager did not know the position / process which made my job frustrating.  Work was not distributed fairly.  Employees often get displaced throughout the company which gives very little job security. Salary and benefits were great
good,I have enjoyed my time here and have learned a great deal about the mortgage industry but want to seek out a less transactional role. The compensation is good and work life balance are great.
good,I have enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo.  The job can be very stressful at times and you don't always feel appreacted for the amount of work that you do.
good,"The location I worked at was not properly staffed which caused stress for the employees and made alot of customers upset. It was alll new management that started when I did with the branch manager leaving on maternity. Management methods was not something I approved of. However, Wells Fargo does take care of their employees and has much room for growth and development."
good,"Working in a call center answering calls helping clients with questions on their bank accounts and selling new accounts was a typical day."
good,For the past 9 years I have worked for a great company. I have been a facilitator for 3 years. I love my job however we are under compensated. I am looking for a challenging opportunity with better pay.
good,"Bureaucratic, slow moving overall. Certain parts of the company are managed via fear and intimidation. Talent, culture and opportunities varies greatly across this huge company. Generally nice people."
good,duties were basic for actual role was fortunate enough to be recommended for additional duties involving more number driven analytics and polled in monthly meetings for improvement suggestions as well as given some more opportunities to take on more responsibility however not compensated for this extra effort and not a very challenging role being very repetitive and routine. Long time before advancement seen as a possibility.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This is a good place to work the pay is decent. Management works with you and helps you when needed. There is a lot of rrom for advancement within the departments or move to other departments.
good,The job is not that hard however it can become very stressful due to confusion within upper management. However I have learned a lot within the mortgage industry.
good,"great people working there, makes it fun, promotes from within. Manager does not take thoughts seriously. Does not give us internet to do our job. But, great culture and support."
good,"I was only ever a teller, but from what I had seen while working there, it seems like they are fairly decent at promoting their employees within the company."
good,"The department I am in doesn't follow the Mission statements and values that are heavily put in place in training,  The environment is messy, unorganized and all the managers are biased against employees due to religious values"
good,"High pressure sales environment, all under the guise of ""Helping your customers grow."" Don't let the position title fool you, every position is a sales position at the Retail level."
good,"Your job is never secure, don't get comfortable for too long in this company as they seem to always be getting rid of people and bringing more into the company."
good,"As a teller, I assisted many customers in a busy work environment.  We had daily AM and PM huddles.  The sales goals were a lil intense, but if met the compensation was good.  I had some great managers over my years with Wells Fargo.  However, my branch went through about 3 managers within 1 year.  There was a huge turnover at the branch.  I enjoyed my coworkers and customers."
good,"Good For Laterals not for freshers or medium experienced and purely depends on the team in which you work, HR has no role to play, Manager is the one who can decide your future and career."
good,High pressure sales environment with unrealistic expectations. Management encouraged unethical sales practices and punished those who did not hit sales goals.
good,"Great place to work, team environment, advancement opportunities. Monthly incentives can be earned. Good benefits and time off from day 1 of employment."
good,"Very hard to make much money.  Slow process to advance.  Management pulled so thin they cant accomplish important aspects"
good,"Wells Fargo is one of the best company to grow as professional, however there are some hiccups in terms of perks. Some projects will demand to extend the work hours."
good,"In a typical day in my current position I fulfilled Technical Help Desk tasks of opening and closing problem tickets, as well as escalating issues to engineers to assist with validations and resolutions. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo has me running transactions, anything that has to do with; withdrawing, depositing, preparing cashier's checks, money orders, temporary checks, payments, etc.I really enjoy being able to help our customers succeed financially."
good,"Interning with Rathbone Warwick and Daly was like putting theory to practice. An unwavering commitment to customer service, with the ability to build productive relationships, learn about financial planning tools and win customer loyalty were the key lessons learnt."
good,My review is management needs to be more involved too much point fingers and not listening to what the managers have to say . The supervisor get blame for everything and the agents are not held accountable enough
good,"I absolutely loved working for Wells.  There was ample opportunity to move up and the culture is great.  The people are what make this company great.  "
good,All they really care about is pushing product onto customers. If you can do that without feeling bad for manipulating people with poor financial management skills then this may be the place for you. Decent pay plus bonuses and good benefits. Management was pretty irrelevant here.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo's vision and values are very positive however the management does not focus on them.  Management focuses on the numbers which does not always relay truth.
good,"As being part of the Wells Fargo family for close to 8 years, I was given the opportunity to learn and grow as an individual and as a professional within their Home Mortgage sector.  I was able to make lifelong friendships as well as be mentored by Leaders who took a genuine interest in my career/development within my department and the company as a whole."
good,"Did various administrative and clerical duties at all of these jobs. "
good,"This began as very good job. Very satisfying, very clean, good pay good benefits and excellent technology.   It was a fun time helping people connect to the bank via the net.   We sold a lot of bank products and generally enjoyed the job.  Wells Fargo made some business decisions that many of us found totally inappropriate according to federal banking law.  We found ourselves unable to  many of the things we were asked to do.  Many of were fired because of this. This was very sad because I had planned to work there until I retired."
good,great company  burt its staff  during t does  noty  connect or support staff during difficult issues with health  etc....  i enjoyed my time there and would happily work there again but i did feel  it was  it was disconnected   with its employees
good,"It's really not a job I personally would want to make a career out of, but it pays well, and if it suits someone well enough, there's enough positives to recommend it. It pays rather well for an entry level job, has nice benefits, and offers thorough training, at first. My biggest issue is just the call center environment in general, its not for me, so unless you enjoy it or can overlook the day-to-day mental stress of it, its easy to feel burned out from it."
good,Office environment was fun and loose. Daily work was repetitive but stable. Working conditions depended on which office you were assigned to. Solid place
good,Good brand big company amazing benifits.  Could have processes for better internal advancement for employment growth opportunities.
good,This job is a great place for recent college and/or high school graduates that are interested in the banking and financial industry. Entry level position so you would be given ample training.
good,My area was drab.  lots of phone meetings since everyone is all over the country so hard to get a good collaborative environment.
good,"- Everyone is pretty nice, Wells just needs to pay way more money to their employees. Very structured training and give you a lot of  leadway when it comes to your job."
good,"Greet and communicate with every customer, process multiple transactions while trying to find products and services that could benefit. Weekly one on ones with management, always setting new goals, informing me on my performance scores. The hardest part would be always having to be on the lookout for fraud, and the best part would be getting to see regular customers and get to know them while I work, and when they come in to see specifically ""their teller''"
good,"easy to move up under the right managers. There is a lot of work compared to how much they pay you. Most of the time, you are working 10 hr days with a 45 minute lunch break."
good,"Ratings are dependent on department and position. "
good,Fair.  Provide opportunity for learning.  Goals in the past were extremely stressful.  They're in the process of correcting things.
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo because I enjoy talking to people. One main thing that stuck with me is we always had to offer a customer another product even if it wasn't beneficial to them. I focused on customer service and what would be beneficial to the customers, therefore I didn't hit my goal numbers when it came to products sold/referrals. I was okay with this because I cared about my customers."
good,I started here a couple years ago in hopes of advancing but all advancement opportunities require you to already be in that position so advancement is kind of an illusion except within your department.
good,"I love working for this company but it seems asa thioguht it is harder to advance or post out than I thought it would be "
good,"Day to day work life was fun. Coworkers were enjoyable. Good work/life balance. However, High sales goals and constance pressure from upper mamagement can lead to a stressful work enviroment at times."
good,Wells Fargo formally known as Wachovia Bank was an excellent place to work.  Once Wachovia was acquired\ by Wells Fargo lots of changes were made.   Wells Fargo reduced vacation and personal hours that Wachovia gave employees.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"great job for development "
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, however their ethics in the workplace is sometimes a bit unprofessional and not for the benefit of their employees. They focused mainly on sales and favored certain employees over others."
good,"Wells Fargo is one of the largest corporations in the United States and internationally so when it comes to comparing them to medium or small sized companies, it is near impossible. That being said my personal experience was pleasant, the hours were great and they were really flexible with schedules. Advancement opportunities are abundant for those willing to take the extra steps to do so, however, the process of interviewing for different positions can be slightly confusing. The day to day work varies greatly depending on the line of business you are working in. Overall, the thing to keep in mind is that it is a very large company, and therefore has various positives and negatives attributed to how to operate with employees, which can be beneficial to some and not so beneficial to others."
good,Wells Fargo could use better benefits and pay. Different types of cultures and easy to get along with people. Great place to meet good employees.
good,The environment working at Wells Fargo is great. However when it comes to doing your assigned job it can be challenging just because the training you go through for 6 weeks is different from what you are taught out on the floor.
good,What I learn is to do more then one thing always staying busy and helping others your job is what u make of it skip tracing was da best part that I like
good,"After sales aspect went away it became more a customer service job rather than sales job. Metrics are everything and no matter how knowledgeable and resourceful you are, if your numbers are not where management feels are in the ""green"" you won't be advancing any time soon."
good,"Very cool and laid back work place, the people were nice, friendly and relatable. Very diverse group of employees and had a lot of events for employees from different departments get to meet and get to know each other."
good,Being trusted to do my job efficiently was the strongest point in my previous career. I thrive on freedom and it helped me complete tasks in a high standard.
good,"Stressfull, underpayed,u can get fired for the simplest reason even though sometimes it's a simple mistake with no warning or writing you up,,, a lot of people got fired and it was so unfair,it's always blamed on the employee no matter what the situation is,they won't fight for you no matter how good employee you are or were you r always replacaple ..customers come first not employees.. they tell you to do some stuff but this stuff can be held against you if you have a customer complaint ... a lot more i don't recommend working for the company after all the lawsuites that has been filed against it and as well they can fire you for not meeting your sales goals and their goals r insanely rediculous.."
good,Wells Fargo has a great culture.  The management at Wells Fargo is very knowledgeable and helpful.  They are also open to suggestions a encourage creativity.
good,I learned that the department that I worked valued their employees. Management was great to work with. I was disappointed to see our department relocate to another state.
good,"Calls were simple and it was never too much a banker could handle. Each day you learned how to handle different personality types and financial issues. Management was decent, often times they were there when you needed assistance. Co-workers were helpful if they weren't busy at the time needed. The hardest part of the job was meeting the quality assurance goals. The best part of the job was successfully helping customers succeed in their financial goals."
good,"Wells Fargo requires a fast-paced selling environment.  Must reach monthly and quarterly sales goals.  Co-workers are great, creating a great work environment.  Must have great customer service skills since customers are mainly concerned about their own money,"
good,"Big name in the financial Sector however the reputation for the Wells Fargo mortgage process is not good.  The underwriting and processors are on a different page while the loan originators are playing guessing games."
good,Great work place. Really depends on your manager on how your work experience would be. Very competive all about sales you have to meet your sales
good,"Core vision & values help customers become financially successful. The goal is to assist customers with the best options for them and their families to have a brighter financial future, no matter what department you work in."
good,"Typical day at work: "
good,One thing about Wells Fargo is that there is constant change.  I had at least 7 managers while at Wells over a 10 year period so they don't stay very long.
good,"I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo, the customers made it very easy to come to work with a smile everyday. My management team was very unprofessional which made it less enjoyable."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The sales goals can be intense, but the people that you work with are cool. As long as you making sure you are making the customer succeed financially, then you will have more customers who want your business."
good,Upper mgt doesn't care about you but your immediate mgrs. do.  High expectations and stressful work for below average pay.  Most co-workers really care.  Some really top quality managers you can learn a lot from.  The goals set each year are so far outside the norm it deflates the entire division knowing there is no hope to succeed.  Upper mgt finally sees the light and then adjusts expectations but the damage has been done...the trust is lost.  Front line managers then have to build them back up.  Upper mgt should help make our jobs easier not harder.  3 years in a row this has happened now.
good,Most days the atmosphere can be light hearted but if the store is not making it's sales goals the district manager becomes very pushy and micromanages so much it makes the work unbearable. My co-workers are great.
good,i made the best of it fun environment and great people to work. i would go back because i all way love helping people.i learned how banking is done and what its all about
good,Compensation is better at other banks but the opportunity to grow and feel for the wide array of banking and insurance services that Wells has to offer is amazing even with just a high school diploma there are lots of opportunities and tuition reimbursement.
good,Management does little to support the growth of the company and is more focused on making sales numbers. The benefits and pay are amazing along with the banking hours.
good,A typical day at Wells is a fast past productive day. You have the necessities to do your job most of the time and it is a diverse work place.
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo is extremely busy. Working in change management keeps me busy. There is never a dual day assisting project managers on various projects.
good,"wells fargo is committed to well being of its employee, but doesnt take time to make sure employee are fully trained.  Wells fargo has the highest commitment to it customers then another company i have worked for."
good,"Good money and easy hiring. But it is not worth your sanity. They push you to constantly sell sell sell. If you like sales, this is perfect for you. If you are more into customer service, stay away. They care more about you getting a customer to open a loan or credit card they don't need."
good,need more team collaboration with partners to service clients properly  and offer  appropriate investment advice to help clients  reach their respective goals
good,"I work evenings and this is the hardest part of the job, plus having to work weekends.  I learned quite a bit about the banking side of things from this job and the management was generally there to help.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist so many people, the worst part was being yelled at for things that are beyond my control."
good,"In my role, there are a lot of meetings to exchange information and keep team members informed of current initiative status, deliverables.  I learned too much to say about risk management, but overall there's a great wealth of knowledge and team members working together to manage risk while balancing the business needs.  My co-workers are intelligent and great to work with.  The hardest part of the job managing priorities and addressing all the day to day requirements (high work load).  The most enjoyable part is learning and work with great team members."
good,"Pros:-"
good,"Your regular phone banking job. Pick up the phone, answer account questions, solve some errors, applying some credits and submit claims. Some management don't know how to answer questions or don't know the companies policies. Seems like they are hired to just manage but don't understand the companies policies or culture. "
good,I feel this company over hired and then laid off 861 people nationally. The Company trained well and closely monitored production and quality.
good,"the mandatory online classes are a plus and keep all employees in tune with ethics."
good,Commission Based sales driven atmosphere! Great place to display your talent and grow quickly! I was able to work hard and earn about 20 awards and recognitions in 4 years!
good,"I worked here for a year, it wasn't that bad at the beginning. The co-workers were friendly and all was good until the sales goals became more important than the actual job. Felt like the priority of this company was not the benefits for the customer, it was the benefits for the bank. Sales, sales, sales."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Overall my experience at Wells Fargo was good, the work environment was good. The company was an employee friendly company as my team and I would have skip level meetings every quarter where we could bring forward our views and complains."
good,"The company changed through the years. Some was good and some was high stress due to the industry. Work 8+ hour days when needed, little interaction. Did not feel like a team.  Was a high stress and not much team building events"
good,"I have great respect for the top level leadership.  Wells Fargo is an extremely large organization and, understandably, the quality of the lower executive level quality is mixed.  In general, the culture is good and team members broadly feel positively about the company's focus on the community and giving back through volunteerism.  Benefits are good, although medical plans have deteriorated in recent years."
good,Compensation above average; good benefits; above average workload; no direct supervision so must be very self motivated
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people , help them make a decision in their banking decisions ."
good,"I loved my coworkers and management. However, the bosses of your bosses are not the best. I have seen first hand how rude and unprofessional they can be. At first not much is expected from you but after about three months you are given more tasks and expectations then what is mentioned in the hiring process. Truly underpaid."
good,"After nine years of working with this company I have mixed emotions about my experience here. I have held a few different positions, and have a pretty broad scope of experiences. First of all, not all managers are inconsiderate, but most of the ones I have worked with do not care to work with you on scheduling, both daily work schedule and vacation time. I am the only single parent in my location and have given up trying to get my work schedule to flow better with the needs of my child. For example: I have my son every other weekend, most of the time I am scheduled to work these weekends with out any consideration of limited childcare. "
good,"could be better management. to much favoritism in my current branch. Not alot of focus on job, not the same company. not enough care for employees"
good,High expectation great pay and rewards however lack of work life balance very long 6 day work weeks so is it really worth it.
good,You must be good at sales and meeting goals to work in banking especially at Wells Fargo. Their career advancement and internal promotions are very good though.
good,This company was great and loved working for them. I did learn a lot and meet a lot of people. The hardest part of the day was tells customers that Wells Fargo is unable to cash there check. The best part of my day was meeting people.
good,"Good hours, weird goals, managers can be pushy. Starting to go away from sales and going more to a customer centric approach. Good company!"
good,Short lived job. promised me every other weekend and did not happen. Also told me I would close branch 3 times a week max and ended up open close every day. Very stressful with pushing sales on you. Overall I loved who I Worked with made great friends!
good,"I liked the business culture and management, very professional. Great place to work, lots of hard working smart people."
good,Extremely stressful job based mostly on referring customers to the sales department. Good compensation however mentally draining.
good,"From 2002-2009, the company was excellent to work for every day.  "
good,Nice environment to spend the day with a lot of extra curricular activity. Excellent systems and equipment. It is very hard to get promotions and the supervision /leadership has a difficult time understanding and communicating the vision and values of Wells Fargo.
good,"This phone bank deals only with Military Personnel, so makes working a little more interesting. This is a very fast past and making sure the que lines stay open is a challenge."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wells fargo it was a great company to work for great incentives,co workers and management."
good,"Only worked as a contract paralegal for a short amount of time, but I enjoyed working with the staffs there. They were always friendly and helpful. I worked in a small team that reviewed legal contracts."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I really enjoyed working with this company as a Technology Specialist with supporting US counterparts and they helped me in a big time like providing me new opportunities to learn more and enhance more skills. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the great co-workers and friendly, supportive management. Excellent support system and training program for new hires. Very numbers oriented. Monthly reviews on your numbers and progress. Fast paced, potentially stressful environment during busy season (year end and tax season). Little room for advancement, primarily horizontal movement between departments. High turnover. Great work/life balance."
good,Wells Fargo is a excellent company to learn about banking and credit servicing and soft sales. Your day starts out taking over 100 calls and you have to refer a product or services on every call. The pay is very great however they start out everyone in your training class with the same pay never mind the previous experience you have. Upper management have favoritism on who they want to promote. Overall its a great job for college students and young adults.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to start in insurance.  There are many different avenues to take during your professional growth.
good,"•	Responding to written and phone inquiries from customers, related third parties, and internal personnel regarding loans within the commercial mortgage portfolio"
good,It consist of phone bank customer service.  Taking back to back calls constantly through out the day.  Very intense required sales goals to be met.  It is something that I am not use to.  I love customer service but I prefer face to face personal service.
good,Company is good but it lacks clear and effective communication on all levels. Just wished they did more with communicating to their employees and that they would reward their employees more than they did.
good,"Good Morale Both Management and Coworkers, and Honestly a Great Company.  Work/Life balance, attitude among co-workers - most constructive culture I have seen in my career. Competent management, compensation, everything is terrific."
good,"productive, driven workplace. continuous policy changes. no consistency. varied management skills and implementation. forever changing environment. Good people."
good,The only thing that matters for wells fargo is sales. The benefits are great and the job could be great but no matter how good you are if you aren't pushing products then you aren't doing a good job.
good,"-I enjoy my job and the people I work with including management."
good,Call center is very busy and fast-paced. Received a lot of customer service training and had many opportunities for growth and development during my tenure. Hardest part of the job is that ultimately you work for a bank and they want to grow their business so you start to feel less like a service rep and more like a salesperson.
good,"good place to work overall, but they expect you to be over capacity while not paying you what they are saving by letting go of resources."
good,"This job is more so a position where I am restricted to referring ""selling"" products that will financial benefit the customer or give them a peace of mind while they are a customer with Wells Fargo."
good,"As a Teller you are the face of the company - you're handling a bulk of the customers, but you're also expected meet certain quotas (e.g. attain a certain number of credit card qualifications or refer new and existing customers for new accounts).  The cash handling can be done by a monkey; the computer and calculators and in some cases the cash COUNTER are all there to assist you. It's the situations that will present problems - the first time I encountered fake bills or a fake check, I thought my heart was going to explode. A lot of my co-workers moved up to Personal Bankers quickly and we were all encouraged to strive to be more than a Teller."
good,I would rather work in person with people then over the phone. The job seemed okay. But I want to look forward going to work the next day instead of dreading it.
good,"Working in a Ux role at Wells Fargo is frustrating because it's a large, traditional company with creaky, outdated, tech leadership who are terrified of change and innovation."
good,"The hours were from 8:30am to about 6:30pm. The time flew by, because we were always busy, I learned all my banking knowledge working for Wells Fargo. I worked with several different manager with my time a Wells Fargo. I took a little bit from each one of them and their management skills. Worked with some excellent coworkers and learned from some of them. The hardest part was angry customers specially when they didn't want to reason. The most enjoyable part was the customers I helped understand banking better and being able to help establish credit. help them with their first loan, showing them how bill pay works etc."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great for a temp job, staff easy to get along with, managers are always supportive, enjoyed working with team and always opportunity for advancement within the company"
good,"Push you to sell bank products. If you are not good at sales then this isn't the job for you. However, I loved the people I worked with and we all had a very close relationship."
good,"I enjoyed working at this location in Minot because it was always very busy with the oil boom.  The management was good and they usually worked well with me when it came to scheduling.  I got pregnant while working at Wells Fargo and they did their best when it came to doctors appointments and other needs.  "
good,Schedules Are Flexible If You Have An Accommodating Manager. Accommodations Are Made Based On Performance Or Relationship With Manager. Dont Ever Work Nights.
good,"A typical say is 8:30-5 helping clients with their financial needs"
good,"this was most stressful job i had, they pressure you daily with new guidelines as well as deadlines. The phone process is always changing they monitor the phones and grade you on how you talk what you say."
good,Decent company to work for...extreme sales pressure...skip level management...most enjoyable part was the customer service and helping customers succeed
good,"I've been working for this company for over a year. The benefits are okay, yet the amount of stress that you have to deal with for such little pay is stressful within it self. Trying to get a bonus with this company has been almost impossible in the past, yet the changes this year are okay thus far. I do not like the fact that I'm competing with an entire company to get a day off. The scheduling time off factor is a huge deal breaker for me."
good,"This company is no longer in business. They are now apart of Wells Fargo. It was a great place to work and goal oriented. I wish that the company was still around, but unfortunately they merged. They had great benefits and great customer service."
good,"It's more of sales, than customer service as it should be. Company should be focused on everyone as a whole. The most enjoyable part of my job was my employees."
good,"great place to work, some manners can be micro managers but overall the environment is relaxed. There is tuition reimbursement and a gym on site which helps. The culture is great at this company and very diverse. Lots of opportunity"
good,"Pretty good benefits "
good,"During my regular work day, I would be taking calls from customers with inquiries about their credit cards. The calls had to be under 3 min each, as well as you getting a sales pitch in to promote a product or service. Sales goals had to be met everyday as well as AHT goals for you to have balance business everyday. If your schedule falls on a holiday, you would have to work the holiday, cause its very hard to get time off in the call center. They tell you that you can earn a bonus, but that is only you have met all your matrix required for the job, and also if the customers only give you all 5's on their grading system would qualify your for a bonus. I feel that if you have met all your matrix for the job, and work really hard, I feel that you should get a bonus. This was very misleading to me."
good,"The role is great, however it is encouraged that you seek growth opportunities as the role can become very simplistic in the world of finance/accounting."
good,For the most part I enjoy working at Wells Fargo however I've been there for almost a year was only late twice and I'm always willing to come in on my days off to help and I even spent a working in another branch for a month. To remind you I have to rely on others to drive me but I'm always willing to help out. However after almost being there a year and always receiving good feedback I have yet to be hired full-time or even a high position. However people who haven't been there a year or who just recently applied gets the position before I do. Besides lack of Job Security/Advancement Wells Fargo is not that bad to work in.
good,Great benefits. Managment ok. Cube world. Close to main highways and business. Many buildings on campus. Many diffrent departments.Cafe on site. No bank on site or daycare. Traffic can be hectic at times.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This company offers great work environment, but suffers from stability in keeping employees"
good,Wells Fargo is a company that rewards the hard working employee. Every year I was able to move up and progress within the company. Ive been blessed to have good management all my years with the company and caring team members who work together for a common goal.
good,"•	Resolved customer concerns "
good,Really good pay and good union benefits but extremely hard work and rotating  which meant you only worked half the time.  Great union that took care of any problem/problems that would come up.
good,"Getting set up for the day. Helping customers cash checks, make deposits, try and sell products."
good,"I have currently been laid off from Wells Fargo.  I like my position but have been looking around to move to a different company.  Since I have started working there the culture has changed.  I enjoy the people that I work for and the company itself.  My management team has changed which is why I was looking to move.  In the position that I am in as a Home Loan Processor there is no room for advancement.  In the area that we are in there are also no other positions to look for.  I was being challenged to move up within the position and when my management team changed that stopped.  I look to learn from my positions.  I need to be challenged and look to learn something new every day.  That was no longer happening at Wells Fargo.  A typical day for me was processing loans, contacting customers, underwriters, closers, title companies, data analysis and working with new loan officers to help them learn the process.  The hardest part of the job was when we stopped being challenged and held back to just doing what was with in our job description.  The best part of the job was the people I worked with and the relationships I made with my customers.  I enjoyed the satisfaction of closing a loan."
good,"I learned a lot about the mortgage industry, had a great deal of training with short-sales and deed in lieu's. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"As stated above, working for Aramark at the Wells Fargo Center, is a pretty easy going job. Not really a difficult working environment, and plenty of room for growth. Only real downside, is limited working hours, but other than that, no complaints. Solid job overall, if looking for a viable part-time option."
good,starting a typical day at wells fargo is a fast paste environment. have to be able to handle multiple task at once. each morning would consist on coming in 15mins early to read emails and bullentings so that you are aware of any changes to be able to provide correct information to customers
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the clients.  Many visited weekly if not daily and the best part was getting to know them and watch their business grow.
good,"It's a pretty laid back position. It's a very diverse atmosphere so you're bound to find someone that you could develop a friendship with, or even just a work buddy. The hardest part of the job is having to meet the sales goals by following the procedures they have outlined. Overall it was a pretty good job."
good,"•	Analyze the customer’s financial situation and make recommendations on loan modification workout options to resolve delinquency."
good,"Wachovia was a relaxing job, as most banking is done online now. The room for advancement was minimal, especially with the change over to Wells Fargo."
good,"I assisted customers in their daily activities of their bank affairs, also I was a sales rep where I showed the benefits of adding on accounts, getting credit cards. I learned the different products that Wells Fargo offered that makes life better.  Co-workers were nice and friendly.  The hardest part of the job was taking short breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job is great benefits, good management, and providing world class customer service."
good,"Pros:"
good,"I liked being that part of the team. My colleagues were very helpful and professional."
good,Easy to feel like you are just a number. Your only as good as your last quarter results.
good,The job itself is decent and okay but the process is very frustrating.  The processors are very hard to work with as all files are inaccurate and require lots of corrections.  Certain title companies are very helpful and have developed strong connections where as some are very slow and inaccurate.
good,Fortunate to have had this opportunity with the flexibility of balancing home life of young children through life transitions
good,"Typical day is running reports, review doucments such as: paystubs, partnerships and tax returns. The biggest key is time management"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Rewarding, Fast pace, Enjoyed traveling, Great management"
good,great job after college. advancement typical 8 to 10 years. most enjoyable people and team work
good,"WF is a pleasant place to work, but I find the environment a bit dull.  My job is 9-5 and we do not get overtime, so I have a good work/life balance."
good,"Wells Fargo had a great training program and it is where I gained most of my teller education. Their in-store banks provided flexible scheduling options while I continued to go to school and provided me with reasonable compensation to support myself. Overall Wells Fargo was a great place to get started and helped provide me with insight on different was business handle customer service, training programs and how the business is ran."
good,Check in would start first thing in the morning and  each deposit would be separated out by location and then dispersed into teams. I learned a lot of different ways to make deposits in the system. Management was good about making sure the work flow was productive. Co-workers were very team oriented. No knowing when we were going to get finished because we worked on production. Not having to work weekends after a week of working long hours.
good,"I was contacted by a recruiter at CDI staffing in regards to a job opening with the Wells Fargo help desk support team. Training was intense but I enjoyed it. I learned a lot there. I got a long with most of my co-workers. On a typical day, all calls were from Wells Fargo employees seeking assistance with password resets for work station log ins, new employees setting up their profiles and managers calling in to make employee rights and roster adjustments. Work atmosphere was casual and I got along with my work colleagues.I do not recall there ever really being anything terribly difficult about the job. I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo."
good,"This was my first job and I learned a lot about responsibility. "
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo because you get a chance to work with a large amount of different people from different cultures across many different departments.  It was a very low-stress environment and I was given a lot of opportunities to lead teams and hone in on some of my management skills.
good,"Typical Day"
good,"My typical day of work starts in the morning when I get money out of the vault for the day, run the night drop deposits. I help hundreds of customers per day in a timely manner with their requests. Constant money handling is what I do all day. I learned a lot about banking from this job, a lot of things that I have never known. The hardest part of the job are the sales goals."
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with as many customer loans as i can get through. First, i have to ensure that all the documents necessary for insuring a VA loan are available. Then as one of the people who can sign documents i sign a document affirming that the loan has met all minimum requirements necessary for it to be insured through the VA. However, if it does not i open up deficiencies on the loan that get worked on by our VA exception team to procure necessary documents that we need. These later come to me and i review to see if they are what we need and i sent them in to be imaged if they are correct, and satisfy the deficiency so loans can be insured. "
good,"Inbound call center"
good,"Great place to work if you like meeting people, or are used to sales driven culture. Promotions based heavily on sales numbers and not merit."
good,"Good work environment."
good,"Although it is a great work environment, it is not a great company to work for. There is no job security and you're stuck in one position to long before you move up."
good,the benefits are great!  pay is good... management not so much
good,"Every day I come in to work, sit down at my desk and process people's documents needed for their loans and this is through emails. so I open up the email and upload those documents into our system calls EDM. The hardest part about my job is being able to keep up with the emails because I'm usually in there by myself in the mornings."
good,"The day to day was always different. I learned about teamwork, sales, loan applications, Notary Public, customer service, wire transfers, currency exchange, safe deposit box and so many other things."
good,Wells Fargo was good at identifying the strengths of their employees and training and promoting them to positions where they can succeed.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great Company if you end up in a good department and have a good manager. Excellent Benefits!! Only bad thing is a lot of talented individuals get passed up. Too much competition and very little room for career advancement within certain departments.
good,From opening till closing the pace was fast. I was placed in a high traffic store. I've learned a lot about working in a high pressure environment with a lack of appropriate support. Co-workers were mostly a great cohesive team. I was blessed with a manager who worked with me effectively. Hardest part of the job was the long hours and the lack of balance with family life. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers and most of the customers. Giving them guidance to help them succeed financially made me feel great.
good,"I enjoy working with wells fargo, I am looking for a career change"
good,Sales skills are a must to move up. Job is very self motivated and constant sales pressure to meet your sales quota. You must enjoy customer service and interaction planning financial goals. Training is provided and mentoring for promotion is on site.
good,"A typical day consisted of coaching bankers on consumer and small business products, prospecting, cross selling opportunities, account servicing, credit and credit knowledge."
good,This company is more for people that just want to be a teller forever.
good,The management style is relaxed but not focused. Work flow is merely estimated not projected based on the statistics which cause quick turn over at this company.
good,"Being a bank officer would sometime have to open up the financial center. Then began my day  with setting goals  for the day. In sales, paper work, customer service and teller staff couching.  Plan for then achieving my daily goal.  I help walk in customer with there current needs and future needs. contacted existing customer for service satisfaction. I would couch tellers in how to identify customer need just in conversation with them  as they helping them with there service needs. Show them what to look for in sales opportunity. Such as credit cards, new account and loans. A part of my day would be spent processing paper work, inputting loans in the computer, check for loan approvals, opening new accounts and following up with my customer. At the end of the day cool down, wrap up all work for the day, secure all document in a locked location. Process in of day paper work for out going mail. Wrap up the financial center for the day by closing all systems and finalizing all paper work, for out going processing. Lock and secure the building."
good,"If you want a job that has you constantly thinking about when you go back in while outside work then this is it. This job has great pay benefits, and even a lot of room for advancement for those dreaming of financial/sales careers. I however was not. I usually came in around 8:45am, and did not (could not) leave until 7:30pm. This job allows you to keep your night life activities, but the paperwork, fast paced, goal driven, job will make you very tired. I used to crash normally around 2:00am. At this job I was ready to knock out at around 9:30/10:00pm. A ton of micromanagement here, and pray that you get a manager willing to help you grow instead of attack you about lack of sales at the end of EVERY day. Good luck."
good,Review daily store sales goals/personal sales goals and brainstorm ways to achieve these goals. Assist customers coming into the branch. Make cold-calls to set future appointments. Management closely watches daily activities and suggests ways to create more traffic/sales opportunities.
good,"tremendous support available, great co workers and management."
good,good benefits and you get what you put in. too many gamers to watch out for.
good,"process vendor invoices for repossesed vehicles"
good,"The hardest part of my job policies are always changing, so its good to keep track and read them everyday.  My co workers are really a team player, we help each other and make sure we understand the logic of the problem."
good,"I have worked at the bank in a few different positions, but this one is the most enjoyable.  t placed me the ideal position to be able to have managerial authority but still have the day interaction with customers. interacting with customer is my favorite thing to do. Knowing that what I do everyday can help people reach their financial goals,"
good,"I loved Wells Fargo job and company as a whole but not the location I was at. A typical day was very quiet and not very fun. Unrealistic rules, management gossiping and lying about employees. I learned a lot about retail banking and products. The hardest part about the job was the turnover in management and the last set of management I had before leaving was very disrespectful to employees. The most enjoyable part about my job was the customers."
good,"As a Wells Fargo employee, my job is to have every single one of my clients leave Wells Fargo with a smile on their face, despite how they entered. There was a customer who came in the branch to cash a check. I introduced myself to the customer and his reply was not so pleasant. He was very upset regarding the fees he was charged to his Chase bank account. He also explained how he did not have direct deposit with his job. I then asked him how frequently did he use his debit card, and he replied that he uses his card about 100 times a month. I quickly introduced him to our Way 2Save checking account, which could benefit him since the account automatically becomes free when the debit card linked, is used at least 10 times a month. I invited him to my office and explained to him more in detail in how the account worked. After we spoke, he agreed to switch, as long as it saved him money. While I was going through the customer’s financial review with him, I also discovered he had a business accounts with Chase. These accounts were being charged fees due to the minimum balance not being met, so I asked him a few questions regarding his business and came to a conclusion that the Gold Business Package would work for this client. The requirement for this account would be for him to transfer a certain amount of money from his checking to his savings account once a month. He seemed relieved and willing to start this new account. A couple of days later, I made an appointment with the customer and opened up his business account. I love helping customers to succeed financially on a day-to-day"
good,Great people and management. Awesome place for entry level employees to get a firm base in a professional environment.
good,After the 2008 merger a lots of things changed . I  love what I do.
good,"I worked here as a temp for 3 months, but I liked it a lot. Management seemed great!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Being a Business Associate within the Business Banking Group, I feel my position is to bridge the gap that connects the company, management team, partners and my clients to reach their goals all whilst building a trusting relationship. I regularly provide up to date information to the Business Relationship Managers regarding their clientele, which results in a new services and an even more committed relationship. It’s a team effort, which I enjoy!"
good,I enjoyed the being able to satisfy someone and making it possible to live the next 30 years stress free
good,"Competitive, time-sensitive, and very detail and customer-oriented environment. Requires a great deal of knowledge and experience with various financial systems, applications, and electronic imaging and data technology."
good,"I enjoy wells.  Management is competent, and the company seems to be very well run.  Be careful of contracts though, as there is somewhat of an annual cycle with funding cuts."
good,"I learned how to make creativity work in a very structured environment.  The management team had a great vision and idea, but had a hard time understanding outside sales.  The hardest part of my job was cold calling banking products.  The most enjoyable part of my job was closing the deal."
good,There were ups and downs with this company.  It was tough to work there during the recession.
good,Typical day at work was to retrieve reports from database to review and present have ready for management meeting. I would review work load for the morning and check for any voice messages on phone. I've learned how to send and track FedEx packages. The co-workers were team players. The hardest part of job was going into another department researching information for investigations and the most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards and bonus that management acknowledgement of our work efforts.
good,They have great benefits. I loved my customers and built great relationships. I learned about working with money and what goes into  the banking world.
good,"The turnover rate with both tellers and management is far too high."
good,"A good place to start off after graduating college. Good way to get experience, but looking to advance career outside of Wells Fargo."
good,Many tasks to complete apart from helping customers all day. Hardest part of the job is assuring all customers are taken care of correctly and handling belligerent customers. Most enjoyable part of my job is spending time with my coworkers.
good,pay is lower than most in mortgage industry.  has great benefits
good,advancement is kinda poor however fast paced work friendly co workers and management
good,"I really liked the bank, however the goals were very difficult to achieve some days, so it made it tough!"
good,"focus is on servicing"
good,"Wachovia was an environment where the customers meant more to the company than its employees as opposed to there being a balance in the significane of the two. While there were lucrative opportunities available for employees looking to advance, the pathways to those opportunities often were muddled in contingencies. This particular employment situation was the epitiome of the ""ends not justifying the means,"" particularly with regards to the daily commute & the hazards that accompanied it at that particular time."
good,"A day to day at wells fargo is different every day. Work start as soon as we hit the door. As a personal banker, our job was to help current customers with any questions or problems with their accounts. We were also responsible for selling new accounts/banking products for new customers, such as checking and savings, credit cards, loans, ect. We had daily goals to meet that would help us commission on a quarterly basis. Management was very pushy about the sales, to make sure we hit our daily goals. As for my co-workers, everyone I worked with were very helpful with things I might of had trouble with. The hardest part about the job was trying to still meet the daily goals on a slow day. It was times like that, we would have to get creative and make things happen. What I enjoyed most about the job was meeting new people and establishing new relationships every day."
good,"Established meaningful relationships with customers and provided financial guidance with student loan consolidation information."
good,"I started working at WF as a phone banker after my previous job closed and was there for 6 months. The job was not hard, but their sales goals are relatively lofty for someone who has no interest in cross selling products that customers don't need (which they encourage, they don't really care what you do as long as you meet your numbers). If you can put up with the BS for about 9 months then there is room for advancement if you wish, because of the high turnover there are always positions and if you make nice with your supervisors, they will help you out. If I hadn't disliked the sales and the extreme attendance policies (you get sick, you get a demerit even if you have sick time and I think it was 3 and you're fired). I will say the benefits are a little above decent because they are a big corporation. "
good,"I programmed reports, learned about programming there, the co workers were nice enough and things went ok."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"During an average work day i will research customer inquires, which include problem solving individually and group environment "
good,I am very grateful for the opportunity. The company expects premier customer service levels. I've learned to work around different characters to resolve issues. Management is great but needs to enforce firm policies in a uniform and specific manner.
good,I think employees get treated well and the hours worked well for my schedule.
good,Wells is a very large bank with a decentralized business model.
good,Everyone in the office is very nice except the president of the office who reigns supreme with fear.
good,"The job is not to bad as long as you can deal with lots of customers all the time, but it was difficult to sell the products to the same client base that called into the phone bank day in and day out. The days were long and it was very busy. Customers frequently called in angry and frustrated so you sometimes had to deal with abusive people and we were not able to hang up on them if they got to ridiculous which was very frustrating. Most of the management team were respectful and courteous, but it is very difficult to get any help from someone when you really needed it. A typical day at work would consist of about 60-100 incoming calls, depending on call volume, with 2, 15 minute breaks, and 1 30 minute lunch. The coworkers tended to gossip and complain about customers but that is something that happens at every job. Teamwork is a very important aspect of the job, even though you are spending your time on the phone. Overall it was an OK place to work, the job was tedious but not that hard, and there is  lot of opportunities for job advancement as long as you can exceed the sales goals required. If you can't meet those sales goals , then job security is very shaky."
good,"Account Executive for $1.3M Real Estate driven book of business."
good,"A typical day at work consist of financial sales"
good,Call center in which as an employee you are only looked at as a number!
good,"busy"
good,"Id work there again. "
good,"Working at Wells Fargo Advisors will vary in quality of life balance depending on what department you're in and what region as well."
good,Providing customer service and knowledge about Wells Fargo products. Working in a customer service call center environment it requires you to contain your composer at all times. Being knowledge about the products and the company allowed me to be successful at the position I was in. It was self rewarding when I was able to accomplish and educate the customers about their situation.
good,"Worked at an in store branch and it was terrible.  They stay open later than regular banks and sales are harder to come by because its inside a grocery store.  Customers are only dollars as far as this company is concerned.  Your expected to sell customers on checking accounts, savings and things like that.  There were also no chairs so you had to stand up all day.  If your not a teller, then you have a chair to sit in.  Not that bad of a place to work.  Just didn't like the teller aspect of it."
good,"Not a bad job if you like sales, however the sales goals were created to be hard to reach and hard to understand. Management was always willing to help with any questions and was very supportive. Plenty of opportunities to advance if you have the drive"
good,"Teams run as silos. Training is available and good, hours are long."
good,"While working at Wells Fargo, I learned to work in a team environment as well as an indivdual contributer. "
good,"could be stressful dealing with upset customers, learned to be patient, had great co workers, management knew their job functions well, employee reviews/and being critiqued was hard. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The Home Equity portion of Wells Fargo Beaverton is unstable with new requirements and guidlines outlined by the goverment to protect the consumer
good,"I needed a job to get me through school, they wanted me there almost everyday including weekends. Not for me."
good,"I worked at a production environment place, we always have something to do, I loved to stay busy because it make the time go by so quick..I leaned to be a better co-worker, for example help others when needed... the hardest part of the job is not doing nothing, and the managers are doing a good job finding work and taking us to team lunches, and awarded us for going a great job.."
good,"I really like wells fargo. Advancement is not very fast pace. Not enough help during the day, short staffed alot."
good,"Co-employees are very helpful, easy to get along with, friendly, therefore work is productive."
good,WF is a great company that holds a high standard of performance and employee expectations.
good,"Its a typical inbound call center environment. When you get to work you have to log in immediately. There is 6 weeks of classroom training before you start taking live calls. There are a lot of banking regulations that you have to have knowledge of so that you don't break the law r give incorrect information. I worked at the largest call center that they run and the campus is beautiful. Great amenities right on the campus such as Starbucks, Chic fil-a, and a dry cleaner just to name a few."
good,"I feel as though executive management sits around all day thinking up ways that they can instigate complete chaos in all of the employees lives and jobs. So they all come together and then they decide ways to make our jobs more miserable and more stressful from day to day. Not to mention, all of the times they decide to change our job duties (what we were hired for initially) and then having us do something completely different. I do not like the way that the company makes it's employees do a 180* turn with their positions. Everyone who works there wants stability and some sense of normalcy. It's hard to know what to expect from week to week or month to month there. Half the time, we don't know if we are coming or going."
good,A typical day at work was working to meet goals and deadlines. I learned that I could work independentaly as well as with a group and accomplish the same goals. Management was good (she would always say family first and worked with us so that we could do what was needed for our families). Awesome coworkers--easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was knowing that you had deadlines to meet and panicing because you dint think that the goals were going to be met--but we always did. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that had the same mind set.
good,come in set up and providing customer service
good,"A banking job is not all about sales it is about customer service, here at wells fargo we were pressured to sale to customers before even providing good customer service. We had to make cold calls and sound robotic with each customer. I disliked working there because not only did I hate sounding robotic, and pressuring my customers but one of my managers was stealing from the tellers. He later got caught but I left before I learned of this. Sales pressured you to hate your co-workers especially when they did well and got extra money added to their pay. Which I disliked them pinning our co-workers against each other, making it a terrible work environment."
good,"Very demanding company that does not consider the employee does not except employee feedback.To work there you some sometimes take managments words as a threat. Management does not give a fair shot for advancement, it's done by association and favortisim. Co workers as far as other tellers are excellent to work with.Hardest part of job is obtaining solutions from a customer."
good,I was employed with the company for almost 4 years.
good,Soliciting customers' for sales.
good,This position was a Mortgage Consultant. Again this used my people skills to assist clients in their efforts to obtain a mortgage.
good,"Excellent place to work, training is awesome, customer service always room for improvement"
good,"Very solid company that believes in the training and advancement of their talent. However, some of the company policies and procedures should be revised to tailor specific situations."
good,depends on the location and management. great benefits. hardest part is dealing with angry customers
good,A good job if your just starting our with plenty of space to expand and grow if considering a job in the financial banking sector. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This job was a lesson learned about homeless in NY. The lesson was definitely needed.
good,"You come in, get settled, then there's a morning huddle going over what happened the day before in terms of paperwork being filed in a timely manner and being balanced at the end of the day in their cash drawer and meeting the daily goals. The management is always right there making sure everyone's doing what their supposed to be doing. Co-workers were always friendly and they made the environment feel much more homely. The hardest part of my job was probably switching windows, because if you had to switch when there was a high volume of customers, you have to get your paperwork finished and balance your few hundred thousand dollar cash drawer in just a few minutes, without error. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers. You get your regulars and it's always nice to see a familiar face. Hearing the customers stories while you take care of their transactions is always a joy."
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of job is helping customer's in need.
good,"Monday through Friday I process transactions for multiple companies , and once a week I work in the receiving where I log the work that is delivered. A lot of typing involved also with having good accuracy and attention to details."
good,A typical work day for consisted of attempting to obtain as many sales of banking products as possible along with maintain high level of service and keeping appointments. I was also required to solve customer service issues and retain customers with high balances.
good,"I learned a lot about the environment of working in an office, how it's managed and organization. My least favorite thing about this job is that my position was a little too dry for me. The best part of this job is the freedom and trust they enstil in their associates"
good,"There's a lot of policy and procedure involved which the company is very strict about. You meet different kinds of people(races, countries, etc)and work with a great staff."
good,Great experience depending on divison of company. Room for growth if you are in the correct division. Great leaders.
good,"I have worked in the Financial Crime department for 2.5 years. I have enjoyed the challenges and the ever-changing scenerios the position brings. I am never bored with my work. I have the opportunity to assist and educate people as well as take care of those who are taken advantage of. I enjoy my co-workes and my immediate management team, who makes working at Wells a family-like environment."
good,Although it has been several years since I have worked for this company I will provide the fairest review possible. I would have recommended this company as an entry level job. They are very family oriented and an unbias company. However they have been sold to Wells Fargo and although I havent worked for that company I haven't heard good things about them.
good,Enjoyable and friendly workplace. Typically quiet but has its moments.
good,"A typical day of work for me involves hard work with providing good customer service to a customer whether it's this person or that person. Taking leadership in doing most of the opening procedures, being multitasked when it comes to many different things that involve making it a productive day. This would include selling money, while completing a tranasction, filling the atm with cash and or receiving cash shipments in the middle of a rush at lunch time."
good,"Job responsibilities were to review and interpret service orders, and keep detailed records of work activities. Job also required installation of Cat5e cable and Fiber optic cables (single mode &multi mode) and testing of each line installed. Patching network equipment: servers, router, switches and optical data lines back to demark"
good,"Job responsibilities were to run Windows XP image on new computers. Add user profile to the new computer from the old pc, and manually configure network printer for each floor IP scheme. Also recorded inventory on all asset tag on old and new computers in Dell’s inventory software."
good,Cash handling
good,the stress to get referrals in that job was stressful. the upper management didn't value us
good,Opportunity to learn many facets of the business
good,During the wachovia/weels fargo merger there were so many people who wanted to advance and keep their jobs
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I answered phone calls. I learned about customer service, diffusing customers and excellent phone skills. The hardest part of the job was convincing customers to try new products or services."
good,Great hours monday-saturday 9-6/8-4pm
good,"My typical day consist of processing received documentation from applicants who have applied for home mortgage, Once required documents are received they are forwarded to underwriters for initial review . if some comes back as a condition ,I the have to call either the applicant . home mortgage consultant , or the title company. Although my job can be stressfull the company will have catered lunches for coworkers, they may have contest where gift cards are given"
good,"A typical day at work consists of coming in, opening the vault, getting your cash, and helping customers with transactions."
good,The company gives financial advisors the tools to build their book of business successfully. Unfortunately their proprietary software used was not nearly as efficient as the software used before the merger. It created a lot of problems.
good,"You work on striving to meet deadlines every hour. It can be stressful because co-workers work slower than others.The management has a challenging task from day to day,dealing with delegating the work.The hardest part of the job is working 10 hours with only one 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch.The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits that they offered to us.I have learned to work independently, and accurating to accomplish my daily goal and to provide good customer service for our customers"
good,I enjoy working for Wells Fargo it is a very large diverse workplace with plenty of perks and bonuses
good,"Learned alot, lots of opportunity for growth. Definitely a political and coporate environment."
good,The management was not fair. The benefits were good. The company promotions were bias.
good,"Wells Fargo provides as good of trainig as anybody and was an excellent experience! I was successful and able to get promoted three times with in two years. However, there was a higher turnover ratio than what I saw at restaraunts in college and positions opened frequently due to unhappy employees. The company had the feel of a place that is struggling to find more ways to increase revenues and decrease expenses for shareholders and seems to attempt this with immediate gratification of daily sales that may not be in their customers best interest."
good,"Great benefits and hours. I work at a store that has a very ""old/ elderly"" demographic, which makes it hard to sell new and modern products. The town is also very small so when you're expected to hit a sales goal it is hard when you do not have the resources, i.e. customers. Management is happy when you have your numbers, otherwise they are constantly on you and are very negative about it. Also they told me they promote within and this has not happened for anyone in my branch due to its small size and that upper management does not desire nor need to advance you. Only way to advance is slowly and at a larger branch"
good,"They don't value their employees too much, but you go get a lot of cash-handling experience. Management team micromanages and adhere to fake/unconvincing scripting."
good,"They have a ""saleat all cost"" attitude! If you're not used to or cut for it it can be overwhelming!"
good,"All Retail positions have sales goals. These are ambitious goals. If you like the sales and competitive side of retail, you'll probably enjoy working for Wells Fargo. Half of the sales comes to you, the other half you have to go out and get"
good,its a place good to grow if you did not finish school and the benefits are great. The management could be better. I worked for the call center the times are perfect because it is open 24/7 of the day
good,"You answer phones and emails. There are various roles at this company and lots of departments. No, one department is the same. I will say all departments are customer service related."
good,"The Bond Operations Team is a small, specialized unit within Corporate Trust Services. Positions within this company offer great benefits and a good work/life balance, but the company culture is stuck in the past. There are often long periods of downtime with no work to be done, and working from home is never possible. Salary could be much higher, and management could be much better."
good,I’m only giving it three stars because it’s a very stressful job that wasn’t for me. If you’re great under extreme pressure this is for you. My managers and coworkers were awesome.
good,"I gained an incredible amount of knowledge in regard to credit bureau data and its format and use."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The work atmosphere is great and the people are easily to get along with. The management is available when you need them to be and if the manager isn't the work directors are.
good,"I liked the diversity that you would see on an everyday basis. "
good,"Morning huddles to get a overview how your day should look like. Learn to have empathy and put myself in customer position. Depending what branch you work, some manager are really nice and try to help you succeed. Some managers need help keeping their personal feeling out of certain situation. Hardest part of my job was dealing with co worker who really didn't care about their job, which have a bad domino effect!  Most enjoyable part of my job is meeting different people and listening to them and the journey they be taking, and how we as a bank can help them accomplish what are their financial goals."
good,I was a contractor at Wells Fargo via Teksystems. Was not bad but Technology is one of those fields where you need to expect that the position won't last forever.
good,"Large organization looking to transform with a new CEO."
good,"Customer service job, your experience is contingent upon both the personalities of your customers and the people you work with.  It is easy to move laterally/horizontally within the company, however you must be in your current role for at least a year to be eligible for movement."
good,It's great start in gaining work experience. You'll encounter everything and anything. For starting part time positions the pay is good. More hours more responsibility same pay.
good,"Lockbox is very customer orientated, fast paced, good option for working 4 days a week.  Not much training happens with all employees.  Advancement can be difficult.  Management doesn't really talk to employees.  Work directors are in charge.  4 layers of management, very confusing who to go to because they all tell you to go to another one.  If you like to not talk at work this would be a place to work"
good,"Some of the best coworkers, I have met. Didn't care for the manager as I didn't feel he was approachable or engaging. I liked the diversity of people."
good,"I worked on a contract for Wells Fargo, and it was nice to be able to work from home. It was also nice to cultivate a new set of skills that I can take forward with me. I just wish the pay for the amount of work was better, as well as having more opportunities to learn or just interact with my peers."
good,"When customers get upset"
good,"The work was interesting on the IT side. I did not have a desk because the floor I sat on was extremely congested. The overall culture was good but stiff, it did not seem as though people were happy to be at work."
good,Management was great and understanding. Flex shifts were offered to assist with a work-life balance. Vacation was strict. Environment was very new at my time of employment
good,"Good benefits and plenty of time off, however in my case, i had three significant life changing events in one year. Subsequently, was penalized because my time off was not scheduled. Ya cant schhedule your mom passing away, your son going into kidney failure and when you happen to break your foot. Iwaapenalized"
good,did not work there long enough to give sufficient review of the company.  tried to move my book of business from previous employer but unfortunately there was a strong no compete clause that limited what I could do.
good,Would come back if I needed. I am only leaving because I want to go to school full time and don’t have enough time for work as well. Four nice bonuses as well simply for level of customer service.
good,"This company tries so hard to keep their customers happy that they forget about their employees. There's favoritism in the job. If your manager likes you most likely they'll do anything to keep you, look the other way when certain things happen."
good,Good company to work for in regards to benefits. There is a great opportunity to become a part of diversity groups. There are also opportunities for paid time to do charity work.
good,"the salary offers are terrible.  the sales comp plans are pretty low"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This position is for a fast paced individual that wants to do customer service and sales. U refer customers to bankers and have balance ure drawer daily.
good,My time at Wells Fargo taught me a lot about the financial industry. There is too much focus on sales metrics and needs to be more focus on customers.
good,Great employees to work with and a decent environment. Has a lot of parking space. Does offer benefits and accommodations per the employees needs. Could have a couple tweaks and changes to the culture but good people to get to know while working there
good,"The work life balance and salary structure is good but the quality of work is not as per the expectation."
good,WF has great benefits.  Upper management passes stress level down to managers.  Tellers and bankers work extremely hard and have to endure reputational stress.
good,Good benefits but compensation could’ve been better. Never offered overtime so you’d always hit no more than 40 hrs a week if you’re full time. Sales driven environment even if the customer didn’t need a product they really push you to make the sale.
good,The company was fine to work for and the people were lovely. They offer online courses for self-advancement that you can take at home in your spare time.
good,"Great work environment, what i loved was being my clients problem solver.  Every time i met with a new client or and existing one with a challenge we would do a deep dive to see how and what solutions we could find.  I had a great team to work with and it made our client satisfaction increased and people enjoyed to come in to the bank because they felt like family."
good,Handle more then 100 calls per day able to control handle time and assist customers. The ability to offer other Wells Fargo products to sell to customers.
good,"they thrive on a positive customer experience for personal and small businesses. Was able to assist many business owners financially. Always gave me satisfaction in assist these owners,"
good,"The job itself was easy and enjoyable.  I liked getting to spend time with customers and help them with financial needs and determining how to best meet financial goals.  "
good,"I enjoyed working in the production center fulfilling the print requests for pitch books, company information books, certificates, cd copies, training materials, post cards, etc. We were a small group of around 10 which had to depend on others finishing what you could not, on occasion. Sometimes I stayed longer to finish my own and others work. Very fast-paced and often compared to co-workers. The bankers (our in-house clients) were not always patient. My boss was flexible with scheduling for me which made all the difference in the world to me!"
good,"Dealing with money and finances, you have to have a very loyal and secure team. Working with the managers and customers is a huge trust environment. Overall it was a learning experience that I can use for my skills in the future."
good,The work ethic environment is very rigid. There isn't room for error and there is always room for improvement. Training and keeping employees up-to date on laws.
good,fast-paced. to be quick enjoy time away don't let it be personal put yourself in their shoes use empathy be courteous continuing education and good breakfast and lunch and dinner.
good,"The culture here is phenomenal. The message is all about how the people make the difference and the company is very focused on developing employees. The routines set in place to reinforce the behaviors are phenomenal. Resources available to leaders for improving coaching style are endless! They have even taken external leadership theories and incorporated those into the resources and training available. Highly engaged and talented people work here, making it a great place to network and grow."
good,Wells Fargo expected employees to obtain clients to originate new loans. The sales compensation was reasonable up to the 2009. After 2009 Wells Fargo compensation did not match the federal government changes to reflect and match the compensation.
good,"A good Company to start off but after a while you will see that there is a lot of room for improvement."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The main focus at Wells Fargo is customer experience. Customers are always greeted and we are prompted to always ask questions and get it right the first time! We also ensure that we are communicating well with other team members and doing the job that is expected of us. This is a very demanding job and a lot if expected from you so if you love customers and enjoy helping people financially, then this is a great place to be."
good,"A typical day at work is signing in and taking calls from the time you come in until the time you leave.  If you don't mind speaking with entitled people all day, then this is the place for you."
good,They would rather hire a bunch of contractors with minimal training and end contracts just as you begin to get the hang of the job. It s a weird cycle and is why they never successfully finish projects.
good,Working for Wells Fargo was an experience that taught me much discipline and how to have an efficient work ethic. I worked well with my fellow coworkers and we had displayed great team work.
good,I was a part-time teller inside the branch and at the drive through.  I was hoping to apply for an Accounting position but had to stay in my teller position for at least a year before I could be considered for Accounting.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good first job going into banking. Starting at $15/hr is great if you’re young. But as far as advancement they make you wait certain lengths of time before you can do anything. If you want to move up you have to wait 6 months, then a year. They have lots of benefits, always have free coffee throughout the day. You’re on the phone the entire time you’re there though. Which is draining."
good,"I started as a teller and progressed to a banker. It is widely known that the large retail banks pay as little as they can. This has gotten even worse as they removed any commissions or bonuses."
good,"A typical day on the job would be getting on the phones to help clients with their inquiries about there accounts; balance transfers, cash advances, closing out accounts....etc..."
good,Wells Fargo did teach me so much about leadership and management how to coach effectively and be able to understand each persons personality. Working with peers were great. Being able to learn different cultures and people. The hardest part was doing working to improve and move up in the company but was always overlooked due to favoritism.  Its hard when you raise your concern and at the end you the one who get punished. Management do not really care about out even though they preach about treating customer in a human level but as an employee they do not show you human level they only care about themselves
good,"poor management. change procedures regularly, one day they would have you do something and then next day will change it to a different way. not pleasant working there."
good,I gained some valuable skills in terms of cold calling and loan processing. I was only there for a year but it was a great stepping stone into the world of sales.
good,"The culture is different than a high tech company.  There's no perks like free lunches or breakfast.  There's a lot of meetings every day.  On average, more than 5 a day."
good,"Don't slam sales down peoples throat. Be nice, and professional and help them before you try to act like your a hero. Learn to work with others and learn from your mistakes."
good,"The typical day at wells was, reviewing files, getting setting them up for when there ready to close. once they are ready double check and send them to title for docs. The one that signed review the package for all corrected signature and all funding conditions."
good,"It is a stable job, but can be very stressful. I hated the phones but there was unlimited overtime available and opportunities for bonuses if you were a competitive employee"
good,"Great place to work, with flexible hours, overtime pay. Inconsistent with keeping team members, management is not the greatest. Learn many new things with customer experience and how to handle hard situations."
good,"A typical day at work is to answer 8 emails per hour and in a correct response."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,corporate politics and inside groups. it is who you know not how hard you work. I work day and night and I was still not good boy because I don't know everyone and they don't know me good yet.
good,"Simply put, I enjoyed my managers and the staff, but the company itself had very unrealistic sales goals and expectations, with bonuses being very lacking."
good,"Good company. Very laxed but csr is extremely busy, stressful and doesn't pay well. The hours vary but management will gladly work with you to accommodate your needs."
good,This position was during the mortgage meltdown era. It's unfortunate that my time here was so limited. I came from 6 figure income during the height of the mortgage boom and simply put Wells Fargo could not compete during this time of economic crisis.
good,"Working in claims, there was a lot of people trying to climb the corporate ladder and they didn't seem to care who they stepped on to get there. The atmosphere is stressful and cut-throat."
good,"The teller position was an easy job task after changing the CEO in 2016. With the previous CEO, the job was very stressful because we had high sales quotas. They expect teller to sell 80 financial products every quarterly, which was impossible at my location. With new CEO there is no sales quotas so the job is way less stressful. The branch I currently worked at is not big on promoting their employees but some other branches really care about seeing their employees grow within the company. The management at my branch has very poor management skills. They will show favoritism and do not encourage their employees to move up in the company. I have been in the same position for almost 3 years, and careless for me to succeed. All my other coworkers have been in the same position 8 years which is insane . I talk about move up within the company with my branch manager, but he discourages me not too. Some employees who worked at other branches have a manager who cares about their employees elevating, which is nice. I guess I got the short end of the stick to work at a branch where the management style is horrible. Wells Fargo is a great place to work , but if you want to succeed you need to have the right people on your team , if not you will not succeed with the company ."
good,"Worked second shift including Saturdays. On average you work ten hours shift. "
good,"The manager was not very good. Two face and really would not help you out if you had a problem with a Finance Advisor "
good,Wells Fargo was a place of stressful working conditions.  It went from 3 Associates manding the office to two.  When one was out only one was left to take care of the whole office.  I loved the customers and FA's I worked for.  I was treated with respect as a young black women in an all white office.
good,"Truly enjoyed my roll working for the bank.  Learned great customer service and cash handle experience.  Was able to advance in career and honestly, wish I had stayed in the banking field"
good,"Wells Fargo is an OK place to work but it totally depends on your location/branch and what managers are above you. some managers can be extremely pushy on sales, some can be real stiglers about punctuality, so on and so forth."
good,very reactive and not enough planning. different people have different requirements for the job. skill sets don't match..some management do not communicate
good,Wonderful friendships & patient managment. Great benefits and volunteerhip oppotunities. Flexible schedule. But frustrating rejections from other sales/service units.
good,"Overall, the past 14 years with Wells Fargo have been a great experience.  They have a fast paced, high energy environment that allow you to take care of your customers with their valuable products and services."
good,Good company for anyone to grow. My typical day was to come in and do my work with no distractions from management or co-workers. Avoid being in mortgage division due to layoffs.
good,"Collection is a very hard department to work in, I didn't like collections because of what you were scripted to say to the customer and I am not a harsh person to make someone feel bad in order for them to pay.  I would rather give positive encouragement  advice on how to pay their bill or how to manage their money."
good,"fast paced and high call volume call center. "
good,Wells Fargo had amazing opportunities for career advancement but maybe too much opportunity. I think at times an employee can advance too fast for proper training to be implemented.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"They could stand to provide more learning opportunities. In my department there is no standardized training or training period. You learn as you go. Overall, not a bad company to work for."
good,"Could not swap with an individual who wanted to go full time when I wanted to go part time so that I could attend school in the same branch. It was not a branch policy, it was a Wells Fargo policy. We would have both had to ""quit"" and apply for each other's position once they were posted."
good,WF is a stickler for attendance regardless of if a personal severe personal situation that entails having to take time off from work to deal with it such as in my case when I was employed there.
good,Wells Fargo was a good company to work for. I needed to change hours for personal reasons and they could not accommodate me. That is the only reason I left.
good,"in my 7 years with the company i have excelled in all areas put in front of me. teller, banker, manager. in that time i witnessed and was directed to perform illegal procedures by management. customer service was mostly positive, but lies were directed to customers due to sales goals. I left because i could not take the lies and illegal actions. as you all know the highest of the food chain for Wells Fargo were either FIRED or forced to RESIGN. including CEO. Wells Fargo is broken and is trying to rebuild."
good,"Straight 40-hours"
good,Good company to develop a career in the financial industry very workplace culture and support from management is always there to help you develop and learn something new every day
good,"Wells is a great place to work. Due to closing's of branches, growth has become stagnant. I encourage individuals to apply, especially if they like banking. To go from Teller to a Personal Banker 1 is coming very rare. Also they are closing 6,000 branches which means the jobs are getting handed down to individuals who are already in the role."
good,"A typical day at Wells required you show up on time because management was always watching. Fit into the culture or be badgered and ridiculed with sarcaisic statements from management. "
good,I would go back to Wells Fargo if I knew they wouldn't have sale goals. Wells Fargo is over all a good company in my eyes. I think the have good products too. I still bank with them even though I am not employed with them anymore.
good,"Good first time career experience. Great benefits. Employed during the middle of many lawsuits that made it difficult to come to work each day trying balance defending what was going on, coaching a team, and being a productive employee."
good,"In my 11 years at Wells Fargo I have enjoyed working for the bank. They take care of their employees with pretty good health care, dental and vision care as well as a 401K. The salary is not very good."
good,I have been with company for almost 5 years and there’s no room for advancement the lead teller position that became avliable they said was no longer available several other employees at my branch applied for positions on several occasions and they are still in the same position .. these are employees that have been with this company for 4 plus years...
good,"A typical work day consisted of assisting customers cash checks, make deposits, withdraws, payments, and questions about their account. Helping customers understand banking if they weren't knowledgeable.  The branch I was at was very family oriented and was easy to work with.  Just like any company, their were some things that could have been handled better with management.  If you are not good with money and numbers this would be hard for anyone that worked there. Making sure you balance at the end of the day is key.  The enjoyable part about working there was great coworkers through out experience and having customers that knew me and only wanted to me to assist them."
good,"I've worked with Wells Fargo for several years and in several different roles. My husband is also a current employee.  I appreciated the benefits and the learning experience. A typical day was pretty laid back for the most part; however, efficiency is required."
good,"I went there through a temp agency. Had to file 15,000 files per day, and being a new guy there I had to study and take LOTS OF ONLINE CLASSES AND TESTS. But I can't do 15,000 files a day and finish their class and tests ALL AT THE SAME TIME. It was an impossible task. So I asked the manager if I could  take photos of the study material and bring it home to study so I have more time to reach my daily goal. She told me it was fine but...I got laid off the very next day for that same reason. "
good,Daily work involved incoming and out going calls to customers with past due amounts on credit cards.  Heavy on regulation due to phone and banking requirements.  Good support from company.  Heavy monitoring of work.  Expected to compete with other employees.
good,"It was a great place to work as long as you can up sale customers. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a normal Job. I was a temp there to help them close up the department, so there was not a whole lot of interaction with the company. For the time I was there the job was pleasant."
good,"Busy, always busy. Difficult to manage work and life but the benefits are great. Management can be a little more transparent but since Change for the better happened things look brighter."
good,Great people but most former leadership has made some poor decisions that have resulted in reputational risk to the team members and stock holders.  The overall culture and company support for its team members and communities is stellar.
good,"It's a great company , to work for but management was very rocky . Had great benefits and you will learn a lot . You tend to learn something new everyday."
good,I have worked at Wells Fargo for 5 years and I have been promoted three times already with a large pay increase each time. Great compensation and advancement opportunities.
good,"Awesome productive position. I was able to meet new clients, provide a portfolio to fit their needs. Follow up with clients on new and existing products."
good,"Great PTO and other benefits, work day is standard 40 hours, management depends on location. Bonus depends on customer service surveys and are way lower than with sales goals."
good,Loved being a teller but disliked the sales. It was a fast paced environment and provided me with lots of great skills. Wells Fargo was all together a great place to work.
good,on a daily i would about to able to build report with the customers that i would see on a daily basis. I am able to handle cash with deposits and as well as being able to withdraw money.
good,I did enjoy how they work very good as a team they really had you get to know your team members by doing activities together. The hardist part of the job was when you had a really bad call. I didn't like the part of the company that was not flexable at all
good,During my time working here I felt personally victimized by my direct supervisor. I asked about her treatment of me to others and they said it was standard. That she is hard on new employees to make them quit. Not to make a personal enemy of her or your time would be miserable.
good,"I'm not sure what kind of people they interview for, but I am not the judgmental, power hungry, robotic type person to stay there. I loved  my Teller position, the work, but the people to work with, that was the difficult part."
good,"Wachovia was one of the best companies I have ever worked for. Wells Fargo took over and immediately relocated all branch managers in the district. Customers were upset, teams had no support, it was a disaster. Then we received an increase of work responsibilities, including a strong pressure to sell every single bank product to every customer regardless of need. I left the company as fast as possible."
good,I interacted with all the cliets in order to deepen their relationship.  I was a successful  teller.  It was fun to work with outgoing co-workers.  The incentives were awesome!
good,very process oriented and solution driven. Management knows how to motivate employees to work towards a common unified goal. Processes are implemented to keep track and accountability.
good,"There is a lot of demand to up sell products. Your supervisor monitors your call to transfer-to-sales ratio constantly, and will give you a lot of encouragement to get those numbers up. But it's hard to up sell a product to an angry customer."
good,great place to work at but doesn't pay as much compared to competitors. the store manager are the nicest people out there. you go in take money out to put in the register and organize yourself. hardest part is helping customers when you cant understand them or they dont communicate what they want.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I obtained a great deal of Mortgage knowledge we constantly  had classes and group  meetings ...the working atmosphere  was great but at times it could be very stressful everyone  worked closely together and very helpful in assisting each other and always worked together as a Team.
good,"Needs to sale 3+ items per day or would get fired. Stressful and demanding. Really short staff and would have to work without any breaks, in other case you would have to eat while attending customers, which for me it was really unprofessional."
good,"Wells Fargo truly makes their employees feel like family. A great place to work for someone who's passionate about making a change. There is growth in the company, but you have to be willing to relocate most of the time."
good,"I expected more collaboration and exemplary conduct from senior and managerial staff. Lack the required training for advancement and learning the job. I thought they were more than a typical bank but I was disappointed. I hope that with the new Ceo things have changed for better, less pressure for achieving sales goals."
good,"I started with First Union, which was a great place to work,  Then First Union merged with Wachovia, and during this time, server consolidation was the rage, and I learned from this experience.  Then Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo.  By this time, I had been working basically on the same project the entire time, although it had grown to 100 times the size it was when I first started.  It was time to move on."
good,"Very old school and formal. Dress up, grind away, and maybe in a few years (or once a decade), you'll have a shot at moving up. It's a great place to work if you want safety and stability. Just don't be expected to earn top dollar for it, although they do have top notch benefits (some of which are unlocked by seniority)."
good,"fun environment, liked the people I work with. Good management, great benefits. come in sign on to computer, get calling borrowers about refinances, gather documents."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work. There are many friendly people and some good management. I loved the people I worked with and that trumped anything else about the job.
good,This branch within central sales has underwent many changes and it is no longer a sales role. It has morphed into a customer service/phone bank role. Great people work here though.
good,"After a good run of 23 yrs with the company, I learned on 10/17 that my contact center would be closed.  460 employees were displaced.  I loved my job and would not have left otherwise."
good,I would love to work there again. All of the manager were supportive. all of the employees were nice and worked together. We had a lot of pot lucks. All in all the environment was very laid back.
good,I would ensure the cash levels are where they need to be for the tellers to begin the day.  I ensured that losses were prevented as well as fraud.  Coaching and development of the employees were done daily.  I learned all of the essentials of banking and policies and procedures around banking.  The hardest part of the job was their was a significant pay cut after the law suit came out.  This caused income to take a cut. The most enjoyable part was building the relationships with my team as well as the customers.
good,"Wells Fargo Securities positions itself as a strong investment bank (aka ""bulge bracket"") but in reality is in a different league from its ""direct"" competitors such as BAML, BARC, DB, CITI and will take years before it gets to the top echelon."
good,"If you can land in the right department. I've seen and heard great stories from some, but for others it can be a nightmare. The right department will get you where you need to be, but every department isn't ideal."
good,My manager was extremely unhelpful and discouraging. Wasn't trained in the areas that were required of me to excel in. The culture overall was great and very customer service friendly. Extremely sales driven.
good,A great place to work with very strong career advancement initiatives. Diverse work force and strong emphasis on diversity. Great health benefits and Paid time off.
good,"Once you are at your desk for your schedule you must be logged onto your computer ready for working claims.  You are expected to work with very little interruptions unless job related.  "
good,"see resume"
good,"I would handle commercial Deposit drops, ATM replenishment, customer deposits/withdraws, sales, drive thru customers...etc. The direct management within the branch kept the office atmosphere relaxed and enjoyable."
good,I loved being a teller. It was a constance flow of work. My manager was great to work with and for. I loved helping and meeting new customer. I believe the compensation could have been greater.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Had scheduled breaks, changed bonus structure. Had crazy scripts that made us seem like robots. Had very high sales goals that were not achievable. Would not recommend to someone who does not like sales pressure"
good,"To start, Wells Fargo is probably as secure as you'll get and offer a really generous benefits programs with vacation, to medical and dental, to discounts offered. The only thing is the pitiful pay and even more pitiful of a raise you'll get for working 10 times harder than the person next to you. Hours are good and management seems selective in terms of who is a good manager vs a bad one. If you're looking for a temp stay with benefits, this is your place."
good,"Worked in various positions at Wells Fargo.  I loved the potential for advancement and the ability to learn more and more of the financial industry."
good,"A typical day at work consists of myself clocking in, planning my day out, then executing the work plan. I still have to be flexible with incoming calls and emails while I am working as well. The culture is very diverse and the management is excellent."
good,"I did typing, 10key, put computers together, repaired Xerox machine, customer service & etc.  I learned to be a team player, management was fine.  Working & helping my associates0"
good,"At Wells Fargo, I worked as PB1 and thoroughly enjoyed working with my set of customers and new customers who came into the branch.  Being able to help people look at the bigger picture financially was very satisfying.  The sales push was not in my comfort zone unfortunately."
good,The company thrived on diversity. Flexible schedule and room for advancement. Training provided for other positions if qualified. Team work environment.
good,Great for someone with a entrepreneur type mindset. You will learn how to build and maintain relationships as well as how to manage oneself in stressful situations with the home buying process.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company, so working here would be a good opportunity to advance in the financial call center field. They are serious about sales goals but provide people to help you along the way."
good,"I really loved my team. It was so much fun working to me our sales goals. It was a superior connection and we unfortunately became too close and when some left the new team members had a hard time adjusting. The new chemistry was affected team goals. No matter how hard we tried it didn't work for awhile, but Voila! one day there it was. The branch was flourishing though we were a small urban branch."
good,"I liked the customer service aspect of working as a teller at Wells Fargo, but the sales goals were incredibly hard to reach and often resulted in a negative work atmosphere"
good,"The best thing about the job was the benefits and pay, otherwise it was fairly stressful with management offering little help on day-to-day tasks. With that, management was real quick to tell you what you were doing wrong or could improve on."
good,"The people were professional and work to life balance is wonderful. The management staff were very inclusive to contractors and FTEs. "
good,"This job was fun to meet a lot of people and help solve their basic financial needs."
good,Wells Fargo cares about you and compensates you accordingly. The people working there are knowledgeable and go out of their way to answer any questions or solve any issues you might have
good,Wells Fargo is an ok place to work. They seem like they are afraid to pay you what you deserve and only give out raises no higher than $.25 annually. They will pay someone more that's new to the company than the people who have actually been here. They raise the pay rates as well for new employees but kept all the old employees at the lower pay rate But the benefits are decent and the work in the community is great.
good,meet great people but the pay does not add up to the amount of responsibility placed on employees. Definitely under paid and does not appreciate the hard work bankers and tellers put in daily
good,"work load is balanced, plenty of help from management, hardly any bonus structure, some OT, noisy and have to deal with co-workers politics, stick to yourself its best"
good,"Managed stores, morning huddles, coaching team members to success, keeping store budget in track, putting together schedule for team, supporting teams, coaching, observing and providing feedback, ensuring people are hitting goals, and following correct procedure, observing customer service, one on one coaching, keeping track of goals and lots of interaction with team to ensure they help the customer with all needs by asking certain question"
good,"I enjoy working for wells fargo. I work for the mortgage department. I assist customers providing them with options for foreclosure. I also handle bankruptcy calls, deceased, and a speciality group for foreclosure.  The hardest about my job is we are skilled with many different types of calls and it lacks on training. The culture is great. Definitely a lot to learn in so little time."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I understand with the mortgage business, things are constantly changing, but with the company slowly going down with lawsuits, management keeps changing how they review things.  For the most part, they just want up front numbers to be the key thing, they don't care about the ending result. We're constantly bending backwards trying to get the same result which gets us nowhere."
good,"work environment is great, great equipment and daily development training. managers are personable.great encounters with clients make it great to come to work"
good,WF is a good place to work. If you want to advance it can be difficult based on their in house hiring practice. Everything is based on behavioral questions whose wording is questionable.
good,"great environment, leadership is good, a lot of opportunities to grow however it is a high stress environment the requires a lot of hours. work/life balance is not as it should be."
good,Big company. Nice facilities. Learned a lot about being on phones and time management.  Great workplace culture and people are great.  Many areas to choose from.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. They take good care of employees, great benefits. The bank has been through some major changes that make banking there better for the customers."
good,"I loved to work for Wells Fargo Auto Loan, unfortunately they left California and I made a mistake of leaving this company seeking a better opportunity that did not turn out to be what I was expecting"
good,I was working to take care of the Foreclosure and bankruptcy dept you have to have a thick skin to do that job.  People would call in to make payments and that was fun
good,"It is good place to balance work and personal life."
good,"Great company, they are just downsizing and are asking me to relocate. With no raise in pay, so I'm looking for other options. Great as far as fellow co workers and Paid time off."
good,"There were no typical days. Every day had some new surprise. I came into the organization already skilled and experienced with most of the tasks required. The new skills I acquired were related to customer survey design, analysis and reporting. Near the end of my time at Wells Fargo, the workplace culture noticeably changed from fairly friendly between peers to highly competitive. This was due to a change in upper management. There was an increase in pressure to produce results and cut costs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with bureaucracy and job stress. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting approval to innovate a new intranet site for cross-selling."
good,Management has changed a lot the company is a great company to work for the some of the branch managers are not good. Company would be much better with better management.
good,"Productive yet stressful , with lots of fun activities to help compensate for all the stress. I learned to work a lot of diffrent systems and was"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of helping customers succeed financially. I learned a lot about finances and how to put customers into the right products to help the succeed. Management was great, but it was very hard to climb the ladder. You have to know upper level management to move up or it isn't going to happen. Hardest part of the time is realizing the fact that you may be stuck in your current position and getting passed up by people who are less qualified than yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job would be creating relationships with your co-workers. The location I worked at team work was very important and we work well together and actually cared for one another."
good,"I felt the management was very supportive in the current position, but it was very difficult to get into other positions in the company. I believed that individuals were placed in positions by who you know not what you know. I am very experienced in banking and would have been able to be a real asset to them."
good,"It's very hard to move up within the department you are in with Wells. The only reason I moved up was because someone passed away in another office that was closer to my former supervisors home. I went for the position before and got declined although I did the work. Wells is very concerned with legal backlash to the point it henders management from actually doing their jobs in regards to proper corrective actions to be able to run an office that's successful and fair. I loved the people I worked with, but Corporate needs work."
good,As a Regional Purchase Clearing Specialist I would work with lenders of mortgage companies in the secondary market.  If there were any defects with the loan submitted I would work with the lenders to resolve.
good,"its ok if you want to get into banking, they pay good, you can definitely move up but you have to be careful with the things you do it wont always be fun."
good,Everyday was about Sales and Customer service Survey to earn that particular the #1 Star of that Wells Fargo Territory. Hitting your Sales goal quota is the only thing the company cares about.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Working for this company was a temp to hire position which later dealt with layoffs. Great place and small staff.  During the time that I was employed I enjoyed working as a team player.
good,Wells Fargo has one of the best benefits packages I have seen which includes adoption and tuition reimbursement.  They are very competitive with the salary compared to other companies in the industry.
good,I love the people I work with my supervisor and my lead. There's always an opportunity to switch shifts. There can be favoritism among some teams that can be difficult to deal with. You do get a chance for bonuses and to move up.
good,"I liked the employees, management was very helpful and was always there to help you if needed.  They also helped with advancement. The parking for the area was the only bad thing."
good,"my morals and values on life don't necessarily align with wells fargo. I have nothing bad to say about this company, they have supported me since i started with them and do have lots of options as far as growth and expansion as an employee however i just don't support the banks mission and would rather work for someone i support and believe in."
good,"Every department is different however the department that I worked in need help in the management area, it lacked bu over all as a how it was a good place to work"
good,"In my time with Wells Fargo, i have had a great learning experience, The company offers many classes that you can take on paid time to further enhance your skills. Whether it from powerpoint to excel to management skills. Immediately start you have benefits as well as paid time off.  The hardest part of the job is physical labor. be prepared to sweat and gain a little muscle."
good,"•	Acting as a voting proxy for Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric and other companies."
good,"Good place to work, Good work environment, the culture is great. an amazing location. I learned how to communicate better co workers. the enjoyable part of the job was the co workers."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for only thing they should take better care on who is in management promotions sometimes where just given out to people
good,"Typical day consists of reviewing loan modifications. Not much communication with coworkers which can leave you feeling isolated. Management was good, assistance when needed without too much micromanagement. Opportunties for projects and extra work, always room to grow."
good,"Payed well on the hourly,  Good environment with very good benefits , leisure work environment for dress code.....but set goals too high and unrealistically to bonus,  too many compliances to knock you out of bonus and upper management out of touch with reality.   ( too be over sincere is insincere )"
good,"Good people. Laid back culture versus other firms, but can be a transition (e.g. lots of red tape, harder to network) going from a small firm to a big bank.  Good work/life balance."
good,Balanced work life. Flexibility culture along with work from home option. believes Unity in Diversity. Gets to work on new technologies and advanced analytical tools and techniques
good,I wish I was able to find more to do as a teller at Wells Fargo. Sales goals were removed from the company policies so now it is very difficult to move up in the company unless you settle for lower pay for over a year.
good,"Great place to work, nice people, not much room for growth but money is good, people are nice, good hours at times. A typical day is being on the phone assisting bankers who call in for assistance. Trouble shooting."
good,"busy fast paced collections, contact internal and customer base have worked here for nearly 10 years, the culture is great and management is fair, responsible for 3-15 Million dollars in delinquency on a monthly basis"
good,As an HMC I was generally responsible for sourcing new mortgage applications for purchase and refinance loans.  Company has outstanding internal lead generation. Local management was great to  work with and very supportive. Overall company initiatives can get a bit diverse and overwhelming.  Hardest part of the job was overcoming previous negative reputation in market. Most enjoyable part of job was assisting clients with homeownership.
good,Hardest part is servicing a customer who's account was compromised. All you can do is assist and please be compassionate and understanding.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"As a Branch Manager every day you will have 1-3 conference calls per day and 20+ emails. You spend the majority of your days on the phone and responding to emails when they are asking you to meet every customer that walks in the door, coach your employees, and prepare for audits at the same time. The positive side is the paid time off and depending on if your a Saturday branch or not you may have weekends off."
good,I belive in theory the company means well and is very much wanting people to succeed in life. The work environment is amazing but some managers really ruin is for others
good,"Wells is a very good company, I was able to balance my job with my life. I was compensated very well for my production and I had opportunity to work my way up to Management."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to build a career, if you are willing to put in the hours, the effort, and develop sales skills.  It is all about sales."
good,"It was all about the numbers, even though they coach and advise you that it's all about the customer. Certain locations had repeat customers who've been banking there for 15yrs+ and as a new face you would obligated to find something to sell to them, even if they had everything with Wells Fargo already. It was like a subtle but pushy type of work. A friendly but shady type of work."
good,"With any call center, there are ups/downs, bad/good days that make you scratch your head. Co-workers, many and new faces all the time as such for a call center workplace. Management, too many bosses to run operations. Job has good/bad like any job has."
good,A work day at Wells Fargo is very busy doing tons of paperwork. Management was ok. Co-workers were ok I've developed some good relationships and maintained them even after leaving that company. I enjoyed my hours at work.
good,"good experience entering the banking industry, but sales goals could be unrealistic and very pushy. I needs to focus on helping the customers not just to benefit the company"
good,"A lot was expected of me. I was expected to show up early to every shift so I could read any emails or any other company bulletins and be ready to take calls at exactly when my shift was supposed to start. During training, there were a few trainers that were very undermining and condescending. The supervisors were all very nice and helpful and there was tons of growth opportunities."
good,Contacted customers daily to bring loan current in mortgage department. I assisted in modification of loans and day consisted of sitting in one area predominately and answering calls or making calls.
good,typically we handle deposits and change orders for businesses dress nice and offer products to customers as a lead one of the things is to approve deposits as well to make sure the customer and the bank doesn't take a loss
good,Working from 9-11 hours a day to ensure all sales and service requirements were met. I've experienced most of my professional growth as a branch manager.
good,"Amazing company to work for, but shady when it comes to Sr. leadership and selling tactics in the Virtual channel. High benefits for education and personal health/ dental care."
good,"Best job I've ever had.  Worked closely with great people in the branches, excellent managers, excellent communication.  Loved working with the bank customers, learned how to cross sell products and be successful working with a lot of local branches"
good,A bunch of appointment setting and cold calling. Very micromanaging and all about sales. Yet a great opportunity for advancement if you like retail.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. The environment is one where an individual can absorb fluidly and feel comfortable with the possibilities of job security.
good,"Not a competitive work environment.  Most often very stable and comfortable.  Not the company to work for if you are looking to ""get ahead"""
good,"Good for people who is just starting they're career , they don't let you move to the position that fits you better and that you can be more productive until you hit the year mark - which is bad for people like me that have dedication and motivation to GROW and make the best out of something that they do"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo and the got along well with management, The hardest part of the job was sales. What I enjoyed most was the people I worked with pushing each other to succeed as a team."
good,WF is a great company for individuals looking to thrive in the sales and banking industry. My schedule required weekend work every Saturday and intense sales goals to meet
good,"Very Micromanage, got move to four  different departments, training was very fast, was made to work extra time like i had no choice"
good,"Wells Fargo is always looking ways to keep team members engaged and satisfied. Although, they focus too much on sales. Sales is a priority, but sometimes it seems that it's more important than service, when I personally think it's the other way around."
good,"Helpful to want you to learn and grow within the company. Sometimes things get stressful but, having an established leadership team to get though it makes things better afterwards."
good,"Working in Wells Fargo is quite the experience. You can say it feels as if your working on a tight rope and can loose your job at any moment. It can be for multiple reasons, such as, balancing, sales quotas, follow ups, emails, etc. The good note is you do get reimbursed for your hard work the pay rate is usually good and insurance as well. However Wells is an aggressive sales  job and very demanding so it balances out. Just be prepared for what it all comes with."
good,Good company culture but does not value educated employees. Provides tuition reimbursement but not many opportunities for post graduate jobs.
good,"Good place to work, every professional and ethical. every busy mornings or late after noon. to be confident, some ethical. to no let other or rude comments get me down. dealing with rude customers."
good,"ok company........"
good,"Typically I start my day by checking my emails and reviewing my appointments.  If  I am meeting with potential clients or banks I always want to be prepared. I spend my day on the road with appointments or on my phone following up.  Keeping a solid pipeline is the key to success.  My day ends by uploading my sales and reviewing my emails one last time."
good,"Good company to work for, but the department leadership needs some work. Little training will do it otherwise great people in general"
good,Obtaining information from customers to provide a great experience while i make recommendations to help financially guide customer to financial success. I can say the greatest part of the day is realizing the great team chemistry we have while still keeping it professional.
good,"Pay for our current area is decent.If you think you go in run a cash drawer and wait on customers NOT the job for you.This job is much more than that you have massive sales goals, cash drawer to balance, policy and procedures to know (inside out) customer surveys which affect you cost of living raise,plus a four minute time limit you need to complete all of this."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I feel with any company you get out what you put in overall great company. Growth & opportunities are available.
good,"Working with this company was very educational, for 5 years I worked there I have learned so many thing from mortgage default, servicing and bankruptcy.  This company is good to work for specially with good training."
good,"A typical day is spent on the computer taking calls throughout the day except for breaks. I learned alot about banking that most people would never know and I learned skills that will be vital to my future. My co-workers were always good people to talk to and fun to be around, which made the days a little bit better. The hardest part of the job were the times that no matter what I tried to find, or what I did, I could not help the customer. Best part of the job is hearing how amazing I was from customers that I could help."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. WFCC showed me how to use more of my team building skills. How to navigate on the different systems and enhanced my ability to adapt to change.
good,"Loved doing my job and working with who I did, just didn't like the whole corporate America feel it had. That is all I have to say."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Wachovia bought by Wells Fargo.
good,helping customers counting cash and sales learned computer and people skills co workers are fun management helps whn only convenient for them hardest par is leaving customers and the most enjoyable part is thee customers
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"There were a lot of changes that were made to the company and It caused some restructuring. Many were forced into jobs that they did not like just to stay employed."
good,"This was the best job I have ever had. I had the greatest, funniest customers. I have no complaints about this jobs except for my manager. This was her first time being in a managerial position and you could tell. She made rules, but she was the only one that didn't have to follow them. The branch I was at, was mainly about numbers not taking care of our customers."
good,The first job that constantly did on the job training. You will be trained from the day you walk in til the day you leave. I loved helping ppl but because there are so many ppl to help there is only so much that we can do with each person.
good,I was a teller but was soon a customers sales rep. on both sides you had to meet a goal if not you would get written up. I would hit my goals but there was times that you would do or be told to open a account no matter what. so we would sometimes we would break or bend some policies to make ends meet but end of quarter.
good,"All work performed from my home office network through the company system."
good,Great company to grow at if you enjoy having a numbers and sales driven job. Always opportunities to grow within the company and expand your career.
good,"Baks are typical more corporate than consumer,however what I took with me from WACHOVIA and still use today is knowing the importance of constant customer service on a 5 star level."
good,"Job pays well for what it is, being a bank teller can be stressful if social skills aren't strong. Customers can be very difficult. If they have a lot of money, they expect you to roll over at the snap of a finger and if they don't have enough income, customers tend to complain about the banks policies."
good,"Meet every monthly sales goals"
good,"Not a good place to work if you are looking for long term job security or a place to retire from."
good,This is a great place to work if your looking for above average benefits and compensation. Management is a revolving door.
good,"SALES, SALES, SALES, TOP BOX!"
good,"this company is in india and and this was my first job, where I learnt all the basics of oracle dba which helped me throughtout till now."
good,"Doing deposits, cash advances, answering phones, sales, customer service, data entry, basic computer operations. Great Management , always willing to help. On site training , many advancement opportunities. Best part of job would be a different experience everyday. The hardest part of job would be there were no full-time positions available."
good,This was a backroom processing job. I learned how to work with a team to achieve department goals. The management wasn't great at first but upper management helped our manager to greatly improve and become a very good manager. I had very nice and helpful coworkers and team leaders. The hardest part of the job was the fact that I basically worked as part of an assembly line of paperwork. There wasn't much variation in day to day activities but the most enjoyable part of the job was feeling part of a team and the interactions with all the members of the team.
good,"If you are a good sales person this is the place for you! The employees get along well, and you have alot of oppertunity for growth within the company-again if you like to sell!"
good,"You get to meet alot of people. You get paid decent for it. Youre off on holidays and weekends."
good,"Assist customers with questions and concerns with charges on personal or commercial accounts. Complete dispute documentation and send to investigator.  I learned how to interact with customers that had disputes on charges from either their personal or commercial accounts.  The management was fair. He made sure that we had all the tools necessary to function on a day-to-day basics. I believe that this was one of the best jobs I had with a group of coworkers since T-Mobile.  The job was fairly a easy job, I think the most challenging of this job was the ongoing outraged customers.  And the most enjoyable part of the job would be the daily contest we will have"
good,Decent job out of college.  Slow advancement.  Plan to switch out of commercial banking asap.  All junior employees are treated eactly the same regardless of skill level or productivity. Bonus is terrible.
good,It can be impossible to make quarter goals. But they do have good benefits. It is also about location and district managers. If you are in good with the district manager you can make it far.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells is filled with great people and is a nice place to work. Unfortunately for me, I was held back from growth due to an Administrative Title. Although do much of the same work as others in higher paid positions, I was not promoted and when asked why, I was told it was because it was hard to justify my being promoted to Analyst from an Administrative Title."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to talk to over eighty people per day all with different types of concerns."
good,The company is a great company however the job description did not depict the actual duties that are required within day to day tasks.
good,"I serviced customers accounts and maintenance of debit cards and ordered checks."
good,"very good company, some exceptional team mates, a good culture and a comfortable environment. Good benefits, job security, job advancement, management might need to get a little more training but overall a 3 star company to work for with a lot of potential to the upside."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the atmosphere was fun and there was never a boring day at work."
good,Wells Fargo is one of the greatest companies that I have worked for in the banking industry. They are primarily focused on working closely with realtors and new purchase business. They have a strong product offering and make getting a mortgage fairly easy on the borrower. I enjoyed  working for Wells but I was ready to try something new.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"At WF, the management runs the staff like an army.  Everything is regulated and documented.  It is by the book and the rules are followed to a T."
good,"Processed deposits and withdrawals "
good,"My typical work day consist of priotizing my work. I come in at 8:00 and look to see what task need to be processed first that are pay impacted. I deal with a lot of managers and a lot of recruiters. I have seven  co-workers that are on my team. "
good,"I have worked for several banks. First Union,Wachovia, and now Wells Fargo. They have a systematic way of doing every process. I thought going into the technology area  would be different but they found a way to compartmentalize those processes. They are not as flexible as most companies but they can be counted on to provide stable employment and income. The ratio of income to the job market is comparable most of the time depending on what area you work in. The atmosphere of Wells Fargo is completely different than the atmosphere of Wachovia. Wachovia teams definitely have more unity among each other than Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is very detached and divided, even within the same group. This slows progress and reduces successes for individual and group development and most importantly company growth. The hardest part of the job is understanding protocol for issues. The most enjoyable is working remote and seeing the outstanding results of a project you worked on."
good,"Began as a customer service representative and was promoted to personal banker, service manager 1 & 2. I was in charge of daily cash flow operational processes. Attended managerial and sales seminars to help develop direct reports. Operations is fast paced and can become challenging at times. As a manager, understanding how to learn what motivates individuals was one of me biggest learning's. Working with people was one of the more enjoyable parts of the job."
good,I perform administrative functions of the bank. I have the duty to ensure about all the customer transactions such as deposits and withdrawals that all the transactions are entered and documented precisely.
good,"Great co workers, the greatest part was servicing the customers"
good,working here the people were ok as only so much supervisors can change .. I had a horrible team lead which made the job hard and frustrating at times..i learned a lot about escrow accounts and parcels and different counties and how they differ throughout the us.
good,I have learned a lot at this Company. I am now ready to move on with my career.
good,There was never a typical day at Wells Fargo. Some days it was hectic and busy and other days it was slow and tedious. I learned how to work on a team and work in a fast pace environment. The management had its downfalls but overall I had no complaints. The most emjoyable part were my co-workers and the hardest part were difficult and ungrateful customers.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers with different transasctions and uncovering needs that would benefit them. "
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo as a Personal Banker consisted of customer service and sales. Wells Fargo is very sales driven which made me a sales driven individual . I learned how to turn service into sells by building a connection with the customer and finding out what's their top priorities. Management was not as effective as I would have liked, so it was more of getting advice and best practices from your peers , my co workers were great . We were a team and we all helped each other out to meet goals and was always comfortable with taking constructive criticism. The hardest part of the job was maintaing exceptional customer service , it was a challenge because the team was Un happy due to the sales goals Wells Fargo had in place which then took away the customer service and made each customer more of a number than high valued individual . The most enjoyable part of my job was the bonuses every quarter and raises every year ."
good,"Constant sales pressure daily.  More focus on setting appointments and opening up checking accounts. "
good,"a typical day at work consists of Checking atm's with store manager/supervisor, ensuring balance in drawer is accurate, assist customers with their monetary transactions, upsale when needed (meet sales quota), keep drawer balanced at the end if the day."
good,"typical is dealing with customers and processing their transactions  "
good,Lots of great experience in all banking transactions from personal to business and investing. High pressure sales environment.
good,"Clock into work and get straight to phone calls to help the needs of the customers calling about and issue or problem with bank account and proceed to try and sale them home equity, checks, insurance etc."
good,"handled cash transactions. Customer service,  Opened ch ng and savings accounts."
good,Good place to work. Developer is given full liberty & rigt to raise his voice. Process is well defined. Flexible timings & supporting upper management.
good,"My current position requires me to process customer transactions within established guidelines, Identify and makes sales referrals, recommend alternate channels, cross-sell bank services and products for Wells Fargo partners and provide excellent customer service.  I have gained some excellent skills while performing my duties which include but are not limited to account maintenance, merchant/vault, ATM processing, foreign currency and night drop."
good,"The job itself was secure, but when we were promised advancement or raise, it was often overlooked and they would delay it. The customers weren't very hands-on since it was all in a call-center. But the ability to help those customers could be very rewarding, even with just the customer being happy with the service provided. The hardest part of the job was when customers were unsatisfied and would throw explosive words at you and degrade you and you weren't allowed to say anything."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work out, have a lot of potential for growth."
good,"A typical day at work starts by retrieving two different data based programs. Retrieving the system that houses Wells Fargo loans and reviewing them in detail. Identify several different factors that may/may not be cause the loan not to be started in the foreclosure process. At the same I’m doing I am making sure to follow state and federal guidelines."
good,"A typical day at work for me is seeing between 6-8 customers a day,"
good,i like working with post closing. sharing the knowlege to homeowners with closing package

good,Helping customers succeed financially while providing superior customer service. Coaching and developing team members to do the same.
good,"A typical day at work included assisting the walk-in traffic with setting up new bank accounts and selling them financial and credit services. "
good,it was enjoyable to work with the various departments in the complex.
good,Was with Wachovia since 8/2006 once Wells Fargo bought out Wachovia transferred to their Retail Underwriting Dept. from Wholesale. Salary was excellent and overtime was mandatory. Enjoyed all my co-workers. Learned new computers systems
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,My manager in Trust Operations was someone you could respect.
good,"Typical day starts with meeting a huddle a retrosepctive of the earlier day work. Work to do creation and Folks start working on the home loans , mortgage checking. Creating fiancial reports. and Loan processing amidst working through some fun activities among Collegues . Learning about MS excel a, macros."
good,Working for Wachovia is where I achieved most of my experience. That atmosphere is welcoming and everyone is eager to teach and learn.
good,"Phone calls, emails, and faxes come in from hundreds of trust account clients requesting money for various reasons. Review of each of their trust agreement to determine if that client is able to receive funds for their request. Filing through an Imaging system. Filing system on-line which was wonderful. All my co-workers were wonderful people. I enjoyed most every day there. The hardest part of my job was being laid off and having to say good bye to my friends and co-workers. This job was very challenging. Attention to detail is imperative when dealing with money."
good,I talk to customers and understand what are there financial Goals and suggest the right product and services. My co workers was great to work with. If I needed help I can count on them and same with me. the hardest part  about my job was sometimes meeting sales goals but with hard work and commitment can be done.
good,"The call center environment is very stressful.  I the enjoy customer service part of the job, the sales pressure for other banking services is difficult for me , even though I am meeting the standards for bonus."
good,Working at Wells Fargo was an enjoyable experience. The staff and managers were experienced and helpful. Hardest part of job was working in a declining housing market was a challenge.  Enjoyed working with the diversity of Houston population.
good,I really liked the branch I worked for and the company was ok. I have no real likes or dislikes
good,"We come in at 8:00 everyday, we come in and open the branch. As a team we have a moring huddle for the expection for the day. The manager usualy leads the huddle. The hardest part of my job is the constant sales, the most enjoyable part of my job will be my co workers. We get along very well."
good,A typical day at work included processing customer transactions and providing customer service to anyone who came in. I learned a lot about the banking industry and how it all works as well as gaining knowledge about products such as loans and credit cards. Management tried to help but often times worried more about getting sales than about actually enjoying the work. This helped contribute to the hardest part of the job which was meeting sales goals while dealing with a very small customer base with which to work so it wasn't always easy finding needs for our customers. The most enjoyable part was working with my great co workers and having good conversation with the customers. They really become a part of your life that way which I liked.
good,it has its ups and downs and it depends on whos your manager and what branch you work in. They are serious in sales and competitive in sales. Especially when in comes to being promoted.
good,"I was a project coordinator the entire time at Wachovia.  The projects that I did for Wachovia were all very busy, but I learned a lot by working these projects.  All the people that I worked for were very nice and easy to work for.  The most difficult part of the job was that each time I did a project, I had to learn something new all over again.  The jobs were fast paced and busy, but the other workers made it fun as well."
good,Wells Fargo is a good company but the major flaws are that u r pressured to sell a lot of products to customers even though these customers may not even need it. Sales sales sales is al they care about. Your arebjust a number on a spread sheet. This is why the culture here is not very good. There is a lot of micro managing here. The good side is that there is a good balance of home and work and PTO. The insurance is very expensive!
good,A typical day at work is to wait on the customers and resolve any issues that come up. I learned how to manage my time with the customers. Management was very nice and helpful. All the co-workers were great to work with. Everybody got along most of the time. Hardest part was to make sure you did not get your cash drawer out of balance. The most enjoyable time there was the company parties.
good,the mortgage business is constantly changing so your always on your toes and your brain is always stimulated with new things to learn.
good,Its a great way to get corporate experience. The supervisors really are there to help you improve and grow throughout your time with them.
good,"A typical day at work is going in working, meeting your production standards and then having fun every now and then."
good,"i like my co workers"
good,"-Approved mortgage loans by examining loan applications (1003) and supported documentation, estimating credit-worthiness and calculating repayment risk."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They are a good company to work for I've enjoyed my time here on the mortgage side.
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work, but not like the experience I had with Chase.  Management didn't always want to hear from their managers, it was more of just do it."
good,"Great benefits, great co workers, finding the right customers is the difficult part of this job"
good,"Wells Fargo is a GREAT company to work for. They promote from within and you could move up very quickly if you have management backing and supporting you. I've learned more about sales and service here more than any other company. As a banker, it's very competitive and could become stressful if your immediate manager isn't essential in making you successful."
good,I enjoyed my stay while at Wachovia. They believed in customer service and the facility was designed to meet the employees every need. 
good,Branch newly created. Had great training associates and hardworking co-workers.
good,"Upper management lacks knowledge"
good,"Great company to work for with excellent benefits, values and a culture that is condusive to productive work being done"
good,"Let me just say that the branch I worked for was very young even for my taste and I am twenty one. I felt as if they just hired anyone off the street to work at that branch. My managers were mediocre until they could never leave the personal life out of the work place.  The Wells Fargo as a whole is a great Company to work for, such as great benefits but you would have to wait a whole extra month just for a bonus and that is if you made your numbers.But someone needs to do something about how they manage the workers and how to not run a bank like a car business. Oh and did I mention that they promise a move up within the first three months. Make sure you get that in writing before signing."
good,"The office I worked in was wonderful and I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. My only real complaint comes from the closing of my office and consolidation with another, resulting in layoffs, despite our overall profitability."
good,"Provide prompt quality customer service along with support to bankers and store management while providing wide range of services including document preparation, account servicing/maintenance. Solicit new accounts and cross-sells products and services."
good,"It hasn't been my favorite job but I can say I have learned a great deal. I have learned better negotiating skills, customer skills, and over how to communicate effectively in the work place. I have gained a trustworthy group of co-workers who all offer a much needed dose of laughter."
good,wells fargo is not a bad company to work for. i just cant stand that they are CONSTANTLY pushing sales sales sales. most times it feels like their expectations are unrealistic!
good,"I love to go to work every day, I love my schedule but not see place for growing with the company. I have high professional skills that I need to put in practice. I am looking for the company that will open the door and let me shine."
good,If your comfortable doing sales and having people constantly ask you(like hourly) what you have in sales then this could be a job for you. If not stay away from banking because that's what its all about.
good,"Wells is a very good reputable company. However they can be a little cheap when it comes to raises. Also as far as advancment from within, it is pretty difficult due to the fact that their are so many others doing the same and trying to advance just as you are. You have a much better chance of getting a position when you don't work for Wells than advancing from within."
good,"Ok days at work, not very many opportunities for advancement, i learned about financing, consumer accounts, worth ethic of coworkers and referrals / banking methods. The job isnt very hard, and the most exciting thing about being a teller att Wells Fargo is the interaction with customers."
good,"Working at Wells was a great opportunity for me to learn about sales in the financial industry. Negatives: manager turn around, employee turn aound. As a financial associate, you are building relationships and trust, and Wells Fargo moves people from one branch to another based on the management's needs, not the customre's needs."
good,Come in and got on the phone and spoke to the borrowers regarding they're loans. We discussed payments and also options in trying to find good option for the borrower as we'll the company.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day as work consist of interacting with customers and providing excellent customer service while processing customer transactions. I plan sales goals and come up with practical activities to meet my goals. I work in teams to profile customers for sales and referral opportunities. The most challenging part of the job is attempting to meet sales goals when business is slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is planning the activities and being rewards with fun prizes when meeting sales goals.
good,"It is a company in which sales is the core of their existance. You succeed if you've got the talent, drive, and self motivaton to be number one. Not an easy task."
good,High sales goals that created a stressful environment. Other than that the company is great to work for with numerous opportunities and lots of room for advancement.
good,"A typical day of work involves dealing with the ATM, customer transactions and settling the vault. I've learned to hone my skill in customer service, when it comes to money people can become fierce. I've thoroughly enjoyed learning and growing at this company. Luckily i had a great staff all the way up to the management who were patient in coaching me in my career. Although that may not always be the case, not every branch/store is the same. I was fortunate to have a fantastic work dynamic with every single person at my store. One thing is for sure though, your district manager WILL help you reach your goal career wise if you put in the effort. hardest part of the job was really getting a feel for the patrons as well as getting comfortable and confident with dealing with large amounts of cash. The most enjoyable part was building a relationship with the customers and knowing I've treated them as I would want to be treated."
good,"Typical day was helping customers with whatever they needed help with, deposits, withdraws,and selling different products. I learned that I need to keep my mouth shut or coworkers will go and complain that I'm tired. The Management, well I'm not going to get into that or I'm just going to get very upset. co-workers need to learn to mind there own business. I liked working there its just that my team members felt different. I was a hard worker hardly ever complained but when I did got chewed out for it. I liked getting challenged I hate that I quite because I didn't get along with the people I worked with."
good,"Flexible schedule...always understanding with doctor appointments, kids, etc. Good people to work with. Pay increases are poor."
good,Answered inbound calls transfered money between accounts handled customer complaints
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking calls, making outbound calls and collecting funds from negative accounts. Management was awesome with supervisors monitoring you daily, and providing feedback and advice to become a better employee."
good,I had a great time working for Wells Fargo. I met great friends who I still have in my life today. I was immersed in the world of banking and finance and learned a wealth of information that has proven a benefit to me even beyond my employment with Wells Fargo.
good,"A good company to work for, however difficult to advance. Management is very intelligent and motivating. Hardest part of the job is knowing that the companies guidelines do not always allow room to help our customers."
good,"My typical day is coaching tellers to help our customers financially succeed. In the mix of the day I help tellers buy and sell when needed, provide one on ones with employees, and to help promote and maintain a positive work environment. Another key role is helping the bankers with their daily interactions with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is every day is completely different. Being part of the management team has given me opportunities to grow as an individual and a team player. Daily feedback is given to help me grow as an employee."
good,"I was a part time teller, handling large amounts of cash daily and conducting financial transactions."
good,it was excellent workin with diffrent people more the staff and the clients. I gained experience in studying the security cameras handling tense insecurity situations and also detecting people with bad intentions explossives by using machines. the hardest part of the job was when your co worker dosent come to work so you have to do the multitasking to cover your work mate. the enjoyable part of ma work was when I was confirmed to work permanently.
good,Need to change some of their rehire policies. Need to be clear- and transparent.
good,"utilizes referrals and company provided sales leads to sell customers a variety of financial services products including: unsecured personal loans, works with customers on the phone and in person throughout the credit application and approval process."
good,mostly work in week day
good,"I walked in at 8, bank opened at 9 and I did transactions while cross selling bank products."
good,"A typical day starts out with a morning huddle. We discuss our goals for the day and what our plan is to reach those goals. Goals refer to checking account packages and the like. I've never worked in sales really before, I've always been more of an office, behind the scenes gal. This job has taught me all about sales and the work that is put in to it and how these numbers affect the company. This is what I would consider the hardest part, simply for the fact that you can't force a person to do anything they don't want to. For this reason, product knowledge is a must and understanding and overcoming customer objections is vital. I have not yet failed to hit my numbers, in fact, I was number one in my branch last quarter. However, sales is definitely not my first love. My co-workers are amazing, our team is so cohesive that not one person feels left out. Our management is even better. They work to help you grow as well as understand you as an individual. I would say my team is my favorite part of my job and they help make it easy to come to work everyday."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"My experience with Wells Fargo was interesting, challenging, and rewarding. Every organization has its ups and its downs and I wont base my entires Wells experience on the bad. Overall its a great company for someone who desires to move up. Its sales central so be prepared to hustle its not a job or career for lazy people. I left because of the environment in my branch and the psychotic Manager in charge but I would still be with Wells under different management."
good,I've learned that it's best to be as flexible as possible at Wells Fargo. The more you know - the more you'll grow. Also it's important to ask a lot of questions when in training for new positions or procedures. Wells Fargo has some of the best trainers and developemental coaches in the banking industry.
good,The hardest part of this role is generating new assets under mamnagement and dealing with a market that is so uncertain. Clients tend to want to stay in cash versus investing in a market driven by program trades at large Hedge Funds or large institutions.
good,"Really good incentives, good salary however management was poor"
good,"Wells Fargo Bank is an outstanding organization. Through working in Retail Banking i have gained experience in management, leadership, coaching, sales, customer service, and much more. The training at the company is the best in the industry and has really taught me skills that i can apply to many positions."
good,"The company had an open door policy, they encourage line staff to stay in close contact with upper management."
good,"Management was alright, it was a wonderful place to work. i enjoyed being face to face with the customers. the co workers where wonderful. the hardest part about my job was the constant sales pressure."
good,Great company though. I have enjoyed my time there. Maybe I am just getting tired of working at a bank.
good,Cash handling and balancing drawer.
good,"Started as Wachovia, had a really great team to work with and great training for position. Still a great team with Wells Fargo and good training, but more sales based over customer service based. Also a lot more strict with new upper management because of the bigger company. Does have really good benefits."
good,The room for advancement is slim if you are in a smaller area. The job is very boring and unchallenging. It becomes very routine and monotonous. Lots of down time. The financial rewards for sales compensation is miniscule. The goals and awards are a joke.
good,When I got hired ( I had Previous banking experience) I excelled quickly and caught on to their method of killing the customer with kindlness so they would let us hold all their money. They reward for sales and will pay you out after so many referrals. I've been there 3 years and they have consistantly raises the bar higher and higher as the economy has hit bottom. I have had some great managers and some bad ones. I learned a lot and have unfortunately learned to give in to the mediocrity. If you get bad customer service surveys (which are random) you will grt put on corrective actioning and potentially fired. I know people who have been in the wrong place/wrong time thing and loss their job. Most firings were fueled by someone up top not liking them. I will stay with them until something a little less competitive comes along.
good,"Company is fast paced and production sales driven, coaching and growth opportunities."
good,Depending on what department you work it is fun and has excellecn retirement options and mddical and dental coverage
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was fun, productive, and management really was there for any questions or just encouragement. Management at every level was extremely focused on providing employees with any assistance they needed to meet their goals. I also really liked that management was focused on internal promotion; somebody was always being celebrated for moving up or into other departments. This was a call center, but it very much felt like an online banking support center. There were always potlucks, coffee stations, and snacks for every shift. There was also plenty of opportunity to do OT, and scheduling was extremely flexible. My only negative would be that sometimes the criteria for calls was too harsh and didn't make sense. They also pushed sales a little bit too much."
good,"Its all amount solutions, they don't really value their customers and employees. Days can be mundane and only sales focused. It gets old very fast. Its life sucking"
good,I'm currently only  a contractor so i really can't say much about the company.  I do however think they treat their employees fairly and they have great long term opportunities.
good,"Good benefits, hard to advance, it's mostly who you know not what you know. Overall it is a good company to work for if you are interested in advancing in a business carrier."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. I really enjoyed my time in Wells Fargo. Company provides you good benefits. Most of the time due to understaffing some employees have to work overtime too
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Working in this company was overall good for me. Although there is a huge changes going on into the company that seems to be not good for future careers of employees
good,"my day at was was smooth helping members with their transactions, helping fellow co-cowers. and training new incoming co-workers. my manager was very helpful in explaining new things to me to help me tome up in the company. hardest part was dealing with the long lines of customers on the teller line."
good,The pay and benefits are great.  The training is hit or miss.  The people are very clicky and that determines if you advance.  My manager was very good.
good,I've worked at wells Fargo for 11 years now. No I didn't go to school for mortgage but it took me on adventures I thought I'd never go through.  I have enjoyed my time here but ready to see what else is out there for me to expand my horizons.
good,"The job tasks are easy, but the customers can be difficult. You have to be able to have a good quality assurance score, good call handle time, and good customer experience survey scores in order to bonus quarterly. Sometimes the days are so busy that you don’t get time off the phone to breathe. You have to stay within 92% of your schedule accountability. Any forms that you have to fill out have to be done outside of your schedules phone time. The job is mentally exhausting."
good,Typical daily routine is very demanding and I must be detailed oriented as the process could change daily. But it is very much gratifying to know you can big a part of the big picture or mission at hand
good,"Typical day at work started with emails, daily scrum stand-ups, reviewed knowledge base, status reports, meetings, and basics. "
good,"Wells Fargo Home Equity Specialist job requires a high tolerance of stress, due to the production requirements and daily changes to your job role and responsibilities. "
good,Work life balance is good. Do not approve of the new management approach. The top management does not seem to have any direction. The data collection to make important decisions are all collected in a hurry. No proper planning.
good,Immediately noticed my new team went through 2 of the initial 5 new hires before the end of the week. By the end of six months I had lost count as to how many new hires were brought on and suddenly gone.
good,"Nobody knows from one day to the next if you'll have a job tomorrow. There is no HONEST communication between corporate management and the production management. I loved the people I worked with, at our level we had a great relationship and made things work for our customers, but that environment was ours and not corporate."
good,Great company to work for. The pay and days off are awesome. You will really learn alot with this company but not alot of room for advancement in small towns. Way too many people playing boss role and not enough people actually doing the work. Too much pressure put on tellers and never enough tellers to handle a shift. You must be the type of person to not fold under pressure.
good,Great interview! Interviewed within 2 weeks of applying. Great work environment and everyone gives 100 percent to make it a great place to work. Management gives weekly information on how the company is proceeding.
good,I really much enjoy working at wells fargo they offer many great benefits also great visions and values they treat there team members fairly also when u have children they pay you while your at home.
good,"Not all it’s made up to be, feels more like a bait and switch. My employment last there about 1 year then I was laid off. Over all pay was great and scheduled was good"
good,"This position is an in depth customer service position where you work with banking relationship teams, and clients to manage their cash transactions. This includes ACH, check, wire, analysis accounts, and procurement accounts."
good,"It's a great compnay to work for. Jib stability and longevity are a few of the things that makes this a great compnay to work for. However, bexuase the retirment rate is low. Job advancement is slow."
good,A typical day at work with Wells was answering 75 to 100 calls per day helping our high valued customers with all banking needs. The management and workplace culture was good. I have a passion in helping people with all their needs so they would leave knowing that so they would not have to call back. If i was not able to finish the job that day would call them back to make their experience better.
good,Working at Wells Fargo I felt at ease and confident in my training.  The work environment was relaxed. I also thought it was nice the resources provided to employees if and when an issue arose.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Working at Wells Fargo isn't all bad. They do try to promote a healthy work-life balance. "
good,"I can't complain. The pay was decent for what the job consisted of. The opportunity for advancement is not available unless you ""know someone"" in the desired job area."
good,"good for experience, you aren't likely to move up quickly unless you have numerous years of expereince. even if you are qualified for the job, HR will block you from progressing if you don't meet their requirements. Lot's of work from home options and people are nice to work with."
good,Seniority is a problem when dealing with HR.  There is a no retaliation policy but sadly management gets away with it. It gets worse before it gets better. they will take advantage of you if you're not careful. Especially at Gateway Plaza. The company is great company but there are still some inner aspects of it that need improvement when it comes to employees and management.
good,I was happy at first working with Wells Fargo until sales became the main focus. I voluntarily left the company back in 2014 but I've heard the environment has made a positive change.
good,"A typical day consisted of taking inbound and outbound calls vigorously. I learned how to better manage my time and how to effectively multi-task. Management was very helpful if they were on your team. The culture was great if you have competitive/business mindset. The hardest part was the call volume, micromanagement, and high expectations. The enjoyable part was helping people keep their homes."
good,Great place to learn if you want to get into banking. You will receive customers from all walks of life and will learn a lot about the banking industry especially if you are in a busy branch
good,Things changed and went from one extreme to the next. There was no accountability for employees. Managers had no control over the team for fear of retaliation. It was terrible during change for the better.
good,low pay and no growth opportunities. Team was really nice but at the same time bankers were working for salaries lower then 40K. I feel like that was insane for the amount of work we put in everyday
good,"Wells Fargo was a great opportunity when I needed a job. It was great for bankers training, which was 3 months and very intense. But It prepared you for the job."
good,"Need communication more with peers and stop talking about each staff behind their back as a manager this makes a negative environment to work in. No one can't trust any one. Just imagine how the work will get done. On a positive note, met new people ( customer and co worker) and Wells Fargo taught me to become a better listen in sales."
good,I LOVED working for Wells Fargo and would go back in a heartbeat.  Wages were low and i was no able to advance in the role i was in.  I LOVED my co workers and Manager.
good,"This was one of my first real jobs and I enjoyed working here during my first two years of college. The management was good and a typical day consisted of processing banking transaction such as deposits, withdrawals, and sales."
good,"The job would be considered a career if there were enough hours for you to make ends meet."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for WF. This has been the least stressful job I've had in years. As many knows, The hourly wage was raised to $15 in Feb 2018, However, WF failed to raise the wages for other employees who weren't making minimum wage. That is an ISSUE! Management plays favorite which makes advancement very hard. It should be based on experience and education. Paid time off is wonderful and they have wonderful medical benefits."
good,Monthly meetings were very engaging. My Manager was the best I have ever had in my life so far. It was a friendly environment. Colleagues were very friendly.
good,"Like to promote from within.  If you work hard and are diligent as an employee, you will succeed and climb the ladder.  There are always opportunities to try your hand at different divisions within the company.  An environment of constant learning."
good,"There is very little room for advancement, layoffs are happening pretty frequently, and there is no work to do because clients aren’t sending loans to us"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This position was everything expected with a large financial institution. I would recommend  to others. Management and teammates were excellent, as well as work like balance."
good,Great opportunity to grow. The perfect company to start a career and develop yourself before decing what to do with your career path. Great opportunities.
good,"I worked during the time they were pushing sales everyday, so I'm not sure how much it has changed since then, but during my time there it was extremely stressful worrying about hitting a quota while pushing people to do things they didn't always need to do with their money. It paid well and was fun to be apart of the team at my bank, but besides that not much else made it worth it. Hopefully it has changed since the company was exposed a couple years back."
good,Good place to work. Life and work was well balanced. Happy to work for them again. Relocation is the reason for looking for a new job and so far have good opinion about the work time spent at Wells Fargo
good,I had a work from home position that I enjoyed. I had a great management team that was there to support future advancement in my career with the bank.
good,Again I worked here a long time ago and management could have changed it was a terrible place then and I’m sure over time it has approved. My review is pointless
good,Was just very slow paced. I like a fast pace type job and being at a desk was not for me. great company to work for as far as the culture. also did not like what the CEO Allowed
good,Wells is a company that does not put their employees first. They are only about the $$$$$. There is no reason to get excites. I enjoyed my manager and my peers.
good,Its a typical call center environment. messy drama but as long as you worry about you and your time then you should be good. the job can be very stressful but the pay can sometimes make up for it. hours not flexible.
good,"The overall culture that Wells Fargo tries to endorse is nice, but it doesn't make it into each branch. Management at the second branch I worked at tended to pick favorites."
good,The pay was good but overall for my high risk pregnancy the stress was not good. The constant hovering and scores was the most stressful part of the job.
good,"Typical day at work starts with management phone calls at 7am.  The branch I was located at would open at 10am so I would be there at 930am.  We would have a manager phone call at 1pm to check where each branch was at the sales goals for the day.  Being a branch that opened an hour later our numbers always looked behind but by the end of the day we would always hit our numbers.  "
good,its a revolving door. high retention rate. i started in january of last year and all together about 12 people have left. no faith in the company. i didn't feel wells had my back.
good,"Wells Fargo was mostly about profit but they have excellent training, advancement opportunities, excellent benefits, and decent environment. They will even pay for you to got to school and have a bunch of incentives. One thing that is for certain is that if you do good at your job and you are reliable you will advance quickly, get pay increases and bonuses, and are well taken care of with their excellent benefits packages."
good,"The culture here is phenomenal. The message is all about how the people make the difference and the company is very focused on developing employees."
good,"The branch I worked in was understaffed and very busy; however, the company was great!  I enjoyed my branch and coworkers.  Management was poor but I would recommend Wells Fargo to anybody!"
good,"Had a really good experience and was fun to work in well's fargo."
good,"Wells Fargo was constantly busy with customers, projects and goals. The sales pressure gets old very quickly if it is not your strong suit, many people are naturals but those of us who aren't quickly dreaded work. That being said, you meet some fantastic customers and coworkers, financial institutions are required to 'give back' to the community they service so there is encouragement to volunteer. Management was very driven, but again, all about sales. You are compensated for your sales, and customer service as a branch."
good,"First Job after graduating from San Jose State "
good,It will take you some time to advance but I loved the fact that we had large cubicles and I didn't have to really talk to anyone besides on the phone.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Processing Loans for Brokers across the USA.. they would contact the customers for the documents needed, forward them to me and I would send and clear the condition to the underwriter."
good,"When I was with Wells, I was on the phone 90% of the day. I would open accounts sell new products and services maintain business. I would also train new hires that came in. I was a part of many leadership development groups and did a lot of group presentations."
good,"Not recommended if you want a challenge or enjoy building something new. Very process driven, little room for innovation, no room to work with new tech."
good,"The culture here is phenomenal. The message is all about how the people make the difference and the company is very focused on developing employees."
good,"A typical day while at Wells Fargo mainly consisted of coming in and getting straight to work to get through the list of loans I had to process for the day. Logging onto the computer and being able to go through the to do list of calling attorneys, or other realtor agents back to gather documents to assure that the loan borrower was refunded money from filing those documents through their state's county. Through this, I learned the importance of dead lines and being persistent in order to get your job done when it depends on other people to complete a task. Being friendly and open about policies to get that information was a major key factor. "
good,"Wells Fargo offered great benefits to all employees. "
good,"-fun enviornment"
good,It was what you want to make it . if you truly like to sell and helping clients then this is a great job . nice environment and nice people you meet on the daily
good,"Working for Wells Fargo was good at times, i only had a few minor situations that were unable to be resolved, The benefits are great and the pay is fair."
good,Its a good place to start even if you have no experience. Great benefits and they train you on everything. Not good if you don't like interacting with customers and problem solving
good,I worked in the back office at Wells Fargo. Processing HOA payments. My co-workers were all very pleasant. We all helped each other out and met all our projects within the given time everyday.
good,They give you work schedules based off of their demand. No part time available in call centers. Great benefits and a lot of advancement room for those who look to work in multiple departments.
good,"Busy, Assisting team members with online tools. No downtime, having to learn more job responsibilities with no extra pay. Managers are very nice but having a phone job can be very exhausting."
good,It was a nice place to work. It was very busy and good enviorment.  The coworkers were nice to work with and good supervisors.  This is all I have to say  that I enjoyed m 6 years of working there.
good,It's a good job for college students or people who don't want to take the college route and want to move up. The company needs to learn to hire people who actually care about the team members.
good,Not sure how it is now but high emphasis on sales and customer experience is mandatory. Must compete in sales in order to advance in the company. Also must be carful handing cash.
good,"I worked for wells for 3 years and had great connections made, great friends found, and truly enjoyed my time here! I'd tell anyone looking in the banking field to try the Wells family for your career choice and you will be more than happy."
good,"i loved everything i did as a vault op clerk. i loved the challenge and the fast paced setting. i love dealing with the armed couriers. i loved the challenge of the math involved and the spread sheets. kept me on my toes constantly. i loved the security. loved the everyday workout. just the environment as a whole. i only had an issue when i became pregnant. i was hard being out of work for 9 months fighting with the STD and LTD departments. was very stressful and they would always tell me they didn't receive my faxes and doctors notes. had to prove many times that i was pregnant and unable to lift heavy things. Fought with them for months. i didn't like how i was treated in the end so i had to just let go. had a very stressful pregnancy because of this. Plus had a c-section wasn't able to return to work right away which would have been a problem. had to let go and tried to get out of downtown."
good,Super annoying with sales goals and pressure to offer credit cards and new account to regular customers when they already do business with us and know that they don’t want credit cards or 10 different savings accounts.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells fargo is a great company. There are many diferent departments where you can try your skills to see if you are a great fit. The culture for employees is awesome
good,"The pay and benefits overshadow how things work within the company. Well, in this district anyway. There is lack of communication which starts from the top."
good,"The pay was very low, especially with being the busiest bank in the entire region of the bakken. The room for advancement and benefits were great but it did not pay the bills."
good,Low paying and not much room for raises and this is not something openly discussed with management. Not much room for flexibility with hiring but I had good management and made a lot of good friends.
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo and would recommend this to anyone starting out in the workforce."
good,Salaries were inconsistant for same positions.  Collection requirements were very stressful. hours were consistant.  Position was highly competitive and lacked any opportunity for advancement.  Managers were fair.
good,"It’s not a horrible place to work, you have to be on top of your game and a very strong individual. I loved my employees, I loved my direct manager... there were times when I couldn’t get off days that I really needed off. I worked very hard, and it paid off as far as moving up with the company."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and working so close to my home."
good,workplace was decent. but place for growth was harder to move up. you do have the opportunity to continue to learn about the company. the most enjoyable part of the company was the peers.
good,It was fine.   The most enjoyable part was working with my customers.  I also really liked my colleagues there.  My manager was very friendly and easy going.
good,"This is a good entry level position to try and move around in Wells Fargo after a year. There is a lot of turn over because this is a tough job, you as a processor are the driving force of the loan process, more and more responsibilities are put on your shoulders and the pay is very poor for how hard you work, and I mean you are constantly working. No one really cares how hard you work you are just a number to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. They will hire another processor to fill your shoes once you leave and the cycle will repeat itself from there. Poor commission, and poor annual raises. Top performers got a 25. cent an hour raise."
good,"It's great working with WF. Every team member has their own personalities. Management is great. Unfortunately, the hourly pay is too low especially living in the Bay Area."
good,"Lots of sales goals that where unrealistic for the area.  Management was ok, culture ok, learned a lot about sales.  The hardest part was not being able to meet the unrealistic sales goals and working on commission was not appropriate for the high cost of living in my home town."
good,"Unable to provide any information available at this time. I am three years removed from the company, so I wouldn't be able to provide valuable information."
good,"Overall it was a good place.  There was good leadership and they were flexible with your schedule.  This was a long time ago, so I don't know what it's like to work there now"
good,Good place to work without much Opportunity for career advancement Within Mortgage division. Upskilling is also not pushed by management and is often denied when requested by employee.
good,"Good management at my branch, everyone you work with is very nice. Since its a big bank the day to day can get tedious as there are many protocols in place for opening and closing."
good,"The commute was great, I enjoyed the stability and benefit package that was offered as well. Wells Fargo training was impressive. Also the environment was fun."
good,"A great job overall and many opportunities to advance within the company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Alright job has its perkes. Can get bonus. Has lots of room for growth. high call valume depending on time of day you work. You will not get holidays off unless you have worked their for a certain amount of time. Be prepared to work Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Fourth of July. No sick time is given you have to use your vacation hours if you become ill or a family memeber is ill. When first starting off you do have to work on saturday or sunday they do not have an option to have weekends off."
good,"It's a good job to gain experience in the financial field. Will learn about multiple different investment options, but not much thinking involved in this role. You're told what adjustments to make on an account and run the same process 20 times per day."
good,"Loved the job, it is tough. They do require you to work Saturday especially new hires. The trainers are wonderful. Job/Life balance is difficult. Not a lot of advancement opportunities."
good,"50 plus call per day and each banker had to sell on each call. Whether it was a product or a service but we had to offer and sell something to each customer. Unfortunately, I didn't like that because not all customers had the time or interest in WF services."
good,"A typical day at work for me included helping customers cash checks, open accounts, provide products and services to our customers based on their financial need."
good,"Quickly established credibility with clients and remembered over 50+ names of regulars, creating a friendly rapport with customers."
good,I did not like working as a collector because I was uncomfortable asking people about money and I got yelled at a lot. Overall it was a pleasant place to work.
good,I felt like Wells Fargo was a good job and the pay was awesome and I had a wonderful manager and co workers everything started changing when they changed upper management and they layed the customer service department off and we lost our jobs.
good,I personally enjoy my job.  It is a lot of face to face customer service interaction and still in the realm of retail services.  My branch has a great team!
good,"good networking "
good,Good company but no opportunity for growth. I've learned a lot by working for this company. The company itself was great but management needs improvement.
good,"Very demanding and same work everyday. "
good,Overall good company to work with if you are into application development side. Great opportunities everywhere. You get freedom for ideas to implement but not much of learning.
good,"This was a great place to work at. Management was always there to help you in any way they could and were always fair. The hours were great as well, very professional"
good,"Work pace would be slow here"
good,"They provide enough training to know the basics but give you a virtual library for everything else not taught during training. Hardest part of the job is learning how to deal with the difficult customers that call in and learning the deescalating part of the job.  I loved the atmosphere, everyone was really friendly and helpful."
good,"If your a people person, this job is definitely enjoyable. Since part of your job is interacting with the regulars and the many new faces you also encounter."
good,Building a relationship with the customers are worth it! Team huddles and one on ones always helped knowing what's expected of you each day and for the week.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"When I originally hired on, I didn't have any experience with financial institutions, so I have learned a great deal. The environment is laid back ,just complete your work. However I was hired as a contract to hire ,I have been at the company for 16 months contract is scheduled to end in two months, my manager who is great by the way wanted to keep us but was not able to convince higher ups that full time employees were needed. If they were FTE positions I would 've stayed love the culture and vibe and knowledge I have gained."
good,"I enjoyed my time at wells Fargo it is a very diverse place to work with many opportunities and advancement, the management is good, they also have opportunities to volunteer with the community"
good,My typical day was checking in and grabing files from the carts. The number of files I would process would vary day by day. One thing I liked about the job was my fellow employees. We would help each other out if needed. One thing that was hard about the job was the repetitiveness.
good,"working along coworkers was a plus.  Everyone was there to help each other with any questions related to a call, people really were nice to work with."
good,"I have only been with the company since August 2016 so I'm still new. The center is open 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I'm still getting the swing of things, working 330 midnight is a little different for me."
good,"typical day, would come in have a meeting with manager and than to contact my customers , great co-workers always were very helpful "
good,"The Management was the best of my professional career. They were supportive but still strict on policy. And they were encouraging, and was ALWAYS there to help when things got crazy. Don't apply if you have any suspicion that you won't be able to handle it, because you'll probably be right. For me, having that much money under my responsibility was too nerve-raking, but other tellers seemed to do ok, so maybe that's just me. It was surprising to find that I would be working ON MY FEET for 12 hours a day. Open-Close; there are no split shifts, and my location only had 30minute lunches."
good,"Huge company that has a lot of room for growth, but can be a little political at times.  Benefits are great. A lot of tools to learn, but due to budgeting they lack mentorship programs and class room training."
good,Typical work day would be filled with coaching and developing team members. Looking out for risk of the bank and making the schedules for team members. I have learned that staying focus and getting the job done is best. The hardest part of the job is not being so close with your reports. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting in your efforts to only see all the hard work pay off.
good,Typical banking transactions that involves deposits and withdrawals with customers. The co-workers were very nice and helpful. The job was over all pretty decent but the pay was not great in my opinion.
good,Great company. Great People. Career progression can be challenging depending on the department. But a overall great place to work.
good,The people were great. Environment was comfortable and management was down to earth. Management didn't give much notice when the company had to outsource.
good,"I worked at Wells Fargo less than a year. I was excited about working in an environment that is professional and important. My role as a teller included making deposits, withdrawals, cashing checks, transfers, etc to customers and businesses. The good thing is that they give many hours. They are also flexible with schedules. Pay was also very good. Now, I did like interacting with customers throughout the day and helping them with whatever they needed. My managers were awesome. Some highlights of the job included making conversation with customers from all around the world and managers noticing our good jobs."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work if your willing to sell products. You also have to have a passion for business or finance.The culture was very good for the most part, I was able to build relationships on a perfessional level. What i valued most was Wells Fargo offers a tution remburshment program. 401K and health care once your hired. While most place you would have to work 3-6month before having that ability."
good,Loved the work place great atmosphere and culture. Work was challenging which gave me the ability to expand knowledge in the industry. The downside is there was no room for advancement in my current role.
good,"Sales, Sales, Sales. That is Wells Fargo main concern and customer service second. Certain locations are incredibly slow and has the same clientele for years, thus making it difficult to make any type of incentive. The company says those are only excuses and that every branch should meet their quota, despite the volume of customers. Every branch is different with their own set of guidelines, making it difficult with the customers to understand why one place says yes and the other says no. Tellers never last, most tellers stay there for a max of 8 months. Very rare for them to be longer then a year."
good,"Management is easy to work for. Morale and culture are in good standing.  Good benefits, however, advancement is a bit of a struggle."
good,Receiving phone call from customer about their account and credit cards.Providing excellent customer service. Cross-selling to customers and making sure you have resolved their issue/problem on the first call. Taking you breaks and your lunches at the time your scheduled to stay above 80% for your work day.
good,The corporate environment was beneficial for group discussion and ability to provide service to our business partners.
good,"Great place, the people are great too, but the sales pressure doesn't make sense. The customers are nice and loyal, but the automation and making things online is pulling customers out of the store while sales goals are rising. It just doesn't make sense."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good company to work for, however my manager at the time was not very knowledgeable of the products and services, so it made it very hard for one to succeed because she was not very supportive due to her lack of knowledge."
good,This company is a great stepping stone for anyone looking to advance in financial services. Working with this company I was able to learn more about home lending and operations which helped my advance further for more pay eventually.
good,Each day was a challenge and sometimes fulfilling. Especially when I could make my customers happy by assisting them with their financial needs. There is nothing like a happy customer and the recognition you get from them. There were always new policies and procedures to learn. Employees were always informed on updates. The most difficult part of the job was trying to handle the customers request in a short period of time. Managers were not that plentiful so waiting for help was difficult because the customer had to wait. My co-workers were always willing to take out the time to assist and share what they learned. The most important part of the job was the knowledge I learned and could take with me and use in different areas of my life.
good,"I enjoyed my department, titles. My supervisor was great.. She always worked to keep the balance of work load and fun."
good,A typical work day Collections on past due balances. I learned that coperate america is what it is. The hardest part of doing my job is the politics of my job. The co-workers are the best part of the job.
good,Work with a great group of people who truly care about their jobs. Really feel that my job matters. Compensation/Benefits could be better.
good,"Great jumbo products, terrible processing and underwriting turnaround times. Files get declined by underwriters that are so bogged down they don't have time to properly look over the file."
good,"Busy! Typical 10 hr days consisting of Follow up, Sales&Marketing, Appointments, MUST be organized, a people person, upbeat, optimistic and a problem solver.  Educated in all aspects of Mortgage Industry. Fun environment"
good,"I introduced customers to new products and services, and generate leads for other members of"
good,"The typical working day revolves around answering incoming customer calls, sorting through new & current accounts wanting to refinance their mortgage, & responding to company as well as customer emails."
good,I enjoy helping and taking care of customers needs. My job consists of helping the customers establish a lower mortgage that is affordable through the programs that are available for them. Saving the homes of borrowers that are not able to fulfill their original agreement for mortgage payments. Wellsfargo does a great job by the care they have for their employees. Being happy and loving what you do means a great deal. My co-workers are wonderful. They all for the most part are team players which is what helps. A typical day consist of a lot of change. Change is growth and growth takes you to the next level in life. Change is great and involves a great deal of knowledge when change is for the positive. The hardest part of the job is ending my day. I will work as long as it takes to get the job done and going way above what my job duties are if that's what it takes. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting up to go to the workplace. I enjoy the atmosphere and my job duties immensely.
good,"Utilize banking information systems to carry out complex financial transactions "
good,During a tough time in the residential market it was difficult to produce loans that could close. It always seemed as if the left hand never knew what the right hand was doing.
good,"A typical day at work was spent solving problems and researching items my group could not locate on their own. Making phone calls to track down documents and handling irrate customers with last minute request. Going to meetings daily and having meetings with my team. Hardest part of my job was seperating friendship from business which had to be done when I became a coodinator as well as getting use to talking in front of a room full of people during meetings and ect. The most enjoyable part of my job was it was a relaxed environment and our immediate group were fun and hard working together as a team. Also helping others within the bank when there was a legal issue that needed to be handled right away was rewarding to know that I could be a part of that. During meetings I would reward them until I was told I was making the other coordinators look bad and could no longer bring them breakfast or little suprises. During my time at Wachovia it was a great place to work, it all changed after wewere bought out by Wells Fargo and was no longer as pleasant. My co-workers outside my immediate group were great to work with for the most part. The new management made rules for different areas although we were all the same department therefore this caused drama and confusion on a daily basis.It got to the point that we were only allowed to speak to the ones within our direct group and changed the whole moral of the area which made it more and more difficult to come to work and be happy. I will say that I learned how to be a great leader and to not be so shy with the training classes we were"
good,"Wells Fargo has raised the pressure on all employee's.  I take call after call.  Around one hundred calls on average a day. "
good,Sales goal can be intimidating to someone that is not use to it. The co-workers are great to work with and everyone helps each other. Wells Fargo is a 24 hour Call Center so they are flexible.
good,I would come in each morning at 8:30 a.m. to help open the vault and set up my station for the day. I mostly did Deposits and Withdrawals and referred customers to sit with the Bankers to review their accounts and maybe open new accounts and take advantage of other products we have to offer.I did learn a lot about legal documents how to handle them and how to read them. Management was good we had enough managers and supervisors to help us with customer service. I enjoyed working with my co-workers we had great teamwork and helped each other reach our goals. There was no hard parts really. Most enjoyable was meeting new people and seeing the same people everyday.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at work would be for you to come in at your scheduled time, log on to your system and begin to take calls and assist the Wells Fargo customers. It is imperative that you get to work on time; Wells Fargo is very strict with attendance."
good,"I am a busy body at work. I am able to multi-task and enjoy staying busy and productive. I am great with people and have learned that even with an angry customer, you can always make them feel better by listening , apologizing even if it wasn't your mistake and trying to make things better. Hard days would be when other co-workers make the business look bad b/c it affects us all. I enjoy working with people, and staying busy."
good,"They wanted us to get 70 sales every 3 months (sales consist of checking, savings, debit card, online banking, direct deposit) but with a town of 600 and been there for 10 years, it was a tapped out market and that's why the branch closed. We always reached our goals, barely, but they wanted more and we couldn't do it."
good,Unfortunately i was placed and in slower pace branch where we'd see on average about 20 customers which most were our regulars. Management wasn't bad but at times very unprofessional in the way they would act in front of customers. Like a typical job you have your standard issues with your coworkers here and there but nothing major. The hardest part about this job was trying to get the clientele into our branch to make your referrals so that you could move up. Most customers were seniors and regulars so they already had most if not all the products we offer.
good,The Wells fargo job was a Great opportunity but The management staff made things way different then it was suppose to be. I was under constant pressure du to the fact that i was the least liked worker. I wasn't as friendly as they would like me to be.
good,"I enjoyed my colleagues at work, but want to pursue a different career path. Pay was great and the hours were manageable."
good,"-daily face-to-face contact with customers"
good,answer inbound and outbound calls get 2 breaks 1 lunch co- workers are very fun to work with. Learned new system training is 2 weeks
good,I would service customer accounts. I liked the job except the sales aspect of the job.
good,"Great work experience and management also, co workers were like family"
good,"Overall, I definitely love the company and the fact that I myself have had a chance to advance my position in just 6 months since I constantly exceed sales goals and also showed my manager I was able to establish strong and positive relationships with my customers"
good,It is a somewhat pressuring position but the ability to move up within the company is possible if the appropriate amount of energy is invested in perfecting the art.
good,"well a typical day at work starts right to work, calls are in queues we always have something to do, i manage a 400 million dollar profile, i get along great with my co-workers, the hardest part of my job would be not being able to always assist the costumers due to policies and procedures , i love when i am able to help a customer and hear how happy they are"
good,Wells Fargo has good benefits for the employees and the incentives are awesome.
good,Phone Banker. Its all about bringing in more money for the business. Very busy
good,Productive fun place but less opportunity for career development. Work life balance is pretty okay. Company lacks flair when operation / banking is concerned. IT crowd seems vivid and pleasant.
good,"Loved my job,,work with customers built large customer base enjoy helping people everyday with their needs"
good,"I found that working at a bank was stressful. Combine the fact that you have a lot of money that you have to keep up with and 5 tellers to supervise it was a migraine almost every day for me."
good,everyone is friendly. I enjoy helping people with their financial review.
good,I worked for Wells Fargo Bank NA for over a year and I loved my coworkers and that company had rooom for people to move up the carrer ladder.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wonderful Team Lead and Managers, great co-workers. A good place with work-life balance but not a very good process and nothing much to learn with the process not only the one I worked in but also the other processes known in the company."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great employer, but they were unprepared for our book of business within their financial world."
good,"Dressing up was devine, seeing those paychecks was extraordinary. self worth? sketchy. Some days you could be a banking champ! (maybe even land a date). Others, scum out wins you. yeah, it was cool, count well, Money is a human god."
good,"I loved being a Teller for Wells Fargo, but did not stay very long because of a new opportunity"
good,The customers were awesome has some very nice people as co-workers. however most of the co workers were not honest with products being offered to clients.
good,"I love this job, there's just not enough room for growth. I have had the opportunity to work with Management within this job and have token on Projects and has excel."
good,We excell at providing world class banking customer care!!!!
good,coolest place I ever worked we would always have our work done but take time to breath and a little fun. best boss you could ever ask for. so sad when we went out of business.
good,"A typical day is work is heavy communication with loan officers, realtors, borrowers and underwriting.  Management expects you to be able to work independently.  My co-workers were fantastic and we worked great as a team.  The hardest part of the job are customers who are angry due to the guidelines changes in the secondary marker with stricter guidelines and do not understand the market today in loan documentation due to the housing collapse."
good,"Assist customers to succeed financially, you meet a lot of new people and learn a lot about finances and how to keep yours in order. Everyone is friendly is get a long with all of your co workers."
good,"I was only employed for less than a year, and due to industry slow down, was laid off. Overall good company to work for, I regret our relationship ended."
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo was non stop deposits from open to close. We were an extremely busy branch. I've learned how to make angry and upset clients not so tense when they leave. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting many different individuals every single day!
good,"Typical day includes working customer transactions and making sells referals. My coworkers and manager were great at my particular branch. We have sells goals that we have to meet that come from the top. They can be very unreasonable and difficult to obtain. Customers can be very irritating, but that all depends on what branch you work at."
good,"It was a fast past environment."
good,"I was working there as a consultant. As a consultant, you were not allowed to attend a lot of staff, business meetings. A very stable company. Life-work balance place."
good,The more you put in the more you receive. Friendly staff. Overall not a bad place to work.
good,"answered incoming calls from various banking customers. Processed fraud claims, opened and closed accounts, answered emails."
good,Have to enjoy sitting for long periods of time. Very fast paced job.
good,"The benefits working for Wells Fargo are amazing. They have a great selection for retirement, really great health coverage, and a lot of programs for team members. They set pretty high goals for their employees who are already getting an earful from customers, so it is a high stress job and extremely micro-managed. Still, they do provide lots of opportunity to progress in the company if you are performing well."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Responsible for meeting Quarterly Sales Goals by maximizing every customer service encounter. Handle complex customer service issues in a timely manner and follow up to ensure customer satisfaction. Work in a team environment with fellow co-workers who handle various or similiar job requirements. Follow policies and guidelines established by the company as well as Federal Regulations. The hardest part of the job for myself was delegating tasks to others because I wanted to ensure that the issue was handled correctly. The most enjoyable part was building rapport with customers. Helping the customers by resolving any question or concern they had. Finding solutions to help build thier relationship with the bank by asking questions and looking for the right product or service that fit thier needs. Gettting repeat customers or referrals was the biggest compliment of a job well done. 
good,"over all wells fargo is a great company. I have a great time when I am at work with my customers and coworkers. Sometimes it gets so slow at our branch but we always find something to do. My management is amazing. We are all like a big family and they help me become more successful everyday and encourage me. The hardest part of my job that I have had a challenge with is adapting to a great deal of patience. Sometimes customers come in and they are unsure of why we process things certain ways and they want it done their way but it is against the policies of Wells Fargo. So then I am the face that they get mad at. Also, having to do mandatory scripting for the company is hard. This is because some customers yell at me and tell me that they know I have to say that cause its my job. I am a very personable person. So to have to say words everyday that are out of my norm, instead of just being able to say things in a genuine way and communicate things properly. I feel with scripting it takes away focus from the customer with a genuine transaction. i am highly against the scripting because of this reason. The tellers get too focused on making sure they are scripting rather than having a genuine transaction that will lead to perfect service. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with amazing clients. i LOVE to hear that I was able to help someone out with a problem they were having. It is really good to hear great feedback like that"
good,I like to work hard I love challenge and being apart of a company that has a lot of dealings in the community
good,"Typical day at work may include ordering appraisals, submitting invoices for payment to AP, researching, working on loan bookings for review, and other office administrative duties such as faxing, filing and answering phone."
good,"The job was as good as long as the business was around. Once business started getting bad, the employees became expendable (a typical tactic for this employer). The only great thing about this job was that they allowed me to have a flexible schedule while I went to school. Other than that, the management was full of ineffective micro managers and condescending authoritarians."
good,"Customer relations, data entry, sales."
good,Work in a controlled environment using Axway software suites to connect the customers and or migrate them to the new systems.
good,A typical day at work included running reports for:
good,Not a bad place to work. You;re micro managed the first year. Then transfer out as has as you can...
good,"This is a job that one is tied to their desk. Obviously in an in-bound call center one must always be ready to take a call from a bank customer. The level of training all new-hires receive is top-notch. While I greatly enjoyed my co-workers and management, and the customers, this job did not suit my personality."
good,"I work customer service so I deal with stressful customer situations at times. Coworkers are good people and make the office easier to be around. Supervisory staff is genuinely interested in your well being, but its not easy to jobs past a certain point."
good,"Wachovia was a wonderful company to work for they were family oriented and valued great customer service when the company was bought out by Wellsfargo the friendly and cohesive relationship with co-workers and managers changed everyone became uptight and stressed about their jobs.The hardest thing about my job was being numbered driven versus customer driven everyone just seemed to be concerned with the bottom dollar.I learned to perservere it the midst of continual changes by upper management, a typical work day consisted of traininng and being available to assist other states make there goal with production to clear customers financial accounts which consist of debits,credits, transfers and balancing teller issues.The most enjoyable thing was my co-workers we had the ability to encourage one another when we felt overwhelmed with the constant changes during the Merger."
good,"Only complaint is the sales expectations. Most wouldn't think sales are a factor, however, this is strictly a sales position. The sales quota is very high and makes for a very stressful career. If you are great at sales and love to push people to do things that they don't want to do, then you just may succeed at this job :-) The benefits are great, pay is so so, management is so so, workplace atmosphere is nice, but the sales are not fun."
good,Learned from and met some great management. The experience provided an expansive growth in my professional experience.
good,100% of your day will require being on the phone. You'll learn to have empathy and understanding of customers who call in. Management will do their best to insure that you are doing your job most effectively and as stress free as possible. Your co-workers are usually fun and keep a positive attitude in the workplace. The hardest part of the job would be the repetitive aspect. 85-100 calls of attempting to sale. The most enjoyable part would be the co-workers you meet. I don't work there anymore but I still keep in contact with a few of my old co-workers.
good,Ok job once you get use to practically begging people for money. Loved my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was trying to get people to pay even though their accounts were set to close. Enjoyable part was my co-workers and the volunteer opportunities
good,"A typical day at WFCC is pretty laid back, getting to your desk and signing in at your scheduled time. Taking calls until your set breaks and anyother scheduled meetings. Helping customers with their questions and meeting sales goals. Everyday is a learning experience in the banking industry and then educating the customers on how to make their banking easier. The management team is very supportive and will help with any questions/concerns one may have. As well as the the co-workers, everyone on your team has the same goals as you do so they are very supportive and helpful when help is needed. Some of the difficultlies of the job is overcoming objections when making the sales referral and other half of the job is meeting your sales goals. Also, mainly when customers call in they are having a problem with their account, so they can be upset with you. The enjoyable things about the job is the benefits and the incentives."
good,I loved know what I had to do the minute I got to work. The supervisor would put my work in my que and I had 10 days to complete each investigation. So I knew exactly which one was due and what time.
good,"Good place if you like sales, Cold calling,Appointment setting, finding financial needs for there customers"
good,Working in the financial business you learn a lot about people and have the opportunity to gain skills in diffusing upset people while maintaining good customer service. The majority of my co workers got along well both at work and off the job. After work activities helped to aleviate frustrations and keep everyone on a personal level which in turn kept us working together as a team.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at work being a bank teller for Wells Fargo would be that I would get to work in the morning and help our customers with withdrawls, deposits, advised customers of our wonderful banking services that would fit their everyday financial needs. My co-workers were fun to work with and were very productive as we would continue to serve our customers throughout the day. Sales goals was a a big part of my job everyday which we would strive to succeed everyday with exceeding our monthly sales goals every month. I learned a lot about the banking industry working as a Bank Teller for Wells Fargo."
good,"Each day a new program laid out to increase sales. The company is constantly changing tasks to increase sales. I've learned to increase those sales, experience, better people skills, and how to bring high value clients into banks. The hardest part of my job is the constant change in sales and quotas being raised everyday. The most enjoyable part is competitive work enviornment, the opportunity to out sell other people, and being number one in sales in the district and southeast."
good,A typical day involves the supervision of three to four tellers to ensure proper procedures are followed for processing banking transactions . Also monitoring proper guidelines regarding the operations aspect and providing positive feedback and developing action plans around these guidelines. There was also interaction with customers in handling their banking needs while providing exemplary customer service. In the three years of working with the institution I have gained knowledge around banking guidelines and the proper steps to ensuring operational soundness.
good,"I enjoyed the work of a lead teller, but I did not like having to sell products to customers."
good,"Everyday at work was definitely a NEW day. Working at a bank you learn something new everything. New people, new accounts, new personalities. I really enjoyed it but the nonprofessional really slowed me down in the branch where I was at. I would love to be back in a banking field, just not that one."
good,Good place to work for benefits. If you are on the retail side the bank it is a high pressure sales job no matter what capacity you work in.
good,"It was a very strong company to work for, We worked 4 10 hour shifts and the benefits were very nice"
good,"Strict environment but good pay"
good,"working with excellents customers and parthers"
good,Working at wells Fargo call center was not bad at all I was able to move up fairly quickly to a team lead but as I got further into it it seemed as though I wouldn't be a leader to move forward any further as it seems they were only promoting friends in the next position if you are not good friends with the main managers then you are overlooked
good,"Good place to work if you are a student and need a part time job as a teller. You get a lot of coaching though, so great place for developing. Not the best paying bank out there"
good,"I like the company as a whole and I love my department, I'm trying to land a full time position which has been a challenge. There are a lot of jobs open on the website. When you apply it takes awhile for you to hear back."
good,Work life balance is good. Compensation is fair. More budget need to be allocated for professional development. They should allow more remote options.
good,Very professional and fun workplace.  Every day meant an interaction with someone new to the world of banking and to the Wells Fargo Banking experience.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. The first time I interviewed I didn’t get it. I got it the second time I interviewed. They have really good benefits for employees.
good,"The company has changed over the years and they are still trying to get their footing after the challenges of the last few years. The leadership is changing, but most employees are skilled and there for the right reasons. I think the company's glory days are gone, but hopefully it can keep the people that make it a good place to work and the new leadership will follow suit."
good,Day starts great with coffee provided by employer after clocking in and pulling up necessary programs to work with; problem solving skills will also be a benefit. Co workers are sincere and genuine and will be willing to provide lending hand if needed. The hardest part is when business changes are needed and unfortunately employees are impacted by loss of employment.
good,Too many sales goals and not enough integrity.  I don't mind having to sell but the way we were pressured was not exactly what I consider to be ideal for the workplace.
good,"Overall a pleasant company to work for with endless opportunities to advance. Wellsfargo offered paid-time off, employee appreciation, team builders to keep the team engaged and enjoy working and when there was a slump internal fun days to pick you up.  Understanding management for one off for personal emergencies if needed. great pay and flexible hours"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The size and scope of the company affords a lot of opportunity to learn. Unfortunately, if you don't change firms and come back, you'll need to change roles several times and wait 15 years before the salary is competitive."
good,At Wells Fargo I was on the phone majority of my shifts. We experienced heavy call volumes most days of the week requiring undivided attention and detail to customer. The workplace culture is respectable; in team meetings/when employees are on break we have casual conversation and banter. The hardest part of the job was maintaining stress levels as influx of calls can become mentally draining. The most enjoyable part was bettering the banking experience for countless of customer per day.
good,"Calls can be brutal and back to back but management allows short breaks to decompress and there are programs for employees who need mental care. Customers can also be brutal, however it is to be expected since it is the institution people place their livelyhoods in."
good,Everything is great. Coaching management can be a little less judgmental.  Flexibility in schedule is great can and would accommodate to shift changes.
good,They definitely have great benefits and pto. But management isn't always the greatest and it can be a bit stressful for the pay. You really need to be good at multitasking and to make sure you're good with handling cash. It has its pros and cons.
good,"Good and best work and best thing about Wellsfargo there will be no layoffs, people will enjoy working with Wellsfargo, and provides best transport of all."
good,All employees working 20+ hours/week recieve benefits. Some days are slow and some days it's not a moment to spare. Entry level for people who're seeking banking career
good,"It was always a busy day working with great people. I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo except for the management, they didn't know how to do the job so it was hard to go to them for questions."
good,"was part of a training program that was ended short. Despite high level corporate problems and a negative customer viewpoint, the opportunity for growth is exponential."
good,"Week long training which can be stressful done virtually. Work environment was fast paced but in depended on the location. Management was great, very flexible and caring in making a productive and collaborative work environment."
good,it is a challenging place to work. As soon as I would log in the phones were non stop. I learned about the bank policy's and how to use good phone etiquette.
good,"Fast paced, highly motivated in house staff. Intense sales pressure only came from higher management who did not frequent the branches or understand the real, local sales economy. They assigned increasingly growing sales goals based on trends or reports, seemingly not knowing or even considering the reality of the customer base in Napa, CA. ""Pressure bursts pipes"" And when some people were faced with either meeting sales goals or losing their income/jobs is when the bad apples came out."
good,"Work when I was there was well. The culture is very energetic and they have a lot of perks such as lunch provided by the managers, rafles, free food truck meals due to accomplishments achieved by the unit. At one time they even hired a masseuse and everyone got a 15 minute massage for an award we received."
good,The workplace culture was amazing. Gave me more of a reason to go into work everyday. I worked with a lot of great people. They helped me through tough times.
good,Good place to work. Advancement and volunteer work is encouraged. Employee development is always encouraged as well.  Recent centralized positions were unexpected and hard on long time employees that were displaced and already had a financial impact due to the issues concerning the financial side of the company.
good,The typical work day involved helping account holders with opening new accounts or servicing their current accounts. I learned a lot about sales and the sales culture. I enjoyed the team work environment.
good,"It's cookie cutter management style.  Nobody is offensive or overly bossy, they tend to hire the right people and create a decent culture. They will work with you on your schedule.  Good job for college students."
good,"typical receptionist job"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wasn't bad, wouldn't recommend it, unless you want to seat for lots of hours. Hope this was helpful for folks looking to work in a call center environment."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to be. I think I just wasn't jazzed about the content."
good,"New management with ads that reflect that time to throw out the out and all new. The new want former out ASAP. The E and E effort is providing cover to the new team to eliminate existing with little or no justification and replace with all new from their last employer and they are paying for those folks, talented or not yet to be determined."
good,Great management & co-workers; pushy sales goals. A lot of people flourished in this environment & there are some great relationships to be made there.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for.  It has really good benefits, the pay could be better!  Over all the department is laid back as long as you are doing your job."
good,"I’ve had the privilege to help the Community at local food banks, hosting financial wellness seminars, teach the children to save, tornado relief, and so much more! I love working at a place that truly values the community."
good,A typical day I'd come in around 8:30am and have my teller box set up by 9am. The day began and off rolling at steady pace. We have a great mixture of women & men. We laugh at times enjoy each other and gave great customer service.
good,There was work in various departments for us to learn and develop a different skill or training while I work there and very diverse background in the company.
good,"work was hard"
good,"Very flexible work balance life. Work product is based on deadline and product.  Not concerned with daily 9-5, but project completion. Management is clear and to the point."
good,The job was pretty simple. You need to sell products to your customers while seeming genuine. Call-backs to clients who would possibly service us. It looks great on resume.
good,Wells Fargo has a fun environment where tellers and bankers are able to connect their life with customers life.  It does become overwhelming with sales goals but shouldn't deter anyone from gaining the experience needed.
good,"Bethlehem call center was the best till they closed site. Upper Management was the best, learned a lot of skills daily from them, Workplace was fun and had a great team. Hardest part of job dealing with irate customers and best part of job was co-workers and management that cared"
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo, they are amazing people with vision and fresh ideas that keep you refreshed and sharp. I enjoyed my job to the fullest degree and working for this company Is a highlight in my career"
good,"It was ok, not what I was looking for. Staff more focused on stats than the quality of work."
good,Developed and maintained relationships with customers to maximize sales opportunities
good,"typical day was 8 hours with multiple shifts"
good,"Enjoy everything I have learn and my growing as well, its a company that give us the opportunity to grow as much as you work for."
good,"The contractors hired on performed excellent, however there is little to know job advancement available here but if you are looking for a temporary job for a little while, highly recommended."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Fast pace work environment, great benefits, can be challenging dealing with the customer's concerns, and a very stressful work environment. If you enjoy a career that is constantly changing this may be a great fit for you."
good,Wells Fargo is a ok place to work. All the work we do we should definitely be paid much much more. Hours could be better. Seniority should take precedence
good,"save yourself some stress and do not apply"
good,"manager had issues with me, but WF requires you to do your job and does not hire in the CMG department, the work is just given  to others no matter what"
good,On a daily basis one would handle about 25 calls from small business owners.  Learned how to offer appropriate ban accounts based on the business and needs.  Management was available to assist in ensure performance and accuracy was handled properly. The culture was open door and professional with high expectations from management.  Performance  and meeting goals was the biggest factor in your annual review.  Constant changes were a challenge but not impossible with good time management skills and prioritizing tasks.  Competitiveness made this job fun along with recognition on a monthly basis  that boosted your eagerness to do better and better every time.
good,"The company was busy and fun to work for."
good,Thoroughly review your management. Needs huge improvement. I am a graduate student with 4 small kids. Seems they would do anything to get you out of the door  if they seemed threatened by your motivation and success within the company. Difficult to contact human resource about issue
good,I had a great time working for Wells Fargo. I left to look for better opportunity and higher paying job. I felt I was held back because of appearance and would have stayed if there was a different District Manager that would approve a promotion.
good,"It pays the bills, and has good people. Really appreciate management here. Only concern would be the structure it can be a bit policy heavy when it comes to certain circumstances"
good,"taking calls assisting customers with their account information, while upsailing other products and services that may be helpful for the customer as well"
good,"I worked there before the sales goals were taken away. There was a lot of stress and management issues. Now that they have changed their guidelines, I am sure the stress level has decreased."
good,"Although the benefits outweigh the negatives, there are very few opportunities given to grow or branch out.  The pay scales are decent however its almost impossible to exceed the median pay no matter how long you're in the position."
good,"Overall, it was a pretty relaxed environment. We get to work from home twice a week which was nice. Good benefits, good match, they also give yearly free stocks as well."
good,Great place to work for growth and experience. Lots of opportunities to learn and self discover your best customer service tactics. Also a great compensation plan.
good,"Day starts and ends with serving customers with various backgrounds, cultures, languages, attitudes, how you handle them it is up to you. some difficult some easy and outgoing. "
good,"Working with Wells Fargo, I learned to be able build a relationship with customers and how to properly do cash handling. The most enjoyable part of the job is the incentives and work environment."
good,"The people and management staff were wonderful, nice and supportive but the pace could get pretty stressful at times and the phone were relentless. I enjoyed working there."
good,"typical day at work included helping customers succeed financially, and carrying out transactions. i learned risk compliance, and rules and regulations. the management can be border line bullying/harassment at times. the workplace is also tough since we do have sale goals and incentives."
good,Wells Fargo was a great company and I really enjoyed working with them. Most of the supervisors were genuine and easy to get along with. Would work here again.
good,"Wellsfargo is a great place to work, but not everyone should be a manager a manager has to lead by example and that didn't happen over all the experience was great but never step up and speak for yourself, if there is a problem because then there will be problems for you. Most of all keep all problems to yourself, because everyone will know your business no such thing as confidentiality."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day with Wachovia Bank would consist of weekly sales meeting to review what we were doing well and what areas we needed to work on.  I enjoyed role playing with my tellers so that they felt more comfortable talking with clients about our products.  Also how to turn a service question into a sales potential. The workplace culture was great.  It was always important to me for my fellow team members to enjoy their job/position.  I would do monthly check ins with my team members to find out where they ultimately wanted to be with Wachovia Bank.  I found it rewarding to help my team members become happy with the job that they had been working so hard to obtain through hard work and determination.
good,"My typical day at work consist of helping customers with banking solutions.  I learned the Wells Fargo systems on how navigate through out the system so my clients would not have to wait for extended period of times.  The management part of my job was to make sure I reviewed daily and weekly goals and how my team was going to reach these goals by motivation, praise, and recognition.  I would say the hardest part of my job was obtaining the goals set before me based on the previous years production and being one of the largest stores in the area.  I enjoyed the challenge of reaching the goals and viewing the rewards that my team members received due to the motivation in the work place environment."
good,the PTO that is offered is very generous and the benefits are nice. The wage is higher than any call center I have worked for. The management is very helpful and understanding. There is room for advancement and you deal with different situations every day.
good,"learn ,know how to work hard and work smart"
good,"Typical 9 to 5. "
good,"Help a lot of customers, deliver great customer service. Uncover customers financial needs. Building personal connections with customers. Hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time in one spot."
good,"While the environment might be amazing here, there is a huge sales focus. If you don't meet your numbers one day, you are pulled into your supervisor's office and asked why. This would make complete sense if my job was a sales based job, but it wasn't. My job was online customer support. I was supposed to help people get their online banking set up, working, and correct issues with that. So WHY was I required to make sales to 25% or more of my customers?"
good,Nice place to work difficult sales goals answering calls regarding the members accounts. Helping with different banking needs. Ordering the customers checks and or debit cards.
good,I enjoy working at my job. The people here are very talented and close knit. The office environment is great .I've been working with the same manger for years.
good,"A typical day starts with Meetings in the morning to discuss the day’s events, give progress reports of complete and uncompleted projects. Discuss any pressing issues that need to be addressed or escalated. Go through voicemail and emails to respond to any messages left. Create a game plan with other team members on projects that involve other team members, and share questions or concerns. Set goals for accomplishments for that day and get to work. The hardest part of the job is getting a project that does not have clear instructions, because that will cause delays in progress and affect the outcome, or completion of the project. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you successfully complete a project on time and get a thumbs up from Management"
good,Greet every customer with a smile and be able to sell banking products to meet customers' specific needs. Room for advancement based on customer service rating and sales.
good,"A typical day at work deals with doing things right the first time, welcoming the customers with a great smile, making the feel wanted and that we value there business. Helping them succeed financially. I've learned that handling so much cash and dealing with personal information is a very serious matter and you can't trust anyone always in dual control. Management is great at making it a fun environment but always getting the job done. The hardest part is to keep in balance. The most enjoyable part is to help customers succeed financially."
good,The branch that I work at is slow but sometimes very busy. Our main clientele are elderly people. I love working here but the pay is not sufficient enough. My team is great and management is average.
good,"Friendly people, was a temp job, assignment ended. I tried to get on full time perm, they weren't hiring at the time. I loved working with the people, the work was easy to understand, I enjoyed the managers,  they were very friendly and helpful"
good,"Good company to work for. Extremely strict when it came to meeting your daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals. Only thing I didn't really like was that they forced selling down our throats."
good,"I absolutely believe the vision and values set forth by Wells Fargo is very customer oriented and believes in going out of your way to please them, as it should be. However, every branch is very different. The pay is extremely fair for a starting job. The hours are great, Monday - Friday and you work 9am to 5pm and until 6pm on Fridays. My branch is closed on Saturday so I have every weekend off. They also give you a very generous amount of paid time off from the start, which is 18 days. Overall a decent place to help build your resume and gain experience."
good,Processing loans on a daily basis .A great work place. learned a lot about loan closing.   Enjoyed my time there .I didn't really have any hard times there.
good,A typical day starts at 8 and ends at 6. You get an hour lunch break which is good. The management is always looking for ways to make it a fun working environment. The hardest part is dealing with mean customers and having to meet sales goals. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with people I like to work with and working for a company you can move up in.
good,"Heavily relied on sales numbers for promotions, overall a decent structure between management and employees. Very little job satisfaction if ambitious toward creating a worthwhile career. For bottom level jobs, such as teller or banker, no college degree required which was a plus for most people."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,took inbound calls to assist clients interested in bank owned properties or to put in work orders for properties in depair
good,"Good place to work. Very good advancement if you can handle the stressful sales goals and daily coaching.  They will push you very hard, so be prepared to talk talk talk and sell sell sell."
good,A great company to work for. I have been with this company since 2007 and there are so many business lines within this company.
good,The employees make the company a nice place to work at. Excessive amount of politics. Best part of my job was to meet team members on a daily basis and help them grow in their roles as well as help clients meet their financial needs.
good,Great place to work if you like the bank field I would recommend Wells Fargo. They are not only for the community but also there for their employees.
good,"fast paced, get to meet and help others, supportive team members, great benefits, OK management, hardest part of job is not having enough time to help customers. phone bankers are timed for how long they talk to each customer"
good,"his job was flexible but wish it was more based off of comission."
good,"Process the loans and help other Team Members."
good,"typical day is always on the go at work, striving to help customers with any unanswered questions they have. I uncover needs that customers have and help them find a solution to make their banking more convenient and running smoothly with no dead ends Not only in banking but also in any job I always go out of my way to please. I work until the problem is solved. I learn so much about customer experience and service. Most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customer leave with a smile and a solved issue that they walked in originally with. I know my work with customers has played a huge affect on them when they come back only asking for me knowing they can trust me with honest work."
good,"If you enjoy sales, and meeting very strict sales quotas everyday for shareholders, then this is the job for you. In all honesty, I adored my coworkers and managers, and leads, but the sales pressure that is put on employees is too great. There would be times I would go home and cry from the stress. The pay is nowhere near what I felt I was worth for the pressure that was put on me."
good,Wells Fargo has great culture that promotes growth. I like company and they always work on your next carrier. they also pay for school.
good,Overall The Company was a good place to work. The people are nice and the culture was strong. it is a great name and strong bank
good,Balance work loads. I learn how to mix chemicals baking it into a finish product. Management is pretty fair. I enjoy being able to work over time if when I can.
good,"this job is lots of training and customer service, had a great staff to work and learn with. "
good,Meet new people all day long. A lot of pressure to upsell products to customers.
good,"it si ok, poor management and team work."
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and say my Goodmornings and off to my desk and start processing claim! We all would chatter while working and would share much laughter. The hardest part was denying medical claims for numerous reasons. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with people.
good,"Tacking care of all financial needs of the customers."
good,"The company is great to work at."
good,"The compensation was great for this position, however I learned later that I was somehow being paid substantially less than newer tellers who had no prior experience. I had gotten a small pay increase but it still did not match the newer employees. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It was a steady work flow, I was rarely overwhelmed. I was a part time teller, scheduled 20 hours a week. Had I lived locally, I wouldn't have minded having so many scheduled days with such short hours, but since I went to school at night and lived far and in a heavily populated area, it was very difficult making it to work on time every morning. I was written up for excessive tardiness and could not transfer to a closer store because of this and management could not change my scheduled days. I had to end my employment there."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Very high sales goals."
good,"Great management, excellent benefits, competitive pay.  Lots of layoffs however"
good,"good,enthusiastic.indeed a great place to work."
good,Job advancement if you are interested. Great Benefits. PTO.
good,Positions were limited in growth due to internal structures.
good,"High volume incoming calls, assist customer with their banking needs."
good,"Banker duties are to service the needs of our customers, as far as their checking, savings, loan and investment needs."
good,It is a very diverse place to work. It has great benefits. There are alot of chance for you to grow with the company.
good,great people help me become a great manager and fine toned my coaching skills
good,The hardest part of the job is handling with money. Typical day at work is working with money and customers.
good,"I really enjoyed  working  with with such diverse people, gaining knowledge of mortgages"
good,It is a wonderful company to work for but there is a lot of miscommunication
good,"Good company to grow in.  Pay is good, incentive is ok.  Promotions do happen.  Good people."
good,"selling financial services and products, cross-selling, referring to partners"
good,Very Busy branch with a lots of difficult customers. You are never bored.
good,"Answer inquires on checking ,savings, investment accounts, etc, initiated domestic and international wire transfers daily."
good,Wells Fargo is more sales oriented than customer service oriented. Did not like that aspect. I am more customer loyal than sales oriented.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,In the mornings we huddle and have a team meeting. Then we take inbound calls and make outbound calls when need be. I answer questions concerning customer mortgages. I have learned how to professionally answer questions about mortgages. The co-workers were working just as hard as I was. Team work was very big. The hardest part of the job was getting use to being on the phone all day. Then I've learned to like it. The most enjoyable part of the job was when all the employees was recognized by the company and treated us to lunch.
good,• Researched and analyzed customer accounts and disputes and provided recommendation for resolution.
good,good place to work and learn. sales goals are intense. real structured environments.
good,I enjoy working for Wells Fargo. They are a great company to work for except for the sense of job security. I have been taught so much from my direct managers. They allow time for volunteering. They offer a large amount of classes that can assist in moving up in your career. There benefits package is awesome. Great place to work if it wasn't for the lack of job security. Everyone in our building is afraid of getting laid off. Most are sitting back waiting for their notice.
good,"I never had a problem meeting quotas, but Wells Fargo keeps pushing for more. Which is why a lot of guys got fired for opening accounts they shouldn't have."
good,Coool place to work at. Fast past enviroment very detailed overtime is optional set schedule and days off but can swap with other team members in the same department as you.
good,working here wasn't bad at all. The only thing i didn't like was the hours and working on Saturdays other than that management was nice and helpful and the pay was AMAZING. Would definitely work here again if I could have different hours
good,"Great company to work for. They help "
good,"I loved my managers here in the SeaTac branch but my only issue was lack of coaching, training, and guidance due to short staffing. It was very hard to seek help with such limited availability of the managers because they were busy with customers due to crazy lines and lack of staff."
good,"WF was a great learning experience, they offerred many training classes and career building exercises. I was able to become a top produces in a short period of time and remained one my entire tenure."
good,Wells Fargo rewards hard work and they do a really good job of promoting from within. They promote a positive culture and they are generous with paid time off. Wells Fargo is flexible with hours so appointments and life can be delt with.
good,"Appreciated by customers but not corporate. Good culture,  good sounding corporate vision,  lots of miss steps and duplicity from upper management though, and loan sales bonuses are a joke"
good,Faced paced and a lot of changes daily with programs and guidelines made it difficult to keep up on mitigating the file accurately.  The quality control department was very critical if there was an error found on the file that did not cause the file to be unsaleable they should work with the staff on making changes not be eager to hit us with findings for small clerical errors.  The management was good as well as the benefits but the job was difficult.  Also allowing the loan officers to get away with unacceptable behavior made it very difficult to preform our job efficiently.
good,Wells Fargo is re-branding and rebuilding their reputation slowly but surely. It will take some time but the employee engagement is still strong overall.
good,"In recent years, Wells Fargo has found themselves in trouble do to some unethical business practices. I can say, that while I was there my department never engaged in any unethical practices."
good,"This company is a great path to a career specially if you are in the business field. "
good,"Enjoyed my tenure with Wells Fargo.  Option to work from home was excellent.  Prior management truly cared about the people that worked there.  Training was available, however, this cut into your production time.  Team Members truly cared about each other."
good,The job was exactly as described. It was fast paced and the earnings potential was pretty much unlimited. I was inexperienced and maybe could have used more coaching. I made money but couldn't handle how repetitious it was.
good,"If you are good at pushing sales then you will enjoy working for Wells Fargo. You are required to meet sales goals, regardless of what they tell you in training."
good,I had the opportunity to work with a very busy loan officer who was able to produce a ton of business for the company to keep us very busy. Was a good corporate company to work for.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Loved my job and my co workers... If I could stay I would.. From my boss to my customers I grew a wonderful relationship with all of them and I'm so grateful to have them in my lifetime.
good,"Work day consisted of 8 hrs, with 1 hour for lunch; all paid holidays and accrued sick time; excellent health, dental and vision benefits; company matched (6%) 401K program"
good,"A typical day would consist of a morning meeting on what we as a team needed to reach as far as a goal but also individually. The workplace itself wasn't bad, but I did not like having to go over something the customer did not initially call in for."
good,I enjoyed working as a teller at Wells Fargo. management is very involved in the teams development and  there is a lot of space for career growth as well.  great job experience if your trying to be part of the banking industry
good,"I loved the sales aspect of the job and how they monitored it with activities and sales tactic meetings. Once the sales stopped due to lawsuits, things got boring and not as fun and goal driven."
good,"I loved the customers, but I didn't like having to try to talk them into sitting with a banker, hoping to get them to open new accounts."
good,"A typical day include interaction with clients that walk in appointment."
good,"I have really been able to grow with WF since I have been here beginning back in 2012 getting my series 6, series 7, series 63, insurance license and notary public. WF really puts a lot of emphasis on training and advancement within the employees."
good,"As a mortgage consultant, my work was totally independent and commission based.  Help was sometimes difficult to get because of the mortgage boom and increased business trend."
good,"check balancing, cash handling data entry. mail sorting,"
good,It’s a good place to start your career but after awhile you do get tired of doing the same thing.. but hey that’s any job.............................
good,The staffing company will continue to lie about  hiring you permanent...I worked 3 they contract to hired after 90days .. no happening.. Asked about a raised then they extended 3 more months .. asked again about permanent.. in less then 2. 1/2 months the job ended whole depaywas laid off ...
good,Overall a great work experience its too bad they are downsizing and consolidating currently. Great people to work with good management teams in my department as well.
good,"little stressful when you had to sell things, but since that is now gone, im sure its a better stressed working place. I liked that if you wanted over time it was readily available to you."
good,Professional yet fun environment. Great place to gain experience in customer service and sales. Make sure you can adapt to change since retail banking is constantly changing.
good,"The Wells Fargo branch I worked at was great. I enjoyed my co-workers and management was pretty good. The hours, pay and benefits were a huge bonus. The branch manager was great when it came to flexibility on scheduling around outside appointments. Overall, a great place to work."
good,Great Work life balance with this Company and Lateral promotion made easy. The company bolsters strong team work. The company could improve its Relationship Building amongst employees to sponsor a more prolific and encouraging work environment.
good,I love the work structure this company provides. They give you all necessary tools to succeed. They make it easy to ask questions and give feedback. Everything you say here is heard and not overlooked.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Very fast pased and unrealistic goals that can't be obtained. Great benefits but very micromanaged. This is the second time I have worked for Wells and I don't like it
good,"Good people to work with, good management, great benefits. Job security was important and maintained throughout the twelve years of working in different positions."
good,"It was a better place to be when it was Wachovia, but when Wells Fargo took over the place just wasn't the same. The people were but clearly the business was lacking the customer service base that Wachovia brought to the market and that I missed dearly. Wells Fargo was still a good place to work and cared about the customer but it was more of a big business place and lost touch with the basics the customer and for that it suffered."
good,"The new WFC (post Wachovia) doubled the size of the company by footprint and employees to 285,000. There is so much opportunity, its hanging out in the aisles. Do clean business, outshine in the personality and networking department and work harder than anyone else in eyesight (if you have it in you), you will become a screaming success...."
good,A very competitive environment. Cut throat sales expectations. Otherwise the cultural atmosphere is great. Was often the only black in my branch though.
good,"high volume traffic "
good,"Good Management but, bad managers (Team leads and Asst.Managers)."
good,"The people that I worked with were very nice. The work pace was steady. Overall, as long as you completed your work and maintained good attendance, then"
good,"•	Meet and greet customers, answer questions, plan and handle events"
good,"Great place to work most positions our contract, so you may or may not get hired for a  full time role , after 18 months the contract expires and you will either need to apply internally or find another role"
good,Secure job experience. Multicultural environment. Flexibility depending on what location. Quick advancement if you are determined to grow in your career path.
good,The diversity within this company is amazing.  They truly believe in team work. There are always ways for employees to grow within the company.
good,Worked 3rd shift at Wells Fargo's Distribution Center with a great team.  Loved the team building and overall atmosphere of the work place.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering inbound calls and reviewing their situation.  Based on call would request the following documents to send to me for review which include tax documentation, paystubs, profit and loss statements, hardship letter, and would sent them a packet to complete and once they review the packet they could either contact me back with question or I would also discuss how to fill it out properly to send to underwriting for review.  My goal was to submit up to 20 or more accounts to underwriting per month and bonus was based on accuracy of the documents submitted to underwriting and time it took to receive and submit.  I learned a lot more about multitasking as I worked off three monitors and used excel a lot.  The hardest part of my job was telling customers that were denied a modification that they either has to work out a plan to resolve the delinquency of their mortgage or look at either short sale of their home or selling it on their own.  The most enjoyable part of this job was when I was able to get their account up to date with new payments and resolve their mortgage."
good,On a typical day I would cut and split checks to balance escrow accounts in all county and states that had Wells Fargo as a mortgage lender. I had to pay attention to detail and use problem solving.
good,I enjoyed my time at wells fargo. It was a great learning experience. I had two amazing managers. I would recommend working for them if you are just getting started in banking. The company does expect you to keep a certain sales goal in mind. They are also intense about customer service
good,"I only worked here as an intern in Chicago for three months. I got good experience and was introduced to a smaller sect of Wells Fargo's wealth management area. I was the youngest person in the office by at least ten years, so I did not often communicate with many people. I think the hardest part was not having anyone to relate to, but on the bright side that allowed me to solely focusing on advancing in my role. I took it very seriously and helped with putting together portfolio reviews and marketing material. I helped manage a database of about 150 clients, but because I was only there for a few weeks I did not have the opportunity to work with clients."
good,"When I began my contract I was told that it was a permanent position however the first day of employment, it turned out to be a temporary position,"
good,Making 20+ cold  calls to customers to set appointments for financial review of their account. Most enjoyable is working with people.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,They absolutely have the best training program and lead source available.  My management and support team locally were the best.  They provided all the resources and marketing materials you need to be successful.
good,Excellent place to work with a great mix of culture and diversity.  Learn how to develop my skills in selling and interaction between customers.
good,I was not there long enough would have like to stayed on longer.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Wells Fargo, they are always willing to work with you and get you the time off you need. A typical day at work would just be running transaction for customers, providing excellent customer service, and talking with customers about beneficial banking products. There is just a lot or pressure from management that i always didn't enjoy but over all great people to work for. The hardest part of the job for me personally was the sells. The best part was being able to chat with customers and get to know new people."
good,"work with a great team of bankers and tellers"
good,Great place to work. A little too pushy with sales but overall great benefits and some people are just too picky. Too much favortism...Mostly about who you know then what you know for a job advancement.
good,"*Customer interaction with mortgage accounts "
good,"Wells Fargo is a very fun, friendly and very productive place to work."
good,"After training I left the company, I was forced to push people into doing things with their money by what was good for the company and not the consumer."
good,I have learned about credit cards benefits and disadvantages through my work on this company
good,"My typical day at work is opening the branch, doing my security check, doing my dual control duties, counting the vault and getting the other tellers their cash for the day, pulling the night depository drop for the morning, greeting customers, making deposits, cashing checks for customers, randoms cash counts on teller cash drawers, pulling the night depository for the evening, counting the vault for the end of the day, selling cash to the vault from the tellers. closing procedures. I have learned the importance of dual control duties. My management likes to train you if they feel you have the potential. My co- workers are easy to get along with and fun to work with. The hardest part about my job is not being able to help all customers with the banking needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to enact with my customers everyday and make them feel comfortable with knowing they had someone they can trust with their finances."
good,"Wells fargos training progam taught me a lot about costomer service and how to treat people, my coworker were all very nice and helpful management was understanding and very hepfull, the hardest part was there was none there traning is vey easy to understand,The most enjoyable was helping costomers with there accounts."
good,amazing job for entry level candidates learn alot about sales and developing operations
good,Great company stable and secure. They are good. They are great. They are fantastic.
good,It was a tough time for bankers when I worked there. The bankers were moved around quite a bit.
good,Hard working employees; busy. Wells Fargo Advisors is very family friendly. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was nothing but helpful when it came to any issue at all.
good,"Great team members, culture and office. Would definitely work for them again. Like every place there’s always room for improvement. Benefits were great."
good,Good place to work for. Wells Fargo does work with the team members very well. Great benefits and some room for growth. We are on the phone with customers to resolve any issues with there online password. Not enough team meetings regarding the company changing work place.
good,"Stressful"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"If you are the type of person who is good at educating others, and solving service complaints (dealing with horrible attitudes), then you can make good money with this company and have a successful career"
good,You deal with sensitive issue since you're dealing with money. Wells Fargo wants to make every customers' experience enjoyable as possible and tries their best to offer their services to them.  They train their employees to serve the customers.
good,"Currently a lot of downsizing which is giving an opportunity to look outside of company. "
good,"Company has a relaxed working environment, my manager was definitely understandable, if I had to go back to that job I would!"
good,The pay was good. When you first get the job it seems like a good place to work. Once you get comfortable it seems to get a little more stressful. ok!
good,It's a lot different now. But back when I worked there it was a little intense sometimes but not always. It all depends if you like talking to people and meeting new faces.
good,The sales goals used to be ridiculous but since they've eliminated them it's a lot less stressful. The management is pretty good and I love my coworkers
good,It was a good with great benefits only thing I didn't like is how they didn't care about your life outside of the job they had horrible hours they wouldn't work around my kids schedule.
good,I loved the structure of being a teller. The pay was great and the hours were wonderful. I loved getting training from them. Some of the best customer service training I've ever received.
good,"Wells Fargo is all about training and helping you to succeed. If you are interested in working for a financial institution, they will help you to advance the corporate ladder."
good,"•	Having conversations with customers and conducting detailed financial reviews to them succeed financially."
good,Awesome job managers not to friendly but I love Wells Fargo it's a good company to work for nice environment get to build long time relationship with your customers
good,I enjoy the co-workers and have fun talking to the customers. I learned ways to do sales different and ways to build customer service. It being so far away is the hardest part of the job because i live an hour away from where i work.
good,Great job to have for a career. Not so great if you are a full time student. Defiantly great with advancement and compensation. Fun place to work with different competition and ways to help selling aspects. Great way to learn to sale and develop customer service skills. Loved management and crew.
good,This job has shown me another part of customer service. Each day I handle numerous cash transactions while conversing with many people from different cultures. My co-workers and I try to remain very relaxed in what can be a very stressful environment. We remain professional but never forget to have fun. The hardest part of the job would be finding products for the clients.
good,"On the phone the entire shift dealing with customer banking issues.  Management prefers to put a time limit on each call, which in turn ends up making the customer feel like they are not valued.  I constantly took too much time with customers, I did not want them to leave until they confirmed their issue had been resolved.  Even though I ranked poor in my limiting the time spent with each customer, I was constantly being rewarded because those customers would request to speak to a supervisor and would praise me for the time I took to help resolve their issue(s)."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting"
good,"was a great place to work for however I was let go because they said I didn't call 1 dealership however I call all of my dealers unless not too. I also use to go above and beyond as I other dealers would call me even though they were not in my territory. they stated that they would rather deal with me then there assigned leander and my immediate manager knew I was railed roaded and didn't go to court so I would still get unemployment t that time. manager stated I was a very hard worker who always showed up on time,never called out sick and was the ultimate team player,. I was a pleasure to work with according to my manager and peers alike.that year was 2008. found out later they let the whole department go 2 months later"
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. Its fun but also serious at the same time. They take care of their employees as well as their customers to the best of their ability. A typical work day at Wells Fargo would be giving the best customer service to each customer, solving their problems as needed, as well as helping them in any way that we possibly can. I have learned so much when it comes to figuring out problems on my own, being able to give the best customer experience to each customer. The hardest part of the job is not being able to do something for the customer like they want it. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help the customer, getting to know the customers, as well as helping them save money!  The people that I have worked with at Wells Fargo have always been friendly and very welcoming. Never have I felt unwelcomed at Wells Fargo! They are all their to help you grow in a way so that you can advance in you're career !"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I learned a lot at wells fargo."
good,A typical day a work includes holding a short motivational meeting with your team members and setting a daily goal and working hard towards reaching that goal. I learned that everyone can not be managed the same way. One must understand their employees. Management was great. My co workers were great. The hardest part of my job was the outbound sales calls.
good,"·    Received my level 1C underwriting for DE"
good,"Working for Wells Fargo has many benefits such as; Many challenges you face on a daily basis forcing it to be frustrating at times although rewarding as you do gain a tremendous amount of  knowledge.  Self motivating, very hard working and enjoy helping the many customers we have to provide them with our financial services.  The most difficult part of my job is the software, location, lack of training and communication."
good,great hands on training
good,"Was my first real job. Great leadership, great coworkers, great opportunity to get started in my career. They provide excellent benefits and very great understanding of work/life balance. Didnt realize how great it was until i moved on"
good,It is difficult to move up to the level that matches your experience if you start lower than your expertise level within this company as they only allow you to move up one level at a time.
good,Wells Fargo was going thought changes in 2008 with the economy being unstable with home mortgages getting refinance. Over all great company would recommend anybody who loves sale and likes bonus check.
good,I appreciate everything I have offered and also I earned but I wish for the opportunity to advanced or be trained more. It’s wasn’t good enough to be let go when I was trying my best to help out so I wouldn’t be terminated and that was all that happened I didn’t get any chance to fix what happened to me at Wells Fargo.
good,Wells Fargo is a good working place but my specific manager was very nosey about my personal life and would harass me until she got her answers about my personal life.
good,As a teller you're expected to sell bank products to each and every customer.   The sales goals can be high and they must be reached
good,Loan Servicing Specialist and Mortgage Analyst responsible for maintaining quality customer service to Borrowers and Lenders. Provide exceptional Administrative support to department staff and Executives.
good,"I worked for WF just under two years. I really enjoyed my job helping bankers and customers! the environment is very conducive to your own personal work flow, and the culture of WF is great! Very inclusive, and very friendly. The managers all have a genuine want to help their subordinates to succeed. The programs to help those struggling is definitely helpful! To work for Wells, is to have great friends as well! I made several great friendships and continue communication with them! The job itself is not for everyone necessarily for everyone. it can be stressful finding the right answers and quickly especially with an on edge banker on your line. One MUST be able to multitask with this job, or one will fail! But it can be really rewarding, and the job carries with it, many great benefits. The only issue is wiht the scheduling, with my particular needs, I needed immediate schedule change for custody issues, and that is not how their program works. Schedule changes come when they come, not always when you need them to, which ultimately forced me to seek alternative employment. Everything else about this job makes it worth it if you can work around that."
good,"This review has already been completed previously for Wells Fargo, I have nothing new to say.  Great place  to work, co-working was great and work day is always busy and productive"
good,"Raleigh location has a great atmosphere and a lot of opportunities to gain exposure.  I have been with the company for 3 years and have made progress with public speaking, leadership.   Currently our underwriting department is experiencing a lot of overtime due to increased productivity which does not give much job work/life balance but I enjoy what I do and enjoy the peers I am around."
good,Great customers friendly employees with a passion for banking. Managers very well trained with a passion increase business and believe in their products.
good,Helping people with there financial needs and offering great benefits for everyone in need.
good,Very good benefits and pay. Promotion in the company is very realistic all positions in upper management are in house promotions. Very busy pace atmosphere expect to take 80 - 110 calls daily.
good,Enjoyable working environment with a very structured culture. Great leaders and diverse culture. Enjoyed the professional atmosphere but due to organizational realignments I was displaced. They offered me a temporary assignment to retain my years of service and allow me time to find a permanent position. Great opportunity and flexibility.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Very stressful job due to customer always be unhappy with the bank in general however the people who work are the best and create a very diverse atmosphere.
good,I was hired with a temp company in Frederick MD. The job was simple and there were opportunities to grow. The only problem my assignment ended. I would apply again.
good,"I would love to go back into the banking field, a good company that I would be able to grow and learn with.Working Full time is a plus."
good,Love the culture but not the work itself. Managers are great everyone is friendly and caring. I do not like sitting for 8 hours. They will accommodate you if you need it but still very sedentary.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, great bonus structure, friendly co-workers, great salary, great work schedule. steady work flow. Great  management and co-workers."
good,Wells Fargo was a great learning experience and the best way to get my foot in the door within the banking industry.  Within the year and half i was working at Wells Fargo i was promoted once.
good,Good job. Met great people there. Still my best friends. Clients were dealership employees so it was a little tough to enjoy my daily tasks. Not a fan of smooth talkers
good,Committed to your success and job advancement this was a great experience.
good,• Entering and cancelling Mortgage Loans
good,I have enjoyed working at the world's best bank and no doubt the best bank I've worked at.  This is a company that makes a difference in lives everyday.
good,I loved it. I work for west asset management but I worked for wells Fargo under them. We would call customers and try to get to to make there loan payments
good,Good Place to work with good benefits. Lacks a workplace culture. During the time a worked there everything was about numbers and results. Zero balance between work and life.
good,"Great team members, terrible management. No room for growth. Learned how to gauge customers reactions and feelings by their body language and learned how to be proactive, multitask and utilize sense of urgency."
good,Lack of proper training when dealing high volume of trades. The employees where very nice and the culture of the office was fun. The manager was very by the book.
good,"Its poorly managed, incompetent, under staffed, consumers cant stand working with wells fargo and I dont blame them. Its all corporate and peopel are just numbers, even the ""lifers"" cant wait to retire."
good,My experience working at a retail branch was not very good. The management in place didn't care about the employee if you were not giving them good numbers.
good,worked has a teller doing deposits withdrawals bank checks and providing execellent customer service to all clients that came and out of the bank .....
good,"the management team in Westborough, MA were lacking communication skills, direction and focus. I didn't feel as part of team, but more like someone always trying to shine, and not being recognized. Very poor team moral and encouragement. No room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work: on the phone with loan processor to clear conditions, hopefully call on Realtors."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"productive, dislike that the managers are not proffesional most of the time, the faces are not friendy and if there is an issue is loudly known, i wish there was more opportunity to grow"
good,"13 years total for me, the first 5 were GREAT then the whole dept was let go (sub prime wholesale ops) Relocated and went on until 2012, state to state, position to position, then came back in 2013 and was let go 2015 because i had a medical issue and only had short term disability."
good,I didn't like being stationary and taking calls for the majority of the day. Management really cared about call statistics and numbers. Very helpful employees.
good,This was a great place  to work and made me happy to go to work each day. The people I worked with was a great bunch of people and they made it enjoyable for me.
good,Strong company but old and set in its ways.  Heavy handed when it comes to maintaining customer service standards but poor in responding to workers concerns and well being. Rigid corporate culture with little incentives for employees or resources to help achieve success.  Management is ofter times bullying and condescending with little regards to the emotional considerations of its employees.
good,great company. nothing bad to say just left for better career growth and higher compensation. But it's a great avenue for learning. The people are typicall of any BPO set up but the company is an in-house facility so it is directly managed and operated by Wells Fargo itself. No third party outsourcing company like CVG or Sitel. Pays better than any typical BPO in manila but not enough for people like myself who has bigger dreams. I just chose to follow my passion and my career in a country with greener pasteur. This company gave me all the experience i need in the BPO set up to move on to greater things. Thank you still. I am grateful for the experience.
good,"Typical job, management needs work, most of the schedules are good after you have been there at least a year. No job security. I learned a lot about mortagages."
good,"I started here and should have listened to the advice to continue moving up in positions and pay, they are so focused on internal promotion and growth that they put people in leadership roles who do not have the appropriate level of professionalism, leadership skill or training and i think this was why everyone i know left including myself."
good,Wells Fargo is a excellent place to start a Finance career. The company provides plenty of avenues to pursue Banking and lays a solid foundation for future executives.
good,"What can i say , Nothing. Job security sucks. If they don't like you they will kick you of to the curve even your the number 1 sales provider to the branch"
good,"Very messy environment to work in , As they say ""more money more problems"" pay is the worst 12.75 to deal with peoples attitudes all day ? No thanks !"
good,"Very fast paced with high focus on sales. Sales are first and customers are second. If you do not get the sale you're questioned as to why you didn't, even if the reason why is because there was no need for a sale or the customer did not want to have a sales conversation"
good,"Wells believe in the vision and values just as strongly today as we did the first time we put them on paper, and staying true to them will guide us toward continued growth and success for decades to come"
good,My team is awesome they are more like family and my manager is really cares about each and everyone of us. However the job is way to stressful for the pay. The moving up process is not realistic and it is extremely hard to advance within this company. The negatives tend to out way the motivating factors that would make anyone want to stay.
good,The assignment provided were long term and stable. However due to the number of temp workers the recruiters do not have enough time to address personal issues that occur on a day to day basis.
good,"its a Hispanic community ."
good,"I mostly had autonomy at my position."
good,"During a typical work day at Wells Fargo, I interact with customers and deal a lot with cash. I see a lot of people in my day and they all have different things that need to be taken care of. "
good,I loved working at Wells Fargo. Overall good company with decent benefits. Good culture amongst employees. lots of overtime available.
good,The disappointment about retail banking is that unless you know someone at the top chances are you will get passed up on promotions. It also won’t help if the bank is the farthest location in district meaning you won’t get much time with supervisor. It’s all political and unfortunately lot of managers breaking policy and not being held accountable. Don’t apply in retail banking. Get a back office job.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,If yo works for this company you are ok being just a number not a person. I worked for the company several years and never even got a birthday card while management got a party every birthday
good,"I enjoy helping my clientele and building relationships. As well being a resource customers need. Most of all, having clients refer friends in to meet with me to suit their needs."
good,Will invest in their team members. Strong sales culture. Great starting point for a career to take off since you learn so many fundamentals of running a business.
good,"The company is so large that it is impossible to group the firm into one review.  For instance, one project may go smoothly, while in a few months you may have a completely incompetent team.  "
good,"Developmental, but alot of unseen hard determined work. Let go at a drop of a dime, after giving close to 9 dedicated years to the company. To pro customer vs business unit."
good,It is a good company but no direction. too many complicated project but no clear direction . It was a good experience overall . large company which has 260000 people
good,The commission is low but with so many customers you can always find business. The management is focused on themselves not on actually helping you personally grow.
good,"The staff was nice.  Friendly atmosphere.  Hoped to advanced, but management would not let me change departments.  Disappointed in their leadership for advancement."
good,I would say if your looking for a stepping stone to learn business practices and be trained for the field your wanting this would be the company for you
good,Overworked and then team laid off. Good coworkers but not the best direct manager.  Good benefits and pay. Definitely not allowed a good work/life balance.
good,"Love work was WF.  Nicest group of people you have find.  No blame situation rather we made a mistake, lets fix if and then move a long."
good,close by home so that was great. Was my return to securities biz after being out of it for several years. Mgr good guy but knew little about the art and mechanics of selling
good,"The basic day in my role was coming into work logging into all my systems and begin taking calls, I helped customers with their bank accounts, over draft fees etc. The hardest part about the job definetly has to be the in ability to move. I am an on my feet person so the extended sitting really gets to me. The best part is the environment, Everyone is really friendly the managers are really understanding."
good,Left for inconsistent management. Many managers came to our location but were all untrained. There was no training among tellers either. It seemed like we were more of bodies than actual people.
good,I thought it was an okay place to work for someone out of school. I dont think that the goals given were achievable. I think that there was too much pressure put on employees to open accounts.
good,"every company is good place to work. It depends on the management, if and when you manager hires you that means he or she liked you but when they change the management and if he or she does not like you for apparent reasons, they can find a way to terminate you. Companies are ruled by the managers and they act with race, age and looks."
good,"After a series of revelations dealing with 3+ million zombie accounts having been created in order to meet sales quotas,  (2) executives leaving under a cloud with $24 million and $149 million in benefits after having it become known that they knew of the account issue for up to 5 years, while boldly stating that we strive for customer satisfaction and every on must preserve and increase the brand.  It seems that they really need to work on rebuilding their company culture"
good,"Im sure most companies like to hire from within, but the issue I had with WF was that when hiring within, only the friends of the hiring managers were usually taken into account. This lead to unqualified people being put in position they were unable or didn't want to take seriously. Being such a big company, people would fall through the cracks making it difficult to remain positive after training in several roles."
good,"Pay is subpar and work-life balance sucks. I was deceived about working from home more often than allowed. I was led to believe that I would have more work from home days, but only to find out it is one day a month. I took this job in hopes for less driving as I drive 2-3 hours minimum per day for work. This drive for four years has taken a toll on my health and well being."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,After the lawsuit you were stuck in role with no room for growth. Paid time off is good. Benefits are really good and you get a lot of discounts with Wells.
good,Fun place to work.  Very stressful job to meet management set goals.  Tons of travel between branches.  Would have loved to continue my employment with WF but they closed down the area.
good,"Assisted employees with signing up for their yearly benefits. Answered questions regarding meidcal, dental and vision services, as well as the prices and differences of each plan."
good,The company provides at least average income for the employees.  Depending on the site holidays can also be very good.  Several business offer incentives.
good,They were great to work for and to work with. They were kind and family friendly people. They were very kind and easy to work for. Their clients were also very easy to work for.
good,There is opportunity for advancement and good compensation for reaching goals for credits and product solutions. Not a bad place to start your career.
good,"Stayed busy answering phones, faxing, taking messages, processing paperwork. I learned how to follow difficult people. Management was younger and I felt as though they saw themselves as superior at times. Hardest part of the job was working on a fly without any training to cover for someone who had quit."
good,I work with WF for 7 months and i can say it was the most stressful time ever. If you want a job that does not pay well and isnvery stressful then this is the job for you!
good,"very hard to work with inexperienced managers"
good,great job security just a lot of little things built up to cause anxiety such as over the top sales goals that were unrealistic as well as inter office termoil
good,"Wells Fargo is a nice place to work. I don't choose to review the company at this time. The location and commute are nice. The companies amenities are unlike other centers. You need to bring your own plastic ware, plates, bowls etc. The benefits are however good."
good,"I luckily applied at a busy store so there was never any time to feel bored"
good,"My experience was poor at best, I liked what I did but I felt that they didn't live up to he help they promised and left us with out answers for there customers. Working area was nice and the over all facility was very nice."
good,The job eventually becomes tedious and easy to become burnt out in
good,A typical day consists of back to back phone calls to build cases for the investigators on fraud claims.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo. However, as my life style changed Wells Fargo's stringent policies where unable to meet my family obligations."
good,Answer 70 to 80 calls a day. Work with multiple programs on the computer. Answer questions regarding their credit card account. Take payments. Refer products or services that will benefit the customer. The hardest part of the job was dealing angry customers. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers and made some good friends.
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo PMB. However, they laid off  myself and another 3,000 people. They let go of team members that had been employeed with the company for over 25 years. I am very sad and disappointed. I thought that working for a HUGE corporation equaled stabilty and growth. It seems as though I was wrong."
good,"My typical work day includes meeting face to face with borrowers and/or speaking to them over the phone discussing their home loan options. I gather all information that's needed to process and approve a refinance or to purchase home including income documentation, credit, identification, assets etc and everything to do with getting a loan submitted and approved,  I work closely with the underwriter and closer to insure we make it to the closing table successfully and in a timely manner. My work atmosphere is great. The most enjoyable partof my job is teh service aspect, I LOVE dealing with people and to know I've made a dream or two come true by saving someone money on a refinance or helpping them move into tehir dream home truly warms my heart and kepp me coming back every day. The hardest part is knowing your worth as an employee and although you enjoy what you do you know there is not much opportunity for change or advanacement and I'm looking for bigger and better opportunities."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Supervised, trained, motivate and evaluated personnel to ensure achievement of the best financial productivity for customer’s assets. Responsible for requirement screening of new hires. "
good,little to no training. Difficult to understand what was required of you. 
good,great place for advancement. But was set on sales that can get very difficult at times. I was not a big fan of management because of sales performances. I was not happy there.
good,"retail position, open normally M-F, customer service oriented."
good,"Great pay and benefits. Bonus and OT. 55 hour work weeks and travel home, hotel, and food allowance."
good,I learned a lot about cash handling and laws concerning money. This was a job that was strictly sales oriented and drove sales above everything else. I was really disappointed in the lack of customer service due to the extreme pressure of sales.
good,Very unorganized bk department always understaffed and undergoing departmental changes
good,"Too much work, not enough individual level benefit/compensation packages available."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to work for, they have great benefits and some of the people who work their are amazing people. The only down fall I would have to say was their some of their management and how they train employees after the training period."
good,"good products - poor management.  Mortgage management had no experience in originating loans, yet they are responsible for Loan Officers.  Good selection of products."
good,We don't get paid enough for what we do! some of the  Management has favorites from time to time and some get away with not hardly working while there are others constantly working
good,People getting hired new are making the same as or more than someone with the company for over 8 years  service managers are egregiously under appreciated and under compensated
good,"This is a great bank to work, however it depends on which branch you are assigned. Each branch is completely different and managers are very different but very knowledgable you learn a lot about banking."
good,"Wells is a great company but the management is very poor. The people that are in leadership positions need more training. It's not the entire company but it makes you question how did they become a manager. On the other hand, the benefits are amazing."
good,"Just be open to change and all will fall in place. Be helpful to others. Understand why you are taking certain actions. "
good,Needs more attention to overall employee and seniority should be awarded.   The culture in certain departments leave s no room for errors or mistakes.
good,It was an OK place to work.  The technology division was operating a bit behind the curve and they always blamed it on not being a technology company..
good,"Pay and benefits is lesser when compared to other major banks. Advancement is highly competitive, based on relationships rather then actual experience"
good,"On paper, Wells is an excellent company with great benefits but (at least in my district) the upper management often leaves a bad taste due to favoritism and poor communication and lack of general management skills."
good,"Wells Fargo provides banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance services. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I was able to learn a lot here but in order to make a decent salary you'll have to leave and come back with more experience. The work/life balance is excellent and the work environment is generally laid back.
good,"They closed the branch otherwise I would have stayed.  It was a good group of people."
good,"From a contractor's perspective, Wells Fargo is a good place to work. Deadlines could make it pretty stressful at times. There is always a lot of management changes which makes it hard to reach the right contacts. It is hard to keep important documentation up to date because processes and procedures are always changing."
good,Each day was different in the amount of work there was to be done because it all came in from the job queue. Sometimes there was only 20 items and sometimes there would be 80 items to be done. The management didn't always take the time to actually listen to you or help make a decision. The hardest part of the job was getting it done on time and the most enjoyable part of the job was getting it done.
good,"It's a good company but advancement are way too competitive and almost impossible. They made it seem like it was guaranteed, but failed to mention that I would have to compete with branch managers and service managers that decided to step down or were demoted.  The vacation time is great, but you have to use for any missed hours and that includes if you are sick. Health insurance is ridiculously expensive!"
good,There is really noi feed back Id like to give great company. Room for growth but culture can be very low and management is extremely unorganized. Other than that no complaints
good,"I has been a while since I've worked at Wells, so the culture may have changed. It was quite competitive when I was working there and unfortunately the ""Good ol' boys"" network mentality was present"
good,stressful at times understaffed drama lazy banker and extra drama late manager disrespectful at moments also and lots of work and things  to keep up with causing pay
good,"I really enjoyed that they give you time off to take right from the get go. Its important to them employees take care of themselves and family. "
good,It is a repetitive position day in and day out not much excitement or change happens very little possibility for advancement and most days You feel pressured into making the company happier than making the customer have air
good,"They sold off their insurance division to USI and are no longer in the market. Good company in the beginning, however, at that time they had challenges with management."
good,"Great place to work.  I enjoyed meeting new customers and business owners and being able to help them with their needs.  The hardest part of the job is to tell a customer  their loan was not approved, specially  when they have worked extremely hard trying to grow their business."
good,"progression is slow and more desirable if moving around from bank to bank, more inclined to hire outside Wells Fargo. Bonuses are lacking for the amount of work needed."
good,"Tough I worked as a contractor. It was a great leaning experience working at client site. Collaborated with fellow UX designers, business analyst, developers and project managers to convey the vision, flow and feature of a Tax resolution software."
good,"As a contractor and not an FTE, I would not feel comfortable writing a review.  I would think you would only want fulltime employees taking advantage of this."
good,"The company was in the beginning of a culture shift.  Management was okay and for the most part they had your back when it came to promotions, etc.  even though the decision goes up the chain of command."
good,"There were many changes made while working at Wells Fargo.  As time went on, things became much stricter for the employees.  They did away with the laid back environment, and eventually wanted to be   a focused on nothing but work for the entire time of your schedule.  Then they changed the schedule my last year employed there, and I didn't have any family to help with my child, and I advised the supervisor of this, and his response was, You will work it out.  There was no sympathy for my situation at that time.  Therefore I had to look elsewhere for a different job. There was no work life balance.  They wanted our lives to revolve around the job."
good,branch was very sales driven.  To the point that manager forced employees to do unethical business practices like giving products to clients that did not need so to increase sales revenue.
good,"Required to get all checks though the system at night for clearance and the next banking day, Count not leave until all checks were done though the clearing house"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Company is in transition. We just had layoff and our reputation is very poor at best. We don't have a lot of opportunities for advancement. The directions from senior leadership is also questionable, we also have been fined several millions of dollars."
good,"Connected across many different business lines across the firm.  Learned project management and organizational skills while utilizing the vast array of resources provided by the firm.  The hardest part of the job was the imbalance of work duties allocated among the team, navigating the workplace politics, and the limited opportunity for advancement.  The most enjoyable part of working there were the benefits, competitive compensation, and ability to deliver a high quality brand to the Institutional consumer."
good,"Never met my manager, always had to work on weekends, this is a call center job, with typical call center challenges.  It was never dull because we were in a small room with all the people who you've known since training.  Plus, the customer calls were quite interesting."
good,Direct Manager is terrible. Creates a stressful and inconsistent work environment for everyone. Usually problems are only handled by reaching out to the anonymous HR telephone line.
good,Site was downtown Mpls. Easy to find good lunch spots. Right on the bus route from my Extended Stay room. Nice to go to Twins Games after work and still get a bus to my room.
good,"The pay is great at the call center however their expectations to meet your bonuses and goals are unrealistic, basically had to shove sales down every customers throat."
good,"Yes.. the sale culture of yesteryear at Wells Fargo was horrible - employees where pressured for everything which made great team members leave. the management team now are the bankers who engaged in the wrong sales practice but the company will not recognize it."
good,It was a great experience working at Wells Fargo with a very diverse team and environment where I had the opportunity to learn and grow as an intern. The job was very enjoyable and everyone that I had the opportunity to work with was very friendly and accepting.
good,"Typical day was 9-5, come in and perform outbound and inbound phone calls, and take payments, for the collections department, learned how the computer system functioned, and how to get the client to make payments to get out of collections.  Management was good, but the Collections Manager/Director did not actually know what was going on, as he/she relied on the supervisors to provide informational, and the supervisors had their favorites."
good,"Many phone calls a day, where you were timed at how long you were on the call, They trained you thoroughly and expected you to inform the call of benefits available to them. If you did not meet their standard of transfers, you could be fired. On the other hand if you did meet the amount required, you received a bonus. They gave bonuses every month if you earned it. There was daily over time required right up until the Milwaukee site closed"
good,Wells Fargo is a excellent employer who provides opportunities for career advancement if you are willing to relocate. The work place has changed drastically since the news broke of sales integrity.
good,"During my time at Wells Fargo (9 plus years) I was given the opportunity to help customers with their financial needs.  I had many great relationships along the way.  But unfortunately poor incentive plans, poor culture led me to look elsewhere.  I have heard that they are working hard to improve this these days.  I sure hope so."
good,"They want bench strength, huge on teaching and helping you learn if you look for it.  Huge on volunteering and over all a good company to work for.  It is very fast pace, competitive and you need to stay on your toes at all times."
good,"It seems very hard to obtain a permanent full time position. Most jobs come via a recruiter. The employees are wonderful to work with, but with revolving contracts, there is not much continuity."
good,"Wells Fargo provides great training and advancement opportunities, however their reputation has been damaged by a sales culture driven by a performance compensation structure that drove certain people to make unethical decisions that did not have the customers best interest in mind.  While I did not partake in this culture and still was able to excel in my goals and my career without doing the wrong thing for the customer, the reputation being damaged has made acquiring more business difficult.  The culture has shifted to one in which you deal with angry and difficult customers frequently.  This is a skill that is good to have but this is not something I want to do all the time."
good,Expand mortgage opportunities in DFW so there will be room for advancement. There are many qualified mortgage professionals that don't have the opportunity to use their talents.
good,Wells Fargo offers great benefits! I enjoy working for Wells Fargo! I have learned a lot working for Wells Fargo. I wish I could move farther up the ladder but there is no room for advancement.
good,"As a full time employee with Wells Fargo I normally work 7:45-5:15 Monday through Friday. Working face to face with customers while helping process deposits, withdrawals and payments. In my position I help management preform many different tasks. Most of the employees there are great to work with, but every so often there is one or two that do not work well with the team. My most enjoyable part of the job is that I get to build relationships with the customers and help them with concerns or questions they have about banking."
good,I enjoy working for the company but there is not enough compensation. The people are very nice but the moral is not very high.
good,Great company. Has to go through the ranks to move up.  A typical day at work .Finding  solution for customers financial needs. While building and fostering old and new relationships. Working together with team  through coaching and mentoring where necessary.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo Dealer Services developed as a result of mergers.  I was initially hired by WFS Financial.  The culture was extremely family oriented and everyone within the company knew each other personally or knew of them.  Within weeks of being hired, the WFS signage came down and Wachovia Bank was put in its place (I was aware of this when I was hired).  Despite the shift, the company culture remained the same (close-knit) and employees felt supported, therefore it felt like business as usual. Large growth was imminent and as employees we prepared for it. It was a perfect opportunity for advancement if you were seeking it.  After the purchase of Wachovia by Wells Fargo, we were surprised to learn that the Wachovia business model was being kept and the Wells Fargo auto finance model would be phased out. This placed a veil of  strain on operations thereafter (red tape).  All in all, and for the most part, work never differed for me as a great place to work alongside my colleagues and achieve greater goals together.  My goal has been and always will be to fairly empower those whom I work with and share with them the knowledge that assisted me in obtaining my goals initially so they, too, can succeed."
good,"Collected on past due car payments"
good,I was responsible for originating and processing loans from beginning to end and collecting all required documents and assisting banks with customer relations
good,Very fast paced in an ever changing industry. Deadline driven so lots of overtime was available and you were compensated fairly.
good,Unique experience. Very different from what I was accustomed too.
good,"Between the mortgage industry downturns and poor decisions by leadership, the company has taken consequential action toward team members who were more than loyal through the rough patches. "
good,"Worked mostly on teller line, always overachieved goals. Wachovia awesome, learned my beginning banking knowledge from co workers and management. Unfortunately Wells Fargo operated completely different. When banks merge they did not hire within, which forced currently employees to stay in positions."
good,"Good place to work. Heavy sales oriented, jobs. Strict goals. Be ready to sell a to and often."
good,"It was enjoyable working with my fellow workers. I made many long term friends that I still have. Wells Fargo is a good institution, especially in the loan department. I enjoyed closing escrows and drawing up mortgages."
good,"Must be prepared to meet or exceed intense sales goals set by company. Co-workers make the job worth-while, while the sales pressure can be overboard at times. Customer service is very important with Wells Fargo culture as well as sales."
good,"This is a good place to work; however, the department I worked seemed to be vendor controlled."
good,"you will speak with about 75-100 customers on average per day, expected to have sales referral rate of 30% or higher and a warm transfer to sales rate of 12% or higher while maintaining an average talk time (AHT) of 260 seconds or lower. The hardest part of the job is the stress of sales and the demand to reach the quota at the end of the day, and the lack of proper communication throughout the departments."
good,"look for a company i can grow with and have stability, not have a revolving door"
good,Management needs to adapt to changes as do their direct reports.  Most are out of touch on what is demanded of their team.  Telling people what to do is not how to motivate a sales team.  Need to tell the why & how to be successful in an ever changing environment.
good,it's not that bad and better than some but not as good as others
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work.  I would not be leaving if I was not relocating to Indiana.  I have meet alot of great people, and have learned much from my managers."
good,"people team up against people they dont like."
good,Mortgage is a tough industry. If you do not have the right leadership/management above you it is very difficult to make a name for yourself.
good," I assisted customers with delinquent mortgages, Updated financials and assisted in skip tracing, data entry, and trying obtain retention options to help keep their homes"
good,Encoding allows you to work in the evening and allows you to build typing skills
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"High demand on sales, hard to split time between tasks, and time selling to customers. Some managers were great, some where difficult. Overall a great experience where I learned a lot."
good,"Enjoyed the branch, and my colleagues. A lot of effort was put into training new employees, and they made you feel needed."
good,"The traffic would pick up at 7am in the motor bank. The lobby area around 1045 am. Mostly simple banking transactions, mostly sitting around waiting for lunch. I learned about banking policies and how they change fairly quick within a month or two time. Management was very standoffish until they got pressure form the top to get more new accounts, credit cards, and online bank customers, which was hard because it is a small town. Plus it made for a a very competitive atmosphere for those who need job security( mostly women in their mid 40s w families) very cutthroat among the ladies. Co workers were nice , but mostly fake with it. everybody in their own world mostly. The hardest part of the job is making sure your cash till balanced at the end of your shift, if its doesnt you have to retrace all of your steps from a 8 hr shift. The easiest is meeting the customers and sharing, while give them great customer service."
good,All day all you heared was hurry up take more calls get your numbers up.
good,"First job i had out of college, was little scared about sol but got the hang of it, would work for them again"
good,"Ok place to work. Could no longer work shift hours requested so I left. During busy seasons phones will ring non stop, so be prepared to talk pretty much 8 hours straight, aside from 30 min lunch and 15 min break"
good,"The job is good for the right kind of person. The branch you work at has a lot to do with how happy you will be. Managemnt can be challenging. You have to work there a LLLLOOONNNGGG time before they will advance you. at least one year or more in each role, no matter how good you are. pay and benefits are great though. great 401(K)"
good,"Not good work life balance. Good benefits and decent pay. Management in my experience wasn’t great but they do have some great managers, you just have to be on the right team."
good,"The job offers great benefits, such as, 401k,PTO, health insurance, etc. Wells Fargo also offers many different work schedules (set schedules) to help accommodate their employees. Though, the job has it's perks it can also be a very stressful and mentally challenging place to work as well with the goals they have set for their phone bankers."
good,"Didn’t stay long enough to fully grasp the work environment and culture since I was just contracted through a temp agency."
good,"Constantly changing working environment that can get frustrating at times due to compnay issues. If you work hard you have the ability to move up, though it is much harder at higher levels. At times management gives mixed messages due to changes and not much clear direction. Can be a fun place to work but ever increasing pressure makes it tough to stay with the company."
good,"Too"
good,"Great place to work for. Takes care of of their employees. Enjoyed working there,  room for growth. Plenty of programs and mentors that will gladly assist in helping you grow. "
good,"People are Friendly, respectful, professional, family oriented.  It was the most enjoyable working place I have ever worked at.  The down side to this, it's only temporary assignment."
good,ok place to work.  did not like being on comminssion.  it was hard trying to overcome the reputation of recent scandals while out in the public trying to get business.
good,Fun and challenging. I worked in mortgage and was not a teller. Fast paced environment with many options to gain new skills. Team oriented and the ability to learn something new each day.
good,It was a great company when I intiallu started but then manager was very rude and she didn’t care about the feelings while dealing infront of the customers.
good,Very fast paced however the management sometimes didn’t help you and communicate with you. Pay is ok but not enough for the cost of living in Denver..
good,Was told this was a temporary to hire position after 3 months they sent us several times to Greenville for training a week at a time they were moving the wholesale division to Winston Salem NC they kept on a trainer from Greenville gave no one a chance to learn everything was taught backwards 5 days before our 90 days they let us go??? weird after spending so much of Wells Fargo money to train us
good,"Work to homelife balance is uneven. Nonspecified upon hire, mandatory overtime and rotating Saturdays off. Detailed, relaxed, team building training. Paid training. Strict late and absence policy."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The people that I have been able to work with and for have been terrific. however the organization is going through an overall and the future opportunities are uncertain at this time.
good,Communications is the greatest challenge the company has to overcome. The support you received from the program leadership is outstanding and provide a friendly work environment.
good,"Company is perfect for highly energetic, self motivated person willing to go the extra mile to get things done.  Its all about following company guidelines while being able to achieve results."
good,"It's an ok job. Nice people, not a lot of room to grow. Opportunities for development and growth are limited from a technologists perspective. Technology is a bit antiquated."
good,"Enjoyed working there the entire time I was there. "
good,"Management didn’t care for culture and team members. Management is very disrespectful always braking dual control.  "
good,"It is a exciting place to work which supplies many challenges. They are very careful about their image to a ridiculous level. Can't throw any paper in the trash, you must shred everything."
good,Management was very poor. No advancement for the hard working top tellers. I was promised a promotion if I exceeded my goals. I was top teller in the state within 3 months. No promotion was given when available.
good,position was ok. however once managers added being on the incoming phone que all day. it was hard to work on our files. when we were working only on our customer files it was a lot harder to get ahold of our files.
good,overall good place to work but management in certain areas are not aliened with company values.  Depends on the area you are working in. I have had good managers and bad managers working for the bank.
good,"My job at Wells Fargo was a full time.  All provider assistants were monitored by ""Blue Pumpkin"".  All provider assistants were audited daily, sometimes by other employees who were. in my opinion not qualified to audit. Breaks & lunches were monitored to the 100th of a second with strict guidelines on when they were to start and end..  Starting times were not always attainable, as you may be on a call with a provider at the time. This job was quite stressful."
good,I liked working here but during this time in my life I was not able to live on an all commission salary.  So I went on and looked for a job with more salary security
good,"I learned a lot about banking, insurance and corporate systems and governance.  There were several merger and acquisitions happening during my tenure that consumed the organization."
good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work for before we became under new management. At this point strenuous deadlines were put on us which caused the majority of the department to be terminated. I was terminated upon returning from short term disability for something that was claimed i done 6 months prior.
good,Currently undergoing significant culture and business model changes.  These are largely good but definitely managing from a place of risk mitigation rather than growth/strength.
good,"It’s a good company to work but management is ok. They don’t really know their people n don’t know what it takes to retain them. "
good,"Its a great place to work if you are not caught up in drama. I had a manager that would not let me advance because he didnt want to take the time to wait for someone else to be trained, even though HR gave the green lihjt."
good,"Before the changes on sales practices, it was a very stressful and competitive work environment, with some co-workers arguing on who gets credit for selling certain products or opening accounts. After eliminating its sales practices it became less stressful and tense but because of the scandals, changes to the policies and procedures were so frequent that it caused confusion among both the employees and management. "
good,"Currently moving towards flex space if wanting to work in an office.  Giving employees more options to work remotely."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Compensation definitely pays for the abuse you're subject to at the hands of customers, but very difficult to accommodate hours. Only management ids off work on the weekends and only management is off work for holidays. My time there we had two paid holidays over the entire year, 4th of July and Christmas, but next year, 2019, our site would have no holidays off whatsoever (with the exception of management)."
good,When I first started working for Wells Fargo the atmosphere was positive and everyone in management seemed to care about taking care of their employees. These days it's a full 180 from when I first started now the only thing anyone in management cares about is numbers numbers numbers.
good,think out of the box; affluent clients with intricate and time consuming details. White glove treatment needed. Satisfaction in learning new methods and conversing with upper management and peers regarding challenges.
good,Was a good place to work until the mortgage industry crashed.  The production forecasters were also off on many occassions.  Impossible to move to another department if your manager didn't want you to move n.
good,I don't believe during the time I worked there that upper management listened to the employees.  The pay was very low in comparison to other banks.  Sales driven environment was extremely heavy.  Number only mattered and not what was best for the customers.  I believe that they could withstand some improvements.
good,"This is a great place to work, steady bankers hours and paid holidays. The training is absolutely wonderful and teaches you everything you need to know about sales."
good,This is not the place for you!  they keep employees that have worked for the firm for years at a much smaller salary than that new employee.  with Maybe 2% pay raises at best.  you can do the math. . .
good,I contracted 3 times at Wells Fargo within great teams with great managers but my current position is far to be as great. It appears we are rowers on a Viking ship with our manager in the back cracking his whip.
good,"My prior work experience was very positive. The supervisor had a hands on leadership style, and created a willing to win atmosphere. Training, and assistance was top notch."
good,"Wells Fargo was a nice company to work for, but I did not work in the best department. Auto Finance was kind of cut-throat. They would hold you to production goal event though the workload was not there"
good,"Experience	"
good,Use to be an ok place to work. Right now I can't recommend the company due to all the lack of transparency at this moment. Overall the company can do better-taking care of their employees.
good,Wells Fargo is in a transitional phase. They are realigning customer processes and strengthening the protections of the consumer.  I believe they will right their ship in the coming years
good,management would play favorites. having  to meet unattainable sales goals.but a clean place to work. not all management was bad some people who have been working there for years do care.
good,A typical workday is whats expected at a banking location such as transactions over the counter or personal transactions handled by bankers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to interact with many different people building relationships while also being able to help them succeed financially.
good,"A typical day at work would be to find out from your team lead the work assigned, possibly assist other departments when your assignment was complete."
good,"Wells Fargo was a hands-on learning experience, and the job was very intricate and knowledge based. The branch I worked in was slow paced, but I did have the opportunity to help out at other faster paced branches, which was also a learning experience. The company consists of a team based atmosphere, where everyone works together and helps each other in any way they can."
good,A decent company to work for. Advancement opportunities were strong in the past but much has changed and in my current environment there is very little.
good,"Good benefits, great Advisors, and the Staff are pleasant to work with. Boise’s Office is fantastic! When I said managers need Improvement  I meant the HUB Managers in Spokane. Not in the Boise, Idaho office. Sadly the salary is terrible. A 2% raise in March (if you get it, no guarantee) does not kick it. I have mouths to feed, insurance to cover, groceries and gas. Very low salaries. Definitely a business for wasting money flying management and brown nosers around unnecessarily  when that’s what conference calling and video conferencing is for.....saving money. Then maybe each branch wouldn’t have to worry about penny pinching and could give their employees what they need. YES, us little ones. We’re the ones doing all the work with little pay while you’re traveling around with a corporate card and not having s care in the world. Fly to a WFA branch ✔️, sitting there all day on your laptop ✔️, acting like you being there has importantance ✔️,  flying back to your brach✔️. What’s the point? Besides this, I personally feel WFA is a great place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good company to work for.  NO longer any sales pressure which alleviates a great deal of stress.  Customer service very important to this company.  Good management
good,"I enjoyed my time at WF, but its who you know, not what you know, so very political, which I disliked. The advancement opportunity wasn't sufficient for me so I am looking to move on."
good,layoffs are frequent. The employees were notified of the upcoming layoffs from the news media. We were told that the position was permanent but it was very temporary
good,Good company with a now new culture.  Upper management can have an agenda and looking to advance their careers regardless of how it affects those in the branches.  At the branch level it is a good place to work.
good,My feeling was with Wells Fargo is that if you did your job well they would not have a need to promote.  It seemed to be very difficult to be promoted even if you were qualified or sometimes overqualified.  It would be advantageous if they would home internal career fairs to increase internal promotions.
good,"I have been here for 3 years and counting. I have loved every moment, however I have only had the pleasure of having 1 manager in which I felt truly cared about her team members. There have been a lot of staffing adjustments and very little room for advancement since then."
good,"Currently working in call center environment. I have never worked in a call center environment. It has been challenging to get used to being attached to the phones all day. Which causes a feeling of being micro managed. Although the call center isn't my cup of tea, I don't mind talking on the phone here and there, just not a fan on being attached to them throughout the whole day."
good,"No complaints about the job itself "
good,Premier Banker role was not what was presented in interview process. Conflicted with branch manager. Was not allowed to seek other internal opportunities that I felt were a better fit even though I worked for the company for 12+ years. Sad ending to an otherwise great career.
good,"Company is way too big to care about it's employees.  Great company to learn banking basics, but it's high stress with little to no support from management.  Sink or swim."
good,"If you are the type to be able to go to work, do 8 hours and not take customer service personally, banker positions pay well at WF. You will have pressure from upper mgt., you will have trouble getting Saturdays off."
good,Pay was poor and only maintained my daily expenses were covered.  I was hired to make certain that the mutual funds were maintained and all the material was good.
good,stressful days. company only cares about meeting their monthly goals. no two people of the same race can sit  by each other on the teller line. management are unprofessional
good,"this department was great, with lots to learn and a lot of impact on customers, which was great. the work was always changing and interacting with many customers was the best part. People in the department were also great."
good,"Job was long hours but fair pay. Research is solitary by nature, so not much collaboration with other groups within the bank. Learned a lot in my time there."
good,"I like working there but it was stress full, work a lot of hours, work had to come first then anything even family, nothing was more important then sale and meeting goals."
good,"sales goal was ridiculous, having to fill 5 buckets each quarter and have two checking accounts everyday was overrated and stressful. may blind phone calls to customers to schedule appointments for sales"
good,The work at Wells Fargo was sometimes good. Sometimes it was not. I work at the Hospital in Fayetteville TN. The management there was very unfair. One guard would set at the desk all night While the rest of us would work security inside and outside the building
good,Being an Investment Management Specialist for the Private Bank was a rewarding experience in learning to develop ones career in wealth management. You work with some of the best analysts and partners on the street to deliver and tailor investment advice to high net worth clientele.
good,Growth has not been easy. Promotions are very rare. Opportunities for internal employees is not the best. Comp is low. Annual increments are very minimal
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I worked for wells fargo before a lot of their changes were made. So then and now im sure there are some significant  changes. Overall really liked working for them.
good,Nothing to say at this time. why because I said so. So this is all I have to say and I don't want to say anything now. But there will be a time where I will say something.
good,"My current assignment has been a great experience."
good,"Good company upper management just wanted to get the work done and then pay off people. "
good,a typical day at work for wells fargo is constant on phones with customers dealling with there bank accounts and there passwords. its none stop fast pace and there is people on top of you if your call goes over 9 mins. its a good place to work for benifits and good friends.
good,"Currently job advancement isn't guaranteed for me , I am a professional currently seeking for a better opportunity in a  well developed and promised career field that will motivate me in a healthy environment with benefits and a motivational team ."
good,"Located in Florida.  Easy going environment and good benefits. "
good,It's very clique like in school if u get along with your manager even if your not good at your position you'll move up if your not good with your manager on a personal lever no matter how good you are you'll rarely advance
good,"Compensation was a huge plus. However, time spent as a Contractor did count toward permanent employment in this role. The Management and team members were very supportive."
good,"Last job was very stressful. put in long hours which included the weekends.. good co-workers, but overall the company does a bad job in selecting poor managers."
good,"started a my banking career with WF and it was very valuable, learned the ins and outs of commercial banking. Would recommend it to anyone looking to get into the industry and wants to learn credit the right way,"
good,"When I was there the bonuses were based on the site success and not individually or team.  I have witnessed many months with no bonus even though I closed over 80 loans.  The management was slow to remove the dead wait and yet, micro managed by creating additional checklists and requirements that had nothing to do with the files."
good,As long as you hit budget you will be ok. They are really about making those calls and getting people on the phone. Be careful of the undercutting of other employees stealing account to make budget.
good,"This job was not stressful. you were able to help your team members. Kind of like they had you on their side shielding them from the supervisors. Not being checked into a phone, being able to come and go as you liked was great."
good,Very stressful workplace. Management plays favorites. Needs better training.  The company is a great company to work for however the management needs improvement.  It's just like any other job when it comes to pros and cons.
good,The company is really stable and gives you a great work place ever! Probably the management to the bank NA is good but the local management makes you feel dumb especially Indians expats and counterpart!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The company is going through massive changes and cuts to all things that have made it an enjoyable place to work for the last 17 years. this is not the same company I started with.
good,They are not overly concerned with the happiness or success of their employees. They are a good stepping stone in any young adult's career. The health insurance is good and sometimes the management can be great. I met a lot of great people and it was definitely a bitter sweet departure. I worked in corporate and I have heard working in a branch is miserable.
good,nice place to work / good culture / good learning opportunities / mandatory required training / good people that care about their job and willing to help / strong customer oriented
good,"After working for WF for 2 year I can say that it is a great way to have cash handling experience, meet great people, and learn so much about banking in general. You do learn a lot about customer service, how to speak correctly to customers, and how to mediate intense situations. The biggest downfall of working there was their ethics regarding customer accounts. I did not agree with a lot in regards to how they tried to sell products and services to people who did not even need the product to begin with."
good,"My whole team was in Downtown Minneapolis. I was the only one who worked there. Sometime when I needed my manager or something I didn’t have anyone, and being a temporary I didn’t have much access."
good,"Help bankers from across the nation with procedures and account set up. Walk the bank thru each step at a time for wire transfer, account setup, trust, and resolve problem with accounts."
good,"Fast-paced work environment, well-fitted for ambitious quick-learners.  Culture is what you would expect when you imagine working at a mutual fund company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other employees with similar interests and work cultures."
good,"Company has resources to be competitive, but large size does sometimes limit being nimble to win at sales person level. It is hard to ignore the benefits to help sell, but sometimes common sense does not prevail for unique situations."
good,"As a BSA I played a key role through the life cycle of the project by communicating between SME, BA, Stakeholders, System Architects, senior management team and business team to understand the business need and then take that understanding and define the appropriate technical systems."
good,"Could be a whole lot better were it not for the level of monotonous, rigid policies with no room for employee input, no matter how ridiculous management's decisions may seem. "
good,There was major room for advancement.However the  atmosphere was stressful at time's due to the overworking of employee's.Recruiting could have been better to slow down turn over rate.
good,"The overall position was great, being able to work will home buyers helping them save there homes. But the job security was not as stable and left me unemployed for several months."
good,"This entity of Wells Fargo doesn't exist anymore. The culture was professional but many of the employees were fresh out of college. Thus, management team feels like they need to micro manage them."
good,"A laid back workplace, great people and great management. compensation really minimal but aside that everything about Wells fargo is awesome. The most exciting part is when you get the chance to watch tv shows or be on your phone when all day's work is complete."
good,Great co workers. Bad management. They are still on he old vision of Wells Fargo. What can you get out of he customer and not what you can do for the customer.
good,"1) Learned about Compliance Certificates, Loan Agreements made between banks and Borrowing Companies."
good,"Management is lacking, Outsourcing is a big issue. Work life balance is great. Large amount of paper work. Limited opportunities to advance. Good for people that are senior IT"
good,"The collector position is one that is hard to advance due to high competition, but overall great place to work. I worked for the company right out of high school and was welcomed with open arms overall great place for starting out."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,My experience at Wells Fargo has been a catalyst for my growth as a professional. I am fortunate to have been exposed to managers who encourage teamwork and learning. Everyone deserves a chance to meet potential.
good,"environment is laid back however, I am able to apply my skillset to the projects that I work on and the teams are great to collaborate with. The hardest part of this job is always having to leave so soon after finally learning the group's process flow."
good,You do way to much for the pay and if you have one bad day you get questioned of why on everything. There isnt much advancement options this is a dead end job
good,"Nothing else to say, one day you are in and one day you are OUT!!"
good,The management definitely needs work. One supervisor was clearly an issue but no one was able to do anything about it. There wasn't much room for advancement but overall its a nice place to work. I worked as a temp for almost 18 months (the full term of my contract) but a month prior to my contract ending they ended my contract without any type of notice. After I had left work that day I was told I could not return and could not contact them for any reason but I was not fired. For that reason I probably won't apply for a job with Wells Fargo in the future.
good,"Interesting workplace. People are very friendly but the problem lies with departments direction, nobody knows, and job advancement is quite difficult because managers knowledge about technology is limited. Over all people who work here are great."
good,"I sign into my work Q contact customers try to help them to get  their car loan back track. I have learned a lot at Wells Fargo Dealer Services over the 7 yrs I have been there It has been a great experience however, there is not room for advancement unless you are willing to move out of state. My co-works are great the hardest part of my job is that is that I an not advance. The best part is that I get to assist customers and with everything from collections to insurance issues or whatever it may take to get the customer taken care of."
good,"-Collaborative environment"
good,"Wells Fargo is a great employer for a big national bank. As a Business Specialist, I get to engage with other business minded individuals as clients. A lot of small business owners have no clue how to run a business, they just know their craft. That's where I come in. I guide them in running their business with different products and services that Wells Fargo and our affiliate partners offer. My motto is; ""Let me run your business, so you can RUN your business."""
good,I'd work there again. That does not mean that it was all a bowl of cherries. They didn't exactly make clear what the job was when they hired me. But I had some friends there. Some supervisors were good and some were not so good.
good,"Very sales oriented company. They give you all the tools you need to achieve success. However, in my current situation there is little to no guidance from my Manager. I have had to search out training opportunities for myself. The company as a whole is great!"
good,I was hired for a short term assignment - the hardest part of the job was the hours. I enjoyed my co workers and management. Management was always compensating us for our extra time.
good,"Production driven, Wells Fargo drives to be top company and you can see that daily in the environment.  There is opportunity for fun but the environment is mostly serious.  Change is constant.  Most enjoyable part of my job is my peers and team, we have a great relationship to where we build a family.  I have an open door policy and my team and peers and always willing to share there opinions or come talk to me about anything.  This make them feel, valued, treated as a person and that I'm not just a manager but I'm also human."
good,"Manage, and communicate with Arapahoe County employees in response to Xerox MFD in need of service.  Work with I.T of county to solve related issues with network, and or PC communications with copiers.  Two reports to be updated daily and accurate of events to be captured."
good,"Very high expectations and monthly sales goals. "
good,the reporting could have been better the days were sometimes hard to stand in the wind rain or Hot days but over all it was a good Job to do
good,"Great company to work for,"
good,I had an awesome time working with Wells Fargo. My supervisors were great and very attentive to his employer's needs. The co- workers were very pleasant and easy to work with.
good,in a day I would be in charge of a crew of 10 and work special areas of the facility checking bags and other item of employees in and out as  well all vehicles trailors are bonded with goverment seals.
good,Not easy to move through out the company. great benefits though as well as some great people to work with on a daily basis. Management is hard to deal with
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,managers don't really care about employees easy to get fired managers sometimes don't care about how you do your work and don't know hot to communicate with employees
good,"It's a pretty good place to work, you have a lot of sales work you have to do. Some days are laid back and some are pretty fast paced."
good,"Great job to work with. A typical day consists of talking to 40-50 customers and helping them get back online, while meeting sales goals. that can be stressful at first but you get the hang of it."
good,"supervisor cared but his hands were ties,lots of favortism,no appreciation and they didnt listen to our suggestions,,,no appreciations awards and half the time u couldnt find a supervisor"
good,Very rewarding working with a diverse amount of personalities.  I enjoyed training new on-boards with proper procedures and following guidelines
good,"It is a pretty good place to work, great products for customers but it is so sales heavy that service falls by the wayside. It's all about the end of day sales quotas. Impossible to not take home with you, always feel like your on the clock to make sales goals."
good,"I have a great experience of working with the Mnc like Aon hewitt and Genpact."
good,It is an okay company to work for. Once you move into to the manager role it becomes stressful. All your time is spent in the branch. It is extremely challenging to move out of retail banking into a corporate role. Basically you have to know someone.
good,I was responsible for analyzing the borrowers financial situation and making recommendations on loan modifications/workout options to resolve delinquency
good,Great work hours for the most part.  I learned how to deal with many different management styles.  The department that I worked in was separate from the bank and from Home Mortgage loan origination so management was constantly making changes every other week which became frustrating.  There also wasn't a whole lot of employee recognition in the office nor the district. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to send in their documents quickly.  The most rewarding part of this job was helping people come up with a resolution for their delinquent mortgage.
good,"•	Assisted in training 10 new hires with sales and service techniques."
good,"overall its a wonderful company to work for. I love doing the customer service part. Im not just not good with sales, And very hard t met numbers when not every customer is the same."
good,"when I arrive into work....it starts out wonderful, everyone is smiling, about an hour later everything goes haywire....employees calling for their schedules, customer's calling to place orders, customers calling to complain abut the experience in the Suite...employees calling out, calling for their gratuities, emails about all of the above....co-workers playing Candy Crush on their computers, Management just watching them play Candy Crush....different managers every 6 months.....the hardest is getting along with every manager that has been in the Suite Department which has been over 25 in a 18 yr old building."
good,excellent place to work  the people are great but no opportunity for advancement benefit are not great
good,"The company overall is wonderful. I enjoyed working there and thought I would stay there for a long time until I completed college. When my department came into new management, things got very difficult. Moral dropped significantly. Everyday you were worried you would get fired. Walking into our department you could feel the tension right away. Everyone I knew was looking for new jobs, a lot of them have left over the past few months whether it was just a new department or new business altogether. I was told my the new management infront of my team that my job was not priority and then fired for that very reason."
good,Upper management is not responsive to front line workers.The pay is good.
good,It is a great feeling to help someone with their home financing needs.
good,It gave us the ability to restructure our customers debt.  This will allow us to put them in a more manageable financial situation by reducing their current debt payout.
good,Pretty good company to work for but the breaks were really short and it was long hours of standing or sitting nothing in between.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"	Manage pipeline reports of 85-90 files per month."
good,"A typical day at work consist of helping customers with thier financial needs."
good,"As a Receptionist I handled a multi line phone system, did cashiering, and wire transfers for the Brokers, managed all cash tenders for the office. I managed client account documents, including stop payments, order errors, and wired funds/ securities files. I did filing and faxes."
good,Mornings started off with scheduling and meeting to set expectation for rest of the day. Convey updates regarding new information within Wells Fargo. Best as well as the hardest part of the job was the handling the employee relations.
good,Nice environment. nice people. I loved the location....Pay was great good training
good,"Review Loans and credit analysis"
good,"On a typical day I came at least an hour early to get a head start on the quantity of work we were given. This was a brand new department and expectations were set and changed on a regular basis until some ground rules were achieved. A typical work day changed daily depending on priorities. System issues hindered the amount of work that could be done somedays, so the job role would direct you to work on reviewing and signing needed documents required to proceed in the foreclosure process. I enjoyed my co-workers and we all worked hard together to exceed goals that were given by management. I learned a few new skills and softwares that I had not used within the company before. I learned more of the backend workings of a foreclosing mortgage. The most enjoyable part of the job was being needed as a teamplayer and allowing my knowledge to be utilized."
good,"I've learned how to managed a work load of loan documents, using all the windows for review of the documents, and learned how to used the I-360 to clock in and out for all breaks including lunch. The management was pretty good, I feel more safe and secure because there's always a security guy at the front desk entrance monitoring everywhere in the building. My coworkers was pretty good with handling their own assignments and completing it on time for the deadlines. The hardest part of the job is updating some news everyday on the loan documents and the information that we should be doing and not allowed to do. The most enjoyable part of the job is I can completed the deadlines on time and have only a few audits back."
good,"Perform a wide range of administrative duties of a highly responsible and confidential nature to the Group Co-Heads and Managing Directors of Wells Fargo Financial Institutions Group.  Extremely heavy calendar management for over 9 managing directors.  Manage travel/road show coordination, client meetings events and logistics such as but not limited to, Nantucket Conference, Wells Fargo Championship, closing dinners and various charitable events all within Wells Fargo compliance policies.

good,"A typical day began at around 8.30.  Very busy department, lots of contact with all staff on all levels which I enjoyed as I am a good communicator/people person."
good,"My overall work experience was that of a learning experience. The work experience was faced paced and stressful."
good,"Excellent company, great benefits."
good,wells fargo focus more on number then anything else. which doesn't really work out for most employee and customer
good,"A typical day as a home mortgage loan processor, for me and many of my colleagues starts at 7am and on most days ended at 6 or 7pm. With a work load of over 60 loans in my pipeline. While at Wells Fargo I learned how to process many different types of loans, my main specialty was around conventional and conventional HARP loans. Within this scope of processing I have done all types of loans including primary, secondary, investments, multi-families, and condos. Management, like all places, have their greats and their not-so-greats with everything in between. Co-workers are the lifeblood of any organization and Wells Fargo is no different, with all the problems that Wells Fargo may have they do seem to find the people that seem to gel well together. The hardest part of my job were twofold. First, would be the regulations that go into the processing of a home loan. What works for one may not work for another and how one underwriter underwrites one loan will always be different from how another underwriter would underwrite the exact same loan. Second, would be the work life balance or the lack thereof. The joke on the job is that there is no life outside of work, many of us work anywhere from 50 to 60 hours a week with a regular work week being 50 hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I get to help people. It's more than just saving money it's the fact that I get to help people stay in their homes. "
good,"A typical day at work includes taking calls from participants in 401k plans. I would assist them with various aspects of their reitirement plans - planning for retirement, investment options, withdrawals, loans, etc. I would also mentor new hires and guide them through training for the position. I would also assist our internal ""Research Team"" with call-backs on outstanding client issues. I do enjoy interacting with customers, co-workers and management. I enjoy the challenge of a difficult situation that needs immediate resolution."
good,fast past from start to finish
good,"Being a Phone Banker is basically the position within the company that can handle almost all requests. We handle customer issues/complaints, banking requests, making product referrals that would benefit the customer (including mortgages) and problem solving. Went through several months of training, and on job training."
good,"Day to day responsibilities will keep you extremely busy, time will pass rather quickly. I originally joined the company in Wisconsin but now work in Atlanta. The Wisconsin office was outstanding. I can't say enough good about the quality of managmement and staff. The Wisconsin office believes in advancement, compensation of quality employees and creating a positive work enviroment. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working customers to create win/win solutions!"
good,"I enjoyed the nearly 3 years I spent with Wells Fargo because my Team mates were amazing and some management was Outstanding. However, I was not that pleased when the new branch supervisors tried presuring sales in immoral ways."
good,Enjoyed my time with the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was just meeting new people every day through customer interactions. Through working here I have learned how to self manage my time and how to coach others toward a common goal in customer service and sales.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Really enjoyed working at wells fargo. There wasnt much room for financial growth.
good,Working 8 hours shifts call center environment upbeat position
good,"As a Personal Banker, I devote much of my day to building long term relationships with our customers in person and by phone. I deepen the understanding of our customer’s financial needs and provide suggestions. While most of the job is performed in the stores, I reach out into the community by placing outbound phone calls to existing clients, visiting businesses, conducting educational seminars, and being active in the community."
good,This was an okay place to work. Sometime I felt like I was back in high school. Some of the other employees like to stare and talk about you before they get to know you. Management was okay they acted like they didn't really know how to manage.
good,Typical day at work would be going in and taking in deposits and withdraws.
good,It was an temp assignment that did not have advancement opportunity it was a project.
good,I was a security guard for a retail store and the company and the retail store treated me fairly good for the brief time I worked for them.
good,"Mortgage Loan Specialist for Wells Fargo. I enjoyed the atmosphere, environment and people I worked with. The information to learn was a bit intimidating but I love a challenge. In the end, I wish training would have lasted a few more weeks, however I understand the need to keep top people of the class."
good,"Great company to work for, it's brand is solid and they have become a major player in banking services and market share."
good,"Overall, a satisfying job. Wells Fargo increasingly conditions a representative to be a complete resource. Numerous metrics must be met and therefore, a very challenging environment is created."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. I was signed on through a temp agency and was not able to make the cut, but I would work there again if I could. People were nice, management was supportive, and the training and team-building meetings were invigorating. "
good,"I interviewed through a temp agency. It was very difficult to get a fair interview when doing the face to face interview. Although I held the position and thought I did very well in the position, it is very hard to get hired as a full-time employee when you are a temp. This it's not a personal opinion but an actual reality for many temp employees who work there and never get hired."
good,"There is absolutely no empowerment and leadership."
good,"Good for beginning experience in big business but managers generally micro manage and just sit around until they are absolutely needed. Almost impossible to get fired unless you break laws, steal, or just very bad things."
good,"Good place to work, Work is good. Management is not fair with PTO. Pay is too low. Management does not correct mistakes done over and over and over and over again."
good,"I am glad Wells Fargo got rid of the solutions per quarter. The pressure from having to meet your quota was difficult especially the location I was at. From current employees, it seems better that there is no specific quote needing to be met. Good benefits and good starting out pay at the time. Liked the flexibility. Training was a bit challenging. 2 weeks long"
good,I worked as a consultant and applied to get converted to FTE. Was not even considered. Wells Fargo wants to hire in low-wage locations and not so much in the SF Bay Area.
good,"Wells Fargo is an amazing company everything is not perfect but they offer security. I think what get lost is yourself as an individual, there no work life balance I left one dept to come back to the same thing."
good,its a good company to work for but maybe management can do a little better. a day at work is the same every single day so it does get pretty boring at times.
good,"Same thing every day, easy work. Contractors aren't treated very well compared to actual employees.  Promises of being brought on permanent are made over and over but not fulfilled."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"At the time OpenEdge was phasing out to C#. Last I heard that changed and now they are coexisting. "
good,"There is plenty of training and side by sides to find what you want to do, however they seem to hire outside the company more then internally while promoting."
good,Wells Fargo has done a lot of great things for me over the years. There isn't a typical day ever because there's always something new to learn. Being a banker isn't my favorite job I've held there. I think there's ways they could improve it but it doesn't seem like they want to change things.
good,There are not many positions to promote to on a retail level. Promotions are primarily internal. Fair pay but rigid environment and high sales expectation.
good,"Very good company, a tonne of growth opportunity within the company as long as you work hard. Clear direction of growth and decent earnings. Will certainly recommend"
good,"Wells Fargo needs to work on ethics with managers,there are managers that have abusive behavior to employees they do not follow wells Fargo core values, also Hr does not care about employees, does not matter have many times you call to HR to report an abusive behavior they do not do anything about it."
good,enjoyed working with customers to fulfill their dreams of purchasing their dream home. And succeeding in making realtors happy when closing on a house sold.
good,"Great place to learn as the company puts a lot of emphasis on training, however, not the best place if you are someone looking for advancement out of retail. Benefits are lacking as well, management puts such a high emphasis on doing the job right but they do not give the compensation that is deserved."
good,"Very similar to being in high school- drama, cliques, and no matter your experience and service, if your not popular you will not move up.  They are very closed minded and pick and choose what policies to follow to benefit their wants and needs."
good,The managers ruined it for me but overall an easy going job for the most part but my branch was one without chairs so standing all day wasn’t too nice
good,"Low pay "
good,"My day consisted of getting ahold of clients to help them try to keep their house, through government loans. My manager was very helpful. I enjoyed it"
good,Great company just need to pay their employees a bit more but overall a good company just micro management is pretty intense. Have all the great benefits and also the 401k and the savings program. Great bank to work for if they paid better
good,Task oriented but ease to work for.  Assignments were provided and deAdlines/goals when given to meet.  Training was useful and easy to schedule.  Management was consistent with daily meetings
good,"I really want to say I love this company. THe benefits are great, the PTO allowance is hard to find in other companies. However if you are in the mortgage side or this company it is hard to move up and layoffs are frequent based on the market. Getting out of mortgage or advancing is near impossible unless you know the right people or have some sort of bachelors degree. Management is so-so just stay as far away from Home Equity as possible."
good,"Great job to learn about everything financial, good job to gain customer experience skills and cash handling skills. Always room for promotions and just learning new things."
good,Work can be difficult some days but that just helps you to learn and grow. There are some really great people there who take a complete interest in helping you grow and move to the next level
good,"Hired as full time. Had to work every week-end with no extra pay. Week-ends were 8 hrs/day. Mondays were 12-14 hrs, Thursday and Friday were 10-12 hours. Loved the overtime money but had no personal life. You worked until the job was done so you could not make personal plans during the week."
good,"I was placed at Wells Fargo by a staffing service for their quarterly mailing to branches of new materials.  This involved working in their very large warehouse, putting a box on a cart and going from pile to pile of printed materials, from posters to brochures to flyers, that are used in Wells Fargo branch offices.  Each branch office had a printout of the specific materials needed for it, along with a mailing label to put on the box once it was packed."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Entry level position with a decent base salary to start. 3 weeks Paid time off to start and you get more when you hit your 3rd year with the company. Good start and relaxed environment, but will want to move on after the 1 year requirement internally."
good,"Overall, a great start in the financial industry. Branch culture varies and is based on the culture set by the manager. Can be fun if you have a manager who is a great leader."
good,"I am not a sales person so the fact I had to pressure"
good,"Great People. Bad Company. "
good,Management does not really support your advancement nor coaches. Workplace culture can be negative. They expect you to do so much and focus on a lot of aspects of the job while not getting anything wrong.
good,"The role is very similar to other roles at other financial institutions, you do the same type of job. Overall the company is ok and the PTO is definitely best compared to other jobs out there I just feel like when you jump into retail banking it is hard to leave."
good,"You are entrusted with a lot of responsibility with cash. There is a high volume of transactions resulting in a fast paced environment. Consequently, you learn accuracy, how to promote and cross sell bank products and engage customers."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo. This job was just what I needed at that time I needed more pay and this job provided me that. I was able to transition from Elephant to Wells Fargo Pretty easy.
good,"Typical day varies - can be super busy during lunch hours. Learned about compliance, confidentiality and security. Can be challenging during short staffing times which is the hardest part of the job. Fun team to work with."
good,They employee a lot of unqualified people and place them in higher better paying positions vs. people that have the qualifications and experience in Banking.
good,"Company is a GREAT company to work for.  If you are hired into a position that is volume and numbers driven be cautious as your work/life balance will suffer tremendously!  Also be mindful of the manager that you interview with OR get re-assigned to after working, there is a lack of consistency in styles and no way to be moved to another manager once it's done."
good,Good place to work. Respectful of work life balance. A lot of changes through out the structure of my organization. Learned how the WF internal bank works with products that they sale. Also what financial ratios and expectations are needed to gain an approval for larger non-flow transactions.
good,"always high stress.....management always changing...always going to have high stree,  never know when your job will be consolidated and they will move your job"
good,"Upper management was very demanding.  You needed to talk up and not let the chain push you around.  If you knew your job, could be very lucrative.  Always on demand in a sales position"
good,"As just what was considered the lowest position at the time in the phone bank center, I know we were responsible for bringing in revenue that far outweighed what we were being paid for.Also opportunities for advancement out of this position were made impossible,virtually unavailable as the goals were almost unreachable. It was well established to keep us down in those positions which did not pay well at all, all the while hoping you don't potty your pants as you are litterally balled and chained to your phone. You are not even treated like an adult as you have to wait and ask permission and wait for relief.Its absurd."
good,"The food expensive though."
good,"Call center environment. Goals are set for each skill set and must it must be met every month. "
good,Working for Wells Fargo is very overwhelming due to the reputation Wells Fargo has. Very flexible hours and PTO/SICK TIME/KINCARE/ bereavement/ disability all benefits are provided. the pay is very good depending on the positon that you are in. Getting promoted is always about politics you have to know someone in order for you to get promoted if not you are stuck!! get on managements good side and you will get all the pto you want and any position you want if you work hard for it!!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It was a very fast paced place to work. I worked as a temp and was offered a permanent position but the salary was to low. The managers were very supportive and my peers were nice.
good,Interactive guest and the environment is fast passed and competitive. The working culture is fun and supportive though. The amount of customers determines the work amount for the day.
good,Overall Wells Fargo is a great company that pays extremely well for the lack of education or previous experience needed for some roles. There is room for promotion within Wells Fargo but you do have to go through several roles to get where you'd like to be.
good,"Wells Fargo work culture wise good."
good,"I really liked working at Wells Fargo. I was there for over 4 years and then was a major layoff in 2013."
good,Wells Fargo was a very good company to work for.  They provide opportunities for advancement and tuition reimbursement for those who are interested in furthering their education.
good,"Overall is great company to work and this bank is one of the largest company in usa .jfjsafafsaeuar aafaflk fsafsaf safsaf"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, pay should be much higher for the type of work that you're expected to do.   There's opportunity to grow within the company but it does take time."
good,"Mico-managing bosses who sacrifice you to customers who aren't getting their way. They limit your options for fixing the problem, as a result, they alienate their subordinates."
good,Very systematic work day in day out. The manager was leaving and didn't put any effort into employees and told us daily we were getting let go at anytime.
good,"Great people, great atmosphere, just not for me. I liked working there, I just felt out of place. It just wasn't my kind of flow. Enjoyed free snacks!"
good,Still have predatory practices I do not agree with. Manager was terrible. Work hours were always being cut. Promise of promotions were not upheld. Plus free coffee until budget cuts.
good,enjoy the environment. Lots of opportunity to self develop. They offer quite a few opportunities for self development through job shadowing.  Management seems to be fair however they are on a lot of calls daily so that takes away from the teams.
good,"Good place to work, my manger is great! colleagues are awesome. stress levels are low from what is used to be. Client facing environments are typically more difficult to  work with but is not too hard."
good,"Very high stress calls, with very little time to fully take care of customers in the way they want you too. They give employees lunches, candy, and acknowledgement whenever possible. Great environment, very hard to live up to the standards they want you to when you are not given the correct time and care you need. Very rigid on schedule, wait list for changing shifts is endless."
good,"I cannot complain about my time there. I worked hard, however I was compensated fairly. I loved the people I worked with but when you need to escalate a situation there is no one around"
good,"I started working in the internatinal wore transfers and moved over to the corporate side of the bank, there was room for adv, but after inj was rels."
good,Closed all mtg branches in states without  a bank.  Couldn't keep a manager in Okla.  Last manager was in Colorado Springs and she didn't really want t manage us.
good,"This is a decent paying entry level position. "
good,"Ok company, manager turnover is high! Pray you get an experienced and mature manager. My previous manager was horrible! Coworkers were the best,they all were team players!"
good,"After the first big lawsuit, things changed a lot and they haven't quite found a way to structure the call center without sales and still keep team members engaged. Constant change, too demanding and difficult for the pay."
good,"Micro-management at its finest.  Making salaried employees fill out a minute by minute ""what do you do each day"" form was insulting and a bigger waste than the waste they thought they were going to find."
good,"I liked the company and job, but I wanted to work remote.  Not an option here.  The people that work there are awesome.  I still have friends from there."
good,"bank teller responsibility, customer service, attending to ATM balance and reloading back up to Head Teller for shipment ."
good,"Very fun place to work. Management is great unless you get a micro manager then life is miserable. A lot of travel so if you have young kids, might not be for you."
good,I did not like the way thet handled the closure of the department and how everyone was exited from the company. Overall great benefits but managements was awful
good,Come in pull bags run money open safe. Greet customers help with their transactions and try to sell them things such as different types of account. Lines of credit etc.
good,"monotonous role in company, good experience in working with customers, good chance for career advancement, not the best schedule with split days off or always working on 1 weekend day, poor compensation"
good,"I've worked here for 4 years and I have been passed up for a well overdue promotion because my boss doesn't like me. That's all that matters in this company. My manager is well known to be hardheaded with anger issue and all around very difficult to work for. If you're thinking about applying and get hired, the company is great but you need to be a brown nose or you'll be in a dead end job."
good,"My role at Wells Fargo was as a Assistant Manager and Personal Banker. We bankers were compensated for the number of checking account packages were sold to customers. It was a cut throat environment. "
good,"I enjoyed the work; But I did not like knowing when I would be able to go home each night. "
good,It was a very bust place to work at. A lot of room for advancement by moving to and from departments. Very strict attendance policy. Learned a lot about the banking industry working there.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company. I believe that hard, efficient, and consistent work should be rewarded.  It's only fair.  I wish to work for a company that shows the same loyalty in return that the employee gives to the company.  Even after still being in the same department and job position for more than a year, a contract/temporary employee should be considered for the permanent job positions.  Especially, if they have worked exceptionally hard, trained new employees(contract & permanent), created and written employee instruction manuals for our daily duties, computer programs, and software that we use.  I love the company, but I haven't felt fully appreciated by the company, even with all of the experience, work ethic, and efforts that I put forth to making my department a better and more efficient place to work.  I have much knowledge, experience, and skills to offer any company that I work for and wish to have an opportunity to prove it."
good,"I remember it being great, everyone was friendly and they really enjoyed working with me when I was a contractor.  They were on a hiring freeze at the time and unable to make me permanant"
good,"Individual advancement lacks leadership vision. Managers are to stressed out to focus on their group and less so on any individual. Training is ""do as you go"", lack of training provides additional stress factor."
good,"i loved working for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. we were a big family that worked and played hard together. the training could have been much better initially, but in the end, they did get people in to train new employees and return old employees on all products. it was a culture that was very fair as far as learning things but not for promotions and salary."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Typical day was fast paced and very involved with day to day business operations and team member development. I truly enjoyed the autonomy to develop and grow my team in order to help them succeed.
good,"Day was ok, just a normal job. I worked hard, stayed friendly and worked well with team. We all did a phenomenal job working in a fast-paced environment."
good,I worked customer service in one of their insurance departments. Pay was fairly low but job was easy. Pay could have been low due to the fact that Wells Fargo took over the company that I work for.
good,"I loved the resources and potential to grow with the company. My cons were that at my last position I felt that I did not get the help that I asked for, it was easier for them to just let me leave."
good,"they have good benefits, but they have to improve that, for example:they may need to implement some ""training"" to teach the emplyees how to get rid of the stress caused by the customer calling, specially the workers working at foreclosure dept. collections, etc."
good,"Team is small and you will know your co-workers like family. Everyone is willing to help when needed."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place but some of the supervisors were not employee friendly. Wells Fargo is having it's issues but they usually hire very good employees.
good,Great company but had concerns with the Canadian Market. Withdrew from the CDA market....too bad. Still a great place to work. Upper management very involved.
good,"No surprise - you're at the mercy of your business partners and, as was my case in my last gig, there's no guarantee that your Project Manager Manager will support you.  My previous gig was much better, both in terms of users as well as PMM."
good,"Wells Fargo has high standards and expects a lot from you. They require consistency from you (i.e: no calling out, adapting to change and taking on more responsibility with a menial increase in wages) but don't give the same in return. In the last 2 months, my schedule has changed at least once every two weeks, if not more. The last time it changed I was not told until Sunday (day before) afternoon. They are inconsistent with their changes that are for ""business needs"" when it doesn't support the call volume. More people are needed at times when there are less team member on the floor, resulting in 95% of the calls I take coded with a complaint due to long hold times whereas I may receive 1-5 calls the last two hours of my ever changing shift. Leadership changes frequently (those who stay a year or more usually get promoted and can leave a department or just move up) which can be frustrating as different managers are at different levels of experience and some aviod their duties (taking escalations or helping in general). Overall the company has high standard for employees but again don't follow through. Repercussions are soft when a team member doesn't adhere like being on your cell phone on the floor, auxing out of the phone when not needed and accruing more than the allotted occurance (which I have some as well but supposedly after 6 there is suspension or review and I know team member who have 8 or more with no repercussions) which makes doing our job more difficult because it's hard to get fired from this company. While others are slacking you have to pick up the slack and"
good,Its a great company to work for but expecting temps to know as much as permanent employees & work deadlines.Teach us a system on 1 project &  kind of backtrack on another just confuses some people.
good,There's hardly any room for advancement.  The compensation is minimum and no raises are given.  A typical day at work at the time was answering 80-100 inbound calls assisting customers with their accounts.
good,"It seems the that easiest way to move up within Wells is to constantly change departments, every 2-3 years.  It's a zig-zaggy path to the top.  I wish there were straighter paths if you have a passion for working in a certain department."
good,department I was in worked very long hours due to lack of employees to cover daily duties. very difficult to move up in company better off leaving and coming back to company
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is great, however I mainly left since the bank made it hard on employees to truly help customers in time of need. ex: late fees, interest, due date changes that happen within same billing period."
good,Helped create the job aids for the supreme database; created the process to navigate the database. I would complete daily assignments in verifying information in the mortgage profile. Would ensure 100 % accuracy in all files.
good,"I worked in various operation departments, most of the time the job was very stress, sometimes had to deal with being micro managed. Job advancement was had because there weren't many openings at the time or hiring freezes happen all lot. Last time many of the employee rewards and recognition was lacking. Not the same company."
good,Other than managemtn being weak and indecisive with problems and concerns. Company has a wek management base from te front line to the top on the mortgage side. Tough and impossisable to get correct or any answers at all to problems. It is its biggest problem
good,My then manager had a clear problem with newbies. She had no patience and was the most extreme micro-manager ever! It seemed that she was feared by others but she obviously brought her personal stresses to the job.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Everyday seemed like a routine to me. I learned about the banking work and taxes.  work place wasn't stressful but I would get boring at times from just sitting at your desk all day.
good,"Typical day at wells fargo consisted in working the sales floor and greeting clients. Then you would be required to do a minimum of 2 hours worth of cold calls. Career advancement was very consistent but before the lawsuit that wells fargo received for all the ghost accounts, managers were cut throat. To the point where managers advice many bankers into making wrong decisions that are unethical."
good,was a job and unfortantley mostdays it felt like a grind to come in.  the tough part were the employees were fine to work with but there were many young kids who did not have any real experience to sell financial products
good,"Too many meetings before and after work hours, For being paid a minimum wage. "
good,"I was a contracted worker for 18 months which was cut short to 11 months.  I have the knowledge of Remedy (PAC2000) and Change Management Process.My hiring manager was remote, therefore I worked independently.  There was minimal interaction.  The workplace was very relaxed.  The hardest part of the job was getting work and staying busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with remarkable colleagues.  They were very knowledgeable and hep me learn the Wells Fargo disciplines."
good,Since all the changes with in the company alot of back lash has fell on the employees when it wasmt our fault at all. The company need to take a second look at the management.
good,"Pay was not good, due to branch malfunctions caused a decrease in moral in central sales. leadership not ideal it tougher times. decent benefits for the most part"
good,"I loved working for Wells Fargo when I first started, it was lots of fun. They would recognize you on your performance ever day and monthly. Then the were sued by the public for accounts that were faked and they never asked for. The work place then became very stressful and they didn't recognize you on the performance. They put holds on raises."
good,"After merger and move from Bryn Mawr to Radnor, I left with severance. I was a trust associate for 8 years and had a great team of people to work with. I would go back if I found the right position."
good,"Overall a good place to work, although there are a lot of negative things in the news right now.   Typical day is 8 hours.  We used to have a lot more options, like working remotely, however that's being taken away now too."
good,I loved to work with people there.The customers where the best seeing there smiling faces and talk to then all the time. The management was great at first and then it changed to someone that didn't know much about what they where doing.
good,"There are positives and negatives just like any corporate job"
good,"Wells Fargo is a very strong bank with their people and their training programs. They have some of the strongest trainers in their perspective fields and strong training programs."
good,"After all employees end shift, enter the bank follow checklist and clean. Clean bathroom, dust, empty trash, mop entrance, clean windows.  Vacuum, check break room."
good,"A lot of room for advancement, concrete policies and procedures, bonuses, many locations, .....………..............don't like having to work on Saturday.."
good,"I'm a contractor who has the luxury, for now, of working at home.  However, Wells Fargo now wants everyone to commute to work, which lowers the overall quality of life in a community by increasing air pollution and traffic congestion.  I am far more productive and happier working from home.  It's a regressive policy.  On the positive side, I have a fantastic manager and very good group of people with with I work, with the usual, arrogant, antisocial computer engineering types.  Contractor pay should be higher to be more in line with what full-time WF associates make with benefits packages.  Rates have not increased for several years despite a strong economy, so it feels like exploitation."
good,"Overall a good company to work with.Very good work life balance,Good polices for women employees.Few managers are outstanding and few just play politics and team members have to abide by there sucking rules."
good,I was a field supervisor for them and check on each account during my shift to make sure all was as it was supposed to be and the guard on duty was doing his/her job
good,Working for any bank can be challenging; not just because of all the responsibility's but the the people who are supposedly your branch managers just add to the drama of following orders like a sheep. i expected team leaders.
good,A typical day as a teller is to come in do your morning procedures open the doors take care of the customers close the store and go home. I have learned a great deal as far as being a teller but it really does matter at Wells Fargo who manages you. One thing I have found is that there are those manager who only care about coming in you balancing out and going home rather than developing you as a professional. However there are the great managers here at Wells Fargo who present you with opportunities to become better. The hardest part of the job is the customer service. The most enjoyabel part is the customer service.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"My group had an excellent and professional staff.  There was a definite cultural difference between former Wachovia management and Wells Fargo, which meant different approaches to managing staff."
good,"Company was a great place to work when I first started with them."
good,"Very ""micro-managed"". Advancement opportunity is there if you have the right connections. I dealt with Executive Office complaints such as if a customer would write the CEO a letter it would come across my desk to attempt to resolve. Dealt with the sales tactic event in September 2016."
good,Had access to training yet never had the time to complete because of so much work.  Employees were constantly looking for better positions due to unhappiness in their role
good,I enjoyed this company and being a part of this team. Management started off well. After the service manager was promoted the new service manager came things went bad.
good,"Management was great, learned a lot about banking products. Enjoyed helping customers with financial goals."
good,"I like to describe it as the office equivalent of a factory job. You are doing a lot of the same everyday and with limited interaction with coworkers unless you have a question. Very detail oriented, and the consequences for making a mistake can be lengthy."
good,"I had an opportunity to help piloting new vendor management systems and help with implementation of the department's process and procedure.  I've learned to evaluate risk associates with each attorney firm we audited.  I enjoyed my co-workers, they were very helpful and professional."
good,"a typical day "
good,My direct daily team was awesome my report to manager was on the east cost saw him twice in 6 months. I was left on contract and was treated with respect despite being a contractor.
good,"I come in to work, I log into my computer and my soft phone, as I take my calls "
good,"On a typical day I learned quit fast that you need a backbone and a very stiff one at that if you are going to work at a bank. People love love their money and if anything is out of sorts it is automatically your fault because you are the person they can see and talk to first hand. Handling customers and their money was a great experience. I did not like my co workers however. they did nothing but complain about the customers and their behaviors. I had a very dishonest manager. "
good,Typically manage a portfolio of 400-800 customers. Making outbound calls to customers in portfolio. Inbound calls usually only come in from your own customers. Emailing customers is also another option as far as communicating with customers.
good,The company has great benefits but the compensation is slightly behind where it should be. I enjoy all of the people I work with and my work environment.
good,Great place to work overall. Great training. But sales culture can get tough but I hear that has changed. There are lots of different opportunities to work there
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work with. It has great opportunities for career advancement. I worked with an amazing very diverse team. Regardless of the diversity we were al treated equally.
good,Check your money out. Load up your truck. Load your weapon secure everything and get started on your route. To always watch your back is what I learned.  Management was good. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was your safety. Most enjoyable part was making it back in off your route first and safe.
good,"My typical day was similar to my last review.  I logged into several systems, checked my calendar, voice mail and email and then prioritized my day accordingly."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good company to work for and has good benefits.  Did not like the compensation structure, made it difficult to meets sales goals would have been decent to get paid for what sales you made.  With Wells Fargo it was all or nothing."
good,it was all pretty easy stuff but i wasn't helped when i wanted to try and make a move up in the job so i pursued other options.
good,Working as system analyst at Wells Fargo was very stressful and fast paced. You had constant changes and knowing in a fast paced environment meant long hours. Working on the weekends was also highly recommended.
good,Great Connection with different individuals everyday while helping form a great banking experience. I was able to help individuals excel financially.
good,"love working with customer and provide excellent service, company is well know for caring for its customer. Need  management improvement with culture."
good,Solid office to learn the essentials of Investment Banking.  Knowledgeable and professional staff willing to help you with all tasks.  Challenging office environment to work in.
good,Training was great. Then there was no training at the bank. The co workers were rude and not helpful. We had no manager   I was hired under the assumption that I would work specific hours but that was not true.
good,"Good place to work, leadership decided to close down the Milwaukee location, when it was a top performing location, but since I'm not privy to all the details of why they closed, I can only testify to the good experiences and hardworking staff that represented the organization with integrity."
good,"Good place to work, but hard to get promoted or expand on your personal development. Too many changes and communication is an issue"
good,"Managers can be overbearing, goals are high and no account for lack of foot traffic.  ""vision and values"" sound great but are rarely lived up to."
good,There is not a whole lot of room to work with single parents who juggle full time work and children. Especially when the children get sick a lot and you only have so many limited days you can get off in a six month period. Plus if you get sick...that will not matter to them
good,"make good money, job comes with immense sales pressure. so stay motivated or get out. They teach you incredibly amazing skills that I feel have really helped me on EVERY job interview i've ever had. Great place to work, just tough mangers some times. Teaches you to be alone pretty quickly"
good,I love the fact that the company is very open minded to not only employee but to embrace people from every walk of life.  They have nice benefits and can be flexible in certain areas of employment.
good,"Teller- Stress- sales--mean and rude District Manager "
good,I learned how to manage my time and budgeting while being a contractor. My coworkers were very easy to work with and the hardest part of my job is just learning the process of the group as quick as possible.
good,overall good company. Many divisions so a great chance to advance and grow.  Use school reimbursement and make sure to always advance your skills if you want to move up
good,Management did not really take any issues that the employees would address.  There were many phone and computer issues.  Most of the time you were helping other peoples customers and your customers were left to suffer.
good,great place to work and climb the corporate ladder. great place to be and work... lovely lovely lovely... great people... great atmosphere... only complaint is the short of pay.... these people work very hard and deserve to be compensated accordingly... base pay needs to increase just has the cost of living in 2015 has... CEO can take a hit in order for their employees to feel appreciated... appreciation for employees is not jean Fridays... its paying them a wage that makes them feel wanted and respected.
good,"It is a nice place to work ."
good,"I really enjoyed the conversations I had with the customers, and helping them with transactions. And my co-workers were a lot of fun to work with. I miss them so much."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"not that bad of a place to work for they have good pay and you have health benefits, but the managers were really nice at all"
good,"I had many positions with the company throughout 13 years.  I seemed to be on trouble shooting teams throughout the time.  I loved finding ways to resolve issues that caused the process not to be smooth.  I worked with other team mates within and outside my department and in my last position I worked with attorneys who drafted documents for Wells.  It was great to see both sides of the issues and if there was a policy or risk I brought it to my managers to see if there was some way it could be resolved.  However, in the last department, there were so many processes that affected our department that we never had a clear picture of.  We never knew how the process worked from start to finish so we could understand why things happened and how we could help change it.  My team mates on the Exception team were the smartest group of women who the entire department depended on to get docs out the door.  If  a document needed to be processed as a RUSH I was called upon to monitor the document through the process until it went out the door."
good,"I've only been at WFDS since June, however, the management has been very friendly and helpful. They are supportive at work and also"
good,"Wells Fargo is a fiscally responsible, high performance-driven bank that puts its customers first.  There are multiple opportunities to grow and advance within the company."
good,I loved the growth and attitudes of my diverse co-workers the most in this atmosphere. Also encouraged financial education and volunteering in the community.
good,Overall a good company to work for. You have to be a decent sales person to be able to tolerate your job. They do give incentive for doing your job and the training they offer for each position is really good. They take the time and invest the money to make sure new team members are being trained properly for their particular role in the company.
good,Everyday was different in that I got to meet and talk with new people. Working in a team oriented environment was enjoyable.
good,"Good company to work for but very limited career advancement opportunities at some sites.  Other sites, opportunities are plenty.  Otherwise, benefits are average and salary is average in comparison to other banks."
good,"When working at WellsFargo is satisfying to know that You are helping customers understand how to manage their finances and make a knowledgeable dicision. Learned that teamwork is crucial part of businessn in order to achieve a goal. Had a very fair management that made sure to follow policies. Enjoy working with co-workers which were from all over the world and learning about their cultures, as a collector some times was not easy to not be able to help customers that wanted to pay but did not have the means. Being able to reach your goals and be rewarded for your hard work."
good,"My manager was a great manager. There are some people that are underhanded, but that is anywhere. Wells Faro is a place where you can grow, if you are under the right leadership."
good,"Wells Fargo is only good if you're into sales and are persistently annoying. Wells Fargo forces Tellers to make a certain amount of sales or they will ""write you up"" and if you get written up 3 times they will let you go. They don't care about there employees, only sales."
good,"Good working culture however the level of nepotism needs to be reviewed."
good,Wells pays much lower than peers and a lot of smart people have left.  There seems to be a large variability between what they pay people in the same role so they stress over and over that pay is confidential.
good,"I enjoyed working for Bank of the West until I wanted to advance my career. Because this is a smaller community bank there isn't much opportunity or room for advancement as many of the employees in positions outside of the retail banking arena tend to stay long term in addition the operations for this bank are predominantly handled out of state so you would have to relocate for most of the positions. "
good,"My day consist of taking incoming phone calls all day for customers wanting to know their account/accounts balance, transaction history,  direct deposit advances, lost accounts and product referral."
good,"The person who performs the job of teller or lead teller at Wells Fargo needs to have a lot of stamina and be willing to deal with difficult customers at some times.  Most of the job is fun and a large portion of the customers are friendly, as are the coworkers and management.  The hardest part of the job for me was after I came back from having spinal fusion surgery I found it very difficult to keep up with the physical challenges that the job of lead teller required.  I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo and was disappointed that I was unable to continue my employment there due to my physical difficulties.  Too much bending, lifting, twisting."
good,This company gave me a great deal of experiece on how to provide an excellent service to the customer.  I got to meet great people and learn from them.
good,Managed 10 to 20 people daily with focus on exceeding branch goals.  Balanced management of operations and sales.  Focused on coaching and development of team members create a positive working environment.
good,I am very grateful to have the opportunity to work for this company...however two years in the mortgage collections department has honestly been very draining....I come to work daily genuinely enjoying serving the company and our customers. I pride myself on my ability to provide quality service on every call and remaining engaged directly to the customer I am servicing without becoming robotic and allowing the job function itself to become a boring routine....However the site I work for has been very challenging because a lot of times you are judged based on the entire sites performance and I feel the metrics system is imbalanced and the managers are not doing a good job in providing consistent clear direction therefore there is always a sense of confusion as to what is the right way...I feel I have outgrown this job and it has began to stifle me personally due to the sense of no reward or recognition for the effort that I put in daily.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, with very good opportunities for those who are looking to grow within the banking industry. There are many lines of business for one to choose from, become a part of and grow both professionally and personally. It is one of the most culturally diverse companies that I've ever worked for, which says alot about their willingness to be a company that desires to compete, remain on the cutting edge and be a major player on the global scale. Probably one of the most difficult things to deal with is displacement or job uncertainty. I have to say that you are always learning something new and different which makes for an exciting day for me."
good,they neeed better management. new managers because when they talk about being ethical thats bs. they are not even ethical.
good,"In a typical day, we would answer phone calls all day, receive questions from customers about tax payments, next mortgage payment due, escrow related questions. Also cross sell bank products, such as checking accounts, credit cards, refinancing loans. My co workers and supervisor were great, no complaints at all. "
good,Is a very good company. have great compensation and salary. Great Health benefit and 401K matching.
good,"fun enviroment"
good,I loved my position and I enjoyed helping the customer but the company is only welcoming when it comes to staring. Once you start they do not support you as a worker. It depends on which branch you are working for that your manager will try to advance you in the company. Most managers will not try to help you advance in the company.
good,"I have completed this section, trying to advance in this on-line portal"
good,"Great group of people to work with. Even in a satellite office the great Wells Fargo culture exists. The vast majority of Wells Fargo hires are great people and that can be seen in this office. "
good,"Could be worse, great benefits come at the expense of lower wages.  Management is like all management; depends on who it is."
good,"Training is very good.  Culture is strange.  There was no drug testing or background checks done which was odd given that we had customer's banking information. It was clear that drinking and drug use was going on at breaks and lunches."
good,"Typical day, standing on your feet in one spot for 11 hours.  Learned how to spot counterfeit money. Management was very unfair and played favorites. Co workers were typical. Hardest part of the job standing in one place for 11 hours.  Most enjoyable, not much."
good,"co workers were great, mid management was terrible. Upper managers were amazing."
good,"4th largest bank by deposit/assets for 2011 statistic reported in Q1 2012. Responsible to map EDI data into customer’s custom file formats, or from customer flat file into the industry standard payment format. Solid experience in data communications/mapping into and out of the bank for Cash Management customers, enabling systematic settlement for payments, remittance, and document data into their system’s application"
good,"wf overall is a great company to work for as far as benefits and if u make your incentive the compensation is decent, however there is no job security, the managers will throw u to the wolves is it will save their butts, its extremely numbers driven so be prepared to make your ""solutions"" (wf's name for bank products)or bare the consequences which include morning huddles and meetings to explain why your not making your quotas and staying well after bank hours to cold call people and setup  appointments and onsite opportunities..They expect u to make every single interaction a sell."
good,"We are required to solicit new business, process, and underwrite loan applications for our in-house processor who is really just an data entry person, and the underwriter who verifies our work often without referring to the 5 page credit memo required for every loan. "
good,"Typical day involves following up on current files in progress, contact current, previous, and future customers, while maintaining relationships with real estate agents, builders, and bankers."
good,Wells Fargo is one of the largest banks in the country. They focus aggressively on selling their products and services to their customers and prospects.
good,"Overall, my experience at Wells Fargo was decent. I furthered my customer service skills, while learning a bit about the mortgage industry. Unfortunately, the industry is volatile and hundreds of employees were removed. The management and training at this institution could use some improvement as well. Employees were saturated with files and most were very unhappy. The pay, however, was an advantage - albeit a short one."
good,"-Cyclical work, every 2nd and 3rd week can consist of 20-60 hours of overtime per week. Bookend weeks are often very dull unless you occupy yourself with projects."
good,Goals and expectations are changing and hardly met. My co-workers were good and bad. Its a restaurant. You can't expect it to be too professional. The most enjoyable part of my job was the atmosphere.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo maintains an attitude of 'retain and retrain.'  This has been functionally true in several roles that I have been in.  Wells does not pay to retain their employees, however."
good,"Overall great company to work for. The management could have done a better job as far as structure and organization. Team work was not a very big at this company. Also, worked plenty of overtime hours including weekends. Life/work balance was a little difficult due to very demanding job."
good,"Managment was never able to stay ahead of the curve and keep fulfillment staffing in tune with the market. It always took too long for deals to close and we constantly missed closing dates, which led to lost business and unhappy customer experiences."
good,"Enjoyed the people and Management team. Wells Fargo is an unstable company. One must enter as a temporary employee and recieve the excellent training Wells Fargo provides. It is a starting point, not  a lifetime career kind of company. Wells Fargo helped me achieve my goal to re-enter into the mortgage company and for that I am greatfull."
good,"Typical day receiving calls, scheduling, and setting up conference room."
good,"A typical day at work was being on the phones assisting customers with their banking needs. Also of course selling products. The management was great! The hardest part of the job was keeping my numbers consistent, with selling. I loved the assisting part of the job."
good,It was a great place to work for I'm just looking for better opportunity.
good,Typical day consisted of at least 50 calls about troubleshooting system and trade issues.I learned patience. My team was very tight. No growth at all.
good,"Maybe sales just isn't for me but at the interview the job sounds great, once you start working there its a totally different ball game. Its a good job temporarily but not for a career"
good,"Good place to work and also never felt work pressure , management has to think beyond the box for contractors ."
good,"This company was a good company to be with. My career goals were leading me elsewhere. "
good,"This job was my first foot in the door with Wells Fargo. It was a call center setting that my boss made easier by being flexible, and fun to work with. It was a lot of in bound calls and few out bound calls. I had the opportunity to be trusted enough to train in more than 10 employees which was my favorite part of the job."
good,"daily scanning, verifying, indexing, fun people., fast paced."
good,Ability to interact with our clients. I throughly enjoyed working in the Bank envirionment.

good,"Great company to work, I would recommend."
good,"The benefits are second to none, the pay is average, and the work atmosphere is average."
good,"A good company to work with, work culture is nice and the policies are good. However they have not off-shored complex process to India yet."
good,Enjoyed working for them in the early years but things changed over the years that I felt were not for the better. The company got too big with the Wachovia merger that had an effect on the benefits that were being offered.
good,Unique platform for independent minded financial advisors. Does not have the product sale pushing from management like the wire house.  Limited support network regarding back office.  In house branch manager/principal at each branch.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,on a typical day i took about 30 inbound calls and assisted customer with bill payments and processed fraud claims. The hardest part of my job was selling to customers with fraud complaints because we had to offer and sale on every call. Management was always around and there for assistance. Co- Workers were very supportive and always willing to help. The most enjoyable part of the day would be helping elderly and disabled customer with things that they couldnt do on their own.
good,Large Corporation.  The company is located in the united states and also has offices in Europe and Asia
good,"The position required 60 hours+ a week between production and management. I learned how to source internal bank business to compliment my existing book of business. I gained a greater understanding of pricing, credit (underwriting) and processing. Management was satisfactory and I enjoyed the many relationships i had with my co-workers and the individuals who reported to me. Balancing production while being accountable for the individuals that reported to me. Production with credit authority to sign off on my own loans."
good,The job itself is a fun outgoing energetic job. I love the customers and the my co workers were easy to get along with. The most difficult part of the job is the stress level and the stability of the job. Hours fluctuate alot so its hard to keep up financial because its part time.
good,a typical day at work is handling 35+ calls a day depending on volume. attempting to sale customers various credit based as well as deposit accounts. staff was great staff attempted to help those who succeed who worked for it.
good,"crazy hours, great pay, unlimited overtime great bonuses!"

good,"usually  great  management  , alot  of  changes ,  good  training  program , able  to make and  meet  good  people , stable  company"
good,"I learned a lot about Commercial customers and what it took to keep their online products running smoothly. My team and co workers were great and all showed excellent team work. The Management was very approachable, flexible and understanding. The hardest part of the job was when the system would go down or wouldn't cooperate when we had important deadlines to meet. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers and their excellent team work and also learning something new everyday. I loved working independently but also enjoyed being challenged and working to meet deadlines"
good,"typical hours from 8am to 5pm"
good,"Great fortune 500 company."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work with a great work enviroment.  I am hoping for another internal position that would further challenge me in the industry but I have decided to expand my search outside of the company.  I review and notarize Assignments of Mortgage most of the day.  I am assigned to various projects encompassing many areas of the Mortgage process, as well as help train new hires in our process.  "
good,"Security First: I was a manager for 24 years- not micromanaged & my division manager let me think out of the box.Leading my team to #1 branch in County for years by training lifting people UP not DOWN."
good,"Working with clients and colleagues is very enjoyable."
good, Attention to detail while performing under strict deadlines. Must be self motivated and driven to accomplish task on a daily basis.
good,"Sit behind a desk all day; job is really repetitive. Being able to work with customers throughout the United States is enjoyable. Some co-workers are able to get away with whatever they want, because management has no real leadership skills."
good,I was able to move up with in the company. As the company got larger they got less personable. 
good,"Order legal documents of lien holders and sellers for short sale requirements, to include pay statements, property reports, credit reports, hardship letters, tax returns, tax statements, BPO’s, cost analysis, purchase contracts and listing agreements."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Very fast paced enviornment
good,"It was a great place to work if you want to get experience on customer service and low sales. I was not to impressed by management because they were not even educated. The only way you would be able to move up was not because of your performance, but of who you knew."
good,"Good work life balance, however salary and benefits not as competitive to other employers. Culture is laid back."
good,"My day consists of much multi-tasking and research on processes and procedures. Learning is constant, since the job responsibilities have changed considerably from previous years of the same position with the predecessor banks. The job description has changed in a large part,and now consists of sales of Treasury products and services, along with the customer servicing. I have worked as a Wholesale Relationship Associate or comparable thereof for the 34 years of my employment with the company. The enjoyable part of my position is working with the clients in the customer service capacity in resolving issues and helping the client with their banking needs. The learning of Treasury products and services is enjoyable as well; however, the requirement of sales is not a part that I am comfortable with."
good,"This company depends on many thing where you work, who you work with, etc,, they are also well know for under paying employees-- no that is not a typo."
good,"My time at Wachovia was always interesting, constently sharpening and learning new skills. Management was good and the co-workers were helpful. The hardest part of my job was the long commute (97 mi) per day and the most enjoyable part was learning new and exciting job functions."
good,"Excellent training, for the transition from banking to the financial services industry."
good,I enjoyed the reverse mortgage field but Wells Fargo eliminated that line of business.

good,A typical day at work was good.
good,"Reviewed loan information, then input into system, I learned how to find mistakes, correct them and move on to the next problem."
good,WFB is a great company to begin and grow your career. There is room for advancement if you are a top performer (think 5%). Management and colleagues have always been a pleasure to work with however the daily sales and service goals are at times unacheivable. There is an intense amount of pressure and scrutiny to meet your goals.
good,get to cubical and answer calls for tech support. Learned about more indepth internet explorer settings. there was no room for advancement and no one on ones with management.

good,I really didn't like the job because of the fact that I had to commute roughly 1.5 hours to get to work.
good,Not the most ethical company or customer friendly. But they do treat there employees well!
good,"Overall coming from working in different call centers, the actual work of taking calls in the credit card department they are easy and straight forward. The management in the credit card department is minimal at best and not much room for growth in the department."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The hardest part it was the mandatory over time. sometimes we were working 60 plus hours a week. I think that took a toll on me and my co-workers.
good,"learn on balancing and cash handling, guest service. benefit and insurance reliable management on organize it's fun job."

Because we were confined to our desk and computers with headset our team leader made special days to reward individuals and the group as a whole. Each day small prizes were awarded and certificates handed out for overall performance. Sometimes group luncheons. We were first contact via phone with our customers and determined all their financial needs by asking open ended questions and helping to advise them further.

good,I was there as a contract worker and wished there were more opportunities to become a permanent employee.  But that was not how the company was structured in in terms of bringing on contract workers.

good,"The best part of my time with Wells Fargo was my team. We worked well together. When things went wrong (work was late, systems went down, etc,) we pulled together to get the work done regardless of the setbacks. I still keep in contact with many of my former coworkers to this day."
good,"Definitely a place to build your professional career. If you’re dedicated, there is much room for growth. Great benefits and paid time off. Quarterly Compensation and salaries could be better for service managers."
good,Wells Fargo offers very good benefits package and compensation plan along with PTO and personal holidays. Many of the retail branches run short-staffed year-round
good,The culture is very family oriented.  The management team is really top notch and helpful.  They do a lot within the community.  There is a lot of room for advancement just not in my current role.
good,I enjoyed my time there. My manager was competent and did not mind helping those in need. The benefits are a lot better than most employers. Most employees are knowledgeable and helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co-worker and the supervisor were very helpful, great location, clean environment, hands on from the team leads, I enjoyed it"
good,i worked at Wells Fargo for 11 years and works for some really great leaders who have taught me valuable life lessons. While there i received a variety of additional leadership and manager development training. The culture changes based on who you work for.
good,It was comfortable working there. I felt safe. Certain supervisors were good leaders and some were micro managers. I expressed my medical problems was and dismissed.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good company but structure is changing a lot, good benefits and somewhat flexibility on hours. Room for growth within the company every 1 depending how good you are"
good,wells strived to make customers feel at ease when dealing with problematic situations while providing there employee's with the proper tools to handle most if not all situations.
good,"For the amount of work done in the production and fulfillment side of the business,  the compensation was not adequate.  Advancement was based on who you know and not merit."
good,"It is an easy relaxed environment. Overtime was easy to pick up and was paid at time and a half. If you wanted to stat late, that was acceptable and encouraged."
good,It's a pretty okay place to work. They pay well but the constant stress of meeting impossible goals is not worth it. I've most definitely had better jobs.
good,"Daily duties included fielding calls from insured's from throughout the United States, handling all types of inquiries. Focusing on retention and remarketing."

good,Learn a lot about how to be financial and enjoy meeting new people and talking. a typical day at work is opening and getting everything ready and then gathering night drop and making sure you look professional and then going on to helping customers. at the end of the day have to make sure to lock everything and put everything away where it belongs and have to do everything in a specific way.
good,"People friendly environment where being receptive to new ideas and feedback is a MUST. Highly recommended! Compensation & Benefits are great compared to others,  family oriented staff and environment where you can literally be yourself!"
good,"No upper management support to improve and involve employees"
good,Generally speaking a good place to work. Work culture varies a lot from department to department along with business site to business site.   Generally speking the company wants employees to succed but like alot of other large banks and corporations they responde to share holders alot quicker than employees.
good,Going thru changes........................................................................................................................................................Learned a lot over the years I have been there. Changes every month it seems like which is expected. Workplace has its good moments especially with your co workers. Supervisors are cool but the changes come from the upper management when it comes to making it more difficult to achieve your monthly numbers.
good,"- a typical day at Wells Fargo would begin a 8am and end anywhere from 4 to 8pm, depending on the work load that day"
good,Wells Fargo was a great experience and I really learned out during my time there. My reasons for leaving wasn't because of the job itself just management.
good,we rarely try to tell a customer we can't do something we always find a way to get what needs to be done for the customer done also you have to worry about customers themselves opinion.
good,"I like the salary and incentives,they have good human relationship and facility is awesome, i ve been working for 2 years and i received more certificates like best phonebankers"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Nice company to work. Workplace culture is good, you get most of the time support from them. Most hardest part is strict data access policy. It has taken several months to get access then you actually start working on it. Amenities are excellent and you enjoy your day."
good,Execution is definitely a part of the culture here at Wells. Team members work very hard for the customers and everyone wants to do what’s right for the customer.
good,"Depending on the branch you work for will really give you a different outcome of the experience you'll have with this company. For the most part, if your management team cares about your team members then the room for growth is impeccable."
good,"Started at one location, but ended up becoming an unofficial travel teller due to teller shortage. Overall, I met some great people at each branch i worked."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. It provides a lot of opportunities for their employees and is a great environment to be in. I love being able to build relationships with the towns people.

good,"Good place to work for and start your career."
good,Working  there  was  a great  experenice.  The  flexible  work  space  was  a  great  benefit  of  the job.  The  downtown  campus  was  really  nice  as well.
good,"Great culture - lots of changes, job security was question, communication was poor, It was difficult to advance due to consolidation of the business.  Uncertainty of a future"
good,I like Wells Fargo but want to move forward to something new. Would recommend a friend for this job. Had a great experience working here. Just need something new.
good,Work life balance needs to be improved when working at the call center. Schedule changes are every three months according to performance status or if you liked by management. Changes are very obviously inconsistent and the favoritism show's when scheduling decisions are made.
good,"Good work culture"
good,Wells Fargo is a diverse place to work. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the customers and managing the teller line. I learned about compliance and operations which was my strong point.
good,It was a challenging place to work with customers screaming and challenging fees. The benefits are awesome and the work environment was okay. The pay was decent.
good,"More than 17 years of experience in planning, developing and implementing IT Technology and Infrastructure solutions.Actively looking for Sr Program/Project Manager jobs"
good,The workplace was very comfortable and management was great. I never had a problem with management or coworkers everyone got along nicely. Everyday tasks are simple and pleasing.
good,Most management tends to micromanage and change some rules according to how they think things should be done. Fellow staff members are very friendly. Great benefits!!!
good,"Strong organization, striving to be the best in the financial industry.  Good benefits and culture. Strong support of community and diversity within the company."
good,Overall its not a bad place to work. Hours are steady and pay is good if you meet sales goals. If you dont meet goals for 3 months out of the year you will be let go. Dress is casual to very casual. Break rooms are nice.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great place to work.Great co-workers that really cared about the work.Management was attentive and responsive to any and all issues. Would absolutely recommend to others to pursue a  career there.
good,"Good People to work with.  A more comfortable atmosphere, but management was switched around too many times.  I did branch processing which I enjoyed more than a processing center"
good,"Wells Fargo has a great culture; however, it is highly competitive when it comes to advancing your career. You can expect the amount of individual focus as much as you would with any large corporation."
good,"Customers know and appreciate their visibility in the community.  Wells Fargo has lots of offices in order to provide customers with the best, most comprehensive services."
good,"The trickle down effect that Wells Fargo says it has with promotion, recognition, and job stability is not happening. Wells still makes it's profit off of cutting employees and resources."
good,Enjoyed my brief tenure with Wells Fargo. They hired me when no one else would following a layoff at Bank of America. Worked for a terrific boss. Was part of a great PMO in Commercial Real Estate Bank.
good,Working in investigations is an interesting field to work in and has room for growth. Downside is the paid time off offered / sick days offered. A lot would improve if Wells Fargo would restructure their benefits / time off policy.
good,it is a very diverse amount of people. It is a busy fast pace work place. You have to have a lot of patience when working here with the different types of customers you are dealing with.
good,Large company with a family type feel.  Throughly enjoyed working for Wells Fargo.  Processes could use a little work but overall a good experience.  Would work there again.
good,Need more advanced mentality at work. Need work life balance. There is no pressure but should use more advanced techniques to learn and compete with others.
good,"It is a stressful place to work, however it does provide a work/family life balance. Also work with a great group of team members that are always willing to assist with the workload."
good,"Scheduled hours between 8:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Greet customers, open/close checking and savings accounts, CD's, took applications for personal and home equity loans. Enjoyed meeting and working with all customers."
good,I didn't like it because it was heavy dependent on sales( commissioned based only). If you are great at sales then this is the position for you. I was looking for something with a salary but was looking for a job that was better then my last one. Wells Fargo has great tools but the right people need them to make it. I just wasn't one of those people.
good,"Entirely depends on the team, project, manager. Overall the work i was involved was challenging and learning. But it all depends as I said. FOr me I had nice work environment."
good,"Wells Fargo matches 6% of your pay 100% for 401(k)s. There are also bonuses and other perks for exempt employees at a certain level. Tuition reimbursement for anyone. Like any company, some managers are great, others not so much. All in all it's not a bad spot to work."
good,a typical bank to work. didn't learn much and management was okay. workplace culture is not so great and hardest part of the job was figure out what to work on
good,"worked here for 18 years, i left because the environment wasn't healthy for me, My sanity is more important than money, which they stopped giving me a raise three years ago., No room for advancement, i felt racially profiled, and i don't want to work for a company like that."
good,"Overall a great place to work, very specific skills learned. Customer focused, employee engagement focused, someone always willing to help with any task."
good,"The team was great to work for with a lot of personalities.  We were work oriented to get things accomplished, but not in a stress induced manner.  The job experience did not allow me to enhance my career per say, but that was what the position was about - proofreading Data Dictionaries for online applications."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo Advisors is a premier financial services firm, serving investors nationwide through more than 14,000* Financial Advisors We provide advice and guidance on a full range of strategies to help maximize the elements of your financial life."
good,"Assisted clients in and out of vehicle."
good,if I lived closer to west lake I would’ve stayed and grown with in the company it was really a pleasure. They offered so many benefits and accommodations.
good,Good place to work. Lots of PTO and decent benefits.  Match 6 percent for 401k. Pay could be better but they seem to be working on it....... .........
good,"The experience working in this company varies depending on the line of business you are in.  Working in Wholesale is very different than working in Community Banking, which is different than working in Technology.  Like all companies there are pros and cons working here.  It has been a very good company for me."
good,"Depending on your manager, you might be able to work from home at least one day a week, benefits are great - PTO, medical, dental, stock purchase options, 401k"
good,I worked as a loan officer at Wells Fargo for less than a year. The job has decent training and benefits package. The structure is very regimented and may not be best for experienced LOs. A good place to start In the industry.
good,"A typical work day would consist of a number of loans to be processed from a disbursed pipeline. The culture was very diverse and the morale was very high. I learned that the only thing ""constant"" is ""change'"
good,"This is a great company to work for. There are many opportunities in this company with over 200,000+ employees. There are much more opportunities in the metropolitan markets."
good,Working for Wells Fargo at Banker Connection was a great experience. I managed to absorb a lot of information in the short year that I have been employed there and would recommend it.
good,"A typical day started with emails from my manager with ""to-dos"" or requests for status.  Once those emails were completed, I could spend my time learning.  I would have preferred more of an intent based leadership style."
good,N/A.... i would rather not submit a review at this current moment for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo strives for excellence in customer service and equal opportunity.
good,"Good place to work but management can make selling items too difficult . People just want their money and u have to sell other products like a saving account , loans Etc"
good,I liked working for this company till my mom got into a car accident and my daughter had to have her apendix removed. I had not been there a year i had to quit my job because fmla would not work with me
good,Great place to work and grow within the company. Everyone is a team player and feel family oriented. Company is always growing and provides new opportunities
good,"Generally good, high stress in customer care and recovery. Good benefits and opportunities to transition positions. Good amount of PTO and holiday time."

good,"Wells fargo is a good workplace, management treat there employees with respect and value us. The hardest part of the job is trying to get fulltime hours"

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"a nice  working environment high paced."
good,"They should judge you by your current work ethic. "
good,With the right position Wells Fargo can be a rewarding place to work. Wells Fargo care about it's employees and has visions and value. The company is fair to its employees.
good,Production environment in cash vault.  Processed deposits brought in from armoured car drivers. Provided change orders to commercial customers and other bank branches.
good,It’s Decent company with great benefits . The management is great and is a reason I enjoy working for the company. I appreciate the bonus structure and the events that were made available to us.
good,"I retired from this company at a time when the sales environment was out of control. Still exceeded my goals but worked harder than necessary to keep customers. The grind was real, the smiles became uncomfortably superficial. Fortunately the culture has changed from what I can surmise of current associates but the customer base fall out seems to continue.  I think this would be a great place to work NOW to regain assets and clients because their operational procedures reflect customer satisfaction priorities in reality not just on paper.  Time will tell."
good,"As a company, Wells Fargo was great. I truly enjoyed the people I worked with, and management was readily available to assist. The fast-pace and competitiveness made it easy to work hard to achieve company goals."
good,"If you like have independence and managing your work load this is a job for you.  Communication is key, being able to explain documents needed and then reviewing and understanding the documents you received to ensure the underwriter is receiving a complete file to be able to complete their requirements and complete the file."

good,"	Customer service"
good,There are lots of potential career development  growth at wells Fargo But overall management not so great . Especially with all the recent undergoing continuous  changes to policy and produces .
good,"Nice Friendly environment to work in. Great Benefits and Great Vacation time. Easy to move around in the company. You get paid for Holidays off and you get every Holiday , except Good Friday ."
good,"I enjoyed the team the most.  The job had long hours at the end of every month, quarter and year end.   Was very stressful at times.  Team get togethers were fun."
good,Wonderful working environment. Great incentives abs health coverage. Great schedule and time off options. Managers were good with teaching new information.
good,"Get used to the tech  center until they get you a security pass...  :)"

good,"The teams I worked for were super friendly and supportive. They made the job much better! We helped each other out when we had questions, or had to go through training. The customers were regulars and they always made me smile each time they came in."
good,"Teller is a great entry level job that gives you a feel of what a professional work place is like. Unfortunately, Once you work in retail, it's hard to move up outside of the department. Job can be slow and transnational but are STRONGLY encouraged to talk to every single customer. Job is fun and bearable, IF you get to work for a good manager..."
good,I did not have any issues working for Wells Fargo as a company. Unfortunately I can't say the same for management or team leads. If you have a good manager then you are good to go. I didn't which made coming to work unpleasant.
good,Get to work from home from time to time and work is straight forward. Just need a job that is full time with benefits as I have a family and need to keep our future in mind. Love the people I work with and easy to work with.
good,Great college job that allowed me to work between class schedule. Opportunities to learn about the banking industry and interact with clients within the community.
good,Great place to be at good people. Days went by rather quickly busy all the time. Had a team that was very productive and had great interaction with each other.
good,"Great break rooms, the have games and ping pong tables, tvs etc. Its quiet and clean. Not enough sitting space even though everyone's break time is different. They don't allow enough personal time. You can't use phones on the floor which is fine, but you also have no down time between calls to ask simple questions. Break times aren't long enough to walk to the car and back."
good,"Good company to work for with a steady job and opportunity to grow. Good support from team members as well as from cross functionally teams."
good,Go in with your head held high. Always make eye contact. Listen. Be open minded. Try to remain positive even in difficult situations. Never be afraid to ask for help.
good,Greeting customers and thanking them for their business each visit.Completing deposit and withdrawal requests for customers.Offering various financial products to customers. Answering the telephone in a timely and professional manner.
good,"The job was quick paced some days and slow other days.  My job was to supervise the teller line, approve or deny the deposit and cashing of large sum checks as well as ship and receive currency to and from the back office as well as foreign currency brokers.  Very heavy cash handling.  Lots of customer service and de-escalating angry people.  The only bad thing I can say about Wells Fargo is they have a culture of being sales driven.  Even if you are an excellent team member, sales always come first and you could potentially lose your job if the goals aren’t met. This is why they have been in the news for having employees do unethical things to get sales quotas met.  I think they should calm down on the sales goals and focus on customer care.  Other than that I loved the job and the people I worked with at multiple locations."
good,Wells Fargo has good benefits. Personally I would not go back to work for them because at the time it was hard to get promoted. If they would focus on promoting educated and talented team members they can retain more staff.
good,Fast paced mortgage environment. No day is the same. I learned a lot about the mortgage and finance business. I also learned several different systems.
good,"Good work environment and fellow team mates were good at helping out if any questions, felt good to go to work each day, would have stayed longer if site was not closed"
good,Wells fargo was a good place to work and the people there were great. Had fun everyday great training grate people always learning new things new people
good,"I like Wells fargo, They have been good to me. I worked in a very nice area of town and was able to enjoy my work space. I wish I would have had more one on one training to do my job before they had to do a huge mass lay off."
good,Do not wish to answer. Due to working conditions and being employed by a staffing agency.  The ability to answer this question is irrelevant. Thank you for your time.
good,"the work place culture at wekks fargo is very friendly and culturally inclusive ."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wonderful customers and a wonderful place to work without the bad apples."
good,"Always pushing to hit sales goals. Typical day was meeting with new and existing clients, opening new accounts, consumer loans, and providing great customer service."
good,The company offers a good environment that doesn't compromise your ethics and has a healthy cooperative atmosphere. The benefits are also quite good which is definitely a plus as well.
good,"Work life balance is not super great, the job can be very interesting or very boring depending on what you are staffed on, learned a lot about various credit products and structures, definitely a good first job with good exit opportunities"
good,"- Great Management: Every morning we had a 20 minute meeting before opening the branch to talk about our metrics and to follow up on how everyone was doing."
good,"When I started out as a part timer, I was offered benefits! Great company for furthering career in banking. Lots of room for networking when you go to help other branches in the same district as your own. Only downfall for me is poor management. Effective management is very important and could make or break your overall experience."
good,"Wells Fargo is the best company I have worked for in USA. It provides the opportunity to develop oneself, and fully supports diversity and has a robust community support program. I have learnt a lot from self-taught internal courses from the learning center, raging from programming languages (C++, JavaScript, Java, Python, etc) to automated testing (Jenkins, Selenium, etc) and Production (Splunk, App Dynamics, AutoSys, etc). Also cloud technologies, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, for cloud compute. This also includes frameworks such as Spring MVC and Pivotal Cloud Foundry."
good,"I enjoyed my time working  for Wachovia.  It was a pleasure working along side management, staff and different departments. lots of room for growth and career advancement"
good,I enjoyed my time overall at Wells Fargo.  I learned a lot.  It was good to meet the people I did and it gave me a good understanding on how banking works.
good,"People are really friendly, manager are very nice, and work load is not bad. learned new tool like DBFit and learn banker business. the time take to work is long thru."
good,"Its was a Great place to work, and it wasnt a hard Job to Learn. If you dont have any banking experience they will give you the opportunity and allow you to go to school while working with your schedule."
good,"Teamwork as it should be!  No competition. Employees are praised for their accomplishments and given training where they need it.  Management open, available, approachable and willing to help meet deadlines."
good,The company wanted to be sure that everyone was compliant and worked tirelessly to improve employee moral. It seemed not a week would go by where we did not receive some sort of appreciation for our hard work.
good,"The office that I worked in was full of wonderful people, however the job itself did not require a whole lot of critical thinking to get done, so I got bored fairly quickly."
good,We were always busy with new clients and new products. The branch manager was a high energy gal that loved her employees and always tried to be fair. Unfortunately the manager spot turned over often.
good,Quick to get you in but will fire you just as fast! I had a miscarriage and my supervisor was not accommodating at all. Managers are a joke honestly cause they don’t know what their doing unless they’ve been there. They promote quickly and they do have good benefits.
good,While working at Wells I have always had a great experience. When leaders from other banks come with years of experience and culture it shifts things a bit.
good,"Working with W.F is definitely worth it. Awesome experience and you have an opportunity to get benefits. Also, the hours are great and you do not work on Sundays!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Team support was amazing and supportive.Everyone in the team felt needed. Leaders also were very helpful and received critics and positive feedback from their team
good,"great place to work, room for advancement, good benefits, room for growth, allows you to use your skills to advance within the company, Good leadership"
good,"Rough sales goals but great people. I enjoyed the work environment and the teaching opportunities that were afforded to me. The district managers had too high of sales standards, however."
good,"I left the banking business right as Wachovia was transitioning to become Wells Fargo. I enjoyed banking but I wasn't making enough money at the time. The skill set that I learned there was irreplaceable. From customer experience, to handling customer issues and employee issues, it was a very educational and beneficial job."
good,"Called in two times per year to help with peak periods of Student Loan Application Processing."
good,Information related to my work experience is best relayed during a meeting. Feel free to contact me via email or direct phone call in reference to learning more about my great work experience at Wells Fargo.
good,"n/a there is nothing to tell, it was a contract job with no chance of expanding the job roll , don't know how else you would like me to state it.. there was no going forward there"
good,Changes to positions and structures. Unsure of direction since problems. Changes to system and focus not on employees that stayed and loyal but on new hires
good,"Meet so many people on daily and build a relationship with them. Employees are great to work with. The benefits are good, full benefits even if you are part time."
good,had lots of changes during my tenure and upper management was not always in tune and did not treat people with respect but on the local level was amazing
good,"O,K. for contract job.  Wish it had continued,"
good,"I've worked at Wells Fargo for 7 months now, and I can say that I do like the atmosphere of the workplace.  It's very casual.  I often see people talking and joking around while they work.  The managers are all very helpful and available to help, so long as you are willing to ask.  That being said.  The work I currently do can get very tedious, and it can be hard to maintain focus.  As long as you can keep your self attentive, it is a good place to start a professional career."
good,"Wells Fargo & Company is an American multinational financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with central offices throughout the United States. It is the world's fourth-largest bank by market capitalization and the fourth largest bank in the US by total assets"
good,"I have worked for this company for 15 years and enjoy the culture I feel they do great in customer service.  I feel that sometimes too much effort is spent on micromanaging versus addressing more important issues."
good,I really enjoyed working for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.  I was a great working environment and my managers were very accommodating with some of my medical/health needs.
good,"Depending on where you work, or your job description, you may or may not enjoy your job. I fortunately enjoyed my job experience. However, I was fortunate to work in an environment that I enjoyed."
good,"I returned to the mortgage industry after the housing/mortgage crash of 2009-2010 due to financial issues and with my extensive background a mid-level UW position was offered.  "
good,going through A transition period with a lot of uncertainty. Great place to work while going to school very difficult to make a career because of the limited opportunities but can be worth it if given the chance.
good,"Starting out this was a nice company to work for, however this company should revamp the morning management. if the career growth was actually as easy as promised i would consider staying but once your in the phone bank department you kind of get stuck there."
good,I used to love working here.  Said I would never leave but that quickly died for reasons I don't feel like getting into.  Maybe if you had different mangers than I then you would love it longer. Advancement is all political.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"There is always something to do and something to learn , the management expect you to get you job first and then you can have you down time , they are very fair but sometimes to hard and do expect to much for the pay"
good,Relaxed and comfortable place to work but few opportunities for advancement in the office I was in. Negative press in recent years made Client Service more challenging I managing impressions of the company.
good,"Everybody works hard in an appreciative culture. "
good,Very collaborative teams and a grate company that provide you the opportunity to get familiar with new skills and to use you skills and experience fully with no  micromanagement.
good,"If you have a family and kids,consider spending most weekends and holidays working.  Other than that the benefits are rewarding in itself.  I would recommend younger people with no family to start a career here."
good,"I was disappointed that they closed our office in Aberdeen. The job marked here is difficult to find a job that would meet all my need to afford all my bills. The pay is min or less, its hard to meet ends without having to work several job instead of focusing on one job"
good,Wells Fargo is a good employer with numerous benefits.call center with good and comfortable equipment . I would recommend anyone that is staring in the call center field to enter this great paying company .
good,I liked my manager but prior struggles made work difficult to make an income you felt comfortable in.  There were things beyond my control impacting my income
good,Project Management very similar to working at any other bank. There will be times that will be fast paced and others that will require you to be flexible and adjust to shifting priorities.  Its just another day in the life of a PM.
good,"Not the best of times, not the worst of times. It helped pay the bills and there is plenty of room for growth. I enjoyed working there on most days, just a few events caused me to leave."
good,"Work wasn't bad, fun place to work but no bonus's or incentives and when you wanted to apply for better positions it was almost like taking a lateral move hard to advance."
good,Very hard to move up here.  People are good and the flexibility is great.  Love the people love the flexibility.  Want ability to move up without having to leave role.
good,"Great place to work, back then there was an opportunity to make lots of money as a young person and doing so by being honest. Not sure what the incentive program is now. Sales were big and the pressure trickled the way down. The only way to get a raise is through a promotion"
good,Efficient team - good folks to work with.  This was a difficult project to manage with the US deployment of over 100000 phones and competing resource allocations.
good,The job was ok I learned a lot about banking.   I was a good experience.   The lunch breaks could have been longer. Part-time was good hours were good pay was decent.
good,"Overall I loved the company, I hate I had to leave do to my health issues however I’m grateful for every opportunity given and every experience gained"
good,On the phone 90% on the time answering questions concerning their mortgage.  Answering questions concerning their escrow and taking payments for their mortgage and answering questions about refinance and any products that they may find helpful.
good,Wells Fargo is a good lender when compared with other national banks.  There systems are very fast and can produce quick results for mortgage customers.
good,A good place to start your career.  There is plenty of opportunity to advance and change departments. The bank is really community service oriented and gives you opportunity to serve your community.
good,At Wells Fargo I enjoy the role of a Personal Banker. I enjoy helping customer succeed financially. The work environment is very welcoming and organized.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"working in a wells fargo call center in birmingham al was not bad at all, good environment and good leadership. the sales goals was very unrealistic though."
good,Back to back phone calls every day. Be prepared to problem solve under pressure! Workplace culture is intense as you are required to offer products and services that might benefit the member.
good,wells fargo is a good job for single parents who dont have small children they are mostly 2nd shift and they are big on attendance. but it is a good place to work
good,Good place to work.  Commute is difficult through downtown Dallas but bearable.  Company is good at communication - meetings are short and allow you to accomplish your goals for the day.
good,Working at wells has its struggles like most companies.  What I love about Wells is that they develop their employees and prepare them for the next level.
good,I learned a lot about wealth management and banking with this company. I enjoyed the work experience and everything about banking that I learned while with the company.
good,job is a call center job. when i was there it was a lot of salees that really made the job feel high pressured. They dont do that now but it was very flexible hours. had to worry about adherencee to schedule.
good,"Work was much easier than outlined in the interview, but the work quickly ran out and several of us were laid off.  Training was adequate, but management seemed to want to take things especially slow."
good,The culture is very inclusive and the people are friendly. The pay sale was fairly average.  The opportunity for advancement was not that good but they would usually find special projects rather than lay off employees.
good,"While my work was time sensitive and had to be kept to its critical path, there were many resources and partnerships that made this less stressful than one would expect.  My Manager was a roll-up-your-sleeves type person and regularly stepped up to help keep projects moving, when needed."
good,The company leadership was not what I expect so I left. Very poor communication skills used by head top leaders in the Boise back office department. The branch/back office were totally 180 from each other.
good,"It is fast pace and challenging, diverse working environment, promotes team spirit.sometimes can be very demanding, big on products sales and services."
good,Good company but needs to improve pay structure they also need to review management reguraly great work atmosphere and training   Helpful if needed.  Lead opportunity
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work with in terms of the benefits that they offer.  The work culture varies by location and management.  They are not very consistent in that aspect, you tend to see a lot of change and new faces."
good,This is an awesome place to work if you want a stable place to work with regular hours. It's always a plus if you speak Spanish especially closer to big cities
good,handling escalation internal and external. Meeting review policy and procedures.  Side by Sides and training with team members.  Answering questions on the floor.  Creating and reviewing reports on daily.
good,"While employed with Wells Fargo, My first year was great until, my hours were cut and the travel time (They transfered me to a location that was 30 miles past the original location) to work increased.  Then I encountered job harrassment that I had gotten let go because I made a complaint to the appropriate manager."
good,"No comment to this section. Went from good to bad over the years, but just the office I was at. I don't like that I am forced to type in this box, as I do not want to comment."
good,"A lot of teams still use legacy technology, the management is wary about making cutting edge technological changes."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Pay was great but I worked 80 hours a week and had a terrible boss. I was right out of school and not ready to put in 80 hour weeks which was expected of us.
good,"On a day to day basis Wells Fargo is a fantastic job environment to learning what it is like to work for a large business. I have enjoyed learning how the culture can drive a company. The experiences learned at Wells Fargo is easily transferrable to any business. There is always a time to learn more and gain more experiences. Management at times could be difficult, but learning multiple types of communication styles between leaderships and team members was extremely helpful. The worst part about working for Wells Fargo was the job security and promotional options."
good,Very flexible and trusting with remote work opportunities. Wells has a great attitude towards saving the shareholder money and not wasting time or opportunity.
good,"Overall good place to work. Pretty simple, no micromanagement. I learned how to speak to customers over the phone in a manner that would be approachable."
good,Wells Fargo is a growing company and have very nice knit family people that works together. It's not a place you feel like a oh no feeling this job place. Room for advancement is there. Great overall!
good,started with a new team and a lot of learning curve on both side. We work individually but help each other if needed. Lots of overtime sometimes mandatory. Travel was difficult at times do to distance. overall a good place to work
good,"There are other banks that pay more for the same job, plus they have sales in which I miss the sales and they pay. I wish they would show more appreciation to their workers."
good,Wells Fargo has great culture and wonderful 401K and PTO benefits. The pay can be better on the service side as well as the insentives. Wells Fargo offers you lots of financial experience.
good,"constantly have to learn new rules, heavily regulated, nice teamwork but sometimes competitive because at the end of a day you are only a number, nothing else"
good,"Overall a decent place to work for, depending on the location of where you live. Most of the managers are good and responsive to with a work/life balance."
good,"phone customer service was the main point here making sure all customers' questions were answered and offering them opportunities as necessary, commission was paid for this as well"
good,"I moved up pretty quickly due to having friends in higher places, however if the managers you work for are poorly qualified you will be passed up on many opportunities for advancement."
good,despite WFB recent set-back; it's a great bank with much to offer its customers and employees; the culture was based on strong credit underwriting and great customer service
good,"This is a fun place to work, but a lot of hours spent staring into computer screens. Management does their best to make everyday fun and entertaining though. I say cut throat because of accuracy reports your manager gets and time sheet you have to update when working on loans."
good,"Not a bad place to work, just very big corp rules and standards. The reviews were old school and out dated but the work environment was good and the fellow workers were very qualified."
good,"Smart  engaging people to work with, in a friendly environment. "
good,I was in a branch setting.  There was not a lot of room to move if no one left and you wanted to stay at that branch.  The position kept you busy so the time went by fast.
good,"Great Training, Great systems, fun workplace. Many positions available depending on your preference. Had the pleasure to work with great former managers. Great learning experience."
good,"I enjoyed working there, was at the same branch for 7 years. I enjoyed getting to know customers and assisting them in their financial solutions. I struggled with seeing the same people over a course of 7 years and trying to meet branches quarterly goals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Management is lousy. Good coworkers and work environment. Plenty of turnover so schedules can be hectic. Promise you growth but sometimes don't live up to those promises.
good,This is not a place that I would recommend to anyone of they plan on working at this particular location. However I have had the opportunity to visit other sites and would love to join their environment.
good,Great environment wonderful place for advancement and job security. Awesome work place to learn and demonstrate great people skills and leadership. Strongly recommended
good,A typical day for me can be a very busy day. I deal with team members that I have to stay focus on to ensure we are meeting deadlines and that I am giving them what they need to do their jobs.
good,"The experience you will have will depend a lot on the specific business group you work for. The best part about the job is that the people you will be working with are dedicated professionals. Hardest part of the job is ""Change"" it can be a positive or a negative depending on the situation. Change is a constant in the business some of it can be cultural and some of it can be regulatory related."
good,I left for a better opportunity. The managers were disorganized and it was around the time that the mortgage system began to fail. I realized that the job wasn't a good fit for me and took a new opportunity/
good,this is  a very stable job. you have to meet the qualifications in order to maintain this position.  this position requires you to meet the certain qualifications
good,Wells Fargo was a nice place to work but they have got to work harder at helping employees in the area of career advancement. Even though an employee may start with a branch role if the employees wishes to pursue a back end role there should be support in place for that also and not just forcing the employee along the lines of only branch positions. It is a great way to get started in your banking career but don't sentence that employee to only branch roles.
good,"I was not a fan of the micro managing, the managers would do with almost every customer we saw at our window. The sale goals were way to high. Very unrealistic, they would make us make people have unnecessary checking accounts."
good,Good company to work for. Pay was good compared to the work i was completing. Management was fare and understanding to their employees. Workplace culture was fare.
good,"Scheduling was flexible and worked around school and other activities I participated in. Enjoyed working there, made some great connections and still keep in touch with them to this day even though I haven't been there for several years."
good,"it was a lot of work for what they pay, they always have to be tested on something or reviewing a new code etc. they made you have sells goals which to me was hard to believe because that's the bankers jobs"
good,This is a large financial institution with many divisions and a lot of locations. This is a very competitive company that strives to insure customer satisfaction.
good,"Was a great learning experience. Was involved with collecting the requirements, documenting the same and also testing. mostly manual testing but i am aware of automation also."
good,"Greeted customers"
good,Wells Fargo had a great training system and great managers. Daily numbers were always clear and there was always great communication with my supervisor.
good,"cold calling"
good,"Overall I learned a lot, and enjoyed my time with WF.  Management was supportive, and helped me improve as I grew with the company.  I was able to help people with their finances, which was rewarding."
good,"The branch I worked at was the only one in town, so it would be very chaotic at times. There would be a lot going on at once and you better know how to multitask. Best part was my coworkers. Management at the time only really cared about meeting sales goals. You deal with all walks of life and get to meet new people everyday. The work was pretty easy. People always seemed stressed though."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for. The benefit there is great, PTO is awesome,    The 401K plan employer contribution match 6-7% employee salary"
good,"I spent 17 years working for Wells Fargo, all in the mortgage department.  It was a great experience and I learned so much throughout my years of service."
good,Overall good company with potential for change and growth. Need to work on hiring better managers and promote people when time comes. Need to hire experienced people.
good,"over all 24 years with company, a lot of moving around & consolidating,  not able to expand my career with options given, most moves are arranged for you"
good,"Call center environment, have to stay in compliance with the bank, customer service friendly, online fraud claims assistance center, customer's call in to report fraud with there online baking username and password being compromised"
good,"It's a good job with a lot of responsibility. However, with hard work it is a good company to grow with-being that you would like a career in banking long-term."
good,Counting cash drawer before and after shift started and ended.  Provided excellent customer service.  Sold banking products for the benefit of the customer.  Talking to the customers was the fun part of my day!  The job wasn't to difficult.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work specially with all the changes. the pay is not good tho. very good PTO time and Vacay days. good changes are coming
good,"Worked at the Mortgage complex in West Des Moines, IA. Contract work ended and didn't really enjoy the atmosphere. Large facility and lack of manager attention to tasks at hand. (New program, manager had no idea of what we were processing during our work day.) Made me feel as if I was just one of the mass employees and think I would rather work in a smaller office and have a little more impact on the company I work for."
good,"Good benefits, fun work environment. Unrealistic sales goals. Typical day was to answer sales and service calls through out the day. Selling loans to customers in need."
good,"The best perk is the work / life balance.  The various jobs held over 20 years at WF have always allowed for a balance."
good,"Didn't like the way the manager's manage, she was favoring certain people and make others work to make up for it other than that it was a great job! i love to help the customers"
good,"You learn about people and their passions, I learn how to listen better, the hardest part is saying no to customer, most enjoyable part are customers."
good,Good work environment. Very competitive in the marketplace. Good benefits. Enjoyed my time there. Was able to achieve professional goals. Made lifelong friends while working there.
good,"Develops and maintains long term relationships with customers .Provides account services also"
good,"enjoyed the benefits and working experience. great start of the financial career, good work/life balance. has great coaching programs that will aid in career growth"
good,"Loved working there, but they worked me way too many Saturdays, ( way above what was promised), you had to be a cheating, slimy conman( trick people into sales) to move ahead( I understand that has changed). BUT, have not improved salaries.  Some managers are excellent, understand their success comes from their people.  That said, they did promote you being the best you that you could be, within your role.  Not too much on advancement, again because I literally had to correct the messes that were left behind by unscrupulous bankers.  Mostly, people who kissed a-- nicely were moved up, this was not a meritocracy. Sorry to put ut in such language, but you need to hear this. However, that IS most banks.  If I had my way, people who had kept the most loyal following of customers, had re-invigorated customers who were upset or leaving the bank AND who had positively grown sales,  THOSE people should have some consideration, not the cheaters and hustlers who could put on a nice face. ( What is that saying "" NEW customers are silver, the other like GOLD."" ).     The tops-down management NEVER listens to individual contributors, really out of step with modern management concepts.  They SAY they support teamwork, but their is no metric for teamwork."
good,"Flexible place to work with more options for work from Home."
good,"Left Wachovia Bank before the takeover by Wells Fargo. Notwithstanding, a couple of friends who work with Wells Fargo speak well of the Institution; that, it one great place to work."
good,Wells Fargo has change the way banks do business. Its a great place to learn how to coach to activities and behaviors instead of numbers and goals. Great Place
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good inclusive workplace culture.  Quick Paced projects.  Smart People.  Collabarative culture.  Good Management Team.  Goof company to contract with too.
good,"A typical day at work involves a friendly surrounding. Everyone is friendly. Its fast pace and structured. The Wells Fargo I work for is a Phone bank, I work in consumer banking as a Banker Coach. As a Banker Coach I not only handle incoming calls from customers concerning their account or debit cards but I also work as a team to coach new hires on their first phone calls."
good,"Good place to work.  Flexible, good benefits. Caring toward employees.  Profit sharing program.  Allow you to learn and build yourself at your own pace."
good,Wells Fargo Advisors is a good company with excellent management.  They care about employee career paths and make every effort to help you succeed.  Salaries are comparable to the rest of the industry.
good,Wonderful team and great company!  I would suggest that you make sure you follow your passion in every role - they have good opportunities for growth as well.
good,Good lace to work I met a lot of nice people there. The pay could be better considering the tellers do a lot of the work it takes to close the accounts for the company.
good,Wells Fargo has provided me with ample flexibility opportunities to work from home as well as several benefits of having 16 weeks maternal paid leave as well as a very competitive Paid Time off allowance.
good,"Previously the sales goals were high and hard to obtain.  Management trickled down expectations and made it an unsettling place to work, wondering if you would be fired.  Great benefits."
good,I was a lead teller at Wells Fargo.  I managed the Money got it ready to go down to the main bank downtown. I also ordered money for the branch.  I was the lead teller at two locations.
good,I feel the company did not concentrate enough on their employees to assist them in advancing within the company.  The work environment was very strict to the point that learning new thing outside of your specific job duties or participating in advancement opportunities was not really made available to participate in during the work hours
good,It is very much a bank. It has all of the professional rigidity and expectation of metrics based performance that any financial institution would possess.
good,"I really do not want to share my personal opinion on Wells Fargo. It was a great experience, I enjoyed it for the for the time being. It was an experienced well worth."
good,"I think that even though there were no more ""sales goals"" they still figured a way to sale in other words. the notebooks that they made us fill out were a waste of time. I didn't see a difference on how that helped. our manager would tell us to take ownership of the situation, but I think if the customer is specifically asking for management. why give them the run around and make us face them and end up aggravating the customer more, because you don't want to help or be bothered by them."
good,"Work place culture is not encouraging and there is a lot of bias towards people of color. Management will only select certain people to travel to other states for training and other career advancement opportunities, even when the so called staff were unqualified."
good,"flexible, competitive, a great place to work with opportunities for advancement available.   excellent benefits and paid time off.  people friendly environments with great use of innovation                                                                                                                                  ."
good,This is a good place to work. I learned a lot about money and finances. I was able to help people see a more clear picture when their financial needs were concerned.
good,the part time job was not entirely what I expected but the staff and office location were convenient for my needs until they closed that particular office.
good,They offered 1 hour lunches and were flexible with time off requests. I worked the night shift because my daughters were young at the time. The night managers were very nice and accommodating.
good,"Pretty good place to work. After the pay raise it made it a lot better as far as the paycheck. Overall, I liked it there, just found a different job that I like a lot more!"
good,Very hard to advance and pay increases were very low. Did not have the opportunity to get any certifications because production was more important.The company was very strict in reviewing loans and if you received a material finding it would cost you a deduction in any bonus that you might receive.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good place to work. Customer service was very important to the company and I liked that a lot.  WF also cares about their employees and advancement opportunities.
good,"Such a horrible excuse of a company! They treat their employees like trash! They claim to have an open door policy for you to voice your opinion about anything unlawful or unethical, but in my experience, when it involves a manager on the branch level the district manager and their boss will threaten your job and/or forced you to resign or be fired as I was. On top of that, the district manager lied to the Dept. of Social Service about the reason why I was no longer working there. I plan to file a lawsuit on this company !"
good,good pay good hours can be stressful at times based on needs from sales. better pay would be nice but the remote access and vacation packages are a nice perk
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that everyday I was helping  someone better their situation by providing all the helpful information I learned through out the years at Wells Fargo.
good,Not a bad place to work. Attentive managers that are good with communication. Calls are busy 3 weeks a month and slower the 4th week. Never a dull day.
good,"Overall, the company has great benefits and start pay. The coworkers are great. As long as your branch manager has a great personality and is personable, the rest of the employees will enjoy working."
good,Great place to start a career in banking and finance. Always someone willing to help and willing to offer advice on how to obtain your career and personal goals.
good,"If you're looking for a job that's steady and makes you some money, this is the job for you. In my area it's hard to get promoted and the minimum wage isn't enough to live on unless you supplement it with a second part-time job."
good,"I enjoyed working at WF due to constantly learning and good co-workers and leaders.  Strong, ethical company who expects integrity and strong work performance and in return provides good compensation with great employee benefits and 6% 401K match."
good,Typical 8:30 to 5:30 job. They broke down the closing funding process to make it very smooth. Not sure how operations are there now. It was my first real job out of college.
good,"I am working a contract position at Wells Fargo currently.  I like what I do, and have great co-workers.  Trying to gain more experience so that I can further my career in the financial industry."
good,"Great Company to work for, I'll be forever grateful for the opportunity to work for w-Wells Fargo. This company provided me with a new career path that was well overdue for me."
good,"Answering email, arranging meetings, manage calendars, arrange travel including and air and hotel, processing legal files."
good,"Wells Fargo Dealer Services has experienced a lot of changes over the past year. Several offices were consolidated into 4 ""HUBS"" The funding department is in constant overhaul."
good,"I say job security is pretty good depending on the department you work in. Id say stay clear of phone banking though, because of high turn over rate. ,,"
good,Assisted customers with calls and any questions they had. Assisted in sales to advance the company. Assisted in any additional assistance needed by my supervisor
good,"Nice place to work with nice coworkers. Only way to grow is to to move to a different team that has growth potential. For the amount of stress, it feels like the position is underpaid."
good,"There are days where your manager would sit in your cubicle and would do side by side coaching. During this time, you are engaging in talking to a customer, while your manager is listening to everything you are saying. After (and at time during) the call they coach you. I understand that this practice was put in place to make you better at your job but it's ultimately what caused to have so much anxiety during that time frame. The people there were amazing, some of which I still talk to today. Overall not for me"
good,Great name for your resume. Not a lot of opportunity for growth...somewhat easy to transition to divisions within the company...stable company that will sacrifice employees to maintain bottom line
good,Be reliable > Work smart > Take ownership > Find Solutions > Execute effectively > Support the team > Positive energy > Adapt well to change >  Just put your head down and keep on truckin'...
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Bureaucracy can get you down but it was okay.  Benefits are pretty good.  The work-life balance gets a little tricky once you get into a certain level.
good,The job isn't as bad. It can be quite stressful and can be quite agitated. One of the things I will always recommend is to create a customer relationship so you always have a happy customer.
good,"Wells Fargo can be a fine place to work. The compensation is above average - paid time off especially.  The work is challenging, and with the right frame of mind, you can see ways you might be helping the customer out."
good,"I enjoyed working there just hate i was let go because i had a car accident and missed to many days, even with doctors notes and release letters. All and all I enjoyed it easy work and friendly employees"
good,"A Fortune50 Company, one of the largest US banking institutions, headquartered in San Francisco financial center. Wide range of banking/financial employment work opportunities."
good,I enjoyed my time working with Wells Fargo.  Gave me the flexibility to work from home and my managers truly cared about my professional and personal life balance.  Enjoyed the work that I did and it was rewards most of the time.  My co-workers were very professional and I enjoyed what they brought to the table.
good,"A good place to work but tend to dismiss wrong doings by employees at higher levels in the company.  "
good,"I don't have mush else to say, i received the best training for my job to date i loved the people there, very friendly and willing to share knowledge. i would work for them again if the increase the pay."
good,"Any job is what YOU make it.  If you love what you do and your good at it, you can move up. At WFA there are always opportunities, if you want them. Right now I'm working out of a different branch and I have the chance to be in a different position for a few months.  Today I'm here by myself, but I'm up for the challenge.  I've been here since June and I've learned how to prepare expense reports, process ACATS, jrnls, wire transfers, ACH, IRA distributions for clients, opening/updating new accts."
good,My managers and coworkers were among the best I have ever had.  At the time I worked their the only major downside was the pushing sales culture which blew up as everyone knows.  From friends that still work there I have learned that has been curtailed and now the focus is solely on customer statisfaction.
good,"Program seemed to be falling apart due to company scandals, but pay was nice and my manager wasn't demanding. Extremely high cost of living around headquarters."
good,Worked privately self directed. Basic work materials are provided. Was a perfect place to work for the first 2 and half years. Company is great but individual management ruined a great company. Great to see they are aware of their past issues and working to hopefully return to a great company.
good,"If you like meeting new people every day, and doing something different for every customer, this is a great place to work. Everyone was always very helpful and friendly here!"
good,my memories of working for Wells Fargo are fond. I had opportunities to learn new skills. develop a work ethic that i still use today. Wells Fargo was a career launching pad.
good,Excellent benefits and good training program as well as work hours balance. I moved pretty fast since I was hired considering that i came form a financial background
good,"Great entry level positions with room for rapid career growth.  Always changing environment, so be prepared with a flexible and positive attitude.  Many great leaders."
good,"Getting good management is a crapshoot. It depends of the department. My last manager was young and inexperienced. Our whole team fleed as soon as she was promoted. The benefits and culture are really good. They match your 401k and medical insurance is affordable. If you do your job well, you will keep your job. Layoffs do happen frequently but thats part of the industry."
good,It was a great place to work.  There was alot of training because of processing software was changed several times.  Travel was to San Diego to sit with Operations which was helpful.
good,Pay for experience workers could improve or not be the same as someone starting. Would had like to see improvement  because some teller know how to do other jobs.
good,Good place to work just not much room for advancement after level 2 supervisor. Can be a calm environment if you keep to yourself and do your job but have call center environment at times also
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Great company to work for. Offered great benefits but the weekend hours became old. Enjoyed the people I worked with and the relationships with customers.
good,"Long hours, solid management, significant deal experience, decent pay, poor quality of life but great colleagues that will keep you company at night.  You know what you are signing up for."
good,"balance drawers and cash check, do money orders, open up accounts building a relaltionship with the customers who comes in often and being for sure of the financial needs"
good,Decent place to work. was a good balance from personal live to work. manager was fair and understanding. training was good. Good company to learn and grow
good,"Typical business casual environment. This is a consultant position, so assignments can range from 1-2 years and some less. There is opportunity to gain an array of experience due to the company having to fulfill client obligations so work is streamed for accuracy, dependability and quality."
good,Wells Fargo for me was a great place to work. Management was very knowledgeable and they cared about their employees. My experience at Wells Fargo was a good one.
good,"Initially it was great and then the manager above me was replaced. It was a job that could have been better if the manager above me was better. I worked for a misogynist. HR  offered very little support as they had just been outsourced. Sometimes, in order to get my reports approved, I would send them through a male colleagues email and hide my signature to get approval. "
good,Very good working environment and a very good team to work with. they have such a variety of different technology to work with. They promote each and individual to learn new technology and promote them to take more responsibility
good,"My position is a contract position so I'm not well versed in their benefits. The culture in my department is collaborative and supportive."
good,"Available upon request."
good,"You knew what was expected of you everyday. Everything was by the book, you were very focused and determined to meet the goals that were asked of you. There was no funny business"
good,"A lot going on within the company. So large that it is hard to get things done in a timely fashion. Often too many cooks in the kitchen, and most of them, are not aware of what the others are doing."
good,"To begin this job, it would be relatively helpful to learn banking terms, such as; interest, compounding interest, secured and unsecured loans. Without knowledge of banking, this job can be difficult to keep up with. There is opportunity to learn during training, as that is an extensive 6 weeks."
good,I really enjoyed that the whole branch worked together as a team to help customers. I really learned more about financing and exceeded in customer experience.
good,Wells Fargo pay did not cover the costs of living at about $13 an hour. Unfortunately with technology growing the need for tellers is decreasing. The standards they hold you to for sales are ridiculous because you see the same customers day in and day out there are only so many checking accounts you can open for one person.
good,"Wells Fargo, has come along way.  They have made their mistakes, but taken great strides to correct. them.  They are revamping their whole company by re training their employees, hiring quality individuals and rectifying there wrongs.  I am looking forward to returning to Wells Fargo to be apart of the change."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to et your feet wet in banking.  Their technology was very up to date compared to other banks, but they were incredibly stressful to work for.  Management was hit or miss.  Spend 3-5 years at Wells Fargo, then go elsewhere for a career in banking."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo was a nice company to work for. There is just no room for growth because management like for you to stay beneath them.[ They have great benefits and overall the company is great.
good,Responsible for the sales of commercial banking products focusing on companies with revenue of $10 - $50MM in sales.  The company is the 4th largest bank in the country and we operate with over 86 business partners to provide a comprehensive relationship to prospect and existing clients.
good,Great people to work with. Relax environment. Mostly coding and some meeting. The facility is very good. The location is very convenient. Great place to work!!!
good,"I spend my day reviewing documents for accuracy and completion.  If the information is incomplete, I reach out to various parties (settlement agents, builders, real estate agents, customers and Wells Fargo Fulfillment Team) by several methods (mail, phone, email and fax) to complete."
good,"a great place to work, "
good,Big institution that has a corporate culture that sometimes surpasses individual groups needs. Some good people and fair compensation and benefits. Nice office.
good,"loved working here atmosphere   is  great helpful  team leads  great hours . great incentives flexible work schedules and lots of  food parties."
good,"Great Company to Work for , Financial Crimes Should be paid more due to the amount of fraud and the claims process.  Overall a great company to work for but Salary should be higher."
good,Good place to work. Good work culture. Adapts to new technology. Good many on job trainings. Work environment is regulated. Potential to learn and apply new things.
good,"Very good working environment."
good,"Great work environment. Lots of opportunities to grow. Some locations have more affluent clients than others but overall great clientale.Networking and volunteer opportunities are amazing. Hardest part about the job is getting familiar with all of the job families. If you're not sure what direction you want to go in, its difficult to get assistance in a career path."
good,"This company offers a generous benefit package including plenty of Paid Time Off, 4 months of fully paid FMLA, and 401k matching.  I have no complaints about this aspect of the company."
good,I have enjoyed working for Wells Fargo for over 20 years. Great benefits and compensation. There are a lot of opportunities for community envolvment and support for employee’s passions to give back.
good,"the work environment was great.  the facility had almost everything you needed to make life simpler.  from cleaners, to hair salon's, daycare and food.  much much more.  my supervisor was kind and understanding."
good,"Great company to work for with a quick paced environment. I love all the benefits (401k, dental, vision, medical, and life insurance). Customer service is very important."
good,"For the most part, a very good company.  I was provided all the tools I needed to accomplish my job at a high level. Enjoyed the 2 managers I worked for..............................."
good,Banking is very rewarding and can be very challenging because of all of the changes that come along with it. Getting to know and serve customers on a daily basis makes the job very pleasurable
good,Learned how to operate within a corporation and what it takes to be a productive employee within a fast paced work place. This was when I learned that I could grow within the financial realm.
good,"After the lawsuit everything was stressful.. We were not technically required to push sales of any kind but I can bet you will not move up. Too many lead tellers. High stress at work, no stress off of the clock."
good,"Wells Fargo is an excellent, well organized employer that provides its employees with a good work environment. Large firm with lots of opportunities to get involved with different projects and roles."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Helping customers with bank transactions, open up accounts, maintain ATM machine, night deposit transactions, assist bankers with opening up accounts. The job was very competitive and we were required to open new accounts or would get wrote up by our manager. I didn't like pushing product at customers that really wouldn't benefit from them. This was really hard for me, even though it was required. I made my sales quota monthly, but it was a struggle. I loved working with my coworkers and we all worked well together as a team. I had an awesome manager that was always willing to assist and help me when needed. She treated us all equally and would make our work environment enjoyable."
good,"Was a good company to work for, however the in-house service department was abolished many yeas ago. Merit pay structure was good as were the benefits. I had no complaints with employeer the years I worked there."
good,It was a great job but I was a contractor so it wasn't a good position to be If I was a permanent employee for wells Fargo it would have been great. working in the company was easy and cool but the problem was managers were weird and not helping much in any ways
good,working for wells fargo was both bad and good. there certainly is people that care about you in the company and want to see you succeed but other times you feel like just a number and there is always the bonuses that everyone is working for. upper management doesnt seem to care about the little guy
good,"Low pay , crazy hours. If you don’t sale they will get out of the door. Managers just try to do their job and survive. The culture seems ok , they just need to incentive the employees."
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. If the pay was more in line with what I should have earned. I would never have left. 
good,Stressful yet rewarding job with the option of advancement if you have the right manager. Many departments to transfer into if needed and many job offers.
good,"Days were busy at times; management fair, diversified, co-workers, # of PTO days, luncheons, benefits.  Management was interested in your advancement."
good,Working at Wells Fargo was a great experience. Staff was friendly and took time out of their day to ensure I was learning the new material. This is a company that is well worth working for.
good,"Wells does a great job of promoting internally and training their employees."
good,"Employee centric environment in Wells Fargo. Great management teams and plenty of opportunity for advancement or movement to other areas. Benefits are some of the best for 401k, helath, dental, and vision."
good,"Great people, good work environment.  Initial program was eliminated.  Good for mortgage loan officers just starting out who live within close proximity to the work complex."
good,"Our branch was constantly under pressure to open new accounts and had a very stressful environment. Once the minimum accounts for the day were opened (10), thing usually calmed down."
good,Overall Wells Fargo is a great company. But you need to be in the right place. Unfortunately the culture doesn’t always span corporate wide. I have had a great time most of the time I was employed there but management greatness didn’t flow across the spectrum.
good,It was an easy job where we just had to take pictures of property and make bids to clean out junk from the property. I was only employed as an assistant by my friend who worked for the company.
good,"I really cannot say too much bad about working for WF, other than the possibility of a layoff was always on my mind since I was laid off twice in 5 years.  Once when the office GJ closed and the entire staff had to find employment elsewhere or move.  Many had worked for WF for many years and it was quite a shock.  The second layoff was short-lived, but still, a layoff which left me thinking the next one was just around the corner.  The management showed compassion most of the time.  Always lots of work to do with a lot of pressure to do more and work overtime.  The bonus payouts were good, the benefits good and the pay average.  I learned how to underwrite HUD184 loans and that was the best part of working for WF.  The break room usually had some good eats, although the kitchen was always a mess.  The hardest part of my job was getting along with all the big attitudes in the company, the best thing to do was just do your work and go home, not make friends within the company."
good,Nice experience working in the same company for 7.6 Years. I have groomed from afa to tl roles. It gives more opportunities to all the team members. I love wells fargo
good,"I really enjoyed the financial field. It allowed me to realize that it is that I really like to do, and what I'm really good at. I truly wished that I never left. The grass is not always greener on the other side."
good,"Company is comparable to other like financial institutions in products, services, programs and employee perks and benefits. Facilities and availability of parking were a plus."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I was great working there but management was a hassle. They we not able to talk to about problems and the Service Manager was HORRIBLE at communicating with her Staff
good,Wells Fargo offer a variety of opportunities for driven individuals. You will have chance to be hands on with many different technologies due to Wells Fargo being a innovative company.
good,"I didn't mind going to work every day but I definitely didn't make enough money. At the time, tellers still were on a commission structure, the bonus every quarter was around $300. Not paid enough for all the stress and work you put in."
good,There was always an opportunity to grow in this work environment in terms of career. however it lacked in leadership from management. I often felt disrespected by my employees and didn't feel as if it was safe to tell management about circumstances.
good,"working at wells Fargo was an unique experience, I learn a lot with the company to work with clients and meet their needs and know that the customer is the first priority, I learn to work as a team member."
good,At times it was productive work place but in my position it was tough to deal with people who were have financial problems but did not want your assistance.
good,"Wells Fargo is a bank, and it processes transactions, it also has money in it. It will not turn into a space ship however if you eat french fries it will look like a hamburger"
good,The training was not enough for all we were asked to do but team members with more experience were willing to help. The knowledge we gained was very rewarding and help us open our vision and get a taste of what the bank industry was about. Every day at work was a rutin but fun.
good,"Manager was great, listened to team and gave them independence. Team was very collaborative and got along very well  and made work fun. Big on problem solving."
good,Big company that valued the sale over the client. Left because of no advancement opportunity but would have been downsized eventually. ...................................
good,I really enjoyed working with this company. I met a lot of new people and existing friendships. I learned a lot from management which has gotten me to the position I am in now.
good,"I really liked working for them. Pay wasn't very good, but I hadn't worked in a few years. worked my way from a Teller to a Merchant Teller with no extra pay. Was promised a promotion and it never came even though I did everything they asked."
good,"When i started with WF i really loved it.  it was challenging and everything i needed.  But, as the time has passed i am very frustrated because there is no room for advancement.  and their raises are only $0.20 if that.  its upsetting."
good,"Lived my immediate supervisor and my job.  Stress came down in form if high sales pressure from upper management.  Great with family life balance, communications to employees."
good,"Loved the environment.  The schedule worked great with my son,  and overall the company was good a good. Place to work. I really learned a lot dealing with mortgage working at Wells and  it has helped me  in knowing the ins and outs of trying to purchase a home for myself."
good,"I had the change to work for Wells while in school in which offered tuition reimbursement.   Work hours were flexible, but a lot of turnover of employees."
good,"Contract position thru Robert Half, worked for a great boss, flexible schedule, culture was great and very employee friendly.  Left due to relocation and end of the contract."
good,Good company and environment. During my last few months they merged with Wells Fargo. I didn't work for Wells Fargo long so can't give a fair review of that company.
good,Good opportunity QA has too much control over your job and it feels like I’m walking on eggshells at times but I do love the company I’ve met great people and overall a great experience
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Open business and personal accounts"
good,"My bosses were nice and professional.  They emphasized team work and worked with members of their team to accommodate quality of life changes. I.E flexible hours, lunch breaks could be long or short (woot for not having to take an unpaid lunch!)"
good,"It was very stressful and unorganized , but they are seeking to improve. The day was filled with meetings on items that should be proactively discussed or handled."
good,"I loved working at Wells Fargo, helping customer retain loan modifications and forbearance agreements was very interesting. I feel good about helping people on a daily basis"
good,"It's fun to work in a company where people truly believe in what they're doing. At Workday, we're committed to bringing passion and customer focus to the business of enterprise applications. We work hard, and we're serious about what we do. But we like to have a good time, too. In fact, we run our company with that principle in mind every day: One of our core values is fun"
good,"Good company overall like anything they can improve good benefits, leave time, cafeteria for all, welcoming atmosphere. They have worked extremely hard to improve"
good,"too much sitting down in one spot, not many calls to take. good ompany but collection wasn't really for me. It has a good work environment though, nice managers and great training."
good,Project team was good and we worked well together.  The project was completed on time and within budget. 
good,Great opportunity however many people are also waiting. HATE the interview format. Managers are good to fair. Good benefits and ample time off although I wish you accured sick time and vacation separate. Don't expect help paying for parking or discounted bus passes when you work downtown.
good,Typical corporate environment.   You never know what people think of you because they back stab you instead of talking to you.  Environment is rotten from the head on down.
good,"This is a great company to work for. However, I was a contractor at the time so I did not get the opportunity to work past the 18-month mark. Which is heart breaking because you spend all that time working to establish your hard work ethic and then you find yourself looking for another job."
good,Large network of excellent workers and a terrific program for dealers to use in granting automotive finance to their customers. currently downsizing to a centralized model
good,"Everyday is a new learning , dealing with the  issue whether it is on low scale or large scale."
good,"I had a strong and supportive team and a good work environment in that respect.  Employees are very critical of management and managerial direction, however most choose to quietly do what needs to be done to be successful as opposed to be open and challenge management and their direction. It is a place where you can be successful, but only if you are looking out for yourself more than anybody else.  I'm told, however, that some managers are better than others."
good,Processing routine account transactions.Opening accounts.Helping customers fill out deposit and withdrawal slips. Disbursing money to customers ......
good,"i liked the job a lot. We had to answer the phones, assist customers with questions about mortgage and take payments. Your daily task include a lot but definitely was manageable."
good,"I was a teller for Wachovia Bank, N.A. for about 5 years. It was a nice place to work. The managers came and went, so management changed quite a bit. There was no room for advancement at the time."
good,This is a pretty decent place to work the hours are just horrible and they don't accommodate for anything this was also part of the reason I had to leave. My daughter had some serious medical issues that I needed to be working different hours to handle all of it and there was no budge from Wells Fargo
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Generally a great place to work. Located at 57th street and 6th ave so easy location to get to. Great people to be around and made a lot of friends and learned a lot.
good,Recruiting agency in Uptown Charlotte. Has a lot of placements at the major banks in town. Many recruiters working there and many jobs available at this agency.
good,"It was great."
good,"It was great."
good,I was able to advance over the years.  recently years were a challenge as the company got itself into some trouble due to various issues. this has come into play as I believe the downturn in production is in part due to the lack of confidence from consumers
good,"Recommend"
good,Nice place to work.  Very fast pace. Better to be hired on than to go through contracts. Not as good of a pay or benefits if you don't go through wells fargo.
good,"Relaxed, great atmosphere, friendly people, constant change, learning experience, great place to work, must be computer savvy, willing to learn new things"
good,"Wells Fargo is very good company, I have worked for Wells Fargo EGS close to one and half years and it was good experience. Unfortunately, I had worst reporting manager that lead to leave the organisation. "
good,"Hardest part of job is when too many call ins and not strict enough rules not implemented as they should be. You can work hard and you get by pass, no recognition to motivate you. Most enjoyable part is when you get free company lunches. I learned no matter how hard you work and keep to yourself there is too much conflict regardless. Not all managers on same page."
good,"I learnt how to sell anything to anyone because the sales culture is very refined and executed flawlessly by trainers. Overal, Wells Fargo is a hard place to work in and balance your life outside as well. The culture is still slanted towards aggressive sales tactics. With that being said, you will learn a lot about effective sales strategies, team engagement, and different roles within the company as you will likely hold multiple small internal positions and designations."
good,Great for learning how to be more professional and productive in the work place. Could have issues with scheduling and management would switch things up often that might not work with your schedule.
good,"This is a contract position and so, perhaps not the most accurate view of what its like to work for Wells Fargo. Among the permanent employees; everyone seems happy."
good,"Learned a lot was the first job in US. Thoroughly enjoyed working and facing customers."
good,"The work is a bit stressful because errors are critical. Management is not too great. They are incompetent and lack professionalism, well at least my manager did."
good,The job was easy and the people was nice. It was a temp job so we didn't get any benefits.. We did a lot of group stuff  together and team building...
good,It was very stressful and busy during the week. The location was very short staff so I was working 40 to 50 hrs a week with no days off. The management in the beginning was really nice but than they soon became very different and kept picking with me.
good,"Currently dealing with a lot of turn over due to law suits, but the company has great benefits. Managment has a bully type mentality and causes a lot of turn over."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"WF is a great company, however, they show diversity to a fault.  Where if you are of color, no matter what you say or do, they do not reprimand them.  It is truly a reverse decimation."
good,The office was busy through the whole summer died off in fall and laid off in winter.  Severance package was a huge help at this time of year.  Managers tried to make a bad situation better.
good,"Pay was good, but the workplace was always very busy with calls. When work got busy, it could become a stressful place to work. The benefits were good, and the managers tried to keep a great atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work would be different from day to day. You never knew what to expect when it came to people and money. On a daily basis you learned how to deal with people as individuals. Management was always close by if needed. The work place culture was varied but respected. The hardest part of the job was moving at a pace fast enough to please customers but being accurate when it came to money.The most enjoyable part was building relationships with regular customers and gaining the trust of new customers,"
good,"Pretty good experience overall.  There are lenders who do it better, but I had a good experience and learned a lot.  Peers and direct manager were great."
good,"I was a teller manager. I handled all vault money, negotiable instruments, and ATM. I was in charge of 3 tellers and responsible for their money to be accounted for every day. In charge of opening branch and security."
good,"I have loved being a member of this team. From day one, I was given the necessary tools and training to be successful in my position. I was given the opportunity to work overtime hours if they were available, and I was given opportunities to lead and even train new hires as I got further into my tenure. The overall culture of Wells Fargo Securities has been great, and it has been a pleasure working with such a great, collaborative team that was very dedicated to achieving our goals and achieving them in a timely manner."
good,I was hired as a contractor so I can not speak on full time employees. Contract work is stressful because you are not sure if you will be offered a full time job.
good,Opportunity to grow personally in your career and putting a small on a customer face after a good service. but to work in these environment  you have to be patience and friendly. i also enjoyed the company of the co-worker being excited and looking forward to getting the work day started.
good,"During my time, to reach numbers people were pushed by numbers in sometimes wrong ways, which I did not do or like. The people I did work along side with I enjoyed but upper management was difficult."
good,"decent managers"
good,Great Management and continuous opportunities for advancement. There has been many improvements since I began working here so you know management listens. The hardest part of the job is slow days however its also the most enjoyable part of the job...
good,Good company to work for. Good work life balance. Good work culture. No great salary or benefits. training provided is sufficient. Good ethics and good leadership
good,"Great place to work. Great technology, company leads and a great name on wall street. Training program sets one up for success with 3 week paid training and sponsorship for a designation."
good,Wells Fargo had very structured processes that allowed for long term success.  The team environment was positive and enjoyable.  When the economy had a downturn some upper leadership in our region chose to lean heavily in grey areas and they are no longer there as a result.
good,"Gained several new skills"
good,Working here could've been better. At times it felt like I was working for a greedy bank who only cared about profits and not people. I also felt like they lacked innovation. I had suggestions that were never heard.
good,"Megabank and mortgage giant Wells Fargo offers a huge variety of financial products under one brand — checking and savings accounts, investments, credit cards, auto loans and more."
good,"My last position was in Clover MS sales. The company had spent the time in policies and procedures as well as compensation. So, the expectations were changing on a daily basis. It made the position very frustrating and confusing as management never knew what policy was and what product needed to be sold and supported."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This was a contract position for a temporary time; decent experience but beneath my skill level and desires. Environment was good. Relatively good experience if the position was at my skill level.
good,"I sincerely enjoyed working there, the people are great and they try to train you and advance you the best they can.  My management wasn't so great, but other departments had wonderful people.  Unfortunately, I have made much more money at other positions, so I had to leave.  I honestly have never worked so hard, but the pay just didn't measure up."
good,"The benefits are nice. Probably better than other places. However, there is not much room for advancement. "
good,"Benefits are good. The rules regarding PTO vs sick time are not so great.  Example: You have 17 days of vacation & sick days rolled into one package.  However, if you call out sick, you use your PTO but it counts against you as an unscheduled time off which goes against you.  You have 3 in a row you are written up.  They also do not accept doctors notes."
good,"At Wells Fargo Bank as a personal banker 2 I was tasked with establishing accounts, maintaining accounts, generating appointments through cold calling, cross sell products and services, help and assist customers with service requests while trying to sell additional products to them at that time. We were required to have many appointments every day that was going to generate business and sales. If we did not have an adequate amount of appointments scheduled we were required to cold call until we got them. Granted times have changed now but this was my everyday requirements."
good,I learned a lot at this company and got the opportunity to train new tellers in an online environment. i was in a good environment and enjoyed my associations.
good,"I worked in the lending arena. It was a great job, but when the economy went askew they left you out to dry. I loved the celebrations and awards ceremonies!"
good,wells Fargo does have a lot to offer and is a wonderful company to work for under the right management. Can be stressful when working under a time crunch.
good,"Working with strict internal and external guidelines"
good,"I enjoyed my position. Great Manager."
good,"Wells Fargo has many division to work in and each division has it's own cluture outside of the corporation.  It's a wonderful place to get into, establish yourself, and navigate around the organization."
good,"It was an entry level position.  It familiarizes you with mortgage documents. Its not very exciting, but its a stepping stone to get you in with the company."
good,"Megabank and mortgage giant Wells Fargo offers a huge variety of financial products under one brand — checking and savings accounts, investments, credit cards, auto loans and more."
good,"In all my positions at Wells Fargo, if you were loyal to the company, worked hard, obtained high QA scores, helped co-workers and generally went above and beyond, you were never allowed to promote.  This was not just my experience, I also witnessed it happen to many others. Those that got passed over would eventually leave for other companies."
good,"The Pros for working at Wells Fargo Benefits, Customer Service week celebrations"
good,"Processed customer transactions:deposits,withdrawal,cashier's check, safety deposits etc"
good,"Every position at Wells Fargo is different. Days can be very stressful, and rewarding. Your fellow team members make your days go a lot smoother. Work is work, but a career is something you can have at WF."
good,Fun and cool workplace. Typical day you will work around 8 hours. Management was great. Most enjoyable part is the deadlines which are not a kind of hurry.
good,"I had a very bad experience through their recruiting processes when I tried to transfer. The community bank does not value experience outside of their own district. I liked the company a lot when I started, but when I transferred and was forced to demote my finances were destroyed and they did not care to remedy the situation."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for.  I truly enjoyed my job and was saddened when I had to leave it.  The people that I interacted with were very professional and made it a joy to come to work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great place to get a great  experience, I have learned a lot in the time that I have been there and I am so proud of my self but each day that I am there I still am learning."
good,"Always on your feet, have to maintain a positive attitude and have great communication skills, have to achieve sales goals each quarter, Can receive bonuses based on performance."
good,OK to work at Wells Fargo.  I learned a lot though.  the best part is to meet people.  co-workers were great.  little stressful when it's busy.  great.
good,good place to work ... management in india is not good. compensation and pay is good. work life balance is there. It is fun working with security guys.
good,Wells Fargo is a huge corporation that has many different opportunities of employment to advance your career. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"More collegiate and a better environment than other investment banks.  Generally bankers work together.  Great brand, pay is avg. to above average to the street but not top of the market."
good,"Was a great opportunity in the financial industry.  Gained mortgage, retirement, and deposit account experience.  Great position to build relationships with potential borrowers."
good,A typical day at work is Good. Had support from the entire team including management. Management is pretty good and they're there for any issues that we face as part any project implementation
good,"It was a very nice work environment and plenty of great employees. The reason I left is because I am a single  mom of small children and being told that if you take off even if you have time to do so it is considered an occurrence which you are only allowed to have 6 before you are terminated. As a mom I never know what may happen and what may come up and I don't like having to choose between taking care of my sick child or going to work because I may lose my job."
good,One of the better Employment service companies I've worked for. They do an excellent job in staying in communication with you during the contract and do a good job of trying to start sourcing you for the next contract as the current one is ending.
good,"Wells Fargo was stressful for me. No pay raise, no promotion opportunity for me. Too much stress on getting customers to get other products with the bank. New checking, savings, credit cards, etc."
good,"Wells Fargo has the potential to be the best Big 4 bank in the country-- It has good talent, prime locations, access to technology, market penetration.  As the culture continues to evolve as it moves passed the regulatory issues, it will restore it's reputation."
good,"working with wells fargo has been pretty great with its challenges. It use to be very stressful but it has gotten better with everything that has happened. Management still needs some help filtering the bad apples. If you are a go getter you can be very successful. There is a lot of favoritism you will have to over come if you are not already a favorite. number one priority is customer servive and employees can be left at the bottom of the barrel if you are not lucky enough to have a good manager.  401k, vision,and dental is pretty good, im not too fond of health insurance.  "
good,"Good benefits, good management........."
good,I did this job for at least one analyst for every Wells Fargo Branches. Different location and different people and I liked to do the job and resolving deployment related issues with my team.
good,See Resume.  Typical day at work heavy phones.  I learned to be patient with customers.  Management was a little weak not much direction.  Work culture was not very driven.  Most hardest part of my job is not working to my fullest potential.  I enjoyed helping stressed clients on the phone and making them feel at ease with their concerns.
good,"I was working at Wells Fargo just for an internship. Although the internship didn't last long, I enjoyed my time there. I was taught about the business world and professionalism that I still use today!"
good,"The Macon location was a great place to work.  I would still be there if my husband had not got a job in South Dakota meaning we had to move.  I liked the job that I held at this company.  It could get very stressful at month, quarter and year end though.  Luckily I had a great supervisor that understood work / life balance.  Our location in Macon GA was bought by Wells from GE in 2016.  I left a year later before the Wells culture truly migrated into the business.  We were Vendor Financial Services so our only customer was/is Ricoh.  We were not your typical ""bank branch"".  My team mates were amazing and were like my family.  I would recommend working at this location.  I can't speak for the other Wells locations."
good,"It is fast passed at wells fargo you learn a lot about customer service, sales, and relationship building. the people are amazing to work with it is a very close enviornment"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Big company with lots of opportunity.  Lots of training and resources available for self-learners.  Lots of locations, so relocating to new markets and staying with the company is possible."
good,This is a great place to work and start your career. After being here for over a year I feel as though I've stalled and not progressed as I'd initially hoped.
good,Management was horrible but the job itself was good. Plenty of hours to work at this place. Teammates were hard to work with due to competitive sales goals. We were always being threatened we would get fired if we did not reach sales goal.
good,I would come in and underwrite loans.  I would then review loans from underwriters with less credit approval to approve or decline their recommendations.
good,"Challenging work and fairly compensated, required a high level of integrity from there team members and highly values their reputation in the communities in which they serve."
good,"Management was on top of things. Customer first approach. Learned a lot about the WC portion, as well as wholesale procedures of the insurance industry."
good,"great workplace"
good,"OK, managed better than most. Surprisingly nimble given the size. Work load is not a problem if you're qualified for the position. Many people are not and continue to get promotions. Management is by women who hire and promote women in certain groups. Culture is very professional, but passive-aggressive behavior exists."
good,"There were some issues when I worked there; for example, what they recently got sued for.  Otherwise it was overall a good job, just doesn't pay well."
good,I enjoy building relationships in my position.  I am given the latitude to take on a task and run with it until completion.  I have learned so much while working here and I am grateful for that experience.
good,"This company is a great place to work as far as benefits. It doesn't really promote about what you know, its more about who you know. If you are a great brown noser or butt kisser you will go far. The management that I have dealt with doesn't like for someone to challenge what they are saying. They want you to believe or go by what they say just because they are the manager and they said so."
good,"When working in mortgage... proper staffing is essential. When not properly staffed for the pipeline size...customer service, quality and pipeline turnover suffers. Wells is great company but their mortgage division should staff up to 125% of there projections to keep up with the demand."
good,"Great work environment, lack of growth. It is a great job for financial people to be there if they want to grow a future in a banking world. Clean and neat place to work"
good,"i love my job, i am just looking to grow at a faster rate than what my company is willing to move. i enjoy working with my clients and helping meet their financial goals"
good,The company is on a downfall due to legal action. It started off great until new supervisor wouldn't work around my school schedule. Wells Fargo paid for my school but didn't want to work around schedule.
good,Supervisor was not to happy with my work. I push and put as much as I could. I was expecting to have a refrigerator to work. Kitchen was dirty and ants everywhere. People were very unprofessional on treating each other. There was a yelling of confrontations and using bad words. It seem to not matter to the supervisor or manager.
good,"Good family work place environment, corporate culture too many hands involved to make one approval, small teams so work was overwhelming at times, teamwork."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I have worked at Wells Fargo on two occaisons and each was different. One permanant fulltime and the other was temporary in a Call Center. My permanant position in the Commercial Real Estate dept. was laid back but not due to lack of work or being bored and if I could turn back the hands of time I would have never left. The temp assignment for 18 mos in the Mortgage Loan Call center was very hectic and somewaht disorganized. I remember the senior manager was pick and chose who to be rude with.
good,Wells Fargo was very training oriented.  Several weeks were spent on knowledge of the products and company as a whole.  Good office environment with opportunities.
good,"Depends on the day, it can be really busy or really slow.  Daily tasks of helping customers.  My last managers was great to work for and taught me many things to become a better lead teller."
good,"During my time there it was up and down. One of my first managers there was wonderful and took time to make sure I had what I needed to excel. The other managers I had dealings with were not great and many no longer work there because of it. Some pushed unethical sales practices but most did not. There was issues with area level management pushing practices I did not agree with but the employees that had lasting success were always those who did what was right for their customers. My typical day was assisting customers to resolve issues, serving as a notary, sales, and general servicing. Although they have had some issues lately a lot of it is area driven and not the overall company. That being said my experience there was positive and overall they are a good company."
good,"The work place culture wasn't what I am looking for long term.  The role which I had, accompanied long working hours, often times working from home after my 8 hours in the office.  Often times did not feel appreciated and/or valued as an employee."
good,Working for Wells Fargo you can learn a lot of new things in just one day. It's a great paying first job if you're looking for customer service experience.
good,"Wachovia was a very good place to work, unfortunately, due to the economy we were outsource. Th job itself is very challenging as we deal with various customers with multiple account."
good,Management is not for the people. My experience at Wells Fargo is not going good. Management in the department I work for is more against you then with you. They are not helpful.
good,Very engaging co-workers who were thoughtful and knowledgeable who share their valuable expertise willingly.  I enjoyed the working relationship greatly.
good,"This company had given me a great start at a career within banking, as the company culture transitioned from a high focus on sales to measurements heavily on customer experience I believe the company lost sight of taking care of it's team members who"
good,"Good place to work.  Very goal oriented but are rewarded for meeting expectations.  Very sales driven. Make cold calls to potential customers for account relationships, loans etc."
good,"It has been 15 years since I worked for the predecessor firm, Wachovia.  At the time they had a corporate culture that was second to none.  I had a positive experience."
good,"Other than the stress upper managers put on the staff to bring in new accounts, it was a pretty good place to work for.  There were times were the district staff would come in and that would greatly affect the attitudes of some of the staff."
good,"good place to work. great team with knowledgeable coworkers within the industry. Great experience and exposure to markets, property types and everything in between."
good,"Carried a pipeline of 100 loans- worked with Conventional, FHA, CHFA and new construction loans. Worked with 20 loan officers, third parties i.e. title companies, appraisal amc, real estate agents and main contact customers"
good,I totally enjoyed my job and training was very good. Benefits were great! My previous Manager was phenomenal and always was there to lend any additional help or questions
good,This position was my first corporate job opportunity. I was able to learn a great deal about lending and banking. The only thing I did not like about the job was the reputation is had while working there. Wells Fargo had been involved in some questionable sales practices that made my position difficult at times.
good,Consulted for one year through Signature Consulting.  I enjoyed my team at Wells Fargo and Signature Consulting was a very nice company to work through.  Hardest part of the job was the size of Wells Fargo and working with people all over the country.
good,Wells Fargo knows employee value. People are friendly in the company. They follow good corporate procedure. They give space for each employee until they get used to the work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Excellent company for employment and customer needs. Great place for banking needs. Team members are treated as equals and managers are more like co-workers.
good,Benefits are great but the layoffs are unexpected. Compensation for the layoff isn't bad though........................................................
good,positive energy.  nice co-workers. no benefits for part time.  have two 15 minutes breaks and 30 minutes lunch when you work 8 hours per day. Flexible schedule.
good,This job showed a lot of room for growth and education.  Management was supportive and concerned for the life / work balance.  I made strong healthy relationships there
good,"This is a great place to learn how to be a teller, handle cash, interact with customers, and the basics of a first time retail position. The environment is stressful and the managers deal with a lot of stress which they will pass down the line. Too many constant changes for improvement which cause tons of confusion. Continue to do what you are taught in training and you will succeed. You do build a lot of relationships on the job with fellow coworkers and customers. Friendly environment when the stress levels are at a manageable state."
good,"It was fun working in a lock-box center and having a part-time job that I enjoyed. Even though there were few hours and only on the weekend, which made for a 7-day work week, I thoroughly enjoyed this part-time opportunity and was sad when I had to stop."
good,This job was definitely one that kept you constantly busy from the time you arrived to the time you should have already left.  Calls varied but were almost consistent since it dealt with the Commercial Electronic Office.
good,Like the shift timings  which are feasible to everyone. Especially for married women regular shifts. Options for half day work on emergency. Also Ijp options and movements are good.
good,"Balancing procedures are very harsh, pay is great, now that sales goals have been removed i am sure it is very easy to maintain position with institution. Must be a favorite to promote to banker or higher position other than teller"
good,Great company to work for.  Benefits and Salary package are decent.  I enjoyed working here because the work was meaningful and teamwork and collaboration was highly used.  I regret leaving Wells Fargo for another company that offered more money.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo introduced me to speaking with the customers in a financial sense, where I actively tried finding services to better help them."
good,In my last role there was no room for advancement. Management was not involved in daily work. Hardest part of the job was going through training. It was not controlled and was based on the sr person there and how they did their job. Procedures and policies were not fully covered.
good,"wells fargo was a very good experience for anyone wanting to go into the finance industry. I did  not have a long term goal to stay in the finance industry , I was needing support for my schooling, this employment did not give me enough time i desired to focus on my schooling and the pay was minimum wage."
good,The team was well managed and the work load was about average for a ticket processing position.  Break hours were monitored very closely if you made it a habit to take long breaks.  The team was eventually sent to work from their homes as as such my contract was terminated as I was not a full time employee.
good,Large bank with a lot of work.  Most of time the working environment is productive.  Better technology than many other banks. Opportunity to grow but also limited
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work for. I am not one that like to work at call centers. I like to stay busy all day. If you can handle it, I recommend working for Wells Fargo."
good,Wells Fargo was a great environment to work in however the work hours were too much and we had scheduled breaks and lunches. Rather than taking a break when we needed it or taking lunch when we were actually hungry. Overall it was a good environment to work in and the people were good to work with.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo and the people I worked with, especially at the branches I was worked with to generate loan referrals.  Management was supportive."
good,nice place to work. depends on the department that you work in. Would love to be compensated more for the amount of work that is done. Would like more growth
good,Contracts are volatile.  Work processes are well documented and organized but deliverables move slow as molasses.  Way to many project managers and not enough developers.
good,"Programs are sophisticated and simple to use. Advancement is available with hard work. Multiple locations to work at, and they are generally fully staffed."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company with years of customers in both mortgage. This assignment required much attention to detail while managing your own pipeline of homeowners. We generally made sure that homes that went into foreclosure in 2013 were supposed to have been granted loan modifications.
good,Enjoyable place to work because of the workers. I learned a lot about banking and different products available to the consumers. Not much growth with wells fargo.
good,Nice place to work..nice environment. ..great people to work for..close home.good pay..nice management. ..peopke can learn a lot..good benefits. .nice scheduled .
good,I have been working for almost 5 yrs with Wells Fargo and i have learn t a lot by the training's they have provided and also these training helps you to grow in your respective career. They also have many activities lined up for the year as these helps all the team members participate and show their talent. After all this when a organization provides to the team member it wouldn't be fair if a team member does not provide his skills in helping the organization meet their goals and objectives also the company Vision and Values
good,Employees are very resilient and willing to learn new tasks. Most managers are very supportive and will assist one in development of a career path. Most enjoyable part of the job is the employees.
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. It's hard to make your way up in the company which is main reason I'm searching for something else. The benefits are great.
good,"The Work culture of wells fargo is very laid back, but this can lead to complacency in your work I found. At times there is little motivation provided by others within the company When working I had to be very conscious of staying busy and finding new things to work on for myself"
good,"Given opportunities to do detail work early.  Opportunities for advancement.  Need to prepared to work hard, but can be rewarded. Good Teammates that will assist you when you have questions or need assistance."
good,Very supportive co-workers. The working environment is always busy. Management is very supportive. It is a great place to work. The hardest part of the job is handling irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers express their satisfaction and appreciation for the service that was provided for them.
good,It was a pleasure to work at Wells Fargo. The employees were helpful to a new Broker. They really took care of their employees. Gave you all the tools you needed to succeed.
good,"Started with Wachovia and company was sold to Wells Fargo.  The Culture change, pay change, and value changed.  Company did not put the right branch managers in the correct branch.  Two much  turnover with employees."
good,A typical day at work is catering to customer needs and making them happy. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer that their funds will not be refunded.
good,"Typical day would be making coffee, checking messages preparing office for customers, Greet customers prepare files, pull reports and answer phones. Assist Home Mortgage Consultants and Branch Manager. Order new equipment for new hires and return equipment for terminated employees. Work with Ad-Services to prepare flyers and materials.  Being able to handle multiple tasks simultaneously with interruptions. Conduct background checks. Schedule venues for events. Perform invoice s and requests for Accounts Payable."
good,"It was a fast paced environment , however it was quiet enough that you could work through your day without any distractions from other employees. I had a new manager who wasn't very good with following up on things. So you had to ask him or remind him 3 or 4 times before he would do anything. The culture was really low key and everyone kept to themselves. The hardest part of my job was maintaining a balance with home during our busy season due to working 60+ hours a week. The most enjoyable part of my job was that the coworkers were friendly and willing to help each other out."
good,"Individual reviews of how they like working at Wells Fargo are likely to vary by dept/manager.  There is a lot of bureaucracy typical of working for a large corporation, but overall a good place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This was a legacy company purchased by Wells Fargo.  It was a solid company, but unfortunately made some poor acquisitions which led to its demise.  Purchased by Wells Fargo."
good,"Good company, room for advancement.  Many different areas of the bank to work for.  Many educational / training opportunities.  Good work life balance."
good,The focus of the company has been to enhance digital applications to deliver excellent user experience in addition to enabling voice print authentication and AI based fraud detection and blocking.
good,"great place to be, there is willingness to help each other out. if you are in need of a challenge, this is the rightful place to be. development and growth is attainable"
good,"Not a bad place to work."
good,"The employees here are great and a joy to work with. Management outlines clear defined goals, so team members always understand the what we are trying to achieve."
good,Firm allowed me to develop Supervisory skills.Had the opportunity to work with Interesting.intelligent individuals.Offered the oppurtunity to move with firm when relocating to Virginia.
good,Great culture caring people amazaing benefits and team builting . Take the time to thourgoughly train and support the people they hire. And keeps you in the loop with new and exciting challenges to help u succedd
good,lots of pressure on the customer service agents to sell and suggest products to customers and get the person over to the sales department after helping them with their issue/problem. Training was very long and in-depth and they focused on making sure you kept the customers account secure and safe through identification procedures.  At that time though the company was focused more on sales then actually helping the customer.  I did feel encouraged and supported by my supervisors though and did enjoy the job
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work, just have to find what youre best at inside your branch. Pretty easy to move up but it depends on how you start plus where you start, just stay focused."
good,From my experience Wells Fargo is very sales orientated. The only way to make extra money is to hit sales goal. Overall the work environment is stressing
good,"It depends on the team you work at. My team and boss are good so I like it. However there are many changes recently, some people the uncertainty in their future."
good,"Design and produce brochures, flyers, posters, fillable forms (PDFs), and ads"
good,Supervisors are friendly At times there is down time but for the most part of it the day goes by pretty fast. Opportunity to grow with the company often. Temp employees are also recommended to apply for a permanent position when one is open. Which they are almost always hiring.Time goes by fast with the busy work load that each individual receives. There are always files to complete so very rarely do you run out of things to do.
good,"Great work life balance."
good,"Like anything else good days and not so good days, stressful some days and others you feel appreciated. Some days you just know you have made a positive change in someone's day even if it is over the phone."
good,"the bank was bought out by Wells Fargo. But the timw I was there working as a teller, I enjoyed a fast pased but small environment.  I love helping people"
good,good place to work with great benefits and employees I LOVED THE ENVIRONMENT and culture. They strive to put diversity and inclusion first. I enjoyed working with the team members.
good,"This is a good company with great benefits. It is a very laid back environment and they trust their employees to do their job right. There is no micromanagement and I really respect that. One issue is that sometimes management is a bit too out of touch and therefore it is hard to learn new things or communicate with them for answers. Overall, I have had a good experience working for Wells."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a banking and financial services holding company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with ""hubquarters"" throughout the country. It is the world's largest bank by market capitalization and the third largest bank in the U.S. by assets.

good,"Great company to work for, only reason i left was because of a re-org. Great benefits and great people to work with. Lots of variety in my previous role."
good,"Norwest, now Wells Fargo, is a huge force in the business world, and as such provided an incredible opportunity to become a clear voice for their clients nation wide.  Working with, not only new product development to increase sales, but also providing existing clientele with a confidence in the corporation is always an exciting challenge.  Norwest offered a very diverse range of communications, which helped to develop my skills as a team player working with numerous departments to achieve large goals with often very tight deadlines."
good,"Good Company to work, Pressure less task and very good manager and team support ."
good,"At Wells Fargo everyone means business. The culture is not easy to handle at first, but once you find your place, you'll do just great. The job comes with lots of pressure, which normal for a financial company."
good,We worked with borrowers to find solutions to keep them in their homes in accordance with investor guidelines and any government regulations.
good,Current organization has been as Good place to work. Fun place to work. We have work life balance. It has so many engagement platforms at various levels like for managers e have Magnet. Over all good.
good,"Working in very Challenging environment and time Critical applications,Build new environments with in time and learned many trouble shooting Technics, reached tight deadlines, priorities work based on the criticality."
good,Easy job if you are hardworking and dedicated. Left before all the drama broke the news. I hear there's no commission now.
good,A typical day in wells fargo is dependent on your role. All roles have gone from being primarily sales to now more customer service oriented.
good,"A day as a teller consists of processing transactions accurately, providing excellent customer service, handling cash, processing reports, following policies and procedures. Wells Fargo is very flexible if you go to school or need to adjust your schedule for whatever reason. The only dislike I have was that we did not have set schedules, but overall working for WF is a great a experience."
good,I worked with a great group of people and enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. I had great managers who truly cared about me as a person. I learned so much about myself from them.
good,Company follows pretty much the standard practices of most big banks. The emphasis is now on sales rather than costumer satisfaction and while this can put it at odds with its employees sometimes it can also benefit employees who thrive is a sales driven environment. Employees have ready growth potential and advancement if they are able to perform in a sales driven environment.
good,"Cut my teeth with this company.  Provided world class training and really helped launch my career.  Tough job and not compensated great - but thankful for my time there,    Amazing people at WFFA especially."
good,Loved the work I did and the opportunity to move to different departments. Sometimes though it takes looking elsewhere to do so.  Hoping to take the skills learned in Mortgage Finance to assist me elsewhere.

good,"its a great place to work and start career.you will love your job.there is no typical day in here.management is very work friendly,very supportive on floor."

good,"No Micromanagement during the time I was employed there."
good,Good place to work. Typically flexible in schedule. Family oriented. Fun people to work with. Ability to learn about the banking system. Potential for upward mobility.
good,"My coworkers at Wells Fargo are to this day some of my best friends, however, the upper management encouraged unethical business practices when suggesting products to consumers. Sales goals were far too high for the small amount of traffic my branch would get."
good,"Gained more experience, time management, and communication skills. Great pay, but requires early hours and attention to detail."
good,Good managers and good team members. I ultimately left for a career change but I am happy that I worked for Wells Fargo. The hours can be long but it might be worth it for some.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to establish yourself as a person it is a great character builder. The customers can be great and they can also be tragic as well. But the coaching WF provides will equip you for the good and the bad.

good,I really enjoyed working at this location. It was enjoyable to have many different job responsibilities and to work with a diverse group of customers.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"very goal oriented company. lots of opportunities for advancement, the hardest part of the job was enough time in the day to keep up with all the duties of being a teller manager and still assisting customers."
good,"It was your typical call center environment. 2 desktop computers per desk with back to back phone calls depending on the time you worked at the 24 hour call center. Learned about the credit card process on how to use it, to red flags that can be drawn for certain things, how to make payments, as well as more in depth view on how to sell a product with out being face to face."
good,"Sales pressure was annoying, but i've heard thats changed. Overall, great company to work for, amazing benefits, lots of chances to move up. Countless different departments where you can transfer to. Also, IMO best way to get your foot in the door of the financial world"

good,"I've only been with Wells Fargo for 10 months, I transitioned from GE Capital after the sale of the company.  The management seems to take into consideration what the team members have to say about process & procedures, which makes you feel valued."
good,"Nice job ...need more engaged management ,more team building opportunity, morr value of the employee. Employees. Moral is inconsistent. ..management need to share more"
good,I rather not give a specific review.  I will leave it up to the future employee to decide.  Every company has its own pros and cons.
good,"a typical day at wells fargo was pretty pleasant, the main focus was to make sure that the customer had the best experience possible and then making sure that the ""teammates"" are in a safe positive work environment"
good,I learned a general understanding of the financial services field with a hands on approach.  I went from just a temp to being the sole assistant.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my boss.
good,10 years at Wells Fargo with some very good co workers and management. The major banks have become difficult to work at and focus on the mortgage side of the business has been watered down with many other requirements
good,This is a good place to work. I am a contractor so my connection to the company isn't direct however I have enjoyed my time here.
good,"Good Company to work with, little tough on the sales part. But at the end of each quarter you will get your bonus which was good. Managers have to do alot of how your days go. They did push alot."
good,"- pretty busy"
good,I was in a pilot class in Wells Fargo there was a lot room to grow within the company and it gave us great training. Before being place to speak to customers we were train for about a month. Help with learning all the various products they offer.

good,"The hardest part of job is trying to figure out all the resources yiu need from different departments and making it work for you."
good,Contractor. NFM. Depends on which business group you're in and how the management style is. I have experienced extraordinary management and horrible management.
good,This was a job i had through a temp agency. They were very nice and helped me learn how to the job with out having any experience
good,Company is moving away from sales goals to bonuses focused on quality assurance and customer satisfaction metrics. There is very little autonomy for leadership
good,Working in the default/collections world has been an eye opener - this is an environment that is very much collections and wish i would have had a better understanding of that prior to taking this job. Wells Fargo as a company has been great. My career development was accelerated with great mentors and leaders till i came to default.
good,Management is not experienced enough to support its teams.  This leads to bad training and low morale.  Told to do something but no support on how to get it done appropriately.
good,Wells Fargo provided one of the best internship experiences i have ever had. They are hands on and thoroughly taught the students about the multiple facets of the branch.
good,"fast pace environment, results oriented.  Frequent chances to policies/procedures. Coworkers focused & pleasant to work with.  Conducting complex cash flows for self employed borrower's was sometimes challenging.  Most enjoyable part of my job were my co workers always supporting & fun to work with."
good,"Review all files in the pipeline. Call Clients/Bankers to give update on progress of application or request missing required documentation. Follow up and work with Underwriters & Reviewers. "
good,Great pay and benefits. Was pushed to hard on sales. Didn't care if it could potentially hurt the customer. Was intimidated by upper management that I would lose my job if they heard me not sale on a single call.
good,Have learned alot in the comapany which made me want to grow more and suceed to higher positions within the financial field. Love the fact that there are different cultures and the managers seem to care for their employees

good,"Every day was challenging with new customer issues and cordinating with the team to find feasible solutions."
good,"enjoyed working at wells fargo , held many different positions as they  encourage team members to branch out to different departments."
good,"Customers are best part of job. Since CEO is in hot water company eliminated sales goals so this place might be a little more decent to work for. PTO is great, ok perks. High insurance. advancement is political."
good,"As a part timer, its a good place to work because you are still getting experience with decent pay. There a lot of down time though and nit a whole lot that can be done to fill that in with."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if you deal with recent changes and the competitive nature surrounding promotions.  Recent identification of inappropriate practices and displacements has made it a challenge to work at Wells.  Hopefully it will stabilize in the immediate future.
good,"IT was structured and logical.  Management was well directed and the staff had clear direction.  "
good,"To provide excellent customer service in a timely manner and exceed expectations."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,Positive culture. Good work/life balance paid time off is significant. Solid health benefits and retirement plan with 401k and company match. Company values recognition.
good,"Answer phones, solve customers problems with their accounts. Did not enjoy being micromanaged if the day gets off to a slow start,"
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. I gained lots of experience in customer service and sales. It is a great stepping stone, especially while attending college. They also have excellent benefits."
good,I enjoy working at Wells Fargo but the drawback is that the pay scale isn't satisfacatory for me.  It will take me too long to move up to be making the wage that I require.
good,The company I work for is profitable and growing as an entity. Typical day at work is enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is trying to please all the customers.
good,"Fast paced envirnoment,lots of inbound and outbound calls to customers collecting on their accounts, striving to get solutions to help keep customers in their homes, helping with other issues as they becomeavailablet"
good,Worked here for a short while but the people were very nice to me.The company could use a little more training as far as management but all in all good opportunity.
good,"Training was above-average. Offers tuition reimbursement, which allowed for my Masters Degree. "

The comfort zones created in a personable environment are rattled and it suddenly becomes a classroom in addition to a workplace. And what I have learned is that bigger businesses take business very serious in a magnitude that smaller companies spend their tenures either attempting to achieve or intentionally refusing to be in order to maintain that one-on-one relationship. Both are very purposeful and I am grateful to both corporations for showing me the balance scale of business.

The financial industry is complex and the policies and procedures within the firm add onto that load.  I've learned a lot about the industry and it has sparked a desire to continue down this path.

The hardest part of the job is the tax season or the end of the year when clients are trying to make contributions to their IRA accounts.  These times of the year are really busy.  The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching the clients about various aspects of the industry and when they are truly grateful for solving their problems.

good,"The culture at Wells Fargo is great as far as the company in general, however there are some branch managers that are highly aggressive in sales and would like for their team to strive beyond measure.

good,"Wells Fargo is one of the biggest financial institutions in the United States, but the company lacks vision and employees are highly rewarded."
good,"Wells Fargo has an overwhelming amount of priorities that are passed down to the branch level. Each month, there would be 1-2 corporate focuses, 2-4 region focuses, and 1-2 district focuses. It was nearly impossible to keep up with what was important, and as soon as a task is mastered, that task is obsolete and a new priority has been set. There is significant pressure to achieve your goals- especially sales and customer service, but also operations and diversity/human resources. Some of our goals were a complete joke- part of our annual bonus was tied to our high value customer retention- something completely out of our control. They view customer service as a perfect or not assement- customers are asked 5 questions on a scale of 1 to 5, and if they give even one 4, it is a non-perfect shop and held against you. Wells Fargo is a very traditional bank, with the majority of senior and mid-level leadership being white males with old school banking mentalities. Getting promoted is very much about who you know, not what you've accomplished. It is extremely difficult to move from retail into another division, without experience in the other division. (For example- going from branch management to human resources is impossible unless you are looking to take a significant pay cut and start at entry-level.) Overall, I would recommend Wells Fargo to anyone who is fresh out of college looking for experience, but unless you know someone and are able to move upward or into another department, you will eventually seek employment elsewhere."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

They showed you how to work with different programs step by step, they uderstood when you were having personal issues. The hardest part of this job was making sales to different customers, having to persuade a person for a type protection on the bank accounts were hard to do. Ex: Overdraft Protection "

One of my favorite things about this job field is that I learned something new every day.  If I was talking to a client and I didn't know the answer, I would always tell them I would call them right back with the correct answer, not tell them something wrong.  The best part of the job was working with people that embodied that same practice.  None of us knew every aspect of the business, but together we complimented each others' strength's and weakness's. The hardest part of the job was having to walk away because the industry would no longer employ part-time employees in the securities industry."

My co-workers were great people to work with, the supervisors and managers were excellent leaders."

good,"Customer service is king at Wells Fargo,  this company prides itself on quality and excellent customer service.  It reflects on how the borrowers provide documentation to processing and brokers.

However the checks and balance do seem to be in place for a reason and it works. "

good,"Being on any trading desk in capital markets exposes the trader, sales person, or analyst to an environment in which not many people can last. It is demanded of the analysts to juggle many things at one time- not necessarily prioritizing which objective needs to be done first. An analyst often has 7-10 of the most demanding bosses, which require perfection. Mistakes are neither acceptable nor forgiven. If you are excellent at quick math and thinking on your feet, it is possible that you will survive in this job. It is this dynamic which prepares an analyst for any demanding task which may follow in the future. If you are willing to work extremely hard and be beaten up daily, I fullheartedly advocate the FX analyst position."

good,My day would consist of opening or closing the branch. A lot of local customers would come in. The work setting is very inviting. I have learned a lot about the small city. Management and co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was to sell products that the customer doesn't need. I really enjoyed the sincere customers.
good,For the most part WFHM provides a pleasant work environment. There are a lot of opportunities available for networking and advancement.
good,Fun place to work. Good customer. Good coworkers. Made friends. Work is enjoyable.
good,Wells Fargo is a nationally known company. The name itself can help you be more marketable to other employers in the future. It's true that Wells tends to be more sales oriented that most banks but I personally was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time and I think if you commit to the learning process its a great entry level job to start a career within banking and finance.
good,"Always busy, a lot of responsibility for not nearly enough money"
good,Good place to work with. good team mates and team leads. Friendly Environment

good,I enjoy the team that I work with here at  Wells Fargo. I also think my manager is awesome and very fair across the board.
good,"Wells Fargo was a fast paced environment that was customer centric.  Normal duties included answering customer questions about their mortgages and offering products that could be beneficial to them.  During my employment with Wells Fargo a government ordered foreclosure review, according to the Dodd-Frank Act, was implemented.  I was first an executive specialist with duties that included compiling documents for review.  A quality assurance team was then formed to review the documents prior to submission, I was one of the first people that was asked to join the team.  I came to the attention of management with my work ethic and personal nature and was then asked to become a team lead that would not only still perform the duties that I have previously listed but to also assist in the development of other team members."
good,A work day as a teller consisted of waiting on bank customers with great customer service. Handling their banking needs such as making a payment or deposit or cashing a check.
good,"my managers were always nice to me. got free lunches when the please is very busy. if you like working with people, it's a great place to be"
good,"My duties including taking at least 65-90 inbound phone calls (sometimes outbound) from customers and addressing any issue they might have. That in itself, taught me a lot about the in and outs of deposit accounts/debit cards, credit cards, online payment tools and a variety of other bank services. Management at Wells Fargo, I believe has good intentions but they don't deliver in supporting employees past initial training. My co-workers at this job were great people, very energetic and helpful. We often had to lean on each other because of the lack of support from management. The hardest part of working at this job is not having your voice heard when you have a suggestion on how things could make the job better or you and your peers better at the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction you feel from helping a customer out of a difficult situation."
good,Was very happy to work for Wells Fargo. Had a very favorable work balance and they treat employees fairly.
good,"I am a positive, energetic, and well-seasoned employee with a lot of skill and knowledge and yet very recently, my work environment and faith here has suffered due to management and new policies."

good,"A typical day was assisting customers from start to finish on Mortgage process. Ordering Financial Statements and Appraisals. Coaching, mentoring and training Bank employees on how to identify leads."
good,"My responsibilities included meeting with potential and established customers within the bank and helping them either establish new relationships or deepening already existing ones.  While sitting with our customers I would uncover those important things that really mattered to our customers financially.  Its that one thing that kept them awake at night.  I would also find ways in deepening existing relationships by finding ways to uncover goals and wants, and helping our clients with credit or mortgage products."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo was a very competitive place to work.  I was able to develop both banker and service operation skills during my time with them.  I enjoyed both of my jobs within the walls of Wells Fargo.  I learned how to motivate employees and drive results while working for Wells.
good,My work schedule and co-workers are amazing. I have gained a great deal of patience as well as a lot of knowledge. I dislike the daily commute and rate of pay
good,"company with great , with good management and plenty of employee programs and assistance"
good,Good place to work. Very aggresive sales culture. Mortgage division is not indicative of entire company/divisions.
good,"Great sense of community and team work! The team is always ready to help each other, management encourages team building."
good,It's not a bad job but it's not my long term career.  I'm being forced to type this review as Indeed will not let me post my resume if I do not.
good,"Prospecting and sales"
good,"Challenging keep up with all the new policies and federal requirements, however I always enjoyed a challenge. Very decent pay to start out with ad lots of room for growth."
good,Wells is a good place to work. Mainly because of all the people that work there. Its just a fun environment and it will definitely be hard to top. Very strict rules.
good,The hardest part of the job is adapting to the different goals that our department has. The government tells us to do one thing but Wells Fargo at times does the opposite.
good,Very Stressful fast paced environment.  That we helped so many people stay in their homes.  I learned that mortgages are never the same and they are people that are making life long decisions.
good,"great team and manager, flexibility with needing time off and making arrangements outside of the regular shift"
good,I think this is a great work place if you plan to move up quickly in a company.

good,I helped customers on the phone in a call center fix any issues and helped make payment on their mortgage loans.
good,"Handling escalations and servicing loans, I learn that every customer has to be treated equally with different types of accommodations according to their needs. I work close with management on ensuring that every loan is handled to the best of our ability while providing feedback to smoothen out the process and be more efficient. The most challenging part of my job I would say is not being able to provide the customer with the best fit help due to investor guidelines or due to policy. I enjoy relieving customers from their burdens and playing a part on allowing them another chance at getting back on their feet so that in the future they can become active homeowner's."
good,This job was a great place to improve your negotiating skills.  Co-workers worked well as a team.
good,Wells Fargo is a successful company with many opportunities.  They demand excellence in their employees however they compensate them well.  Wells Fargo is excellent at developing their employees into managers as well.

good,"Handle Customer transactions, balance cash drawer, meet sales goals, nice coworkers, great manager"
good,"I have been a Wachovia/ Wells Fargo employee for the past 7 years.  I've always enjoyed networking and meeting new people. For one, im always curious as to how someone got to where they are during their journey in their field of choice. Also, it allows me to evaluate myself to ensure that I am doing whats necessary to advance myself.  During these years I've made some wonderful acquaintance's during my tenure, but it just hasn't equated what I feel is fair compensation for the job that I perform. On an average day I handle approximately 5 to 10 million dollars worth of trade paperwork that needs to be returned each carrier.  Through research of other institutions that have the same role, I noticed that we were in the lowest tier.  With me having a family and things that I want to accomplish, I know that in order for be do that I have to keep my career options open."

good,"Great place to work, except when they have massive layoffs.  I enjoyed my brief time there.  Had there not been an increase in mortgage interest rates, many of us would still be working there because we truly enjoyed the people we worked with."
good,"The most enjoyable part is my co workers."
good,"quality of sales and service determine your success, daily coaching help to build skills"

good,I was responsible for running outbound mail via Pitney Bowes machine.
good,"In the ever-moving environment of financial services, there is always the element of fierce competition at Wells Fargo Securities.  On the other hand, the culture at Wells Fargo does provide for some balance between work and personal life."
good,While working for Wells Fargo I was able to advance my work experience and knowledge by receiving promotions from loan processing to a mid level mortgage underwriter.  I learned team work as well as taking leadership rolls with my fellow co-workers.  I enjoyed working with training new employees and being able to use my experience to help them learn.

good,I worked my way up to many different positions with WF. I'm glad they gave me great benefits and the opportunity to try different positions.

good,This is a place that you will always be able to learn different things through different departments.
good,Great sales and personable experience. Very motivated to help people and learned more about the banking industry
good,"•	Developed and executed marketing programs and general business solutions resulting in increased     company exposure, customer traffic, and sales."
good,no complaints with this job. left the job for a better opportunity with another company.
good,"Never a dull moment, kept busy."
good,"There are a lot of opportunities to learn and grow. It also gives you many ways to grow into the company. You have the ability to create your own career path. People can be very helpful in your career decision. Very competitive. You get to meet new people make new connections and make a name for yourself inside and out the branch. The hardest part of the job is what you make of it. If your good with being a student and being friendly you can make it. I learned about differences in life. The different people you meet with different culture styles personalities , ect.. Each day can be unpredictable but yet stray on the same task ."
good,"Typical work day started with checking emails and returning all emails and calls...Learning new systems and working with internal clients that were very tempermental. What I learned from management was how NOT to treat your workers. Some managers did not know the job and were very insistent on trying to tell seasoned employees how to do the work. Hardest part of my job was not having enough work for the system that I worked out of. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers, they made it easy to come to work everyday and learn a new skill."
good,"day consisted of answering inbound phone calls for 7 hours. I liked having my own work area, my team mates, and managers. Helped clients uncover needs was the most enjoyable part. Crazy shifts."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A basic day would consist of help customers with their financial needs. I learned quickly to not judge a book by it's cover. The worst thing a person can do is assume and when helping people with the finances it is all ways best to ask questions before jumping to conclusions. Communication was key on the teller line and my teammates were great at talking.
good,"A typical day at work started at 8 and ended at 5, Mon-Fri.  The Administrative Assistant position that I had, worked directly with management in daily travel planning, meeting scheduling, email monitoring, project planning, etc."
good,Always helping customers and always making out going calls to book appointments
good,"As the Regional Private Banking Manager, I was fortunate to be affiliated with such a diverse and talented pool of Bankers/Lenders who were very goal driven."
good,"Provided operational support for high-volume financial institution."

good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work. I was able to develop my career with the company. I was laid off due to cutbacks within the Home Preservation department.
good,"At ""Wachovia Mortgage Corporation"", the typical day consisted of a consent juggle of new business, while maintain and serving a current pipeline of previous customers.  I learned the to never take ""No"" for an answer and always be prepared for the customers objective.  The management team that was ahead of me were all proven previous mortgage consultants whom understood the job from the ground up.  The team was build, structure, and ran very similar to a sports team.  We would assist one another, support one another, as well as encourage one another to be better than you were the previous day.   The hardest part of my job was not been able to control the waves of the real estate industry.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the environment, my co workers, the amenities within the work place."
good,"For being such a huge corporation, most of the time you feel like an asset.  However, there are certain areas in which you will feel like a drone with no real importance to the company."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo has definitely been an experience. I started out as a 20 hour part time teller, graduating to a 40 hour teller, being appointed as the new hire teller mentor, then finally promoted to a Customer Sales and Service Representative. A typical fay at work as a CSSR was extremely structured. I knew what my expectations were for every hour granted, for instance, the first hour I was to stage coach, next I was to stage direct, then I had a one hour call block by this time my schedule appointments should began to come in that would take me through until closing. The most difficult part of my job was obtaining four solid appointments, a great deal of people didn't want to come in to take advantage of our monthly promotions so this began to put a strain on my goals. At Wells Fargo, I have had 6 different managers who all had different personality and management styles hence some pushed learning and self development harder than others. I started to learn that if I wanted any type of promotion then I needed to start enrolling myself in many web based training as possible so that I can become more knowledgeable about different products, services, regulation guidelines and protocols. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to coach the new tellers as well as the seasoned in how to sale the benefits that we offer instead of the products. Many of my co workers that I have trained are now in management and others decided to explore other opportunities within the company."
good,Didn't pay well and a very boring job. Worked nights and had to try to stay awake.
good,"I provide in depth client service to the clients in a professional and timely fashion."
good,"working on ira accounts"
good,"I think middle management needs to get in the field more and visit and train the managers of the banks. The branch managers become very demanding and rude when it comes to ""daily solutions"", which are the ""sales"" numbers for the day. The branch managers at all times want you to beat the ""required"" number of solutions for a day by 150% which means they want you to do a day and a halves worth of work in one day each and every day. What happens is you start getting employees cheating, so they don't get in trouble for not obtaining the new ""solution standard"" set by the district managers who are trying to look good on every report so they can be promoted. That is why you see such a high turnover rate in the staff at the branch level."
good,Great pace to work. Good training and very organized. Allows you to work independently and manage your own business.
good,"Pros"
good,"I enjoy testing our system on a quarterly basis prior to releases and analyzing situations that best fit our clients needs. My typical day is independent analysis of all escalated package issues and working closely with IT. "
good,"When I was with Wells Fargo, we had a very high volume of loans. This was excellent in that it secured my job and kept me busy. I usually got to work around 7:30 and did emails and voicemails until about 10. At 10 I would receive my new loan assignments which were anywhere from 2 to 8 loans. These were worked right away and usually took until 2. After new loans were completed I would start on the last touched loans in my pipeline and contact borrowers for status updates or document requests. One of the best aspects of working with Wells Fargo was the incredible amount of information I learned. I learned not only about working in a fast paced and structured atmosphere but also about the mortgage industry and everyday documentation that is usually overlooked. Another reason I enjoyed my job is due to my co-workers and the management team. I gained life long friends that encouraged me when I was having a rough day. Possibly the best part of working with Wells Fargo as a loan processor was the management team. My manager gave me the tools and confidence to succeed as well as my senior manager that came by everyday to make sure everyone had what they needed to be successful in there job."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoy motivating & inspiring fellow co-workers as well as providing customers with impeccable service that has true value behind it.
good,"Working with multiple people daily with different personalities can be challenging.  Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"i get to work and start my day of taking inbound calls and help  customers with their bank problems, or questions and all sorts of other things we have to keep an eye on, like adherence, average handle time, customer satisfaction, referrals and sales. The hardest part of my job it to look after so many different stats everyday."
good,"taking 80-100 calls or more a day, offering a beneficial product on each call"
good,Good job to have in college. Taught me how to sell and manage people.
good,Decent compensation. You take over 100 calls per day. Management wants you to succeed.
good,A typical work day entails excellent customer service and finding financial solutions for the customers. I've learned the art of customer service can take you far in life. When you help a customer it is not  over when they leave the building. The communication exchange during the transaction is important and can stay with an individual long after leaving the business. That is why it is important to make it pleasant and perform it correctly in order to build lasting relationships with customers.
good,"They pay well, but I got the feeling I was just a number. Constant layoffs due to the industry."
good,"There is lots of support and competitive pay. Process flow still needs more work, but not too bad."
good,"Very easy and fun working place."
good,It was always a great day to wake up and go work at wells fargo great people to be around.
good,"A typical work day for me is receiving my pipeline of loans that I have to work on each day.  I receive the loan from when the final modification documents were sent out, to when I settle the loan in CPI.  Among CPI I also use HPA, LIV, and HSSN to finalize the documents I have received.  I communicate with co-workers and other departments when needed.  Since this past November when we have started working on our own pipelines, I love it!  I really enjoy having responsibility for taking a loan from start to finish.  I keep notes on every loan that I touch.  My co-workers are awesome!  I really like the environment at Wells Fargo."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was customer interation.
good,At the time that I worked there it was very fun.  This side of the company is no longer around.
good,"Learn the systems, consumer and business customers"
good,Excellent People to work around. Lots of training and knowledge development. daily operational and sales Goals were to be exceeded. The easiest part of the job was that you enjoy helping and meeting new people everyday especially when you have a great personallity for people. The hardest pat of the job was making sure that compliance waas in place when not having a compliance officer.
good,"Good company, compensation could be a little better though"
good,"Every day huge volumes and extra initiatives to be worked with complete 100% quality and target."
good,"Working for a nationwide bank has taught me many valuable skills and lessons. I come in to work expecting not only my 'regular' customers but new faces as well. I enjoy meeting new and different personalities as we are a very diverse company. As a team, we work well together and are always there to help each other out. Not only do I get along well with these members, I have made lifetime friendships with a majority of them. We are a sales-oriented company which has had its ups and downs; what company doesn't? In the past three years I have been taught new techniques of going about the responsiblities and requirements that are expected of me; I have also came up with a few of my own to mold to the customer or situation im facing."
good,"-assist customers with all their request"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"fast past environment"
good,Working at Wells Fargo is very fast paced and there is never a dull moment.  Though the demands are high management does provide the needed tools to complete the job
good,"Every day was the same which was fine, you knew what was expected of you.  You have sales goals to reach which could be challenging but that is part of your job and what you have to ""work"" for.  The co-workers are very amazing and family-like.  I learned how to better sell products.  The hardest part of the job was meeting numbers but it was not an impossible task.  The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming familiar with your customers and learning who they were as people, not just another account."
good,"Enjoyble for the most part."
good,i do not want to write a review i belive it is irrevelant to the job i just applied for

good,A typical day for me at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage was reviewing home loans before post closing. I worked on a team of 4 and it was great. I had really awesome co-workers and management. Working with a lot of volume in our daily workload was my favorite. I rather be busy than to have the day go by slowly with nothing to do.
good,A typical day in this job includes working against multiple deadlines while ensuring maximum accuracy is used.  It is a very team-based environment where each coworker has a common goal and everyone lends a helping hand to ensure it is complete.

good,Wells Fargo allowed me to expand on my knowledge with the laws behind collections and connecting with my new people. It also taught me how to grow as a person and handle many changes.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The Business is constantly changing. Many days don't know where to turn because of management contention. The best part is helping customers save homes. Worst part is not knowing from day to day if your job is solid. Many opportunties to learn over classed. Have the unique ability to hire in great numbers and turn over great numbers never seemed to figure out the issues for the production value. Many times so much team you are lost in shuffle and miss the pass.
good,A great company that has a promising future. Customer Service is a huge focus right now. Serving the customer and getting it right the first time is vital within this organization.
good,Wells Fargo is number 1 in the mortgage industry for a reason.  They are great.

I learned what some types of business is included in Commercial Ag like Feed Mills, Cotton Gins, Grain Elevators, Produce Handling and Packing, Fertilizer Ops, etc.  My underwriter was considered my manager and he made the job easy.  One way is that he told me that he appreciated the work I did."
good,I enjoyed working with Wells however it pretty well consumes your time.  Needed to establish more balance between work and home.  I was with them wholesale and then they closed wholesale so was absorbed into retail side.  Wholesale was great however they have different rules for retail plus instead of working one computer system and learning that we were thrown into two totally different systems and expected to be up and running with minimal training without letting our turn times suffer.  This caused an extreme amount of stress trying to maintain this level.  Overall experience was good and enjoyed working with all employees/management.
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells. I was only a temp but enjoyed my job during the priod of time that i was there.
good,"Growth has been exponential so we are always busy."
good,"I really enjoyed the great pay, opportunity to grow and learn while working with the company."

Managers are stationed all over the place, watching you and every move you make. Every call is recorded, so you have to watch what you say while you are on the phone. Management can tie-in to every call and listen in. Very seldom will they take a ""heated"" call or a call where a customer is very upset.The hardest part of the job is the selling aspect of the job. You are given a total of 6 weeks of paid training. While in training, instructors briefly go over everything that needs to be taught. I'll put it this way, my 1st day on the call center floor, i felt like i didn't know anything and that was because i didn't. You are not really taught about how to use the system properly or even how to deal with a hostile call (and the majority of calls are hostile situation calls).

The most enjoyable was being able to provide solutions the customer may not have thought of.

good,"Flexibility is a ""MUST"" any day of the week."
good,"Needs better pay, but learned alot on the job. Great diversity and culture. Steady schedule, but difficult to move around within the company."
good,A typical day consisted of closing mortgage loans in timely manner. Quotas and compliance. Co-workers worked together to achieve monthly closings. From pre processing to processing to underwriting to closing.
good,Of course it has changed much over the years but my first job in banking was in the Wachovia call center. They offered a great training program and I learned much of what I know now from my time I worked at Wachovia. They promoted from within and I was able to transfer easily several times as my life took me to different places.
good,A temporary assignment where I entered data into a new office system for Wells Fargo.

good,"Good first job out of college, should be prepare to sell, sell, sell. If selling products isn't your cup of tea don't become a personal banker."
good,I loved the individuals at Wells Fargo. However I felt abandoned by some of the management. This is a great company and I love what they stand for. I just think is was wrong point and time in my life with the wrong individuals.
good,I have worked with Wells Fargo for over 8 years. There have been many ups and downs and have seen and worked with many different people. I spend alot of time with customers providing customer service and sales to help the customers with their financial needs. I worked my way from teller to Service Manager.
good,Management was hands on and provided constructive feedback to further your career. A typical day included the review of thousands of general ledger accounts. My co-workers were team oriented and enthusiastic. The hardest part of the job was tracking trends to improve processes but it was also the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,I enjoyed being a loan processor with this company. I learned alot in my 5.5 years with them.
good,work is from 1030 am to 700pm and im on the phone the whole time takings calls and helping customers.i learned a lot about teamwork and sales while i was there. management was ok until we got a new district manager then things got micromanaged too much. my co-workers were awesome i never had any problems with any of them. the hardest part of my job wasnt angry customers like everyone believes it was definitely dealing with the micromanagement. the best part of this job was when you did really well there you got a lot of recognition for it

good,Received and placed outbound calls to borrowers to resolve document issues and customer concerns.
good,I have my ups and downs but it was okay to go to work that you look forward to the job that keeps you busy at the first few years and I enjoyed it but when the company decided to shot down slowly people that you see and became friends with slowly disappered and you feel down but work has to done. I made friends over the years and lucky to have my friends even after we all got laid off.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is having the ""team tv"". It is streaming videos of different things happening across the company-- almost like company news. It really makes me feel more connected to our team members across the country."
good,"Very comfortable sales environment. For someone who has the marketing and communication styles that befit a sales environment, the life of a wells fargo teller would be a perfect fit."
good,"• Provide frontline customer services for a high volume inbound centre for loans such as mortgage, personal, master cards, auto, business line of credit and retail"
good,This was a temp position but it as great pleace to work. I learnt a lot bout the banking industry.
good,A typical day was preparing 1041 fiduciary tax returns and providing Trustease software support to co-workers. My co-workers were team players and pulled together to complete projects timely. Management was always available and accessible for questions. I Learned tax law and the Trustease software system. The company had well established policies and procedures.
good,Lots of career advancement with the company. Company has lots of diversity.
good,"The company was good to work for, as far as paid time off, and benefits. But the company had very low morale, and managers that didn't know how to talk to people. The managers were not very friendly."
good,"Work hours between 7-6. Good benefits and insurance, nice work environment with major focus on customer service and sales."
good,"I feel that working at Wells Fargo. Hard at times, Managers are difficulr to understand are demanding"
good,This is a good place to work. People are nice and fun. Lot's of collaboration. Ability to work from home on occasion.
good,"Had a good first year, learning a bunch and adapting to the banking culture. Then a new market president came on board and made my last four months at the bank very very difficult. By pumping sales goals over 200% of what we already had. For such a small community, not very realistic."
good,On the phone with custmoers 95% of the time. Irate customers will call from time to time.
good,On a typical day I
good,"Worked in the exceptions department. Looked at and researched checks that were kicked out of the checking system. Team environment. The hardest part of my job was that we all struggled to get the work done. Everything that came in that day, had to go out that night. We all had to stay until the work was done even if it took 12-17 hours."
good,Atmosphere is a good working environment. Very fast paced. Most there are friendly and easy to work with.
good,Awesome team and awesome work culture. Seniors and colleagues always ready to help.
good,"Day started at 10am, put on your best smile and SHINE!!!! Assist all walks of life with their financial misunderstanding, assist in seeking creative ways to commit client with financial success."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Come in early and open my folder for most important calls and accounts to be taken care of first thing. After that work reports and assigned accounts. Management was great. Co-workers were great. Hardest part would be remembering all of the steps to the position. Always adjusting to the new format to follow, or guidelines set. Great challenge that made for attention to detail. ."
good,"Good place to work, like the numerous options within a large company such as Wells Fargo."
good,asks for a lot but it is a great part time and full time job depending on where you work and who is your manager
good,"Stable company, good employer."
good,Is a good company to work for. I was hired on at the wrong time when the mortgage industry really crashed
good,"Large coorporation, with room for carear exploration. Conveniently located close to downtown MPLS"
good,I have excellent co - workers and have enjoyed my time here at Wells Fargo Advisors. I have had the opportunity to utilize my financial skills and acquire more. I have had the opportunity to familiarize myself with cost basis calculations and modify corporate policies. I have enjoyed my overall experience at Wells Fargo.
good,"Full service companyto work for in Banking location Chester, Pa"
good,"Learned 6 separte systems to intergrate with each other, was able to meet hundreds of new people. Business work envirornment."
good,Enjoyed working for Wachovai overall great company to work for
good,Is an excellent starting job or non bread winner place to work
good,Culture change still underway from Wachovia merger. Our facility was closed during reorganization. Very large structure.
good,WF was a fun company to work for. We had to be very competitive with other WF branches but were always recognized for our achievements.
good,"I enjoyed working there, I learned a lot of banking knowledge that helped me on down the road in my professional and personal life. I would recommend this company, very good benefits."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to learn banking. They no longer offer medical coverage. Even to full time.
good,Large company to work for so had the ability to transfer to different departments within the company.
good,"Contract position currently, like the location and management is very professional."
good,My performance at wachoivia was 5 years of processing check thru the computer. The eithier 6 years was working in the mail room
good,"Good company to work for. Interview process was fair. They were very responsive once I applied, it didn't take long before I heard back which is good."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The people I work with are awesome because they are able to see the character and work ethics in me.  Moving in positions can be challenging and discouraging, especially if you don't have the experience but know that you can do practically anything."
good,"Good management, flexible schedule . A large company to work through but with good management and technology to look up different departments it can be a smooth transition deending on management. Pay is lower than expected, but work life balance makes up for the difference"
good,"Wells Fargo is a company that is easy to start with, but difficult to advance with. Most positions paying more than $50,000 a year will require many years with the company or in a similar role before the recruiters will consider you. Most of the entry level positions are flexible with hours and are not too demanding. Departments close or relocate causing employees to get shifted around to other departments. This can be good or bad depending on your career goals. This is not a company in which you will quickly move up regardless of your ability, but it is also really hard to get fired, making this a good choice while you look for something better."
good,Casual work environment. I was in a non customer facing position. Normal working hour 8:00AM to 5:00PM. Typically a banking environment.  I worked here for many years. I started in customer service worked my way up through various positions.
good,"Thank you for the opportunity.  it was great working there, learned a lot and worked really hard because it kept me busy.  it was fast pace and very enjoyable."
good,"Great experience. Nice people, and flexible. Remote access work from home opportunities. Compensation is at market rate.  Location was surrounding other good businesses."
good,"I joined when the lawsuit was happening and they did away with the sales goals after the summer i started. It was rough but we got through it as a team. Like any other job people came and went, had some difficult coworkers. But as my original team came and went and I was the last 21 of 3 left my new team was not as great. We all left one by one and the moral went down. The dedication to customers went down, the new policies that went into place made my job harder and I got yelled at frequently every single day. So that when I decided it wasn't for me. I did not agree with some and voiced it over and over but I was never heard."
good,takes to long for career growth. You can self develop or develop for your next role but it is about who you know its not what you know. too much favoritism
good,"A typical work day would be reviewing loan documents and verifying loan numbers with a couple different loan system and making sure loan documents meet certain criteria. What i learn from this job was how loan documents are being processed for review. Management was laid back, and helpful when needed questions answered. Workplace was good, lots of helpful coworkers, and environment was laid back. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a positive environment, and being productive."
good,"manager was great and accommodating to my life and situation.  She's on a great career path with the company.  In terms of growth, I reached as much as I believe i could with the company at the retail level and there was very rarely a position outside of retail banking available."
good,"It was a fast paced environment and stressful at times.  Need to know how to interact with clients. Great benefits and place to work, but was extremely competitive.  Promotions were not given fairly."
good,Not very much excitement. The job is great for people who are looking for part time work with few hours but if your looking to have a life or work for a company that cares about you as an employee then I would advise against it
good,They want to see you grow. They try and help you get to the next level of your career. I enjoy working here. We have great people and fun flexible work balance.
good,Decent place to work but a bit cliquish and promotions and advancements weren’t handled objectively. High volume of work and challenging but tasks were challenging and fulfilling for me.
good,Great company and lovely coworkers just wasn’t good enough for me because you can’t advance within this company. I worked through a third party company
good,Back office work relatively unfulfilling.  Pay below industry average.  Work/life balance good.  Benefits good.  Coworkers pleasant.  Office and equipment nice.
good,"Good Firm to work for, and is an industry leader in residential and commercial lending.  This provides the opportunity for movement  between teams and platforms."
good,Management could do better to retain employees by managing expectations. Promotions are sometimes given based on who you know and not on what you can do. If you are to good then be prepared to never move up.
good,Overall I was satisfied at Wells Fargo. I left for development opportunities that were not currently available at Wells. My branch manager was difficult to get along with but he is no longer there and I would always consider going back.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Love the company but there is little to no advancement available for senior leaders or to go from retail banking to another line of business   You develop great skills working at this company
good,"Lockbox services: There are different positions within the lockbox, but regardless of which you do, you're constantly busy. Quality and production are very high priorities. The work demands a high level of attention. Use of mail processing machines is a possibility."
good,Wish they didnt have to close all the offices. I was one of many who lost their job due to miscommunications between management and employees. Overall was a good place to work but needs more work/life balance.
good,"The pay is decent I worked 40+ hrs 9:30-6ish (sometimes 7pm), and my paycheck averaged around $1100 every two weeks.  Management is decent and coworkers were all nice. Sometimes customers can be extremely rude if you’re not bilingual. Overall it was a nice experience working there."
good,Good company to work for.. I am working here from past 2 years. They provide good benefits and have a good work culture. Their contract to full time employee process is less transparent.
good,8 hour shift that requires you to take an average of 100 calls per day. Meet sales goals and referral goals. At the time I was there overtime was available all the time.
good,"Worked remote- enjoyed the teams and working relationships. Fast paced environment, again must be a self starter or you will be left behind.    Managed global teams and projects $10 to 20 MM."
good,This was a specialized group apart from retail banking. My manager was amazing and I enjoyed working in this department. It was fast paced and a new challenge each day.
good,"Easy work, customers are great, pay and benefits are worth it. Training is a pain but after you get through it its smooth sailing. Hr helps with any problems, staff is mostly awesome."
good,A lot of flexibility for schedules depending on your manager. Room for advancement. Great PTO and benefits. On site workout classes and plenty of food options
good,Good place to work. Good environment. Managers were willing to help employees with work and give ideas to better their skills. Employees able to advance after one year
good,"Call Center environment with lots of pressure on QA, and Average Call Handle Times (be fast), and customer survey scores. It can be quite stressful especially with management walking down the aisles somewhat micro-managing. Opportunities seem limited to ""who you know"" basis. (Personally, my tenure and great stats were not enough)."
good,It is a good place to work at but difficult to grow to the next level. I tried to grow and get to the next level but was not able to do so. Therefore I am looking for opportunities with growth.
good,"I would have stayed with the job if it paid more. The managers were professional and cared about their employees. Helped them be successful."
good,Wells Fargo in my opinion strives on production and a good environment to work in. Wells Fargo could improve on salary increases for multiple positions within the company.
good,"My team members were always willing to help, my manager wanted me to succeed, worked downtown and the commute on the bus was not bad, there was always something new to learn."
good,"Overall my experience there was very pleasant. As with any corporate office job, there comes politics. As long as you do your job, there's rarely an opportunity to gossip or participate in office tid bits."
good,I would say that I had both positive and negative experiences while working at Wells Fargo. The company mission and goals are solid but as with many business a lot depends on local management.
good,"The company itself is not a bad company to work for.  It has a strong and structured model which, should it be followed diligently and ethically, does yield high results.  The limitations in the job come about at the more local level ie. management, coworkers, district mgmt, etc.  I suppose it is the same with all corporate jobs."
good,"good place to work, a day start with standing meeting and status update with all the team members and plan the rest of day work activities. All day meeting are planned well advance"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Typically you are on the phone with customers all day. The hours are late and sometimes all day. If you have children, 10 hour shifts are not the way to go. You have to be socialize if you want to succeed or further in your career."
good,Learned lots of on the job training.Co workers were drama. But everything was about sales. But I had the best manager ever!!! Not really any room for advancement unless you had the in with the branch manager.
good,"I worked as a Temporary at Wells Fargo,  Temps were treated differently than Wells Fargo employees.  I'm sure if I were an employee of Wells Fargo things would be different."
good,"Depending on who your manager is really determines what kinda work life you will have. It was very bands on fast paced work at times, it's pretty competitive and you can advance as much as you won't as long as you put in the work."
good,Many different departments to move around. Culture is currently changing and bringing on different types of employee. Learned to juggle various personalities.
good,Good company.....has/had some bad apples. Does a lot of wonderful things to support communities. Had some overly aggressive sales people. Has been working to change image and correct reckless sales culture
good,"I enjoy it, but people not wanting to help out is a waste. Typical days are pretty steady, but the 1st, 3rd, and days before holidays are a little crazy but manageable!"
good,Sales driven role and company culture at that time. The new culture and identity of the bank is more customer service oriented. Overall a good bank to start with.
good,Busy at times.  Good pay for job.  They tend to promote from within.  Very corporate environment.  Stsndard set if hours and worked the same job all the time.
good,"Wells Fargo was a good company to work for. Starting out they promised not to be so sales pushy, but eventually you felt your managers  breathing down your neck, and everyday became a nightmare. It was my first banking experience, and while I am thankful for the knowledge I gained (working at WF you need to be FAST and polite, and accurate, all at the same time, and the first time, or else customers bite your head off) and I am thankful for the time I allowed myself to be there and grow, but eventually the sales pushing and pressure from my managers lead me to resent coming to work everyday, and often times I thought about just driving right past it, as I would be up all night the night before, dwelling on how I was going to get my numbers up in new accounts. The pressure was too much, however, sadly, this is how many banking jobs are"
good,"You have to hit monthly goals, which gives you insensitive. The management was down to earth and the experience was wonderful. Pay wasn’t all that great at the Time."
good,"I worked for years in three different positions and I felt that corporate was never happy with my production. You are paid pennies on the dollar for a quarter of work, the managers are constantly quiting. I personally had ten branch managers and three district managers in just five years. Stop promoting salespeople that have no idea how to manage and promote the team players."
good,Took forever to advance that's why I left the company. I also did not like my most recent manager she was not able to lead like a manager should which is another reason why I left
good,"It was a good company to work for, the paid was a decent paid, training was amazing, did not like the system to difficult to find the outages at the end of the day/"
good,I loved wells and how they take care of their employees. But I think my department lacked good managers. The communication was not the best. Managers were never on the same page. But I loved the people I worked with the environment was great to be around.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was enjoyable, but unfortunately the atmosphere was a bit tense. However, the wages and benefits are very good when working there."
good,A company that consistently puts their clients first. The department I worked in did not have much room for advancement. Spent much of my 10 years in the same department just moving from team to team.
good,Wells is a good place to work. IT is usually at the cutting edge in terms of technological implementation. Workplace culture has a nice work life balance.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Handled documenting, closing, disbursing and servicing of highly complex loans. The loans may"
good,"As a contractor, I specialized in periodic review for Wells Fargo Commercial Capital lines of business (CTS, CDF, WFCF). I mitigated and assessed risk while investigating customer profiles for accuracy and completeness. Then I effectively collaborated with lines of business to obtain any missing customer documentation in order to comply with government regulations and Wells Fargo control assurance standards. When needed, I also worked with the EDD team to provide enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers and disposition negative news.Good experience."
good,i was a contractor so it is hard to review this company in an accurate fashion. it appeared to be a great company for the full time employees that i did speak to.
good,"was ok no advancement hired outside more than internal"
good,"I was a web developer here on a team of about 3 developers, and had a good experience working with JavaScript, and Cold Fusion.  I would definitely recommend working here to other people that might be interested in the financial services industry."
good,Not much supervision and a lot of change's in what I was supposed to do. I was disappointed in my coworker for being late and drunk a lot and I did not get compensated for my overtime.
good,Busy environment on the investment side.   Comfortable work environment working with clients to help with their financial and retirement planning needs
good,"Its been so long since I worked there I don't really recall.  The days were pretty redundant, but the employees were nice. Management was okay.  There was always something to do."
good,"The company has great benefits but the work environment is slightly toxic. Since my time working there, the company has changed compensation plans 4 times to make it harder for employees to make money."
good,I was working with a temp agency so didn't have all the benefits. I really learned a lot. But I didn't get the chance to work straight to the company.
good,"When you come in, you check your emails; see what appointments you have for the day; what contact events you need to do; morning meeting with the branch before we open; after opening, greet customers as they walk in and leave, see if anyone needs any assistance; if so then you bring them over to your desk, introduce yourself, and go from there. Before end of day, you make sure all the duties within the branch are taken care of before leaving; check what contact events and appointments you have for tomorrow and that you are ready and prepared for them; sign out of your computer, lock your desk and drawers; and then leave for the day."
good,very shady business practice when i was here. They pushed sales but rewarded you well for the sales. It was a very competitive and fast paced environment where everyone competed for sales from regular customers
good,I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo but there was not a work life balance. They normally promote from within which is great from an employee point of view but favoritism is still prevalent here which can make it hard
good,"I enjoy my current job as senior loan processor, the only disavantages with Well Fargo is that they made changes to move to all processing to central call center, versus leaving us in branch, overall is disadvantage to our customers that they cant meet with processors face to face when needed,"
good,As a contractor I was not able to enjoy as much as the permanent employee. It was fun working with many talented individuals. I have learnt a lot at wells Fargo.
good,Pay is low and commission structure was low but did not have to go hunting for leads. Lot of transition when I was hired because of the bad press but overall a good place to work.
good,The management in the area I worked in was great.The team I worked with was outstanding and many of us stay in touch after WF. Wish contractors could stay longer.
good,Process customer transactions accurately . process ATM envelopes that were deposited overnite . Maintain confidentiality of customer information . Balance /prove drawer at the end of day.
good,"Benefits were good."
good,"Low Salary compare to other Financial Institutions, The career growth path was not good. They promote Growth but is not the reality. People with no banking experience getting paid more than employees that had with the company more than 5 years. Underpay employees. Lack of promotions for internal employees."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Fast pace envoirnment and requirements need to meet every day."
good,"I do not mind working again for wells fargo as long as I find the right place. I was treated exceptionally by my supervisor. She was amazing. But when you work for the lower level job, do not have a high hope for the work life balance."
good,I worked for three branches. wells fargos management very. I had one that worked with my life schedule and the others had a very fix strict schedule. benefits where the best last year but plans changed drastically for 2019. I loved meeting new people every day and providing financial solutions. pay was great and my co workers where very helpful.
good,"Good co-workers, Onsite food, very strict on terminology, training was very good. Hours were good for me and my personal needs. Would like to see better pay or some form of bonus program for front line workers."
good,Good benefits but wages compared to cost of living could be better. Ex: 16 weeks of maternity leave but but make less than lower positions at other financial institutions.
good,"As a consultant, I worked 3 contracts.  The workplace varied with the contract. One contract was excellent in most respects.  Another contract was just OK.  The last contract ended early because I resigned due to ik=llness"
good,Wells Fargo Advisors is a very customer oriented company.  The financial advisors work hard to make sure that they are meeting their clients expectations.
good,"I had a good run with them.  Through my years with them encountered many good managers.  However, I also experience several poor managers and a systemic ability for managers to shirk responsibility and sustain mediocrity."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo Dealer Services was being on the phone with customers, DMV's, and car dealerships trying to hunt down our customer's car titles. What I learned in my time there was how to time manage, and how to work in a corporate environment. Management was very supportive and the culture was dedicated to customer service. The hardest part of the job was taking on team members workloads  while staying on top of my own work. The most enjoyable part was the friends I made, the customers I helped, and all of the valuable lessons I learned."
good,"Good bank to work for as a permanent employee. Good location - near Grand Central station. Top management tries to transform the bank, with various initiatives."
good,Wells Fargo is a Great company to learn several different aspects of the mortgage business. Friendly company with several different department to learn from.
good,"Greet agents on your way to desk, answer questions or help."
good,I enjoyed my time with wells Fargo and I was very good at it. Plenty of opportunity for career advancement. Friendly staff and great health benefits. Good job.
good,"Depending on where you work with this company can depend on how you view Wells Fargo. I've worked at different locations and they all have been different. Call Centers are not fun at all and stressful, however working in the Branch is less stressful and a better environment, although the shifts are basic."
good,It’s a good career choice and a decent company to work for. You will meet people that may become lifelong friends. You will gain skills to help you in your future endeavors
good,The company had many areas for growth. Learned a lot about banking.  Honestly gave me the tools to start my banking career. It made me super interested in banking career.
good,"Its a pretty good company to work for, but as in all jobs, it really just depends on the department and job. There are lots of opportunities for growth. All the managers encourage developement"
good,very good place to work and management is not good in some teams not all.other than this everything is good in wells fargo like salary wise and atmosphere wise all good.
good,Huge organization with lots of opportunity for career growth.  Can be challenging given the business model of consistent lay offs.  Fast-paced and dynamic environment.
good,"Great company, great culture although I sent a short time period. We usually started with a meeting and sharing some news or  branch goals. Aggressive sales goals."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Been with Wells Fargo for 7 years. Would love to stay but have not been able to secure a transfer back to Idaho where my home is. Currently in management and successful but having difficulty getting even an internal interview for lesser position I previously held.
good,Contact as many customer as possible to collect on past due mortgage accounts. Obtain payment/payments on the first calls. Set up acceptable payment arrangement if you are unable to security a payment at this time of the call.
good,"The last couple of years the bank has had issues with its perceived and actual confidence as it relates to customers, team members and regulatory agencies. Because of this the bank has been having to meet all requests to improve its view by customers, improve the workplace and be consistent in dealings with government agencies."
good,"Wells Fargo gave me my start, but the company has changed a lot since I started at 19. The company doesn't taken care of their employees the way the can and should."
good,"Overall, Wells Fargo has been a good place to work. My last department was very political and you had to be in with the right people to advance unfortunately. With that being said, I moved on to another department and have done very well. We underwent getting new management early into my role and the manager is in another state and isn't all that great."
good,"People in IT expect change, but constant change results in an unbalanced workforce. People spend most of their time following compliance guidelines and rules, learning new apps and procedures  than they do actually performing their jobs. Too many rules and procedures burns people out and makes them less productive. Email culture is ridiculous with people receiving 80 to 110 emails per day, most of which do not directly apply to them."
good,"It was fun while it lasted, the job is pretty easy helping customers from all over the globe with their financial services and products. I wasn't too fond however how this bank pushes its employees to sell their financial products on every single call. That got me looking for another job immediately."
good,"Pretty good place to work, depends a lot on your individual manager.  Good for employees, not as friendly to contractors. Space at CIC is an issue, hard to balance.."
good,Demanding environment with changing regulations and requirements of US OCC/SEC Regulations.  Cost saving and Risk Management were the primary priorities.  Days consisted primarily behind computer and on the phone.
good,"*Contractor* Working in Access Management, I can say that your experience will vary based on the department you work in and the mid-level management in that department. Being part of a team that is made up of several other teams is less confusing than it sounds for us, not so much for our internal customers. I'm told by employees (seasoned and recently hired from contracting) that the benefits and pay are worth it. If you're a contractor doing research into working at Wells Fargo, negotiate for a higher pay rate with your agency. They might be able to help out."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers succeed financially through loans, accounts, mortgages, and insurance products.  The workplace culture was fast-paced and sales driven."
good,A great place to work. Relaxed dress code and great management team. Training is thorough to make sure you feel comfortable when you are doing the job.
good,Wells Fargo provided a good basis for those who don't have customer service experience. I liked the people I worked with and gave me a good idea of how the service and retail finance industry works. I got along with the managers at the branch but wasn't too fond of the managers who managed our region because they always pressured individual branches to make numbers which were mostly unattainable.
good,"I've learned a lot about corporate culture here; middle management quality can vary, a typical day goes from stressful to boring, the hardest part of my job is juggling a variety of issues at the same time, the most enjoyable part is being the point person for solving problems."
good,I had an overall good experience working at Wells Fargo both on the retail banking and home mortgage side of the business. I gained solid career skills at the company
good,Typical work environment for a mortgage company.  The company began shrinking processing centers to reduce costs which is not atypical.  Most managers were straightforward with the treatment of employes
good,I loved working at wells fargo until I moved branches. The management team made going to work a struggle for me. Other than the management team the job was a good job and if I could go back I would just with a different team.
good,This company has Great benefits for its employees. The work place can be fin and energetic but very stressful at times . The hours are convenient and positions are always available.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company that is supportive and offers continued education.  The ""Drive Your Own Bus"" is true.  You can go as far as you want to go with in the company."
good,"The Pro about Wells is they are a very large company, so there is opportunity to move around.  The Con of Wells is they are a very large company, so it is easy to get lost in the Organization."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"worked for WF for nearly a decade, really depends on location, upper management, and office politics. was a very high stress job when i was employed there, but that was several years ago. its a stable job with good benefits, but can become boring, and routine over time. I enjoyed my co workers most of all while i was with WF. The general public has lost alot of faith in banks , and that can work against you when trying to sell or refer bank products. also the underwriting requirements are very strict, so if your client has poor credit its not even worth your time to try. I enjoyed the people, not so much the sales and logistics of the company."
good,"Implementation needs to be worked on, however. Rasing the company minimum raise counts as a pay raise, even if worked here for years, which can cause team moral to go down, and feel less valued."
good,"lots of favoritism"
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo is stressful. On average I would take 100 calls a day. The job is very high paced and can become mentally draining by the end of your shift. "
good,"I would love to go back but owe a balance from 6 years ago for PTO that I do not have on hand to pay."
good,"cool people worked at the bank I was at.  it was a little slow sometimes, and that is when the manager is all in your grill.  kinda weird at times.  the discount at nearby food places was cool."
good,"A good start to start a career within Wells Fargo if that is your desired goal, Pay rate could've been better considering the amount of work and pressure."
good,"Not for me, a free man. The reason a Bank is called a bank is because it controls the ""banks"" of the money flow. I did not witness the dishonest and deceitful sails practises, but do not think they did not take place."
good,"It's a nice stable position. The environment is pretty corporate. There can be a lot of work sometimes but most of it is monotonous and data driven. If you're looking for repetitiveness, this is the place for you"
good,"Great management, great work management, handling money every day staying in balance is like walking on egg shells with their new cash balance policy ."
good,"good place to work, good benefits. good chance for advancement if you are willing play to corporate ladder game. if you are older you find yourself declined for jobs they give to younger people with less experience."
good,it was a good experience working with and for the company. the environment was good and benefits. i learned a lot  on customer service and adapting to a constantly changing environment.
good,"Handle large amounts of cash, interact with a variety of customers, develop basic knowledge of Wells Fargo products, federal banking regulations, and basic business concepts."
good,Nothing bad to say about working at Wells Fargo.   IF you have the opportunity to work in Charlotte it is a wonderful city.  The investment bank suffers the same issues any other major IB does.
good,Never a slow day and always had something to work one.  Priorities shifted from day to day / week to week but it made the days go by pretty quick.  The pay and benefits are great and allowable family time is nice to have.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, I would learn a new task or a new way to deal with a situation, management is understanding and caring when you prove to them that you are reliable and dedicated, I feel like myself when working there, I feel comfortable enough to be myself around others, that hardest part of my job is keeping a sense of urgency while also catering to financial needs of customers and not making the customer feel rushed but also not being overwhelmed during a busy day and trying to manage wait time and perception, the best part of my job is knowing what is expected of me every single day I walk in , being able to find answers to my questions, and knowing that I can make someone's life easier or better financially."
good,"Overall a very good place to work ( Wells Fargo Capital Finance in Santa Monica California ). Everything was working out well until we realigned with Corp. "
good,Love the paid time off and vacation but management can be hard to get along or work with when under pressure. It is hard to advance when your an asset to the team
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,at times it was loud depending on who was in my cubicle working with me. sometimes up to 4 per cubicle. my boss was great she let us play friendly competitive games with eachother to keep us all motivated and keep us pushing for sales to reach goal. i left before they changed a lot of the ways they operate. ive heard from old co-workers who still work there that it has become a lot better place to work.
good,"Good job for people who want to spend day and night at work. Excessive overtime hours, lack of employee appreciation. Good job if you studied for business administration or any type of business function"
good,"Great Drug Free Environment To Get "
good,"Retail banking is retail banking, no matter the name of the institution."
good,wells fargo has its bad days and good days overall I enjoyed the work culture. it seems we are asked to do more work than we are paid at times. It would be nice if there was more advancement opportunities for the administrative roles
good,"I enjoyed completing my 4 month contract at Wells Fargo. My team was very helpful as well as the management side of things, alwwaye pushing for us to learn and apply ourselves with the downtime we had. I would of me working at Wells permanently if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"This company is great to work for, for the right person. I heard a saying once and immediately this company came to mind “people don’t leave jobs they leave managers “"
good,"I am a contractor... paid by the hour , but expected to be there 40hr/week . Manager is cool, providing support when needed... wonderfull view from 23rd floor of tower... ahah"
good,"There was a lack of supervision and those with little work ethic often did little during the work day."
good,Good environment with opportunities for advancement and pay raises. Work home balance was good but depended on the manager at the time which was inconsistent.
good,"The work experience at Wells Fargo varies greatly depending on the line of business (LOB) you are in. I started in WFVC (Wells Fargo Virtual Channel) or phone bank. I worked both sales and customer service and the environment was high stress and cutthroat. Every second of your day is micromanaged. I then transferred to business banking for a position of Loan Document Specialist 3. Even though I only went from working on the third floor to working on the first floor, it was like working for a completely different company. I was no longer micromanaged even though I still had production goals. I was given some autonomy in how I managed my work flow, and given the flexibility to manage things like doctor appointments around the work schedule. It was truly a night and day difference within the same company."
good,Was a teller for a year and some change. I would recommend this if you have a string interest in sales and finances. Tellers were responsible for meeting a quota of new accounts opened each month.
good,"The companies dedication to the growth and training for each employee is amazing. Because of Wells Fargo I am more knowledgeable, open minded, and confident to do any job."
good,cambiaron los valores de la organizacion y se enfocaron demasiado en crecimiento lo que los llevo a no actuar con etica
good,"My day would start out by checking what files were in my inbox to see what files I had to do for the day. I would pull up the first one and go through the documents on the computer to make sure all the documents we needed were there and that they were correct. Then I would enter the information into the system to prepare the closing documents. I would also enter the funding conditions and instructions to the title company. "
good,I have enjoyed working at Wells and in the time I have been there have learned many new skills in multiple departments of the company that I believe makes me more rounded of an employee. I have worked with IT Support through Technology Connection and went as high as I could in that department.  From there I decided to branch out and worked downtown in the Call Center utilizing and learning their ALM software in order to route calls to workers and work with the business to develop strategies for new campaigns.  I feel that Wells is a great company though compensation is an area for improvement for non-salaried employees.  They otherwise have a great environment and provide plenty of community support opportunities.
good,Every person look at every job different what might work for you might not work for me.. Wells Fargo is a great company to work for depend on who you are..
good,This has no bearing on my switching jobs.  My sole purpose for possibly switching is for a salaried job as a loan officer for mortgages or construction lending in a smaller bank or credit union.
good,The culture of the call center is wonderful and there are many opportunities for growth. The main issue is the customer base. They tend to be uneducated and extremely rude. They do not like to listen and they are disrespectful. If you are wanting to work in the phone bank you must have thick skin.  I leave work with a headache daily. But it is an entry level position into a huge company so you have to take it with a grain of salt. If you can make it past your year then you will be fine!!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The bank attempts to instill work-life balance, but that doesn't always seem to happen. "
good,"Good company if you can meet expectations. 8:30am-5pm fixed shift for bankers, no overtime. Goals are challenging, mildly rewarding. Competitive environment."
good,Underwrote two to three loans a day and kept recons at 36 to 48 hour turns times. Trouble shot any issues to offer solutions for difficult loans so that the loans could close.
good,Enjoying offerring new products and services to the customers. Opening new accounts and transferring funds as needed. Data entry and inputting and correcting information. Getting approvals for accounts overdrawn or needed overdraft protection.
good,"The company provided adequate training and direction. My manager was hard to connect with, however the staff within the Gainesville office were amazing."
good,It was a great place to work in order to enhance my ability as a manager but upper level management started to require employees to act in unethical behaviors and is why I decided to leave.
good,"Management has been very lacking in the last 5 months, as our branch has not had a branch manager since his demotion. The environment within the branch itself is fun, as coworkers are enjoyable and friendly, relatable and are able to work together as a team. The most enjoyable part is being able to close on investment business, and able to work together with additional partners to help clients achieve financial success. Movement within the company is prolonged, and there are biases and favoritism within management as to upwards movement."
good,"I have many Business Intelligence Development skills, but the job I worked was only T-SQL in nature.  At no time did they encourage me to develop or learn technologies or business practices that were not directly related to my function in the company."
good,"loved my team members, loved helping customers dreams of homeownership come true, I would work there again if opportunity came up. income is good, work from home opportunities."
good,Good place to work and get exposure to the financing world. Good work life balance and people are great to work with as well.         great            !
good,"the company is a great company to work for if you want to start building your resume. just like most jobs, its a lot of favoritism and politics. Overall i would recommend for a young adult in college or just getting out of college."
good,"Job security is no longer applicable."
good,"Specializes in team leadership and motivation, development, client relations, strategic planning, creative promotions. Strong analytical skills, time management skills, self-motivated and self-directing, the ability to proceed with minimal direction and information. Excellent critical thinking and problem-solving skills for making right and proper decisions along with exceptional interpersonal skills and the ability to work well in teams. Energetic and creative individual with a desire to develop professionally in a company that promotes growth and exciting opportunities. Combining a variety of exposures and industries will allow for creative platform to engage with potential business development opportunities. Demonstrated creative and innovative approach to all aspects of responsibilities specifically in sales processes, marketing and internal initiatives."
good,"It was a nice place to work, I liked the atmosphere and the people I worked with. We all worked together to make sure the job was done at the end of the day. No complaints except the pay could've ben more."
good,"Great place to work in corporate for an actual career. Expectations are defined. Good people. Longevity and room for advancement. Learned a lot working for the company,"
good,Was with Wells Fargo for a total 16 years after being a part of an acquisition of Marquette Bank(10years of service).  I have no complaints as I was given the opportunity to advance my career without any road blocks.
good,sales paid poorly they capped you off at a certain amount upper management had no idea where they wanted to go with the department no clear vision by anyone.
good,"Sales Goal oriented, Focus on metrics and performance, also customer service is a most to work at Wells Fargo. Best part is commission but it is only quarterly and not Monthly like my current job. (T-Mobile)"
good,"Wells Fargo, was a good company to work for, however depending upon your location and bank manager, there was much to be discussed. I didn't have an opportunity to really get the full atmosphere of Wells Fargo, because the branch manager I had was a horrible person"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The work culture there is free, it is nice to a degree but some workers can make it feel out of hand. "
good,I took the leadership training that was given and was able to experience a different management skills.  I was also learned of different volunteer services that I was not aware of.
good,"Seemed to be a high turnover in management which gave a feeling of uncertainty.  However, my peers were great to work with.  Last set of management sought to undermine our team."
good,Learned a lot from the job that I had at Wells Fargo. While doing this job it helped me with real life situations. Also gave me the opportunity to help others when they had questions about POA’S.
good,"As most people know from media coverage Wells Fargo has had more than its share of scandals lately, some of which were due to malicious conduct, while others were the result of poor oversight and planning with third party vendors.  I was involved with trying to make good the latter. Working from home was great.  Unfortunately the work I was assigned ran out and they had sufficient coverage on the other work streams.  I cannot complain though about a 6 month contract extending out 10.5 months."
good,The turnover rate is crazy because the job is boring & majority of the supervisors are hard to work for and you get written up for everything! Your stats are based on preformance but preformance is based on luck and then you can fail a call for the simplest things. Everything is about the way you say something and you have hide truth from the customer about what will happen next. Just feels wrong not to be able to be honest.
good,Minimal opportunity for growth and advancement. Many great people to work alongside and great benefits are offered. Enjoyable work environment and good experience.
good,"Wells Fargo is a company that provides a ton of very solid benefits to their employees.  They also are extremely good at rewarding years of service with escalating PTO balances."
good,"The company as a whole has made some mistakes, however working there is great for the most part. There will always be things that you cant control. The one big item that stinks is mgmt. is so set in their old school ways that you have to be butt-in-seat for X amount of hours that it seems they dont trust you as an adult."
good,"On a daily basis, I worked with incredible coworkers. I loved my lead teller, my supervisor and our branch manager was amazing. On the other hand, when corporate would come to inspect our branch she was about as horrible as a person could be. I always felt so horrible to see my bosses treated in such a way."
good,It was probably the most relaxed place I've worked completely different from what was bank side of the business while we had alot of compliance and duties to handle it was still very nice the issue was the culture its like they honestly don't care
good,management isn't the best and worked well with me going to school. but If you plan on moving up in company maybe not the job for you. task are really easy and you meet many new people
good,"I have remained with the company due to the excellent benefits and job security.  If you are displaced, the company will try to place you within another department or give you recommendations for other locations that may be hiring in your same field.  I have been with the company for >6 years and have survived all displacements within the company and have relocated once to avoid a company restructure of the fulfillment center I was working in."
good,Wells Fargo is an overall positive and productive work environment. The structure is rigorous and project managers can often times become more pencil pushers rather than decision makers and I am seeking a larger opportunity to be a contributor.
good,"I liked working at Wells Fargo. I only worked the Student loans dept. I did not see any advancement in the company. Not to say there wasn't any, It just wasn't in my particular dept. I enjoyed the job for the time I was there."
good,"No previous banker experience when I first started. I was able to learn about loan origination, credit products and overall banking. I would recommend to a family or friend."
good,Overall this is a good company to work for. Employees are offered many benefits including insurance and paid time off. Advancement opportunities exist but can be few in number in smaller cities.
good,"Unorganized upon arrival. It took over a month to get me set up with a workstation. I had no real work for over two months. Nothing was documented properly and no SOP. Job was easy and the pay was great though, especially for what I did there."
good,"In general, WF is a good company in general.  There is a tendency to have large layoff's frequently in the mortgage area of business.  When the economy is good, you're treated well."
good,Wells Fargo offers many opportunities to those looking for challenging positions. There is an opportunity for just about any kind of job that you are looking for. As with any company there are areas that are more challenging than others. I do find that more time is spent meeting rather than doing at the moment but the company is heading in the right direction to create a more productive environment.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Sales right now is changing very much but its a nice fast paced environment, not a lot of opportunity for advancement unfortunately. Great benefits!!!"
good,"it wasn't stressful and the environment was good. The management was not good, the manger let the team leader do his job and she was awful and bullied the employees ."
good,Good place to work if you live in a big city. General pay is good and they provide tons of benefits. A lot of paid time off a year and many holidays. 401(k) match and maternity leave plus great paternity leave.
good,I would like to decline writing a review. When I've tried to advance passed this feature it won't permit the option to decline. This is not something I would like to voice my opinion on.
good,"Really enjoyed working for WF when I initially started. Management changed and everything went down. Upper management would visit our branch and would be unpleased with us, say we are smiling too much(whatever that means) and eventually the customers started to complain about the ""new"" managers. They started firing left and right so I resigned. Overall, WF is a great company to work for, that was just one location."
good,"Wells Fargo promotes within in an accelerated time frame, but only if you are impressive and/or who you know.  If you do what you need to do and keep a positive attitude you can move up career wise very quickly. However there are times you may end up with management who play favors and you could end up stuck in your position for awhile."
good,"Overall the culture of document custody was great. The people were nice and management was understanding to a point. The only drawback for me was my department was always swamped with work and we never were able to have a full staff to tackle the work. Which led to people doing multiple tasks, training periods were shorter, honestly at times it felt like management couldn’t get a grip on things. This was noticeable to the team because whenever they brought in temps the temps would stick around for a short amount time and stop showing up which had a big impact on morale of the team because that would lead to too much work and not enough team members."
good,Typical day can be busy and fast paced or slow and time consuming. Your workload is ultimately up to the individual but you must maintain productivity and complete all task at certain time limit. If not you will be shown on reports. Wells Fargo is a changing environment so you mus be ready for changes and be able to adapt quickly.
good,Came in to work and reviewed accounts to see if a new demand was needed on delinquent accounts. I was excited when they opened a gym for employees and contractors.
good,"My typical day at Wells Fargo includes but not limited to call facilitation, risk assessments, monitoring and driving change, communication daily with senior leaders and respective groups. I've learned a great deal especially associated with risk and partnering with different levels of leadership to communicate those risks. I wouldn't say there's anything particular about my current role just challenges that are handled as they arise. The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to talk to different individuals throughout the day and overall satisfaction of completing a project within the expected time frame."
good,"Through all my experience at Wells Fargo, it is a very structured work environment. Each department has its own set of policies and procedures to follow in order to do the job correctly.  It is very customer service oriented."
good,A typical day at work was to come in and get set to answer call and prepare reports. I learned about the things needed to purchase a house and a things needed once a house goes into foreclosure. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the co-workers and some of the managers.
good,"Busy work day"
good,Love their sense of community service and work life balance.  Hard working workplace culture.  The current CEO of Wells Fargo Advisors knows how to express his appreciation for his team members very well.
good,Didn’t get the full benefits of working for Wells Fargo I had temporary assignments there. The experience was nice but didn’t get the full experience.
good,"assisting client with everyday financial responsibilities"
good,Working at Wells Fargo provided me with a lot of skills from making my own decisions of information found and learning how to manage my time and calls. Managers were there to help and push you to succeed at your job. The workplace culture was fun sometimes challenging.
good,"Always work to be done in production. Do have potential and willingness to cross train, only if time is properly allotted. Team members are pleasant to work with."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo had a good work environment, however there could have been more emphasis placed on employee development. I have worked for the company for three years, and have been satisfied, however I would have liked to have opportunities for growth within the organization."
good,"Overall Wells Fargo as a company is great company to work for. However, it takes great leadership skills for team members to get the best working experience with the company. If team members have a ineffective manager that lacks communication skills it makes the job harder. Despite the things that has happen in the past with Wells Fargo I would stay with the company if I could advance quicker especially since I have an advanced degree."
good,good work life balance.  maternity/paternity leave policy is strong (fully paid). vacation policy is good and improves after 3 years with the firm overall.
good,"Exceptional Customer Service and Communication is the key to success as well as a must.   Don't expect the usual, each day could bring other demands, must learn to prioritize and manage time.   Quality and time lines must be met.  Great Co-workers."
good,"The salary, team members, benefits and company give-back are positives! Since the company has global locations, you need to work all time zones to be effective, which becomes tiresome."
good,went from sales to service but management didn't change so still felt the same. They claim not to do anything to whisle blowers but that isn't true. A lot of things stayed the same
good,I enjoyed my work at Wells Fargo. I had a opportunity in a different bank as a loan officer. I truly like the Wells Fargo family and i sincerely hope to have another opportunity to work for this company again.
good,"It was a great place to work.  The management prior to the Great Recession was demanding but fair and, for the most part, did the right thing for the customer and employee.  However, as with a great deal of the country, the real estate craze became a toxic virus and infected the board and executives resulting in greed and poor decisions that have since been revealed and brought about the once great company's bankruptcy, morally and financially.  Very sad to see."
good,Each branch has a different culture thus the atmosphere is different from branch to branch. Overall it’s a good company to work for. You have to start out as a part time teller unless you have prior banking experience regardless of qualification or background. They don’t hire full time tellers
good,A typical day was steady and easy going . The job itself was very motivating.I loved working with my peers and having the opportunity to service our customers with an positive attitude
good,"Wells Fargo offers a lot of learning opportunities. They care about their team members and encourage growth. Working at a bank, in general, is very difficult as there are many aspects of each position to master. Customer service is Wells Fargo's top priority and they have adapted well to all of the changes within the industry."
good,Wells Fargo Financial's work culture consisted of small offices called stores which normally employed 5-8 employees. The business focused on gathering mortgage customers while cross-selling other loan products.
good,It was okay to work there. It was a call center. They had a high turnover rate but the people were cool to work with and it was a fun and competitive work environment. I enjoyed working there.
good,"The job required everyday to deal with transactions for the customers while giving them financial advise. You were expected to watch for criminal activity, but rarely were backed on it during work. There was no expectation to offer customers products, however they did constantly remind us that we were required to get the customer to sit with a banker to further their relationship with the bank. This however did require us to delve into their accounts and find any products that may fit into their everyday life. The people there could be great but maintaining such a professional environment and trying to make it enjoyable put too much stress on the employees."
good,"Walk in, log in computers, check schedule, take back to back calls, have to stay on the pone less than 5 mins, make sure all customer questions are answered"
good,"Relaxed, non stressful. Nice people. Pay is average. My area had work/life balance. I would recommend  Wells Fargo to friends and family as a place of employment."
good,I have worked for Wells Fargo for many years. I believe it's a wonderful company and they have always treated me well. Wells Fargo has the best benefits which is a big reason why I stay.
good,"It was a fun place to work, enjoyed the new experience and getting to know different people. Work was challenging at times but that was also what made the day fulfilling and exciting, Team placed on was diverse and many job titles but all working as one to get the job done."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This job was fun due in part to the people that I worked with at the time. There was a fun competitive environment. We all pushed each other to work hard.
good,"Wells Fargo is not a bad place to work. there are many opportunities within the bank. however, I worked in Wholesale and the climate and environment within Wholesale is not healthy and has overall poor management."
good,"While working for Wells Fargo as an Upscale Security Officer for  G4S, I was responsible for system management of access control into the building as well as facility management of the mechanical and server rooms and hourly patrols of the building. Overall the position was pretty cut and dry but due to poor communication with upper management and difference in goals and methodology of how the security platform needed to operate, I was forced to resign."
good,"Company provide great opportunity for growth and benefits if you can tolerate the Over Coaching and Micromanaging that you are exposed to on regular basis. Terrible compensation for those existing employees which were loyal to the company for years, which get paid less than the inexperienced new hires for the same position. It makes no sense."
good,"If you don't mind having your company in the news with negative publicity constantly, don't consider. Otherwise, there is a lot of opportunity here. Decent Benefits"
good,For Contract work it was great. There is a mixed bag with the people and management is very much in the news but they do a lot for the community Thru company leadership events.
good,With everything going on in the news and lawsuits Wells is constantly changing. There is no room for advancement UNLESS you relocate. The job requirements are also always changing so i do not know where i stand comp-wise.
good,"Wells Fargo Bank is a decent company to work for, but the management is not what I was expecting. Managers do not care about your improvement or advancement in the company except themselves."
good,"It's a good place to work to gain experience, learn all you can, advancement is not easy, plan to be in position for a year, then post for another position within the organization"
good,"The culture at the wells fargo location where I worked was diverse. Local management tried to engage employees, because upper management wanted engagement."
good,"Left because I needed a change. The program that I was working in was ending, and there was no clear direction for where the employees would be placed"
good,It was nice to learn about the MCR machine and bank procedures for checks and deposits were made and scanned. It was a well fast paced working environment for a part-time job.
good,"I worked here several years ago.  I don't remember much about the culture except that I was young and I enjoyed the people who worked there and even the customers.  It was fast paced and you were required to get a minimum amount of sales each day so that made it stressful for some, but I found it to be fun.  I would do it again,"
good,Advancement is great at Wells Fargo. Be aware that retail banking is a very low paid and high worked area. Corporate positions are more influential and desirable.
good,I do not have much to rate on this since I worked as a temporary worker and the majority of the questions did not apply. Temp employees do not have the same requirements or expectations as the permanent employees. The environment was a call center with constant back to back calls inbound and outbound. All the answers were scripted.
good,This job was continually involving. Things could change day by day on what a person was working on to how to process the files. Some days the work load was overwhelming while other days there was not enough to go around. People could either stick to working on their own or they can collaborate with others.
good,"Was there a long time then layoff. However, standard procedure . Flexibility is key as with other corporate positions. Some politics exist amongst groups."
good,"My job was interesting and enjoyed doing it and the most interesting part was to discover, something new each day.  I liked working there dependently."
good,very sales driven and lack of customer needs. A typical day consisted of being sat down by managers and told to call your family and friends to come in and open accounts.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Would like more opportunity for contractors to be hired directly when performing positive. Otherwise this job is easy. Very little stress. Decent workload.
good,Works perfect for little ones in school and having to get them. Wish management cared more about customers. But you’ll get amazing ones and others that just want to seems like they have control issues and pushing people around.
good,It was a great experience and opportunity. Too aggressive sales goals until they got caught and penalized. Managers have authority and have lots of support and tools.
good,had fun working with staff and meeting new clients. opportunities for growth within the company.  works around home life.  learned new skills.  need good cash handling skills
good,Wells fargo was great because of my team if your team is not good you wont like it. The pay is not that great but the hours did change so that was good.
good,Solid Place to work. Good atmosphere. Good people. High paced demanding environment. Ability to advance career if you work hard. Can be stressful. Decent pay
good,Horrible manager that only care about sales. The rest of the staff are hard working people. It can be stressful at times but very rewarding. Advancement can be hard.
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that had issues that they could have prevented if they had just listened in the beginning. Customers seem to think that it is ok for them to be disrespectful because you are in a customer service position.
good,"I enjoyed overall working at wells as I'm a very driver person and a top performer, and was constantly going to award ceremonies and got promoted without even asking to be promoted, as the Manament watches the top performers. they just need to pay better on the base salary."
good,I love my co workers and customer I dealt with. The management over pushed for sales due to quotas from Corperate office but we have all seen that on the news
good,"Long term career, but not for the faint hearted. Rewarding career if you can build a book of business in a quick amount of time. Everyone struggles the first five years in this role."
good,"but they were too focused on sales and opening more accounts as a teller, which was kind of weird to me. other than that i enjoyed working with the people there, and was promoted after about 5 months, so working hard there has benefits."
good,"A typical day was largely spent doing production work, but there were opportunities and time for side projects and help other employees that were having difficulties or needed help.  There was also time to help others with excel issues and problems unique to our month-end closing."
good,"A great thing is the 3 days in the office, 2 days at home (or more if you want, you can really work from home almost at will).  I loved that schedule.  Most developers do not get in until 10, but work to 6 or more, but it is up to you, very flexible as long as you attend the meetings."
good,"Everyday was a new day, you never knew how it was going to go, you were in charge of how you spent your time.  Your desk space is large, dual screen monitors and pretty relaxed environment.   You learn really valuable skills in this industry; data entry, collections, negotiations, office and administrative duties, basic collections laws throughout the US, etc.  "
good,On a typical day as a changed circumstance validation analyst at Wells Fargo I would be required to work 70 tasks that each take around 6 minutes but sometimes more depending on the loan file. The goal is to identify why a customer fee was increasing and validate the fee increase to be in compliance with Federal regulations and Wells Fargo policy
good,The best thing about working for Wells Fargo are the clients you service. helping them truly make a different in their life financially and help guide them to solutions that ensures a peace of mind. working as a partner/ supporting many different business sectors.
good,"stressful in a commission-based job, but a good learning experience and I'd recommend any millennial to work at a large company like Wells Fargo to get a good feeling for it."
good,"Worked with a great team, but the pay/incentives for the position didn't match the amount of responsibility. Sales team had an incentive plan that paid much more for bringing business in, however the Underwriter's incentive plan was directly linked to performance of the loans and therefore the profitability of the company, so believe Underwriters should have been better compensated."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"very busy and stressful.great seeing customers and able to help them. i wish had an opportunity to grow within the company, but things change. I do appreciate the experience"
good,Typical day at a call center for servicing commercial customers. Provided cash management services. The company wasn't Wells Fargo then and merged numerous times.
good,"Fast-paced contract position for a special project. Easy to do after training. Nice people to work with. It was a somewhat disorganized at first, but it finally came together and we were able to complete the project."
good,Working environment and the delivery process systematically perfect. Their is lake of experience of higher position group of people who just west time after meeting and meeting where 0 output and that makes production delay.
good,Advancement opportunities were there but they didn't announce them. You had to approach and actively ask for raises and advancements. Co-workers were friendly. Minimal work drama. Always had to work on the weekend if you were new.
good,"I worked there during the time where there were extremely competitive sales goals.  Stressful at the time, but I have been told the culture has changed drastically.  Overall a great work experience, and would recommend to anyone hoping do break into the financial industry.   It is not easy to move up in the company, you must be a self starter and advocate for your career advancement."
good,"Wells Fargo offers a lot of positions if you know the right person. But it is a really stressful place to work at. Management decides who gets promoted and when, and most of the time is not based on your qualifications but who you are friends with."
good,"I sourced, structured and closed factoring opportunites throughout the Northeast.  I built relationship with internal and external centers of influences."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work for the right person.  There is a lot of advancement, one can learn a lot, and have multiple careers.  The culture is changing towards one of less transparency and much more bureaucracy."
good,Required to sell bank products to ensure job security. Management is always changing and selling bank products was the way to move up. Customer service was what can I sell this customer today.
good,I did not leave the call center closed down. I had to find a new job. It was a great place to work. Nothing more to say here. Thanks for the job it was great.
good,"good place to work at wells fargo in scrum team. Work can be done collaboratively, qualitatively.  less production defects. good learning on tools too."
good,All team members help each other to meet their goals and deadlines. You have ability to contact other testing teams to get information to finish your job.
good,Very fast paced at the time I was employed there. Regardless of stress level managers found time to have fun with employees. I had to leave since I found a better paying job doing the exact job at WF
good,I will say that the disorganization this big business had appalled me. It was very fast paced but it had a very high school like atmosphere with the drama between employees and management
good,"I was there for almost 14 years and had a wonderful experience.  Multiple promotions, great benefits, work/family life balance, learning opportunities, and great culture.  I really enjoyed it during that period.  When I went back after my time away I was very disappointed in the position and management style.  It did not feel like the same company - that is why my ratings are lower because I based a lot on my last experience."
good,I didn't mind working here.  I didn't necessarily like the phone calls sometimes but I really enjoyed the people that I met there.  It was really nice to be so culturly diverse.  They were pretty flexible with you on your schedule if you needed to change anything around but otherwise it was a regular shift that you worked everyday.  Which was what I wanted at the time so not a big deal.
good,It was a fun place to work with a lot of commraderie on the team. Everyone worked together and enjoyed breaks and lunches together. Great amenities on site at the facility for the employees.
good,One of the best jobs I've ever had. Managers were great except for mine. Pay and facility was nice. Didn't care for the shift but it wasn't horrible. Benefits were amazing. When I struggled I didn't receive any help just criticism. I would work for them in a heartbeat.
good,"Coming from another job that excels on promoting their employees, and helping you grow, Wells feels like they throw you into the deep end, and light the surface on fire, hoping you'll do well."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This was an eye opening experience that helped me bridge a gap in my resume between sales and engineering. I would recommend this organization. Thank you
good,"No advancement for long-term employee's who demonstrated loyalty and exceeding all metrics on a regular basis. Employee's have access to a variety of organizations within the company to have the opportunity to interact with other business groups, however there are very few that can make the jump from their current business line to another."
good,"Wells Fargo offers great benefits, compensation and is a awesome place to gain work experience. The overall environment is accommodating and can be competitive at times, however, it offers great exposure to varies levels of employment and career interest."
good,"everything boils down to politics, not skills. the best way to move forward and advance in your career is to threaten to leave. as long as the company thinks your in control you will be stuck in your role underpaid."
good,"This company is always looking to be progressive in its community and social visions - aligning its self as a diverse work place. It provides strong work life balance with great flexibility for certain positions and strong pay and benefits.  This company encourages and provides may opportunities to give back to local community work as well.  While I enjoy being part of an organization that is looking to be progressive and socially focused- it can take time for the company to implement these ideas and not everyone is in alignment.  This can make for challenging work situations.  It is also hard to be in an external facing role when the company is making significate culture changes as I am often tasked with responding to questions about the environment.  Also I have found it challenging to be able to move on from a role - once you are labeled a certain way, it is not always easy to look at new roles with parallel skills within the organization."
good,Everything is about numbers and getting more business for the company. Did not have to take work home and preferred not to even think about work after I left. Good pay made it hard to leave but I was sure happy when I did.
good,"this is a great first job, if you come in with experience its hard to be compensated for experience.  everyone basically paid the same.  Leadership is good"
good,Working at Wells Fargo lead to alot of promising business relationships. After working there i have lots of great friends. Glad to have seen many leave and grow in the banking industry.
good,It was a decent job but only a contract position. The work life was much like that of a high school. The pay was lower than I made as an intern in college and the management was not well informed.
good,"It's really fun if you love to help people, do math, and multi task. It was really nice working there and I think it's a great position to start with if you want to find a carer in the banking feild"
good,"*high energy, constant  negotiating with borrowers and investors"
good,The day starts early in the morning at 7 am and goes upto 6 in the evening and later communicating with the offshore team in India till around 10 pm after going home.
good,"The pay and benefits are great, but there is no true work-life balance. Corporate politics make it difficult to move up especially when you are doing well."
good,I liked working at Wells Fargo Bank. It was a good learning environment and there was abundant opportunity amongst the diverse populations all throughout.
good,"Typical day requires a lot of reading, some phone contact and emailing."
good,"My time with Wells was informative and creative. Everyone is really supportive and present to help you succeed. However, as an individual you must be willing and able to learn, grow, and evolve. Otherwise you can get stuck and feel negative about the environment. Particularly because everyone around you moves on."
good,"Processing is stressful, when dealing with customers, which we usually are to blame.  I deal with relocation, so we closes loans faster than any other businesses, however we're graded on our loyalty which is probably not that great for our customers' because they are dealing with too many people.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,need more options for time off. there is no sick time provided. you have to use PTO if your child is sick or if you have an emergency for a family member.
good,"The different shifts available have helped me with my family. The management staff is lacking, in some departments. The pay is great, and good 401k options."
good,"Though the position did not last as long as I desired, I did not see"
good,"I chose to not discuss. It's slow paced. The pay is not very good, it doesn't matter if you have a degree or not. The pay will be the same. I'm making more than people with degrees because I have more experience. Personally, I'm OK with that but people who spent money on college are not making any more. The flexibility in the work schedule is extremely nice."
good,Getting money back to people who did not know they had it. Learned a lot of technology language.  Broad knowledge base about others job functions and how they interact with mine.
good,A typical work day is sitting at your computer doing very repetitive work. I learned how loans are pooled together and sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The management is relaxed and the workplace culture is a stress-free zone. The hardest part of the job is staying focused on reviewing tedious mistakes on thousands of loans a week. The days go by quick if you have an enjoyable audio book or music to listen to.
good,"I have worked for Wells Fargo in three different capacities, and I had good experiences. This particular job was fun for me. I had good co-workers and managers. It is not hard to build a rapport with upper management. They are not uninvolved. There's a lot of ""if this, then this"" to the job, so when you're new you can have a lot of questions even after the training period. Co-workers were always willing to listen to your situation and give you direction, as were the work directors. There were times when I would just sit down in my supervisor's cubicle and just talk - because you can be that way with them. In this particular position, everyone on the floor had the same job, so every manager was managing the same thing. With that, if your manager was ever out, you could turn to any one of them. In all, if I were ever to need a job, I would certainly go back to Wells Fargo."
good,Worked at Wells for seven years.  Very enjoyable for the most part. Excellent benefits and discounts from various vendors. Good culture and had the chance to work with some outstanding people
good,I spend almost 3 years with Wells Fargo and really have awesome time with all colleagues and my friends. This is a great company to work for. They would work for their clients that need the right person to work for their clients. The clients are companies that would work with anyone.
good,"Because I grew up in Des Moines and was well aware of Wells Fargo for many years, it was a fun place to be.  Many of the people working at this location were people I knew from my early years.  I actually worked for a former high school acquaintance."
good,I originated loans for the company which was very enjoyable.  The changes within the company made the job less enjoyable.  The management structure made my process harder to complete.
good,"A great company, but facing a lot of challenges right now and frankly after nearly 25 years with the company, I am ready for a new challenge.  "
good,"job title is described well "
good,"Learned a lot about the financial world, and got the opportunity to meet a lot of customers from different countries. If you focus on your goals and set yourself to achieve them you will get there with this company just takes a lot of time and effort!"
good,Wells Fargo is a decent place to work.  The benefits are good.  Want to keep you involved in the community.  Currently are trying to improve their image.
good,"Company is good, Work culture is very good, the Rule and Regulations are good however the way it runs is not acceptable."
good,overall the company is great to work for but layoffs can be unexpected. Which is what got me in the situation I'm in now. The Benefits are amazing.....
good,"The company provides good work/life balance for families.  They have an inclusive environment.  The insurance is a bit costly, but the do have a decent coverage."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Large bank with almost 300k employees. Job salaries are on the lower end and working your way up is tough. Lots of people in middle management positions that were promoted due to tenure and not actual performance. There are worse places to work I guess. There is not anything special about this place. I've made good friends and worked with some talented individuals, but the lack of care from upper management with their own agenda's is a killer to morale. You will make more money leaving and coming back then by in-line job promotions. There is no reward for loyalty here."
good,"Large company, with various departments. Many Lines of Business due to the fact of it'is extreme complexity and corporate structure. Places emphasis on maintaining diversity in the workforce."
good,It's a great place to work if you're capable of learning their systems on your own. If you struggle with office work then they're not the best place for you to work. Overall it has been a great experience and the managers will assist you when needed.
good,Compensation and benefits are good.  Opportunities to learn. Team atmosphere.  Fun to work with team as everyone is active part of the team.  Supplied with the information to do the job.  Good place to work.
good,Fast pace promote good company policies and procedures.  Management is stat driven.  Great pay and benefits are good.  Good work area and professionalism is required.
good,Wells Fargo is very customer driven and customer savvy. Not sure if its the market that I work in our if its the company as a whole but they fall short on employee satisfaction.
good,I currently lease forklifts and work with big customers and major vendors while mantling the relationships to help future sales.I enjoy the challenge of helping the customer succeed and working together to achieve common goals.
good,"Learned great skills serving customers and how to handle tough situations. Develop and honed your own skills as a manager and coach. Plenty of room for growth on retail side but does not have much room at the very top like most companies. Benefits are great, WF matches your 401k contribution. Plenty of PTO time."
good,The company encourages team work and cooperation. We would have quartely team outings to boost moral that were organized by our manager. The company also had bonus incentives to increase sales.
good,"The teller position was fun most of the time, you just had to make sure that you were on top of everything so that you were always prepared for anything. I left that vague on purpose because a lot of times you would have something come up you wouldn't expect. The job would have been so much more enjoyable at a higher wage though."
good,"If it wasnt for WellsFargo I wouldnt be the great employee I am today. They train staff so well. De-escalation skills, and communitaley effectively. This is one on the best jobs i ever had. It stared to get very difficult because WF is always money hungry so we had to pretty much harass our clients to sale to them even if they didnt have the money. Thats the reason i lefty and also the pay isnt that great"
good,"There's great variety in Wells Fargo Historical Services. I enjoy the creative, hands-on nature of museum design and installation."
good,The work is primarily research and data analysis. The work environment is  that of a typical office environment. Most of the employees are tenured and appear to like the job.
good,"Fun environment to work in"
good,"Currently working in this company Work–life balance is good and pay package is average, great  place to work, Opportunity to learn and good work culture, exposure to Industries best practices, considerably good career guidance."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to build your career. One only needs to work hard and stay focussed on their goals. There are many young college grads with similar mindset in terms of progression so it makes for good conversations and extra encouragement.
good,"A good work environment, good staff. It was hard for staff to move up within the company. The people I worked with personally were a great group of people."
good,"Because I love math and customer service this was one of my favorite jobs.  A typical day at work consists of working directly with customers, their accounts, and money."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The customer care was great the selling part of the accounts was the hardest part of the job. The staff was always helpful and the hours worked on the weekend was never to bad.
good,I ready enjoyed working for the Wachovia Co. Which is currently Wells Fargo. A typical day at work is fast paced and productive environment. Great place to work.
good,"Mortgage intern for the summer, learned all aspects of the mortgage process. Excellent learning experience and industry exposure. Branch manager set up several activities for us to learn."
good,"System Assets and Configuration Management is maturing quickly.  Framework is solid but needs to be brought to a large and diverse company.  Processes are under construction and need managers and analysts to drive adoption.  Good tools have been selected, work is needed to implement and optimize.  Good work-life balance.  Pay on the lower  end for large banks."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if your goal is to reach your highest potential. It was hard to move up in the retail because of the sales goals they had.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company for entry level positions. You receive continuous training, coaching and career development to ensure your success. Strong focus on a great place to work for employees"
good,"I really enjoy working for WellsFargo. I love the hours, the holiday time, and also vacation days. I absolutely loved the customers and also my employees."
good,"good environment to work,  co workers are great, some locations have everything you need as far as health services, dry cleaning, options for food, banking, and fitness"
good,I would review consumers personal/household income and determine if they qualify for a loan modification for the home mortgage to avoid foreclosure. Once the client is approved for the modification I would have to calculate the new loan amount for the loan modification. Then I would create the final modification documents and mail them directly to all borrowers via FED EX.
good,"This is a great job with great perks like benefits and decent pay. It's not a hard job and there's great job security. The problem is that they seem to have no interest in truly vetting their internal candidates before promoting them, so there are more terrible managers than there are good ones. Managers who don't care about their team, who don't listen, and who don't know how to do their job. As a teller, you can never ever expect to feel valued. This job is fine for a couple years, but if you stay too long you'll want to scream every single day."
good,I enjoyed working here but it was not my career path. They did not hold my position when I had my daughter. The staff that I worked with were fun to work with.
good,"I worked for Wells in some way or another for 8 years collectively. One thing they do incredibly well is TRAIN. They train their employees incredibly well. Something they fail to do is follow up train and hire management from within. There were a handful of times where they hired people outside of our department for management roles and I feel that was a mistake because it's hard to gain trust/respect for your manager when they themselves have never done your job. They can't fully appreciate the amount of work that has to happen to do your job. "
good,very political didn't really base promotion on experience rather on who the favorite to the manager was.  good hours though and okay pay.  great co workers
good,"I enjoy this job. Responsible for examining and analyzing programs, processes, claims, documentation and/or files of unusual, complex and/or higher risk transactions to ensure compliance with internal company requirements and/or agency or government regulations. Communicated overall process or transaction quality and provides feedback to appropriate contacts regarding identified material deficiencies or issues including identification of inconsistencies.  Analyzed risks and offsets and develops solutions for problems identified.  Acted as a mentor to lower level team members and assisted with their development.  Provided support for exam management activities and any other initiatives as needed"
good,Enjoyed working for this company. They have made some mistakes along the way but have corrected. Growth opportunity if in the bay area as they are headquartered.
good,"In the current regulatory environment, much of the focus is complying with increasingly complex regulatory rules. In addition to this, the company is coming to grips with being the product of decades of mergers and acquisitions. There are many opportunities to improve and this is a company that will only improve over time."
good,Large complex organization with with ever evolving (and confusing) policies and processes.  Managers of widely varying capabiliies at all levels within the organization.
good,"I had good jobs and bad jobs and good managers and bad managers during my many years at Wells Fargo.  Overall, it's a decent place to work.  I just chose to leave to pursue community work."
good,The Culture of Caring is very strong orientated. We all work together and as a group. I feel like my managers truly care about everyone. We do many group activities.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It's hard to get rehired once you lose your position. Management wasn't really a help to employees. Overall i loved my position and being able to interact with costumers
good,"Overall it was a good place to work. I liked everyone there. However, I worked there during the period where we were forced to open accounts even if it wasn't necessary for the consumer. I didn't do it because it was unethical."
good,"Sam day of work each day, learned how to navigate and use Microsoft Office to benefit workflow. People are nice, but work can get boring. Hardest part is working OT every single week. Most enjoyable thing is the people you work with."
good,While trying to work 200 files and take incoming calls to help modify home loans... we were asked to do things that was impossible to do... Every manager had a different answer and the criteria to modify loans always changed.
good,Great place to work. Management was ok.  the mortgage market is always unsteady so that's a risk you take when working there.  good benefits.  over all a good place to work
good,"A typical day at work would include studying for securities licensing if not already obtained. "
good,"A typical day at work is coming in doing opening procedures and  getting night drop in the morning. Helping customers do transactions. Help the other tellers that need assistance with an override, question or concern. Completely control tasks that are assigned to us. Make sure the ATM doesn't have any issues."
good,"Great benefits, decent pay comparatively, takes a while to advance but offers great work/life balance if that's what you want. Health care options are top notch, too."
good,Wachovia Bank is no longer around.  They went under during the financial crisis of 2007 and were bought out and are now a part of Wells Fargo Bank.  They were a great place to work prior to that.
good,"Had a great group of folks with Mainframe Operations and with my final group CICS engineering."
good,Great company to learn and develop from. Daily duties were to order cash as forecast required. Responsible for commercial depository procedures. Complete daily morning huddle and use customer service experience as key to success
good,"Good Work culture and all high standard application. Management team will good they wont put you in pressure for easy task, you have your own space to work within SLA."
good,Wells Fargo is currently going through major changes creating extra stress among management crossing through multiple depts. Was once a great company has potential to be again as long as you aren't a customer.
good,"The overall company is good with advancement opportunities within the department you are originally hired at. It can be challenging if you decide to try another department. It's sales driven and sometimes it can get in the way of doing whats best for the customer. A lot of the ""assistant managers"" aren't well versed in management, they are promoted based on sales which isn't the best way to help others coming up when they lack leadership or teaching skills."
good,I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo.  I didn't feel pressured at the time to sell products as what recently happened and they had to fire employess and Mnagement for unethical sales.
good,I started at Wells Fargo as a Personal Banker and then was promoted to Assistant Branch Manager. It took approx. 2.5 years for this promotion.  The compensation was average however during my time as ABM  the branch where I worked went through 4 different Branch Managers.
good,"•	Received high praise for providing complex resolutions for client's software technical issues. "
good,"Meeting goals is a very  important aspect in every position within the company. In order to succeed, you'll have to be willing to work hard and met the department goals as set forth"
good,"It is a good place to work all the team members are very friendly and esp my Boss is a very good man."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work!  Company  does its best to educate and trained you all year around.  The hardest part of the job is new management and how the process  has become more complicated.
good,"The building was beautiful, the cafe was lovely, the ping pong table and break rooms were wonderful, the events were always fun and the coworkers became more like family than coworkers. The highly competitive and drive in my building  made for, at times, a tense and uncomfortable work environment but the customer experience made it worthwhile, aside from the good benefits, generous PTO, paid holidays  and lots of opportunity for OT hours"
good,"Residential Management Program is a great department at Wells Fargo.  We focus on mitigating risks for customer and the bank by reviewing the attorney firms' process, billings and procedure.  I've learned many valuable knowledge in details in foreclosures, loss mitigation, vendor management, and banking relationship systems.  As firms starting to improve their performances based on the hard works of our auditors, the needs for auditing seems to be lessen."
good,"Training available. Management engaged,  Benefits exceptional.  Close to home, Compensation above average.  Room for advancement.  Good customer service."
good,"Wells Fargo is really busy and proactive, they really do want their employees to have a good schedule and feel like they want to come to work. However, advancement is really hard and it is difficult to move anywhere within the company."
good,It was good enough for a temp job.  Although I was being paid the same as someone with no experience and I have 10years mortgage experience
good,I enjoy working for Wells Fargo. My day is pretty much talking to customers on their Auto Loans and getting the accounts current. I also set the accounts up for Rep once they hit 75 days or more. I am looking for opportunities to cure delinquency.
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for 18 years. In that time I managed many back office units.  I enjoyed managing people and ensuring that all daily objectives were met."
good,"The company does a great job compensating and providing opportunities for growth, however this comes at a sacrifice of your personal life and family. Hours promised at hire are not the hours you will work and Saturday's are mandatory and the hours continue to increase. The management abuses their power and does not care about their employees. Sales are the only focus in this company. The customer is nothing but a number and at the end of the day they couldn't care less if that customer left because they believe both customers and employees are replaceable. The most enjoyable part of the day is friendships made in other branches with the other employees and being able to have the opportunity to work closely together."
good,"Call center work, basically. Now that the focus is no longer on sales, the company is struggling to regain its footing as far as finding a culture for their employees to thrive in. The pay is competitive, however, and the bonuses have been lucrative."
good,Having daily meetings to discuss production schedules and the SLA of the customer. The enthusiasm of the staff to meet the requirements of the job. The daily camaraderie and respect in team work.
good,Good company to work for and has more pros then cons. Pay was decent and the work was challenging but stay out of the drama and just focus on your job .
good,"Wells Fargo great place to work as far as the money and the advancements. Wells Fargo down fall is the management that runs the departments they are allowed to make a person income to their personal input meaning if they don't like you they can fire you without a doubt, I feel that is not fair or the way a large corporation should be ran. Other then that I loved it will still be there if it wasn't for a certain manager that was racist."
good,They were always on me about my call time and about sales.  Now they have gotten in trouble for the sales emphasis which created problems especially in the branches.  It was a very stressful place most of the time.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company. However, if you are looking to grow with a company it is the company to work for. The experience I received at Wells Fargo was great."
good,"multi tasks, pulling reports and compile reporting for upper management . Track employee productivity and provide to management"
good,"good place to work, but don't expect to be promoted.  very few people get hired into FTE roles.  But, even fewer people leave.  Pay is okay, but not top for sure"
good,"- Position held was entirely focused on identifying new business relationships for our group"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Was hired on as a contractor to fulfill programming of in-house ms access databases. All internal databases are evolving and attached to large DB back ends. Much SQL programming involved. Serious delay times were experienced so I used multiple techniques to improve throughput of embedded queries."
good,"Wells Fargo was a nice place to work and had a many great benefits. This industry has many compensation changes and people move from one company to the next, often. You are generating your leads and clients from local realtors. This business is really dependent on your relationships and in keeping those relationships. Customer service is the key and consistent theme in this business."
good,It was a short stint with Wells Fargo. A very good experience working with them. Helpful and supportive team. Got a chance to interact with few business leader's too.
good,"Productive place to work. I have learned an abundance. Also, this company provide great work/life balance. Great place to work."
good,"This company is a good place to work and gives lots of opportunities to move up within the company. competitive pay, 401K, and time off is also a bonus to working for this company."

good,Work environment is fast paced. very challenging projects to work on. I have learned various aspects of Agile methedology.
good,"Wells really was a good place to work. Can't say a bad thing about those I worked with. If Wells does anything better than the competition, it's training. Yes, you get the usual entry level training too but it can go as deep and far as you want it to."
good,"Fantastic Vision and Values, great Core Competencies and work culture. Loved working under present senior leadership. Culture fosters on professional development, giving your best, being your best. Company believes everyone are leaders."
good,"This is a job that relies entirely on sales and customer service, the individual transactions are treated as sales opportunities, and you are expected to act on every opportunity. Requires an energetic and warm personality, and knowledge of the services offered doesn't hurt."
good,Excessive overtime required.  Management at local level is more focused on numbers than the team members.  Benefits and vacation are okay.
good,Banking is an interesting field of work. It is nice to be able to meet so many different people everyday. The regulars get to know you and begin to feel their visits to the bank are very enjoyable. The work atmosphere is different than any other field. There is no room to move ahead or grow in the this particular line of work. However the benefits are nice depending on the company.

good,"Wells is a good company to work for. We get to help people manage their finances and sometimes help manage their lives as well, through their finances. work with a great team team where everyone understands our goals and work hard to reach them. As a manager the hours are sometimes long, but that comes with the territory. Great benefits so that when your family needs them they are spot on. As a manager the hardest part about my job is finding the right people to work at my location. Making sure that this person is the right fit is not always as easy as it seems. The Best thing about the job is that; 1) I get to help customers succeed in their finances, 2) I get to help my team discover talents that maybe they didn't know that they had to help uncover additional ways we can help our customers."
good,"Very uptight place to work, rules constantly changing. Management breathing down your back about nothing even when you do all you can nothing is appreciated"
good,"Wells Fargo is a great employer, but the department you work in might cast a negative shadow on your overall impression.  There are excellent medical benefits, generous PTO, maternity leave, FMLA etc.  Compensation is not on par with it's banking peers.  You must negotiate your salary well when you accept the job offer as raises are minimal and merit increases are rare (at least for my department).  My position required constant travel so the work/life balance was often unbalanced, but I obtained air miles, hotel points etc. I would definitely work at this company again."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I love my current manager.  She is very understanding and is very adamant about getting me to the next area of my career, be it with Wells Fargo or not.  She genuinely wants me to learn more about being an effective leader."

good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful place to work with room to advance. With so many different positions available you can easily become who you always wanted to be by working there. Job security is one thing that I feel needs to be addressed, many people have families that is their priority. in my opinion working there as a single parent you should have a list of back ups for your family because once you are at work home doesn't seem to matter to the ones in higher positions. I understand business is business, however for the ones that have their priorities in line Family is first and work is second. I do miss working there a Wells Fargo, it seems all that I feel I was good at I found there however staying seemed to be the only issue."
good,Wells Fargo has very family like atmosphere and everyone is so friendly and helpful. They are also do great things to give back to the community.

good,"Good place to work. "
good,"Wells has a lot to offer, benefits are pretty amazing, the pay is great, bonuses are great and advancement opportunities are limitless in that they don't make you wait a year before you can advance if you are doing great.

good,"If you're a people person and great with making sales/closing deals, I would recommend."
good,"A typical day at work entails assisting customers with issues concerning their banking needs.  My job also consists of leading team members each day through transactions and daily production in the retail banking industry.  I prepare schedules, hire, coach, promote, and release on occasion employees within our branch. I am personally responsible for my own job performance, as well as the other team members in our branch.  I am also responsible for providing excellent customer service to any and all customers every moment of every day."
good,"Work can be challenging which is great, But I've been in sales for a long time, and retail banking it's not a typical sales job. Checking account everyone has one, if you know what I mean. I learn a lot, and one of the great things I'm going to take away from working at Wells Fargo. Learning to plan your day is what will make you a successful retail banker. Cold Cooling lead, is the only thing I hate about this job. Can't really talk about management, cause for me I don't need them to know what I'm doing wrong at my job. The best part about this job, are the customers. I love and I mean love talking to new people everyday, and meeting some of the most interesting people in the area. I can go on for days about clients."

good,"Very monotonous work. "
good,"Working here I learned a lot. The job comes with perks that most jobs don't come with. The managers were pretty fair, they didn't play favorites. If you work hard you can move up. The only thing is that it was very repetitive and it got boring at times. But it was a job that made me feel important and like I was doing something good."
good,"I waited on customers and did my best to make them happy. I made deposits, loan payments, and opened accounts. I referred customers over to the loan department and did safe-deposit box payments."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo is rewarding and stressful.  As a Service Manager, I oversee a group of about 8 to 12 tellers.  My location has a separate motor bank which can cause some headache.  While at my currently location, I was the only Service Manager when are supposed to have 3.  It caused me to work all day and 6 days a week.  It took away from my time with my husband and family."

good,I was part of the Norwest/Wells Fargo buyout so they mapped us with a SD location.  I loved working with those team members in the Underwriting Dept.  Due to our branch being so busy we worked a lot and I learned a lot from our Underwriting Team.

Would love to see more of the Wells Fargo Mission Statement to come forward from management rather than constant concern with sales goals."
good,Great work environment. Everyone is given endless amounts of opportunity to advance if that is part of your career development. Very diverse work environment. 98% of the job positions focus highly on sales.
good,"Wells Fargo as a company has a great reputation. Your experience with Wells will depend on your dedication, your department/location, and management. I had many great experiences in 7 years and was promoted many times with large salary increases. Then I encountered horrible leadership where I was led by a ""boys club"" of leadership. This caused me to leave. I would love to go back to the company, given the right leadership."
good,"A typical day at the company included a fast pace job development, a great human team with a lot of passion for their work and unity. The management was there always for support and with not a huge team it was easy for management to individually help you as a professional.

I worked with wonderful co-worker.  They are knowledgeable and very willing to assist when needed.   The most difficult part of my job is not being able to obtain a solution in a timely manner.

My co-workers were great, they depended on me a lot, just as management did. I had a vast knowledge of everything so I was the go to person for everyone, closers, processors, underwriters. Especially when it came to fees, Hera Hoepa, etc. The hardest part of my job was trying to do all of the rush loans that were brought to me, trying to get them done when a had a line of 5 people at my desk needing help with fees, title, HOI, etc. But I handled it and smiled the whole time. Everything worked out great!"

My management team was always unstable since I have worked with seven branch managers in the last 7 years. My coworkers have mostly been like a family as we would share ideas to improve company revenue and chemistry with each other. The hardest part of this job is communication with staff and clients. We don't see eye to eye on a lot of things and have weekly meetings to resolve the issues. I always enjoy working with the public. It really makes my   day to see new and familiar faces learn about how they can become financially literate once they sit down with me.

good,"in becoming a  strong asset to a major company, Wells Fargo gave me the best advantage to grow not only as a CSR but as a person. coming to work everyday with certian goals and things to attain really pusghed my drive in the banking industry. Aside from the job itself, we usually (reps) were concerned about the micro-mangement that comes when certian team leads or supervisors dont meet quotas that can effect them. As bieng a leader on the floor withtthe new hires, i never had an issue with co workers, wells fargo gave me a great hands on experience on how to teach and be open minded to others. All in all the most enjoyable part of my day was knowing that on each call i had the chance to make somebodys life much better during there finacial situation or just providing great support and service."

At Wells Fargo I am responsible for doing things right the first time, up selling Wells Fargo products, and also completing the task within guidelines/protocol. My managers and co-workers are very hands on and supportive; we all work as a team.

Each customers bring different experience, you never really know what you're going to get. The work is stressful, like any other financial institute, each employees has a quarterly incentive goal to meet."
good,None of the company are bad but every company has its owen goods and bads.
good,"Wachovia was a good place to work for I give them 4 stars until they become wells fargo the environment changed  Wachovia was a more calm people environment, management could use an overhaul."
good,poor commission payout. no chance for management or growth oppty.

good,"Great place to start banking career. Lots of training. "
good,"I worked at a couple branches and had a love-hate relationship with the position. I loved interacting with customers, and I loved learning the regulations and policies of the bank, however the pressure to sell was not something I was comfortable with. Overall, it was a decent job, but certainly had its shortcomings."
good,good employers and good with their customers. Too bad they are no longer
good,Flexible work schedule with limited supervision. Pay based on years of service and vague review. Lack of acknowledging education with commensurate pay.
good,"The management could use better skills. The co-workers are understanding, hard working, and loyal to each other."
good,It was a great learning experience to work for just a well known business.  It taught me how to work on my customer service skills one-on-one with our clients since we had to meet them in person.
good,Work was not to difficult and enjoyed the office space which i worked in.
good,"Fast paced environment, but great team to work with.  I've only been with WF for a short period of time, but within that timeframe I have learned a lot in regards to my job.  This is mainly due to the support of my co-workers and their willfulness to be a resource."
good,Responsible for mobile delivery for all platform and Tech lead and Onsite coordinator
good,"My day begins with me arrive early to ensure that the systems and phones are working properly. the calls slowly trickle into the lines as the day gets started. The rush of helping loyal customers and non-customers by providing outstanding customer service. In this position I have learned that each phone call is a new experience and that each interaction will go completely different than the one before it. My peers are excellent at providing positive feedback when coaching and they provide daily motivation to keep the team on their toes to meet goals. The most difficult part of the job is not over thinking. However, the thrill I get is knowing that the time I took to assist my customer will all of his/her questions is always appreciated even when I am not able to provide the answer the customer wants."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,My role with wells fargo was before them joining the retail banking world with Wachovia. I was a credit manager where I had to looking for clients to provide financial solutions.
good,"Company is a little top heavy with management.  The work enviroment was good.  Benefits were great.  Learning was provided, but needed more ability to update and stay current on a varity of topics.  The main and most crucial were provided.  Great co-workers on my team.  Alot of free breakfasts and lunches."

good,The sales goals are very high.  There is room for growth if this is your thing.
good,I didn't like the financial institution because it takes money from the lower balanced people to provide higher interest rates for the high balance people. So i didn't like selling their stuff. Easy Job though.

good,The sales goals are constant and challenging. If you like to sell and want to be rewarded Wells Fargo is the place.
good,The company hired  qualified management and encouraged employees to advance
good,"I review various accounts to ensure all regulations and procedures are followed. I have learned the importance of communication, team work and how to work under little supervision. I feel that this company is wonderful for any career level and they have a management style that encourages team member feedback and engagement. The hardest part of my job is learning to be a remote employee as opposed to having a manager on site. I enjoy learning new things, helping to ensure that all procedures are followed and assisting in risk analysis/mitigation."
good,"Good bank, nice culture, good management. Not that much room to grow."
good,"great customer service, management was good, got along with all employees and enjoyed what I did.  Foreign currency exchange"
good,"- Run daily reports/pipelines for funding."
good,"The typical day at Wells Fargo was to receive new relocating clients and to reach out to them over the phone.  I would then answer any questions they would have, go over the pros about using Wells Fargo vs. any other bank for their new mortgage.  I would take their application if they wanted to do that or I would schedule a later date to contact them.  I would also reach out to previous clients who have or have not applied for a mortgage with me.  If a client had gotten a contract for a home I would get the new home information along with their realtor's information.  I would also go over with the client the next steps and what documents may  be required of them before closing on the new home.  Once a loan processor gets assigned to the client I would reach out to them again to give them the name of the processor and to verify the documents we will be needing from them. I also am their main point of contact if any issues come up before closing."
good,A tyical  day at work requires me to log on and meet my goals each day. I have learned a great deal about mortgages and reviewing credit reports. I really enjoyed my co-workers before the changes. I was able to communicate with them and get positive and negtive feedback from them. They really created a team environment. The hardest part of my job now is working from home under new management and a new team that I have never met before. The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility of working from home.
good,Hardworking fast paced environment.  Worked with some great people.  I gained much experience and enjoyed my time there.
good,Worked independently to meet daily quality and production goals.  Friendly co-workers and helpful team-lead.
good,This job was somewhat stressful but at the same time I learn a lot about mortgages the different laws...
good,"I worked at Wells while I was a full-time student. They accommodated to my school schedule and my co-workers were awesome. Some of the best employees I've ever worked with. Management was okay, but that depends on the branch you get. Overall, I'd recommend Wells Fargo to someone looking to start their career."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"8-5"
good,"Selected as one of 15 associates into company-wide development program to enhance leadership skills by rotating through various departments and independently managing teams"
good,It was an excellent experience working and dealing with customer over the phone providing information and solutions of their concerns.
good,I love the location and people i worked with . It would have be great to have had stable mangers to guide us and gave us the right tools to succeed.
good,"The bank made a commitment to me when I signed on and I made a commitment to them as well. They trained me and I received my certifications as fast as humanly possible and then I was laid off, with what turned out to be 160 of my teammates. I have been re-applying for many jobs since last September have not been able to get face to face interviews with hiring managers for commercial credit positions although I have over 30 years of experience in that area at all levels. Wells is a fine place to work and I liked everyone of my teammates.  I am trying to get back on board the stage coach but it is a lot harder than they said it would be when I was laid off. This is disappointing to me. I will continue to try."
good,Loved the customers I had. To be able to help them in anyway I could.
good,"Great work life balance at this work place, it is now Wells Fargo so i'm not sure of the current work environment."
good,The day goes by fast but you mainly look forward to getting off work lol
good,"Coming to a Fun professional work enviroment is my ideal work place, Being able to be comfortable at work and work with others just as enthusiastic and willing to learn new things from each other as I am. Team work will make a dream work. I believe a little challenge, long day at work keep the excitment going."
good,"Sales, sales, and sales. They want you to sell services to customers and it doesn't really matter if they really need them."
good,"•	Developed sales strategies for maintaining and further penetrating existing client relationships."
good,I think that there should be a move diverse process when it come to picking or promoting people to management.
good,Great volunteer and community opportunities. I've learned a great deal as I was one of the first team members who started with the Quality department in its infancy. Great development opportunities.
good,"Very mellow stress free work place."
good,My job at Wells Fargo was always challenging and productive. The type of claims that I worked were always a interesting learning new and different ways to assist the customer.
good,The management in my division had to interest in growing or developing new business.  SImply maintaining what already was in place.
good,"Edit, format and public Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Procedures."
good,Work environment is not the best and can be tough to advance.  Salary is very competetive with other banks in the area and benefits are good.
good,"Overall an excellent company to work for, in CLG no a lot of knowledge on the management side to help you advance your career and a lot of inconsistency with job requirements. Otherwise great organization."
good,"The job is very sales oriented and that is what will make you stand out to the management. Customer service and operations are important in order for you to keep your job, but you can't advance without great numbers. Your happiness in the position will largely depend on your managers, as there can be a lot of turnover at all levels in the retail sector and you may experience several different management styles. It's a great position to gain experience and start building a resume, but in order to stay long term you really need to have a passion and aptitude for sales."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,This was a good company to work for as a contractor.  The distance made working there a challenge to work over the long term.
good,Wells Fargo has great mortgage products and great professionals on the team.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo is pretty good. Nice facility, nice people that work here. Everyone is willing to help & there is plenty of room for success. I do wish the approach or job was less sales based, and more customer service oriented. The hardest part of this job is the referral requirements. The best part of this job is getting to help people manage their financial needs."
good,"Wells Fargo has a casual, jeans and t-shirts environment.  They encourage working from home.  They have a well-implemented ticketing system that tracks issues per machines, so you can go back in history and see if an issue is ongoing or if it's new.  The management I experienced was not impressive, however they did know their jobs and were willing to do whatever was necessary to get you help if the issue was beyond your experience.  Overall, Wells Fargo is a company I wouldn't mind retiring with."
good,"On average i make 25 plus outbound calls daily, also receive inbound calls. I assist with the loan modification process and i learn new information about the ins and outs of owning a home. My current position is a great learning experience and i enjoy working with people and knowing that i can help someone brings joy to my life. It is now time for me to brach out to something in my field of study because mortage is not my career choice."
good,"There training program is well organized. I learned systems and got along well with trainer and Management. Co workers were not as friendly,"
good,"Worked 23 hour days, six days a week.  Greet customer, arrange accommodations, balance cash register.  clean swimming pool.  Check motel rooms after claaned."
good,"Great culture, flexible work schedule, competitive salaries"
good,"Takes to long to get hired. Still a temp without benefits."
good,Wells Fargo is a solid company to work for. I throughly enjoy the support the company provids to its teammembers. The benefits are great.
good,Worked at same location at Pinkerton/Burns. The atmosphere and job were the same.
good,"An okay job. I had plenty of chances to expand my knowledge and exercise my multi-tasking abilities.  Just is not the job/company for me. It seemed like a job, not a career."
good,"Good place to work, great team players, Great training. not much more to say............"
good,"8am to 5pm, learned how to review and analyze financial documents. Everyone is friendly and goals are obtainable"
good,"Answer 90 plus call a day. Service accounts."
good,A day at Wells Fargo is very fast pace and ever changing. This company is a great place to work. I take about 2000 calls a day and make about 41 calls. This company truely focues on the customer and strive to make the customer experience very pleasant!
good,"Good Place to work"
good,On the cutting edge of efficient training techniques and transition very well with mergers and buyouts.
good,I develop numerous skills working for   Wells Fargo formerly Wachovia. Very busy environment always developing new skills and abilities. We worked as a team and I enjoyed working with them.
good,"It requires a lot of field work. They have a great lead system, but it's up to you to get out there and drum up business. If you don't meet their requirements, they will let you go."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. The slow down in the industry caused our building to be shut down, otherwise I see it as a place to grow and retire."
good,"I am currently ""displaced"". Meaning a 60 day notice and 3 months severance. The mortgage industry is very volatile, one day you can be quickly advancing in your career, and the next day you get laid off. It all depends on rates. HR can claim all they want that performance is weighed. However, on more than one occasion layoffs have been done this way where underperforming people who don't advance (ie more tenure in the CURRENT position) keep their jobs. While the high performing people who advance and have less tenure get the boot. It's the WF way. HR shouldn't have the say, it should be management. They're the ones who see performers and know who isn't competent."
good,I was hired by wachovia bank and loved it there. Worked as a Phone Business banker and it was outstanding
good,"Fast pace, days go by much too quickly. A typical day at work is a combination of working with reports, overseeing progress towards goals, assisting employees with questions and mentoring. Answering emails, working with customers and vendors to resolve any issues."
good,can be promoted quickly. They will work with your schedule.
good,had great managers throughout the years. all lasting one year before they are upgraded to a higher position in the company. every manager has a different way to deal with their employees which has allowed me to take in aspects on each individual to be more successful in my job and the duties i perform.
good,"typical day includes contacting customers regarding loan application, gathering documents. Also ordering appraisals and other required items. scheduling closings, submitting documents, reviewing files."
good,.Good company and great management team. Enjoyable company and my schedule and training was awesome. I really enjoyed working with my supervisor and team. I gained a lot of knowledge from this company reviewing appraisal and the working with appraisers
good,I helped assist bank customers who were in a position of losing their homes. The greatest joy I had from my job was helping people.
good,"Event though this was a temporary position, the time on this job was enjoyable. My only regret was that I was not able to go permanent as this job was not intended to be a permanent one."
good,4 out of 5 stars.  See resume for more details.  I have gone through 3 mergers over the past 26 years.  The mergers have proven to be highly interesting.
good,answered incoming calls to call center...while I was in this department.
good,"Typical day was productive. Assisting clients via electronic systems. Customer base consisted of client services and retail locations. Job was not hard, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the co-workers."
good,Fast paced emviorment great co workers. normal day would be to help from 50-100 customer a day depending on volume of calls. I would also help with review of documents for loan modification and assitance to explain these assistance programs. Collections were a big part of my duties.
good,"I was very lucky to have a fantastic manager here.  Unfortunately, said manager had no authority to help with work/life balance."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company.  They've remained stable and profitable in a down economy and have been a staple to the community in terms of being a provider of jobs to tech folks such as myself.  I've worked 4 contracts there in my career and the one I'm on now has been the best so far.  I do production support for the money movement applications, working mostly on the OPS (Online Payment Services), which means I help ensure the integrity of online transfers.  My typical day at work includes triaging issues that may occur, including any of 100's of batch runs that can fail due to system or network glitches (sometimes in the middle of the night).  If this occurs, my group is counted on to solve what other groups cannot.  We have read access to production databases so we are the ones who figure out what happened and find workarounds to ensure integrity of all money movements.  If transfers get stuck due to (i.e., batch failures), my group writes game plans that include SQL, PL/SQL or shell/perl scripts for the Production Support/DBA group to run.  Our applications are all web service based, so we do not have the luxury developers have to invoke the UI and debug the apps we work on.  We are considered to be the experts in our field and rely mostly on our findings the log files, paired with a general analysis of the code logic to make our best assessment of what might trigger unexpected issues.  We are a tight nit team of only about 4 people, all working very closely with each other.  I am responsible for starting the friday evening happy hour meeting after work, which has been"
good,I learned excellent computer and interpersonal skills. I also learned how to work well in as a team player.
good,Wells Fargo is a great learning ground and offers a variety of lateral move opportunities.  Recommended if looking to get exposure in an industry leading technology rich environment.
good,"If you are interested in having great benefits like healthcare, dental, this is a good place to work, because you can receive it all even working part time. Wells Fargo is very sales driven though, and managers and the company can put a lot of stress on their employees, almost forcing them to leave. Everyday there is a quota to meet."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Fast-paced but friendly environment...Nice place to work but compensation is not sufficient
good,"A typical day at work is help customers with their financial needs, from a simple statement to a deep understanding of their financial situation. Designate time during the day to call customers, find new prospects and set up appointments. Customer questions can be planning for the future, investing, retirement or just learn how to pay their bills and manage an account, my job is advise them in all those areas. Building trust and relationships is the most important part of the job and can also be the most enjoyable part, customers trust you not only with their money but also with personal matters of their lives. The hardest part of the job is getting the sales especially during economic hardships. There are some achievable goals and there are some unachievable goals, unfortunately management press their workers to the edge, stressing them with job security, but that was my experience with that specific manager. Co-workers are nice and most of them offer their help. What I learn is to manage my time at work, prioritize, and keep information safe and aggressive sales. You will also learn to deal with harsh customers and be polite even in difficult situations. Learn to keep integrity and values even when it can affect your sales goals."
good,"Typically I would come in after opening. Get my teller window ready, and start taking customer's transactions. It was a fairly busy location, located just outside the parking lot of a shopping mall. "
good,I perform administrative duties.  I learn about what items make up the federal estate tax return.  Our team had different supervisor.  One would let you know that someone was not happy but would not tell you who mention it. The other was helpful.  Some co-workers had personality issues that effect how they work with people.  The rest was easily to work with. The hardest part of the job was making sure that a 400 page return was put together correctly.
good,"My typical day at work includes running transactions, managing the other tellers, interacting with customers and management, and training tellers. I also complete training and control tasks."
good,"It was fun to work there great customer base, however there wasn't much of a work life balance. Sales became so demanding that it was impossible for each employee to achieve set goals."
good,"fun place to work even though everything is based on sales. Upper management constantly on you to make sure you are offering you are offering other than that nothing is too difficult."
good,Not a bad place to work. Depends on your co-workers. Supervisors are pretty good but mid and upper level management kinda forget how to treat people.
good,"Wells Fargo Bank is a verly large institution. If you produce you get to keep your job. If you don't they'll get rid of you and you won't see it coming. At the end of my tenure with Wells Fargo, I was doing new accounts, new loans, helping out at the cashier line, doing payroll for the tellers, training tellers, assisting the manager, opening the bank,. closing the bank. At the end of the day my feet were tired and I was exhausted. I soon discovered that traditional banking was not for me. My co-workers felt the same way. I left to follow a career in computers, because that's what I went to school for. The most enjoyable part of working for Wells Fargo was the last day I worked there."
good,"I interacted with customers on daily basis, processing large and small cash and non-cash transactions."
good,"The contract was good, but we finished early. We had to convert some access reports to ssrs, and improve the overall response time."
good,The company overall is a great company to work for. There is room for advancement with the company.
good,great place to work for if you are good at sales. good opportunity for incentive pay
good,"Typical day would consist of underwriting lower level loans, reviewing income, government documents, titles, appraisals, home owners insurance and other misc documents."
good,"I grew tremendously at WFFRS...there was opportunity and challenge but unfortunately, some of the management lacked descretion."
good,Highly stressed team building! great! Management strives to coach you to success.
good,"I love working for Wells Fargo, however I am looking for better advancement opportunities and am unable to find something within the company at this time."
good,"This position was a 2 month contract job where I learned much about how a large corporation operates on a national and international scale. My management was helpful, but there were many occasions where I had to figure out what projects to do on my own. The main point of this position was holiday oriented. I personalized 500+ letters as Santa Claus to the children of Financial Advisors for Wells Fargo. Each letter was catered to the interests and accomplishments of each child. Along with this, I did 200+ other mailings and phone calls to Financial Advisors."
good,"Throughout the day I typically work on various projects. I've learned to learn fast. Things seem to change their on a daily bases, and it's something I've learned to alway be ready for."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This company is a great company, but if you are not into sales then it may not be the best company to work for."
good,Laid back atmosphere. Great benefits and relatable managers
good,overall a great company to work for if you are looking for a monday through friday job with some early saturday shifts.
good,"Handled all transactions for customers including but not limited to, check cashing, deposits, savings bonds, cash advances, money orders, cashiers checks, change orders and update personal information on accounts."
good,Micromanaging is huge here but the benefits are great. There are always opportunities to move up and programs to get you where you would like to be in the company.
good,"I have been with Wells for 6+ years. I've learned a great deal about real estate banking, treasury management and finance. I've been promoted twice in two years time and appreciate the fact that I've been able to grow with the company. Wells Fargo offers excellent benefits and compensation. Overall, it is a great company to work for. They value and reward hard work and productivity, as well as diversity and community involvement."
good,"I enjoy working at Wells Fargo, the company have an pleasant atmosphere"
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work if they would give their contractors a chance. we are only looking for a chance.. in the end remember someone gave you a chance but I think this company has forgot how to play it forward
good,Working at a bank is informative. I learned how fraud happens. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the days were customers were lined up out the door due to payroll.
good,Work consisted of working open to close without any prior warning due to employees calling in to work. Besides that it allowed me to expand my customer service skills as well as my sales skills. Only down fall was I was required to meet sales goals without any extra practice or networking. I learned how to establish my skills and obtain customer's business which I believe is the most enjoyable feeling of the job. When the customer leaves happy with what they received as well as had knowledge of what they purchased.
good,I love Wells Fargo but I am looking for a company where I can be recognized for my skills and grow within the company.
good,Building relationships with customers is the best part of the job and helping them reach financial goals.
good,"Wells Fargo over works it's employees on the retail banking side and leverages threats to get performance with a careful balance of recognition. The company has culture that expects each emplyee to do three times the work of one employee, They'll do things such as decrease the number of Business Specailists that earned an average off 55k and make a personal banker who make 35k do the same job. However they do recognize that personal banker by giving him a cool name like business champion."
good,Call center is what it is.
good,I have worked for Wells Fargo for 12 years and have held various positions in retail branches from teller to branch manager. I also spent 4 years in learning and development and currently work as a quality control manager for our premier client underwriting loan center. Each position has been rewarding and challenging and I have had some great managers and co-workers.
good,"A typical day at workis you check you work load meaning checks and batches. You process all check follow up with account manager on funds for clients or the insured to post funds or pay their premiums or to return due to many reason. Porcess all wires or transfered funds amd make sure total amounts match after each batch is posted or depoistto balamce out. Make adjustment were needed and recon to make sure account is in perfect stauts or to see what needs to be paid to clear the balance or to inform the acount manager of what is behide before month end. Everything is on your past, but must be completed by the end of the day. Breaks and lunch is not monitor but must be taken at a respectful time.Emailing all day every day and filing once mail has arrived or things need to be sent out. It seem like alot but it made the day go by and you stay busy!"
good,the best part of the job was interacting with the customers and finding the needs that they nedded. gaining the trust of the customers. learning all of the benifits we has to offer. there were no management opportunities but there where other growth opportunities. assisting the customers with there daily financing that they needed. learning how to manage the main vault to assist the tellers as well as the bank with all incoming and outgoing transactions needed to promote a satisfaction experience for the customers.
good,I enjoyed working in the Reverse Mortgage department. We all worked together as a team. I felt like we were all like family because of the long hours we would work together.
good,I would just run documents thru a sorter machine for 8-10hrs.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The make sure you are up to day in your training and complience.
good,I worked for Wells Fargo for 13 years and would have continued however my job was moved to another state and I was unable to relocate. In the beginning the company was a fun and family oriented however with the fast paced economy they soon became move dictatorship and less pleasant atmosphere to work in.
good,I enjoyed my time here as it was not too much work. Just a relaxing atmosphere. But not a lot of room for upward development and growth.
good,*sales pressure and boring routine work everyday
good,"Is a great place to work you meet friendly people. The pay is great, the benefits are great but the management is HORRIBLE. Usually management is not accountable for any of the errors that you make and you do not even need work experience or education to be upper management. You are choosen for upper management on the way you look and who you know."
good,"Learn about cell and home technology, customer service and how billing work"
good,"During a typical work day I do everything all over the bank. I handle any variety of customer service issues including explaining the way interest works on different credit products. I open new account for walk in customers, both existing and new, and make phone calls to solicit new business. Also, I may train new employees or assist in functions behind the teller line, providing approvals for large transactions and moving money from vaults to teller drawers. At the end of the day I must submit between 4 and 5 reports detailing my sales, service and other activities for the day. If the required numbers are not met, we all may have to stay late and make phone calls to solicit business by phone."
good,after spending 2 1/2 years with this Company it has certainly changed as most banks will to accomadate for the economic change. It can be very rewarding but equally dwn fall. TRY your best and prepare to sale.
good,"Great company to work for, demanding goals to meet. Great management."
good,Wells Fargo has one of the best training programs for their employees and make sure that you are prepared and ready to be successful in your desired position.
good,"All depends on the the branch you're at and your manager. Great PTO and benefits, pay could be higher. Saturdays are part of the package unfortunately."
good,I enjoyed going to the different branches as a Roving Teller. Meeting new people and providing customers with any questions or concerns they may have had with their accounts or loans.
good,"Ensure yo understand all levels of the job qualifications and are ready to do what it needed to meet those, do not compromise your ethis for better numbers"
good,Wells Fargo is not a bad place to work at all. I have a great time there. They have alot of different challanges and prizes you can win.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, benefits were good. Able to learn new loan types. People were very friendly and helpful."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work. Having merged most recently with Wachovia Bank the bank is still in a state of transition.
good,"Althought Wells is a good company to work for I am not sad about our seperation. Benefits were changed dramatically and not in favor of the team members. Managerment were demanding more each day. With less rewards, or incentives."
good,"WellsFargo is a great place to work in many ways. They have a lot of knowledgable, experienced people, good cultural aspects and affinity groups and lots of business lines to learn about. Chances for advancement vary greatly between departments, but there's always a lot to be learned from wherever you are."
good,Great place to get  in the financial industry and learn the business. It’s is a very large company so there is something for everyone. I would recommend for someone looking to get in the industry.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Very gud environment to work. But not satisfied with the salary. Work is not to complex. Few decisions taken by senior management is not satisfactory . Salary structure is not good. Work life balance
good,"Immediate managers(s) were good. Company seemed a bit disorganized and slow moving. Was treated decently and respectfully. All in all, a decent experience."
good,"Wells Fargo offers a great chance to get yourself into the Finance world. By interacting daily with customers and working with you team members you can gain a lot of strength to propel you further into the finance world, whether still with Wells Fargo, or another company."
good,"Good people there but company is very much in flux given recovery from  reputational issues and new CEO. Company will return to historic performance, but will take time to get there."
good,Overall it was a consistent place to work with accepting and nice colleagues. There were a fair amount of benefits and incentives from hard work. Always managers available to help.
good,"Good Organization to work  ,except Management , some Managers are not helping basically Hyd wellsfargo, Bangalore Wells fargo is so nice to work, Every thing is good"
good,"The workplace at Wells Fargo is supportive, inclusive, and innovative. I appreciate my managers and peers for all that they offer - the company is truly always working to do right by their customers and by their team members. However, my line of business has proved challenging for growing your career. There is no career path, and there are few opportunities for gaining skills and exposure to work outside of your team."
good,A reputable and solid company but just didn't my career purpose at the time.  I knew exactly what to expect day to day but needed more challenges each day.
good,"Great starter bank,  place to learn all the nitty gritty. I learned a lot while at Wells Fargo and would happily work for the bank again. There is room for growth."
good,"Culture has taken a turn to where regulators are more important than team members and customers  "
good,"Typical very large company.   Culture is nice but managers do not have a ton of experience and are locked into tight guidelines.   Again, typical for a very large company."
good,It's the true definition of you stay at your job because of your immediate manager. Employees in this department are overworked and under compensated. Blinded by double overtime which isn't worth the insanity.
good,A great place to work without all of the added pressures one may normally experience. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity for growth. Lots of positive changes are taking place.
good,"Although the pre-employment screening was strenuous, overall this is a good place to work. I would like to see a little more diversity in the Orlando  offices."
good,I liked working at Wells Fargo but to much emphasis on what employees were doing wrong versus working on achieving success.  Too much emphasis on JD powers rating.  it was PERFECT or you were written up. My review was always perfect but I saw ALOT OF Good people dismissed.
good,"Wells Fargo pays us well, with good vacation time and opportunities to move up and advance. They set goals to help customers achieve their financial goals and put them first in everything they do."
good,A nine to 5 pm work week with overtime. Knowledge on going. Management style strict. Workplace  environment good. Overall a good place to work. Employee cafeteria for both breakfast and lunches at discount. Free parking.
good,"The work is interesting and keeps you. Management is very inclusive and approachable. The factors to keep in mind is that the schedules feel like they are unevenly split, only 4 or 5 people in a 50 person team has two consecutive days off and even fewer have a shift that does not en-tale closing at 7:30 P.M. The work/life balance is almost none existent."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Constructive challenge and fund to work with this company. "
good,I was brought in as the sole mortgage loan professional for the Coon Rapids branch of Wells Fargo.  When I started my position I was surprised to find they had recently hired another mortgage loan professional for the branch and have given him the office I was promised.  I was disappointed but remained there attempting to develop self generated business opportunities.
good,Be prepared to learn a lot in a short amount of time. It can be a lot to take in but it is a great experience and they will work with you if you are having trouble.
good,You are timed for everything your entire shift. Management was very fair and clear when it came to communication. The job task itself was fun. You'd analyze information presented to you on a customers profile and you'd help assist the customer to prevent fraudulent activity.
good,"I loved working for the bank. My goal was always advancement. The issue was the process was very selective. Their was already a preselected person before the position was chosen. I felt I never had a fair chance to be selected. My work ethic and knowledge of the banks policies and procedures was, in my opinion, much greater than the chosen candidate. Often times the person chosen did not stay with the company. I"
good,"The management was very professional. They training and cross training  were very thorough. The procedures, reference material, and database were well established and ready to apply toward my tasks."
good,"Wells Fargo was an excellent company, although a little too corporate for me. I felt more like a number rather than a person, and they offer plenty of opportunities for advancement, willing you initiate it."
good,"A typical day at work would consist meetings and on call meetings interaction with fellow team mates, working and analyzing on data. The workplace culture is fun and interactive."
good,Very enjoyable environment. All facilities are available.its a very good company. Will get 2offs and will go for team outing from company end no need to pay any extra money.
good,I am not interested in sharing information about my experience working here. I need to get to 150 characters so I will keep typing until I get there. OK.
good,Wells will be a better place to learn and provides challenging environment which will bring out best of every team member. Progression will be surely based on performance and paid fairly to the current market.
good,"Wells Fargo treats their employees VERY well. I resigned last week, after a life-consuming 6 years as assistant Branch manager and now I am questioning my sanity. I don’t have another job lined up and I could have stayed there & literally been paid to sit on my butt and do nothing all day with great benefits. I gave it my all, every day, and got nothing in return. Nobody- Not even my manager- asked me WHY I quit."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo, great experience. Patients and empathy is a must , you also learn alot about how to communicate and personal financial education."
good,"I love this job, however, the schedule was horrible. I would prefer to get off of work by 5:00pm but other than that it's a decent place to work for as long as you enjoy being in a call center environment."
good,I feel that the company does not promote advancement or show employees how to advance within the company. If you are lucky enough to get a good manager. He/she will help you with your career path.
good,"Our group is dissolving, so the turnover rate is high right now. It's like working in a library environment. We aren't told what the future holds for our group, which makes it difficult to want to be here."
good,"Opportunity to move up in the company, but has a lot of changes that at times can affect a persons production. The benefits and work environment is nice."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company with good people. But being a bank, they are still using old technologies and that doesn't help a person who is interested in learning the latest and the greatest out there."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the atmosphere was great.  Everyone was very professional.  The compensation was less than similar banks in the area.
good,"Management will expect results, realistic or not, however, support those who produce. Management in my group did a poor job of fostering change/innovation."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Centralized ops position with plenty of face time with senior managers. A lot of repetitive, mundane tasks with little authority to implement meaningful change. A culture with older advisors who were very technology averse and did not like taking orders from a younger individual even though I was licensed and qualified."
good,"Great starting positions, pay is good also looked ar each year per area with advancment options. Great options to move around and to get more money, i would say try not to get stuck in one location for a long time. Get into indirect branches of Wells Fargo like mortgage, crimes, risk, or QA, there is a lot of money in those options."
good,very decent pay. great place to work now that they've stopped individual sales goals for their employees.  not much chance to move up which sucks. fantastic benefits.
good,A decent company that has good pay and good benefits. The environment I worked in was low stress and they encouraged a healthy work/life balance. I learned some new tools while I was there.
good,Typically the day starts and we have a morning meeting to energize the team. Afterward we open up the branch and assist the people that come in with whatever they may need. Most days are fairly steady with the occasional busy days at the beginning and ends of the month. The culture is recommended to be around experience for fellow team members and customers but there are days when that doesn't take place.
good,Good place to work. There's a lot of potential for growth but at times it comes from moving between positions rather than internally. Still would overall recommend working here
good,"Office nice location. Management say not mandatory OT, but if you don't then it definitely is frowned upon. You work OT, it's great. You are 1 minute late at your desk you are  then placed on informal warning. I overall like working for Wells Fargo."
good,"1. customer service driven - whether on the phone or live interaction with a customer."
good,"A fast-paced work environment that needed individuals that were productive, accurate, and has attention to detail. Great work environment, with colleagues that truly cared."
good,"Good place to work if you enjoy change. Financial services and technology are currently in very fluid growth cycles. Therefore, the ability to be comfortable with change is a must."
good,"Great place to advance"
good,"Working at the CIC Building is not much different than any other call center. Team environment thats like family. You work together, fight together and win together."
good,It was a good place to work but management needs help. You do not have a lot of down time. Management is more worried about gossip then doing work. Upper management such as the district manager has no real idea of what it takes to keep things running and are quick to blame the staff even when we are short handed and not taking lunches because we do not have the man power.
good,"Very good experience working in this company. I have learned below technologies in this company:"
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits. The bank really trains you in laws, compliance and other great knowledge that really helps in real life situations."
good,"They gave me the training I needed to do assigned duties and let me do them."
good,"Work was pretty laid back where I worked, clear goals and expectations.  While the benefits were nothing inspiring the work culture overall was pretty great except for the occasional micromanagement."
good,I have been working here since 2016 and i have enjoyed a lot. It feels like a second home to me as everyone at work are caring loving and friendly which i think is most important.
good,Enjoyable workplace but also a competitive environment. Worked with some wonderful people. Could have had better management and goals and workload changed very frequently.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I like the fact the is room for growth in the company. I am able to help my customer with their financial needs & and share my up and down in my life to help them in their future to not make the same mistakes.
good,It was a great first job in the finance industry.  Their training was extremely thorough and I learned a great amount during my time with them. You should try it?
good,"Advancement is difficult, everyone starts as a part-timer and must stay a year before applying for more hour positions that are usually given based of seniority instead of education or qualifications."
good,It is a desk job answering inbound calls and making outbound calls for eight hours straight. As long as you know the procedures and keep up with the daily changes it is a great job.
good,Micromanaged. A typical day at work is customer relations. Quota for opening accounts is 20 per day. There is a lot of cash handling and learning new systems.
good,"No complaints overall. Good experience and great co-workers. Wells Fargo has had it's difficulties in the past couple of years but they are definitely focused on building a better, more customer-centric business."
good,Good jobs.  Most positions moving east now. Most administration positions are in the City. More specialized skill sets spread out. 13 Paid holidays off.
good,Wells Fargo is a wonderful company to work for I hit a year working there and in the time I was promoted and got pay raise. Of u work hard and do what u have to do you shouldn't have a problem getting far in the company. Only reason I left was because I was moving. They did offer me to relocate.
good,"Days went by quickly as I was always busy.  Variety of duties, great work situation. Initially the management situation was fantastic. Felt I was respected and a necessary worker. The office eventually closed as work was shifted out of state. As the work wound down it became a difficult place to be - other employee attitudes made it uncomfortable."
good,As a client assosciate the job wasn't difficult.  The Financial Advisors 's are suppose to pay you 1% of their production but it's their choice and many just won't.
good,"good place and working culture is awsome. mangement is cooperative. Some inquiries get hard when customer or team member dont want to listen what wells polcies are telling. over all good place, lot to learn and so many opertunity to grab and wide area of filed to use ones talent."
good,Bureaucratic and challenging. There seems to be a very different culture per department and group. Some groups were very laid back while others were constantly pushed to the limit.
good,"Work life balance was not the best.  I was let go due to a vehicle breakdown stranding me in Utah, More than 300 miles from my home.  After having all my other stats above par"
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo and skills learned have been placed in the resume on file. Any additional questions can be addressed at any time that is convenient.
good,"Ran transactions for customers and worked heavily under sales goals.  Fun workplace with great support from staff/bankers.  When ready, job advancement was offered"
good,"If you are working exclusively remotely at this company your job may not be as secure. Best if you live at a major Wells Fargo hub. Things were going great with my job, as well as that of a number of my colleagues who work remotely, and did not live at a major Well Fargo hub. We ware all laid off. The performance was not a factor for the mass layoff."
good,"Servicing phone calls from customers regarding their home mortgages. Learned how to talk to different type of people (relator, thinkers, socializers, and directors). Learned how mortgages worked. Learned how to utilize different systems and improve in multi-tasking. Learned how to build relationships with customers. Management was a hit or miss, you either got a supervisor that cared for you or ended up with a supervisor that didn't care for your advancement, only their own progress. Favoritism is huge. Hardest part of the job was the numbers of products you had to offer on every call and the goal percentage you would have to meet each month. Great coworkers."
good,"Strong development of team members"
good,Wells Fargo Dealer Services was a good place to work.  I was able to learn a lot and cross train in other department to attain more knowledge about my industry.  I was able to utilize that knowledge in my next role.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo has a great training program, and are excellent at developing talent. They teach you the job skills you need to succeed when you advance or leave. The company culture is still demanding, with unrealistic goals and pressure, but that's getting better. There has been a big drive to improve turn over, but there is no job security. Wells Fargo is great company to work for overall."
good,It is a good company to work for. Every group is different but positive and helpful. The company offers great benefits and work flexibility for remote and flexible work locations.
good,Only negative is mortgage business changes fast and with that so do layoffs.  If you are not a top producer your time with Wells can be very short and it adds a ton of stress.
good,Wells Fargo has a phenomenal credit culture.  It's a very conservative culture where you learn in addition to sharing your learned experiences. One generally has the opportunity to grow in their career.
good,Stressful unattainable sales goals.  Good pay and great benefits.  The people you work with are like a family.  Down fall was call nights to make cold calls to increase sales.  Holidays off great vacation
good,"Access clients’ accounts and analyze visual clues to support your financial status. Use assertive communication techniques when dealing with delinquent customers."
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. I was able to receive 3 raises in 1 year. I was offered the opportunity to grow within the company. My only complaint was the work hours. I needed an earlier shift with consistent days off
good,"Great place to start. Going to school, or have another career in mind? This would be a great temporary position. There is not much movement here, its teller or banker, and if you wait forever management."
good,"Fast paced environment, great culture and values, had most holidays off every year. Great benefits plan overall a great company to be emplotlyed by. Would definitely recommend to someone with or without experience."
good,I am looking for a fresh change and more challenge as a whole. I inherited a manager that was not engaged in my abilities to be a great administrative assiatant.
good,"Great company, super easy job. Only bad side is the turn over (due to people leaving and promoting within); within a years time, my branch went from the best work environment Ive ever exerienced to a sub-par place where I took on a heftier bulk of work due to the lack of motivation/drive from my peers."
good,Corporate culture reduce abilities make any advancements. Either you are too good in your role and top tier executives and managers do not want to lose you. Or you most likely get laid aid due to yearly revenue requirements by executives.
good,Wells Fargo is actually a well non mice managed company overall u come to work do your job and go home i enjoy coming to work wish OT was offered more tho and i haven’t been there that  long but pay is always a topic of discussion and and negotiations can be looked at at some point
good,I feel like my branch could’ve been more involved with getting workers where they wanted to be career wise but other than that I enjoyed working here.
good,Working for Wells Fargo at the time was high pressured sales. The branch I worked at was very busy. The turnover rate was very high at the branch I worked at.
good,The Organization was changing directions at the time of employment.  Associates were great and team work was strong.  Obtaining goals was hard at times and now things may be different.
good,"I enjoyed and learned many traits as I had to wear many hats in the Department. Te company offers great training and its very diverse. They always have team leads and senior reps assisting the floor. Had the experience of working as a collections, loss mitigation, customer service and home preservation agent."
good,Wells Fargo will train you well and you will have decent benefits but the compensation packages are and bit too low depending on what job position you are applying for. They invest a lot of time and money in technology and marketing. Some of which I believe could be skipped and the money saved could be spent on employees whether in additional benefits or salary.
good,Not a bad place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with it just wasn’t for me. You bonus every month if you meet your quota so that was a good incentive.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed working for this company. It was very culturally diverse and i also enjoyed the people that I worked with everyone was helpful and worked as a team.
good,"The company is growing and changing. Someday you will get caught in lay off, it's just what is meant to be, unless you are northern HQ. Des Moines, or Sioux Falls."
good,Wells was a great place to work. They work on train and advance your career. Work life balance is acceptable and the schedule can be flexible. Good PTO and other benefits.
good,"everyone had already been knowing each other, and i always felt like the odd one out while working there. benefit is I do see people who have stayed there for a long time, decades even in the same bank and moved up, so there is potential for growth"
good,I worked for Wells Fargo when you had sales goals.  There are no sales anymore.  I really enjoyed helping the customers with their banking needs and looked forward to seeing them everyday.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great bank to start your career.  The senior people are generally welcoming and willing to help advance your career.  I was lucky to work for a great team and learned a lot,"
good,"I recently retired early from Wells Fargo. Up until 2016, I was proud to work for this company. The scandals reported and the lack of management’s addressing a toxic culture in a few business lines do not reflect the business culture throughout the firm. Some managers are jerks but you will find that at any large firm."
good,"In my department, my team has great culture. Fast paced but good balance between work/life. Most difficult part is understanding the processes, otherwise it's an easy learning process dependent on how much you're willing to learn."
good,"Wells is a very inclusive and non confrontational work environment, full of teamwork and collaboration.  Voices are heard and ideas applied.  Management works for and with their staff and assist in their growth when possible,"
good,"Management could be better. Great benefits such as matching 401k, paid volunteer time, great health insurance, PTO and much more. Work/life balance could be a lot better."
good,"A typical day at work included the normal processing steps (4506T, Flood Certifications, VOE's, reviewing tax Returns). Scheduling closings and final review before passing the files over to the Mortgage Closers. Standard business meetings and lunch outings. Some business travel."
good,Wells Fargo is a great working environment with many of opportunities to grow and learn how to be successful in the corporate world. Great Tema building strategies and open policy.
good,My Branch was awesome co workers but company was hard to deal with. The Company in General was going through problems and the employee had to adjust and make up for it.
good,"The schedule was fairly consistent, always hovering around 40 hours per week. Overtime was frowned upon. Sales was the primary focus. Coaching was readily available."
good,"Excellent place to work."
good,"its a good job, good benefits. I just wished it paid more for what all asked for you to preform your job. management is ok, I've had better. people here are nice."
good,"Good values , depending on location management needs improvement. Recommend having experience with checks or a lot of cash handling before working as a teller."
good,"Wells Fargo with a good opportunity to work I was able to move up in the bank and I was glad I could I was given the opportunity to work there."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of attending customers with excellent customer service along with selling our services. The goal was to open 3 accounts every day (credit card, savings, online banking, etc)."
good,When I left Wells Fargo the culture was very sales focused and you had to hit your numbers. It was all they cared about. I hope that has changed with the exposure of their sales practices.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Managers have  a tendency to promote the newer employees.  And if you are bilingual it's a plus and get promoted quicker.  Benefits are good. They do 6% matching for the 401k.
good,"I work in a call center environment. The people I work with are fun and we have working fun. But you always have to stay professional with other departments and with the customer. You have to know how to control yourself and be mentally prepares talking to customers because a lot of the situations are unique and you have to do your best to help the customer. There is support on the back end to help resolve the issues. Over all it a good place to work, good pay benefits paid time off. If you have a great supervisor is makes everything that much better."
good,Making deposits and withdrawals for clients.  Management changes a couple times while I was employed.  Hardest part was having a schedule that was not consistent.
good,"is not competitive salary wise, great work like balance, very little growth, lots of opportunity to volunteer/community involvement, management is approachable"
good,"I wasn't an actual employee for Wells Fargo,therefore, I don't have much of an actual review. I'm probably the wrong person to ask. I do apologize...."
good,I really would rather not comment on this matter. There are several good things about working there and several not so good things about working there.
good,"There is a lot of untapped talent waiting to shine due to restrictive roles, politics and reorganization activities. The pay is a little less than competitive. The culture is positive and conducive to working families."
good,"Pros great company to work for, great pay, good culture  after management  difficult to move up leasership has been changed tremendously in last 6 years so staying in retail to long may not be the best thing. Learn what you need and use it to  get you to next step."
good,This is a good place to work.  Most team members are friendly.  There is stability and the work and life balance is great.  Compensation can be more competitive.
good,Many reorganizations delay execution of strategy. Decentralized functions across US adversely impacts teamwork. Cross functional functions are not collaborative and protect their turf.
good,It has been a good 7 year run for me here at Wells Fargo. I’ve learned so much and had a wonderful time assisting all of my clients with their financial needs. Wells Fargo is currently going in a direction as a company that I’m not to sure about and so this has inspired me to look into other positions else where to allow me to grow as an individual in banking.
good,This job was all about customer service and sales.  My only complaint was the sales expectations caused animosity between employees.  It is my understanding that this is no longer the case at Wells Fargo
good,The site leader was very rude. She was not compromising with people's home life that may have children. She was not willing to give leave for people who are relocating.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, given many opportunities to use existing skills and add new skills, only issue would be with management on all levels."
good,Wells Fargo had a hard time meeting the needs of middle market sales. They also made promises during the hiring process that were not upheld.  For instance I was told my compensation was going to be a 40% payout which only lasted one year and then was cut by 30%.. overall it was a good place to work but you could not believe everything that was promised.
good,Overall WellsFargo is a great company to work for. It's better than most....I enjoyed my time there. The location is great. I would recommend friends to work there.
good,"This was a high stress, high pressure job, but it also came with a great sense of accomplishment."
good,I was lead teller and my main station was the drive thru I enjoyed my job but unfortunately I was wrongly let go due to someone else worth ethics. After being let go I couldn't get a job at another bank ever.
good,"I worked mostly from home because there were not enough spaces for contract employees.  It was easy to set up Skype meetings with team members, and we were able to get work done in a virtual office setting."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good place to work, great people to work with. I was there when they still had sales goals which put a lot of pressure on employees, it should be better now that they got rid of that."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good employer during the years I work "
good,Good company to work for with good benefits and support from management.  The company offers a long history of many great characteristics and a feeling of pride in working there.
good,"Overall... the company has great people to work with and good benefits.  You work hard daily and are expected to worked overtime. "
good,"Personally speaking I loved working there because I was a very friendly person. I really like the fact of interacting with customers.I got to make really good friends with some daily customers."
good,Wells Fargo was a great company to work for.  There were many non-credit online courses one could study to improve knowledge related to one's role and those of the organization.
good,"The location I was able to work, was filled with seasoned professionals that worked like a loving family.  Everybody enjoyed what they were doing and loved to be assistance when they could help. This location is CIC WT Harris Blvd, Charlotte, NC"
good,"The environment is fast paced most days, some days can be slow. There are policy and procedures that need to be followed at all times. You must be in your role for 1yr minimum to be considered to move up in the company or per branch manager discretion. A who you know type of environment as well, not necessarily dependent on job knowledge to move up in the company."
good,"Team work, and  Partnership is key success for providing an excellent customer service. So joyful for entire team when customers achieve their financial goals by hard work of many experts from different teams at Wells Fargo."
good,Overall daily work was find but didn't understand why the Bank hired 20 people in January 2013 trained us for 2 months on their system and laided off everyone a year later.
good,Pushy sales focus instead of on the customer's needs. Leadership was not at all understanding or flexible with pregnant staff. Would get verbal warnings about the number of bathroom breaks due to be a pregnant diabetic nd had a doctor's note.
good,"•	Performed IRA technical duties processing a variation of transactions for the Private Client Group Region. Duties included utilization of various systems including Smart-Station & Wisdom in finalizing all IRA account request as submitted.  "
good,"Wells Fargo offers good benefit options, PTO is based on years of service and the recently updated maternal/paternal leave for new parents was very thoughtful."
good,"Excellent people management."
good,great place to work. only downside is they didn't hire- everything was thru a temp agency. Didn't give the best stability. but i enjoyed what i did there.
good,"A typical day at work involves opening procedures of the branch, a daily huddle to give information about new products and policy changes. As well as just focusing on making sure the customers needs are satisfied. After closing procedures you go home."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo. The people and the management were very good. I was promoted to a Lending Officer position but this was eliminated after 11 months due to downsizing. I eventually attempted auto loan underwriting but that environment was not right for me. I left to return to mortgage underwriting with another lender in the Charlotte area.
good,"My immediate supervisor was amazing, but upper management not so much. There was an expressed “open door” policy, but was frowned upon when used. Employees did not feel appreciated for the most part."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. They have what seems to be an endless amount of options for employment; depending on your interest/expertise.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work at.  A typical day included previewing client portfolios in aims of reallocation. Management was hierarchical, but that's the corporate life."
good,has a good workplace culture and provides different career possibilities across various lines of business. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in non profit organizations with 16 hours of volunteer time
good,The job is much like any other I imagine the site leadership is amazing in a good way. I enjoy working there because I work with good people everyday.
good,"In my role I have the opportunity to build long lasting relationships and partner with many leaders across departmental for support as well as there direct team members.  Assisting leaders and identifying trends and learning opportunities while mitigating any potential Risk, ensuring that compliance standards are met. "
good,"I worked with a lot of younger people fresh out of college and their work ethic was very different from mine. They didn't give anything extra, they worked from 8:00-5:00, took two hour lunches and left promptly at 5:00. My experience has been to take pride in my work and stay late"
good,I enjoyed my employment as a contractor.  My original contract funding was cut early and they found another position for me.  Wish they did not have the 2 year limit on contractors.
good,"Project was not well supported by senior management, but the team of people we had working on it were very dedicated and a joy to work with.  Change management process was one of the best I've worked with.  Hardest part was the changes in direction -  - slow decisions or none at all eventually caused the project to be put on hold"
good,Erster Job nach der Ausbildung. Als teamasisstenz gearbeitet. Bezahlung sehr niedrig.
good,The manager's focus is business. After they whole law suit they have been focusing on risk. I work 9-5 job have good vacation time. Rotate Saturday's.
good,"Wells sales tactics at the time were pushy and pay was not competitive. "
good,Worked nights we had double duty working on banks that networks were down which we could not do much with since they were not opened yet. We activated ports and checked on printers and phones .
good,Hiring process is lengthy. May have to go to a couple of interviews that are lengthy. Training is more self service. Very strict on point system. Good benefits.
good,"Working as a DevOps Engineer. I take care of end to end Jenkins Jobs setup and configuration for CI/CD. Merging and Branching in GitHub version control. Pre-prod environments Java, Tcserver deployments and upgrades. We use puppet and AWS cloud tools as well."
good,"Great place to work, great experience, hours and benefits. A lot of ways to be promoted but most of the times those opportunities have a candidate from inside set already so not opportunities as they say. Pay is alright well some positions don't get pay enough if you compared to others who do not contribute to team work at all rather they sit on a chair all day, as well fluent in another language does not make a difference on pay."
good,"Would work 45 hours or plus a week. It was fast pace.I learned how be a team leader and how to handle upset customers. Management always had our backs. The best part of the job was out environment, one of the best jobs I have ever had."
good,Under the my vertical job culture is very good and employee has job safety also there is no additional benefits for employees salary is very low for this profile
good,"Been with WF for nearly 10 years. I've experienced a lot over that time and learned from many different people. I spent the majority of my time within the Financial Crimes Risk Management group, specifically within Financial Crimes Investigations. I do mostly financial crimes risk management work. About three years ago, I moved into the line of business within the Financial Institutions Group of Wholesale (then known as Global Financial Institutions). I currently do geo-risk assessments on the various jurisdictions where the business maintains relationships with other financial institutions. The culture is struggling right now as the bank is ongoing tremendous changes due to the various scandals, mostly on the retail/consumer side. I really enjoy the people and the flexibility of the company."
good,I worked in Downtown charlotte office.  Good Place to work. Learnt new technologies. management is friendly.Co workers are helping nature. I enjoyed working there
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I liked the people i worked with, but at that time, the branch manager had very poor manager skills and would look at his employees as another number in the sales goals. He only cared about his store goals and wasnt a good manager."
good,"We were excited to start working on IBM's  Blueworks Live and BPMN suite, I only strated training on it whn I decided to leave for a better opportunity; nonetheless, it was interesting to participate on the training"
good,I enjoyed my time at WF until politics took over. I learned a lot and had a lot more to learn. I tried to stay on but the amount of hours I was given vs. my bills made it too hard.
good,I would say my experience was positive working within this organization as well as the inclusive feeling within the teams was a great culture. There was a lot of change experienced however it was always communicated well and my role was always understood.
good,I enjoyed my work environment at Wells Fargo. We were truly a team. Co-workers always willing and able to assist if one needed help. Hardest part of my job was my commute.
good,"My Internship at SWells Fargo was an amazing experience. Having the opportunity to learn network and grow in a profession that will benefit my career. "
good,I loved working at Wells Fargo but they should consider promoting the right people for the right reasons and timely to retain great talent like myself.
good,Most important is to give excellent customer service. At the end of the day your drawer is balance. Hope for a good manager who treats everyone fairly and with respect.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to start your career in the financial industry and work your way up as there is a lot of growth within the company. Be prepare to come in on daily basis with a plan as they are very aggressive with meeting their sales goals.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work. They have a pretty good corporate culture. The best job I've had in my career was with Wells Fargo. I'd go back anytime I had a chance.
good,"The most challenging part of working at Wells Fargo are the near constant reorganizations. In seven years, I have had eleven different managers, all without changing positions. "
good,"Easy to be hired, most people do not make it to retirement due to layoffs. Your future with this company is not assured even with great annual reviews"
good,"Nice job, good benefits, poor management at particular location, Location was very busy but i built a good rep oar with most of my customers. Great opportunity for growth"
good,"I enjoyed working at WFHM, however, their compensation is low for the amount of responsibility bestowed upon each employee. For this reason, I had to leave my position."
good,"The pros were definitely the benefits, while the disadvantage was the competitiveness of all employees which didn't promote team work in the environment."
good,Testing Procedures/QA are too strict and do not validate the knowledge of employee. Job insecurity. Never felt like you could be with the company for years due to the many layoffs.
good,"Wells Fargo is jam-packed with meetings. We have meetings daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. "
good,"I loved working at wells fargo, however it was while they still had very high sales goals and that did sit well with me so I left. The work day was hectic but rewarding. They trained you often and offered great benefits. Defiantly a career."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,nice people good working environment learn customer service skills get attached to customers. management can be difficult to read or know if your doing your job well
good,I have nothing to say about wells fargo. other than it was just a low pay wage job and hard work. Salary to low to balance my economical situation in life.
good,"Overall a good place to work, but no room for advancement.  Was a temporary position, although opportunities to apply for permanent positions at Wells Fargo."
good,"working at Wells Fargo was terrific, I was able to develop skills and abilites assisting customers with their financial needs; draw back was as a Licensed Banker my compensation for my efforts with sending customers over to the FA weren't good enough, I would sell the customer on the idea of using our FA's to increase their financial success, make large transactions but receive very low compensation on those accounts, the FA was paid a higher amount which was unfair and demotivating. "
good,People in the department are very friendly and department as a whole is somewhat small. The only thing that set you back was that you needed second approval for everything. which would hold you back in
good,Why did you make this mandatory I have other things to do I should be able to put this off until I have the time to sumbit an actual review this is veryannoiying
good,"Good Company to work, excellent infrastructure and technology and security policies and procedures and regulations and guidelines .  Did not have proper documentation and processes"
good,"My overall experience was pretty good with the company. As with any place you had some supervisors that wanted to be a show off and treated some employees unnecessarily bad in order to make a name for themselves but for the most part, most of them tried to be fair and treated each employee as an adult. Not really much micromanaging there and I liked that aspect."
good,Started every day reviewing my To Do list which helped me structure and organize my week. I worked with the bankers reviewing their portfolio of clients  who were viable candidates for commercial lines of insurance for their company.I also cold called and literally walked in to business' around Colorado trying to gain new clients for Wells.
good,You will always be pushed here and there is never a dull moment. Everyone around you is working for the same goal and you feel like are truly part of something big and making a true impact. You have a lot of autonomy and responsibly.
good,"In my experience, WF is the best place for work life balance. One of the best company cultures I've been a part of. The managers are trained and knowledgable. You have an opportunity to advance if you express your intentions to management and they will help you get to where you want. I would like to get back there."
good,manage a pipeline of 30-45 loan depending on capacity. contact customer to provide updates on application status via email or phone contact. along with maintaining customer experience and satisfactionij
good,dont look to advance they have you training agents only to promote them to the positon you are quailified for there was a lot of favortism at the company
good,"Working for Wells Fargo was a pleasure and I would definitely consider working for them again. The company offers many benefits, including a competitive retirement matching benefit. They also provide tuition reimbursement for anyone pursuing higher education in areas that would benefit the company."
good,I loved it there until they laid me off. Really wish they would have kept me. I enjoyed the culture and the benefits...they pay was average. They gas you up on the training though. Never got my DE
good,Most we work for 8 hours a day in continuous and some times while working we do fun activity for stress relief hardly we get time to invest in ourself.
good,Diversity and inclusion is promoted here. My team members strive to do the right thing. Positive contributions made to communities through philanthropy.
good,we play game as teams and the work life balance is a good way to have your team work as hard and they can. The supervisions are willing to help you get to the next level in your job.
good,Great first job out of college. Very hands on management and regular team meetings. Great training and mentorship programs for early-in- career employeees.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Worked with great people that wanted to contribute to the organizational goals.  Allows employees to work remotely and offers great benefits and opportunities to grow.
good,Typical work day is to come in and know what your job is and are given the tools you need to do it. No micro-managing. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and form bonds with.
good,"Wells Fargo at the time was a very challenging but rewarding job in my Retail Banking career.  One of the things that I was accustomed to was the retail working model that Wells Fargo represented.  Even though Wells Fargo has had in recent years its challenges to rebuild the brand, I found myself more as family with the friendships that were formed with great leaders and motivators to see me trend well and best serve all of our customers"
good,"Management in my site was fantastic, hard working and caring.  Great benefits.  Limited ability to increase your salary other than through promotion or posting for other positions."
good,"Good paying job with wonderful benefits most of the managment  is fantastic, but can be very stressful to endure for extended periods. I was not made fully aware of what the job would require"
good,"I am working in this company from last 16 month, overall i find this company is a good place to work. Hike and promotion is normal as per market."
good,"A busy, fast paced work environment where there’s always something new to learn. You’re in constant communication with the customer. Managers are very supportive and will help out in anyway they can. The workplace culture is like one huge family. Fun loving and reliable people. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to tell people they’re clear to close."
good,"6 week training  Mon-Fri from 8am-4:45pm with weekends/holidays off when starting off"
good,"I worked in two different states for the same company and the culture was very opposite, in one city management was terrible, they would bend the rules to receive incentives that tellers and bankers did not receive even though the incentives were based on our performance, not the managers', they were not customer and employee oriented. And in the other city it was all about the customers and employees and anything the company could do better to improve experience and longevity. The benefits made it worth it to stay at the time, along with paid holidays and vacation, i only left to pursue a career in a different industry, had i stayed in the bad city i would have quit immediately had Well Fargo not offered to transfer me to a better location."
good,My time with Wells Fargo was pretty good and I learned a lot. I think that there can be an issue with the culture of the company at times and advancement can be difficult or unfair.
good,"Great company to work with, but management was bad. Once people start getting bigger posistions , they will treat you like they never meet you, but regarding that, everything else is a good environment, fast paced."
good,"nice respectable management, willingly to work with you"
good,"I learned a lot during my time at Wells Fargo. At one point I was considered for a permanent position. Unfortunately the position did not offer much room to grow so I decline. The co-workers are all very nice.  Few of my superiors offered to write me good reviews for my next job, and they actually did."
good,"Although I was only a contractor, I still had an inside view of how this place was run and it was strange. I worked in back banking and the favoritism was outrageous. Also, the male financial crimes boss only hired young females to work for him. It was eye rolling on a daily basis watching them all fawn over him. The culture was very unfriendly. Wells Fargo is constantly getting in trouble for shady business practices, but I didn't notice any of that when I worked there. My job was to help the company get in compliance with federal regulations or face a very steep fine."
good,"I loved my job at Wells Fargo. I had a very flexible schedule and great benefits.  I loved the people that I worked both with, and for.  I learned that the job is what you personally make of it.  I feel that if you worked at hard at your job, then the outcome was rewarding."
good,Recommend anyone apply if you're interested in being part of a financial institution.  The culture is one of caring for the individuals well being and growth.
good,"I was one of the most productive employees but decision of keep employee does not come from manager, but came from HR which is not on site.  The company have since changed it's CEO"
good,"Managment was ok with a few exceptions "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I think this company is a great stepping stone for someone looking to gain knowledge of how money works and what spending habits are good and what are bad as well as credit understanding.
good,They don't pay nearly enough for the role that you are in.  They also have little room for advancement.  Typical day would consist of trying to sell customers banking products as they walked in to the bank.  I was a loan officer and/or personal banker.  Earlier in my career at Wells Fargo I worked in a call center.  This was tedious work.  It was phone sales so trying to sell customers products as they called in for something else.
good,"Wow what an amazing experience, such a fun team and lots of opportunity for growth. But the salary was low. They did try to offer bonuses, but still not enough."
good,"Great place to work in a professional environment where I felt appreciated.  Great benefits for team members.  Not much room for career advancement in the city I worked for, but Nationally, many opportunities if willing to relocate."
good,"In my time there it was a great environment. It was fast paced taking care of a lot of customers and at the same time you have to take your time with customers while still being fast. Ensuring you are accurately imputed data by both you and your team members. Service managers usually have to deal with all the irate customer situations so you'll need patience. You'll be working with the Branch manager to focus on customer service. You have a monthly report of commitment to coaching and weekly shops where customers rate their experience which is a BIG focus for every branch. But, with all the issues they've been having and lawsuits they are closing a lot of branches and will continue to do so... Although the city management handled it very professionally the district manager did not which made me lose faith in some of the management team. Although their vision and values say they value their team members, some managers do not."
good,I loved working at wells Fargo.  They have one of the best benefits package.Maternity leave is comfortable. But management can be a toss up.  And Sales quotas can bring stress.But if your dedicated you can make some serious money diffiently too it being in retail banking.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo helped to sharpen my customer service skills as well as utilize time/self management."
good,"I don't remember much about the contract.  The work was setting up products for customers.  Management was fine, not overly supportive but not toxic either."
good,Wells Fargo is a huge company and the different divisions have different cultures. In Wells Fargo Home Mortgage ways in which the culture can be improved is being more attentive to the changing demographic of employees. Employees are younger and more interested in work-life balance. And there are many companies that cater to this. Wells Fargo has to do a better job of competing with companies for the employees that value a good work-life balance. Those employees are more productive and bring their whole self to work.
good,"The management associates are fair, the workplace is fun and fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers. The hardest part of the job is resolving customer conflicts."
good,I like working for Wells Fargo and have done so for almost 2 years now. I work claims all day so it can get repetitive some times but overall it is a good place to work.
good,"Being a Teller is not an easy position, however I truly learned a lot at this job. The environment was very fast paced, and in a short amount of time I had experience doing basically every aspect that involves being a teller. I have gained cash handling experience, as well as people skills, and how to deal with tough situations. Being able to interact with customers and help them meet their financial goals is one of the best parts of the job. Although the schedule and staffing was sometimes an issue, the job was overall a good experience and an enjoyable place to work."
good,"I had a lot of banking experience for over 30 years but only at the branch level, and this is totally new for me and it was great to work in a new position. Wfg did have a good progran for you to advance your knowledge."
good,Wells Fargo Mortgage paid amazingly and had wonderful benefits! The company offered many onsite extras like different doctors so you wouldn't have to take off work as much but the possibility that your department could be laid off was not worth it!
good,"The learnings in the company are very useful to understand the concepts of US Banking System. The Production Management is very support to provide you additional responsibilities. However, the Transport Management has many issues especially it is a problematic scenario during night shifts. Hands-on experience is good and I believe very company has its own pro's and con's."
good,"Good place to work. all places have people with different personalities. We are fortunate enough to get along and work with all people. Wells is a very diverse work place. The company has had many challenges recently. However, they still maintain the status of one of the top financial employers out there. Would go back if I had the opportunity for the right fit."
good,Good place to work. Pay should be at least 2 dollars more an hour per position. No sense of job security. Good team environment. Career based job. Flexible hours
good,"Wells Fargo is a good financial services company. While I was there it was as Wachovia, it was a good place to work. I enjoyed my time there even though it was brief."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Like most Financial Services careers, your direct performance is closely monitored. There are plenty of opportunities to advance within your spectrum of knowledge and training. The culture has since changed, for the best. The company has had to revise and mitigate the past problems of ethical behavior. The training offered  is top in their category! Information to ponder,  HR has always favored the company’s best interest."
good,"Large company with many layers and divisions of IT dispersed across the country. Fairly liberal WFH policies and my mgr is very supportive of ,my efforts."
good,A typical day at work entails meeting with fellow team members to set the daily plan. Make outbound dials to appropriate clients. Work on any client needs as they are presented.
good,"Dealing with other peoples finances can be challenging so I recommend going into it with a open and positive attitude or the ""weight"" of it will get to you."
good,"Overall the company is great, they have been great about helping me balance my home life and my career. The people I sit with help get me through any tough times, which is the best part of my day."
good,"A typical day would start with a sales meeting to learn about new financial products and helpful ideas regarding who to specifically target and the best way to present them. On average I would make 100 calls per day to both new prospects and existing clients. In addition, I would assist clients with any issues and questions they may have with their portfolio. I also organized financial planning seminars for new prospects and existing clients."
good,Good environment and working culture.  Promotes within and retains employees.  Good benefits with a 40 hour work week.  Best part of the job was working with the customers.  Management was very clear  at communicating organizational priorities and objectives.
good,"There is a good work balance.  Some departments have too many meetings.  Management positions spend 85% plus time in meetings.  "
good,I learned a lot about working with people in a competitive environment where commission are involved.  I learned how to be more accurate and efficient in counting money and being able to calculate answers in my head as customer spoke their needs
good,"The entire day is spent on the phone with headphones.  The calls come in from the branches with questions about policy or procedures.  I would also review legal documents, such as Powers of Attorney or Probate for use with bank products."
good,"My position required me to be on the phone helping home owners over the age of 65 that had take out a Reverse Mortgage against their home. Some of the customers where at risk of loosing  their home because of back or unpaid taxes and or insurance. My job required me to go over their financial information to try to get them set up on a payment plan that they could afford to save the home. The hardest part of the job was telling someone that i could not help them the house was going to sale. The most enjoyable part was telling my customer that they had been approved and they could stay in their home. I have been doing Customer Service for over 20 years on the phone and face to face, but this was by far the hardest job working with seniors some my parents or aunt and uncle age. Dealing with some that had no one to help them and did not understand how they got in that situation and could not afford to get out of it. I learned how to have a different kind of patience and compassion for seniors as a whole never know how they are living and or what they are going through at a time when the should be living comfortably. The management was always there to help and coach when needed, but my job was done with very little supervision. I had a pipeline of approximate 230 customers that i reached out to every month."
good,Base pay plus incentive. A typical day included reviewing several new files and older files  (reviewed documentation).  The management seemed focused on production.
good,Substantially more good than bad. I liked working there. Sometimes wish I could go back to work there. --- Typically worked forty hours per week. Because I was regularly promoted I learned the responsibilities of multiple new positions. The management did leave something to be desired. Overall the workplace culture was better than most places I've worked. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the continual changes in policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part was being part of the team.
good,My only complaint is that business slowed down with all the bad press. Business is not the same as it was in the past. Management is good and the organization is well run.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for that offers generous amounts of vacation time and decent benefits. Some road blocks include opportunities for career advancement & lack of competitive compensation packages.
good,"Opening branch or closing branch. Commercial teller."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, would I seek future employment probably not. But you never know what the future has in store. I enjoyed my work environment aside from certain aspects"
good,"I have worked for many different departments within the bank, and they are definitely not all created equally. Some departments were phenomenal, others were lackluster. It really all depends on the area you're looking to get into."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo was a very fast pace and customer oriented atmosphere. I enjoyed helping customers, opening new accounts, providing loans to customers etc."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Worked as a contractor in the lab area . Move one lab to a new area."
good,"If you want to jump start your career in banking, a teller position at Wells is a good place to start. All banks are sales driven. They give you opportunity to explore various ways to reach your goals. In addition, Wells Fargo salary and incentive pay is very competitive."
good,Short term project/contract unable to provide more detail. The end of a project will also have a more aggressive expectation and can distort the true culture of the environment.
good,Ended my contract after one attempt at series 7. I really liked the atomsphere but the conpany is very hard to get into without have a contract first.
good,"Great way to start a career in finance. Quick advancement opportunity. I loved what I did, but company has to worry about bottom line and higher pay is not a high priority."
good,There are many ways to learn and move up in the company. It depends on your drive- Attention to detail is critical in your job and doing the right thing.
good,I truly enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo and would definitely work there again. I hope that management would put more emphasis on training than production. Quality over quantity should always be the main focus. The process of how to do the job should not surpass the understanding of the process.
good,"Wells Fargo treats its employees relatively well as compared to other large banks.  It pays its employees well, generally speaking and promote valuing its employees as one of its competitive advantages"
good,It was a great place to work part time while in college and playing soccer. The environment was fun because of the management. It was great at advancement opportunities.
good,Able to come in and know what needs to be accomplished.  Able to work with little or no supervision.  Able to organize your work the way you wanted too.  Usually a team meeting in the morning to talk about where we were at.  Meeting deadlines when work was due the same day was the hardest thing to do but I always met my deadlines.  The fun times were celebrating everyone's birthday.  Management was always available if you had a problem or had any questions about your job.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work based on pay and benefits. I had a contract job, however, I know that if you are working directly with the company they compensate very well in those areas. The managers I worked with were very into making sure you felt comfortable with your job to meet your goals. If you were not meeting goals, they always tried to find a way to help you meet them. I think the hardest part of my job, which was operations, was just trying to remember what documents go into which batch class and document type. It could get kind of confusing. Again, they have tools to help you though. It was nice to be able to listen to music or podcasts while you worked."
good,"If you are to get hired then you could make it into a career. It is possible to move up from the bottom, but you WILL have to willing to relocate. The pay was great and so are the benefits."
good,"There are many aspects of WF that I appreciate - the people, the vision, the resources. Being in the headlines definitely took its tool on the culture. Some leaders rose to the occasion and others did not. Once you are in the inner circle in certain areas of the organization, there seems to be a complacency mentality. Asking questions can be looked at as negative rather than with the intention of innovation."
good,I worked with loan adjustors on pre-foreclosure properties.  After the property was foreclosed  I managed and sold the properties.  Most of the properties where commercial.
good,"Good job. You have to be good under pressure. Training was a great experience, although I feel like it could be longer or a little more thorough. Still a great experience."
good,It's a good place to get started and they always try to promote from within. If given the opportunity I could definitely see myself going back to them.
good,Wells Fargo is a nice company to work for.  The 401-K plan is great for retirement.  Managment could be better.  The health care coverage could be better.
good,"I have an opportunity to work in the new concept office which has open concept and collaborative workspace throughout the building which really helps with networking and quick catch up with your managers."
good,I would advise any young persons looking for employment to apply at Wells Fargo.  You can start as a teller and move up very quickly.  The company is dedicated in development of their employees.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Wells. Worked as a teller and had a great time meeting new people and just had a great corporate culture. Would go back in a heart beat.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Getting stocks ready for sales on the stock-market. Knowing the everyday changes and regulations each company has to sell on the stock market witch makes it one of the hard parts of the job.
good,"Management is a little distant with their communication and promptness. The whole interview process is not about acquiring great talent, it's more or less if you can answer the cookie cutter interview question as a well studied robot should."
good,"I loved my last Wells Position but it was only contract and paid almost half what Wells full time employees make for similar duties.  BUT it was great work, and the managers were great.  Super flexible regarding work hours so long as everything was done on time."
good,"WF is a decent company to work for, typical days depend on what position you are in. Management varies from hands off to micro-management with very little consistency even within a department. Workplace culture is decent but can definitely vary. Huge company so very little ""human"" treatment of employees on a larger scale. Upper management tends to hedge the truth when it comes to layoffs or situations regarding unpopular decisions."
good,"Wells has superior benefits and opportunities to grow and move about the country. Now with sales goals removed, the atmosphere must be more customer oriented."
good,Overall a nice place to work. Middle management needs vast improvement and was a direct cause for higher than average turnover and the loss of talent.
good,"Very difficult to get an interview within the company even after working for several months. It's all about ""who"" you know and not ""what"" you know. Large company so you don't get to see instant results of discussion in meeting come to fruition."
good,"Good Company to people who want complete work life balance."
good,My temp job with Wells Fargo Insurance was part of a group set up to process insurance premium reimbursements.  The call volume was  variable depending on how many checks and letters had been mailed out recently.  I had 50-60 work days with no calls.  I was allowed to read at my desk.  I had 40-50 days with only one or two calls.  I had a few days with 60 plus calls a day.
good,"I answered incoming calls, researched solutions or processed requests for bankers, tellers and store managers. Our call center had great management, but the feedback we got from our callers, painted a more competitive picture in the banks. Our workplace culture was awesome and we had monthly staff meetings to discuss our focus.  Our management always made learning and new challenges fun, as did our coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the salary, which was very low, for what we did."
good,I always enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. I was able to continue learning in an environment conducive to improving myself and my knowledge of the mortgage industry. I was able to voice an opinion on procedure and felt appreciated. The down side was getting laid off twice.
good,"Developing and maintaining high performing sales/service team members through coaching, mentoring and the development of skills and behaviors is a primary accountability of a Supervisor in this capacity."
good,"I witnessed too many nepotism specially in the management level during my 12+ years career with WF. They did some reorganization but it does not go far enough to the 'deep cleaning' level on the management. Other than that, working with WF is a pleasant and worth to be part of this historical American company."
good,I would have never left my job as a Banker at WF if it wasn't for the branch manager. She made my life and others lives so stressful. 15 staff members left our branch when she came there.I was the best banker they had at my location and my customers loved me as much as I loved them. None of that mattered.
good,"I love the wide range of diversity at my group.  My coworkers were the best - we got along well, great teamwork so the job got done successfully and in a timely manner.  "
good,Ok working with Wells Fargo until I was an opportunity to advance my career elsewhere. Decent benefits. Great branch employees. Challenging to advance within.
good,"I liked the people I worked with"
good,"Drama tends to radiate throughout the company. Depending on the manager, I have experienced lack of management, micromanagement, angry managers and support of managers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,its a good stable job as long as your pay attention to your work. you cant go wrong their. but i do feel that the managers need more training in how to treat their employees and how to keep moral up.
good,While employed at wells Fargo I did enjoy my time and benefits The pay is amazing but the environment in this particular branch was unhealthy and very hostile.
good,Working at Wells Fargo can be great or awful depending on the department you work in. While I was in property management the work load was great and I was able to complete all task that were requested of me and complete all my yearly goals. I also had a management staff that cared about my development and my future. When my department was restructured and my position was  eliminated I then move into a position working in the condo approval department on the collateral side of the home loan. This position was extremely busy and stressful and due to the work environment we never had the correct amount of staff to provide our departments service level agreement that was promised to our internal customers by management. It was almost impossible to perform all your daily tasks without having to work overtime all the time. Because of this environment we had a lot turnover in staff and always felt behind on our work.
good,Metric driven company that pressures its employees to meet unreachable marks. There needs to be more of a balance between metrics and overall customer experience.
good,The job was fine and some of the people were very nice. Manager had others do her job for her. She was never there and she had no clue what was going on.
good,"I loved the company however the sales goals were very hard to reach."
good,"No doubt its one of the best place to work, however you will not be satisfied with your initial salary and also you have to wait too long time to get promoted. Mobile phones are not allowed at your working stations for majority of the processes."
good,"Great company , just need more opportunities for experience agents. Also would like to be paid for the experience I have with the area of work I have from previous years."
good,I worked there as a consultant and generally found the environment to be supportive and focused on getting the job done.  Very professional and good focus on achieving the best solutions.
good,I worked in a particular department of Wells Fargo that almost certainly does not reflect the over all culture. But the retirement group is fairly low stress and very cooperative.  Moving forward in one's career there is slow. So if you want a calm environment where the only expectation is daily competency and you have 15 years to get where you're going Wells Fargo retirement is the place for you.
good,During the first scandal it was difficult to go back to the pre-settlement frame of mind and trust with customers. As position was making outbound calls  with the intent for customer to complete credit card application over the phone.
good,"Wells Fargo likes to develop their employees to create careers in banking. This includes additional training, online courses, mentorship opportunities."
good,"Working as a operations processor and a operations clerk, it is a good step into the business career. However, lack of education can minimalize your advancements. Being paid salary is defintely better than the hourly paid jobs at wells fargo."
good,"Wells Fargo was an amazing place to work, but the inbound call center life was extremely stressful. The site (location) had a lot of ways to keep bankers engageed and there was a lot of things going on all the time."
good,"My job is a processing role, which I really enjoy. Lots of analytical work and attention to detail, fun to look for problems in documents and discrepancies before submitting for review if you enjoy data entry and organization. "
good,Met a lot of successful people while working with the company. Only downside was how hard it was to transition from Retail/Branch Banking other career opportunities not located within a branch.
good,"Well all around WF, there are numerous debts and fields you can be working in, but for me, I felt WF has all the great components of a company but is lacking the benefits and advancement for employees. See, a lot of people would love to work, then get a career advance into a higher stepping stone but at WF, you don't see this a lot as you used to due to the company hiring from outside or outsourcing."
good,I worked here out of college.  Wells Fargo did a great job with teaching how to succeed in the industry and how to be a professional in general. The training for new hires was fantastic
good,Typical day was to review potential risks and provide assessments. I learned the beginning stages of risk and set the stage for a successful risk career.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"as an Intern in the Wealth and Management Line I was told that there were many opportunities to move across lines of business. Well, Turns out after talking to COUNTLESS other employees that really is not the case. "
good,"I loved how goal oriented the environment was. Not only was there hope in being better then you were yesterday, but there was wonderful encouragement from the team to  support you along the way."
good,"Numerous opportunities for different kinds of work"
good,For the most part I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo Advisors.  The benefits were excellent.  The flexible schedule allowed for work/home life.  Their commitment to the community is outstanding.
good,Wells Fargo has a lot of great benefits but doesn’t compensate as well as its competition.  It’s a great place to start a banking career but it’s not a place you’d want to stay if you want to grow.
good,I was employed for over 10yrs before deciding to change careers. I thought I would retire with WFB but soon the cost of living began to outpace my ability to advance in life. I'd have stayed if they were able to match salaries.
good,I worked at Wells in the high of their sales scandal and it was stressful. I always had a manager breathing down my neck even when I was consistently top in sales.
good,"Working at a bank is great. I learn a lot about finances.As a Teller there is a lot to consider & its hard to get your plans accommodated, If you work in a busy branch that is."
good,"Wells is a competitive and solid company to work for.  It can be, however, stressful at times.  Benefits were good and the overall work environment was decent.  Management at times was for the most part, knowledgeable.  Most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers and the challenging aspect of the work.."
good,"Wells Fargo provides a way to get your start in banking. Sometimes it can be repetitive. The opportunity to grow is possible, but hard in some positions."
good,"This company is set up to help its employees. They have good benefits, a lot of vacation time offered and it is a professional atmosphere. Being a Wells Fargo employee has a lot of positives. "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work and start your financial career. The benefits are a plus. You usually have a fixed schedule. With great management you will learn a lot and have opportunities to grow within the company. "
good,"Fun place to work. "
good,"I loved the management, very helpful and understanding. A day at work was always productive being able to expand my skills and communications with my costumers. I enjoyed going out of my way to help my costumers needs. I learned that a job is is my second home and everyone is a family, helping each other and learning from each other."
good,The processing and underwriting was very good but income could have been improved for States where they have no bank branch presence.  Management was very helpful and supportive.
good,"Overall I love my job despite the inconsistency with management, I was able to grow personal and professionally.  My service manger helped us each in our own areas and always worked to accommodate any needs."
good,"Lots of changes mostly for the better.  We will see about promotion possibility.  They say you need a year in current position before you can apply for a new job,"
good,Data entry and view scanned documents. I was working as a temp so there was no advancement. Management didn't seem to have anyone who was supervisor so if you had questions there was no one to ask.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It was a really big company. not a bad thing at all but different layers of tape to get through. I appreciated my leadership and they do their best to make everyone feel important.
good,Wish the pay was a little more. And more career advancements. Call center position can be mentally draining. Calls are constantly coming in back to back. Where the company would like you to solve customers problems in very little time.
good,"Lots of different positions, also currently not hiring for mid level employees.  Only bottom and top level.  Possible loss of job to India can happen."
good,"no realistic balance on work expectations, sales goals are unrealistic, and impractical customer service goals. vary stressful but overall fun loved working with people."
good,The tell we position at Wells Fargo is ideal for young professionals in college who need flexible hours with more than fair pay. Job serves a stepping stis me as hard work does indeed lead to promotions. Would recommend to anybody loooing for introduction to corporate culture.
good,Typical day was fast pace and stressful.  Communication  between management and employees was not a top priority.  No prior notification when systems or procedures were changed.
good,"It was a good opportunity , The manager Was new Manager and Forced everyone to open an Account , The Pay was getting better, I got a Better offer at Mortgage broker"
good,"Focused, professional work environment. Fellow team members, respectful, professional. Assigned project was intellectually challenging and professionally satisfying."
good,I learned a lot working at Wells Fargo. Most of my coworkers and managers were great to work with. Just wish the accountability was the same for everybody. The sales goals and minimum standards were too high and put too much pressure on teams. I enjoyed the operational side of things and the customer service practices that were in place.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo definitely taught me a lot about character. We are handling customers finances so it was a bit stressful at times, but you learn how to remain calm."
good,"There is a well rounded Culture represented at Wells. But not to much in leadership roles. I really enjoyed the work/life balance. Being a dingle parent made that one of the most important things for ,me. I was able to have flexible hours and make up any time missed."
good,Sales goals were removed which was nice and min raise was raised to $15 per hour however management was always in your customer interactions and there wasn’t much room to grow.
good,"I worked for the Wachovia which was acquired by Wells Fargo during a merger.  I am not sure about Wells Fargo's culture, pay, work life balance, management, or overall rating.  This rating is for Wachovia not Wells Fargo."
good,"have to make it work for you. as with any big company, one can find themselves spinning their wheels looking for advancement. the opportunity is present but don't expect to be pushed up"
good,Its a good place to work at if you are looking to grow within the company. It offers great benefits and the pay is not bad. It just depends on what management you are under sometimes it was good and sometimes it was a lot of drama.
good,"Good job and great opportuny. "
good,Good corporate structure.  Great compensation package.  Nice to come to work in casual clothes since I did not directly serve the public.  I was able to wear shorts to work in the summer!
good,it was an good environment but i needed more money for the responsibilities i was being asked to perform. They wanted to keep you at the same salary but require more and more of you. Everything was always changing. Nothing was good enough.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I learned a lot about change management and adapting to new ways of working. It was the hardest part of the job, but it also was a good way to learn for any place of business."
good,"I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo. I always felt supported. However, due to some changes with the company I lost confident in the job security. I loved helping customers succeed financially, and providing them with the right products and services that fits their financial needs. On the other hand, there was so many changes with the company in the past year, and it made it hard to have clarity  on what was being asked of me."
good,"Well organized."
good,The work pressure is very low and is not very challenging. Therefore the growth rate is very low compared to other competitors. However this work culture is suitable for some individuals.
good,"After 5 years of working for Wells Fargo, in my opinion its a great opportunity for individuals who are interested in a future with finance. Wells Fargo has a lot of room for growth. Typically work will consist of meeting sales quota, calling and referring clients. Wells defiantly compensates their employees with great benefits however does expect your commitment in return."
good,I enjoyed working with my colleagues there but corporate really tried to make things miserable. I'm lucky I was placed with a good team The supervisors were great and we had a weekly huddle to discuss matters which made you really feel like part of a team. .
good,Wells Fargo is a decent place to work.  At the time we took on Texas closings and that is a whole different type of rules and regulations in the Mortgage industry.   With being a sales driven company by the time loans made it to closing sales was very insistent on closing the loan immediately.  Several times I would catch conditions that were not satisfied and had to return the loan back to management and underwriting
good,I love my Career with Wells Fargo - However their senior leadership is making some poor decisions that is impacting their employees and because of the reputation they earned they are now trying to make up for all of their mistakes but at the cost of their employees
good,"The Retail Banking side, it hard to manage day to day. You learn on the fly how to deal with difficult customers. Management outlines are continually changing."
good,"Great co-workers and environment to work. The company is experiencing a lot of change and transition, but that is a good thing. I enjoyed going to work which means a lot to me. I am hoping for another opportunity with them as they sold our dept to another company, but I prefer WF."
good,I worked on a software team. Team was more interested in finding excuses then getting work done. The working pace was very slow. Expectations were set low by manager.
good,Overall it was a very exciting company to work for and I thoroughly enjoyed the work. A lot of training is involved. Must be dedicated to the company or one will struggle to maintain the position.
good,"Learned many professional job skills "
good,"I learned a lot. It was very competitive and if u could keep up they didn't keep you. Very corporate world. Meetings, Numbers, Everything was very fast paced."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work to learn your job. Provided you with the tools needed. Management was not the regular Wells Fargo management team, so with that said it was very cut throat."
good,"Good people, good supervisors and great bonuses.  It was very competitive in a healthy way making it fun. Great teamwork between the different supervisors and different divisions."
good,"Generally a positive experience, though would have preferred more support for my unit from management. Culture is collaborative but fast-paced and competitive."
good,"helping customers with their needs for accounts, offering products and greet them soon as they come in. I've learned to be patient with upset customers. Learned to work under pressure."
good,"This is a good part time job but not really like a good start for a career in a financial institution. I could only speak for my branch in MN, but I feel like there is little or no advancement in my career while I worked as a teller with Wells Fargo"
good,Great company to work for with great benefits. I was able to work comfortably and enjoy family life as well. The job wasn't very flexible when it came to emergencies but was giving over 20 days PTO to use.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Wells Fargo.  I had not worked in the Banking industry before so it was a new area for me to pursue.  The company was great albeit a little behind in technologies due to Banks being overly sluggish to upgrade and always worrying about security of new hardware/software, etc."
good,"Be prepared to sell"
good,"There are a ton of great benefit, I work remotely which is a plus. The 401K and paid vacation time is one of the best benefits. As well as good health insurance options."
good,Good benefits and decent salary. Overall a good place to work if you're into banking. Lots of sales pressure which can get annoying but pretty good bonuses if you hit goals.
good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work for such a large company.  If you put in work you will get recognized for your efforts.  A pretty good experience overall working for them.
good,"When I first started at Wells Fargo, I had limited mortgage experience yet the training period caught me up to speed with the industry basics.  The instructors were very good."
good,"Overall, it is a good company to work for, They pay well and there are many sites/locations to work at.  The customer experience is extremely important."
good,"Quick paced, not physically demanding. Quick paced especially on pay days. Culture depends alot on the area where you work but always an importance on opening new accounts."
good,"As a contractor, I enjoyed working at WellsFargo. I was disappointed that my 18-month contract was not extended after all the extra effort I gave to the job."
good,"Wells Fargo does training very well but is very demanding when it came to sales.  most every meeting was about boosting numbers and/or loan volume and less about the clientele.  Most the employees are very friendly although can be ignorant of some rules and regulations sometimes, but not often."
good,"It was fast paced in the sense everything had a deadline, but its repetitive which made it a more relaxed environment, but when its stressful its very stressful."
good,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is a good place to work because of the people.  The job is stressful but mortgage processors' jobs are stressful.  The structure is good, and each person knows what is expected."
good,"Very Productive work place,  all manager  are  very respectful. Facility has very rewarding  education and advancement opportunities. Very structured.   Company paid  pto , retirement match was  great"
good,"great co-workers long hrs, management time helped when it was necessary. I enjoy working there due to the fact that my co-workers knew how to communicate with each other."
good,"The work atmosphere was friendly, but compensation was a bit lacking.  benefits were excellent, but training was sub-par.  The easiest way to advance was to leave the company, then return as a new hire."
good,Sales goals kept becoming increasingly difficult.  Management never made it easier just more stressful.  Too many time-wasting meetings. Lack of clear direction.
good,"Wells Fargo has a decent salary, the work hours can be pretty long if you're fulltime. The environment is customer friendly, wells fargo Is very big on team building."
good,"Wells Fargo is a typical office environment, They strive to incorporate all their employees into the daily work day.  Their pay is competitive and they offer decent paid leave."
good,"Great culture / benefits.  Typical challenges working in a large, corporate environment.  Plenty of opportunity for additional opportunities; good on-line training."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Fun place to work but the management was all over the place.  Very little emphasis on getting things done, lots on empire-building.  Managers would impose their own views of what other areas might say (""Credit will never agree to that"") but on checking the misquoted would have no problem."
good,"I loved the job and loved working here but I left because I wanted more career choices than just branch banking.  I wanted to move into corporate, however there were barriers to moving out of the retail branch."
good,"The point system needs to be adjusted. Because the position requires employers to sit for 8 1/2 hours the Lunch break should be an hour instead of 30 minutes. It takes almost 10 minutes to leave your desk, make it out the building, and to your car."
good,"If it were not for management, I would have stayed with the company, too much micro-management though.  They institute requirements that do nothing to get the job done efficiently and bog you down."
good,Far pace to work.  Work Days are typical.  Expect to work most Saturdays.  Don't expect performance pay increases despite how hard you work.  Bonus have been greatly reduced.
good,"The job itself was ok overall. You have your good days and bad days like any other job. The pay keeps me here, but the hours are not the best. Easy to move around in the company if you do great at your job(I previously worked in their credit card dept.). You will be treated any type of way by the customers. So my real only complaint is how you are treated by the customers. They blame the company's bad reputation on you. It makes you hate to come to work just to talk on the phone all day. You try not to take it personal but it can become stressful at times. Overall great benefits, company trying to become better, and somewhat stressful."
good,"Overall good company. Limited, however in the auto industry side unless willing to relocate. The company is very large and many different sides of banking to apply for."
good,Strong institution which is paying for the size of the bull's eye on its back.  Catching up technology wise but not paying front line managers well.  Great referral network but stained reputation still difficult to overcome.
good,"Although i loved working at wells fargo, i always believed i should have been paid more for the amount of work we were given. I learned many things while working at Wells, life advice, financial advice, and extreme people and family skills. The culture of wells was to genuinely care for the customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers but it was manageable. Some employees and management were not desirable. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting up everyday in hopes i would help someone in a positive way at work."
good,"The benefits  are great, but the job itself is very stressful and repetitive. I also believe I was not able to use my education and experience as much as I would of liked. The advancement opportunities were limited, but the management was great. I really feel I benefited from working at Wells Fargo as a person."
good,okay place to work. they value their employees and the customers. Collections is not an easy position. You have to deal with a lot of different characters and not all of them are nice and one person can throw off your whole day
good,I worked for Wachoiva just before it became WellsFargo. I ultimately left because of the unethical behavior that was encouraged by our managers. Sales goals have changed now.
good,"It was a fun place, but too much drama. People complained about everything and the manager would call out people like if we were in high school. The job was suppose to be 32 hours a week and 11-7 and they tricked us. It wasnt the way the job description said."
good,The commissions department was a fast paced environment with many deadlines and lots of technology enhancements.  I enjoyed being involved in the process improvements.
good,Good place to gain experience in testing of bank applications. Good culture. Cons: night and weekend prod installs suports with non-defiened hours. Pros: convenient location of the office
good,"Overall a good place to work but as a contract employee you feel there is no shot for full time employment or advancement, which is often the case. No complaints about management or pay!"
good,"good company to work for and they take care of their employees. the job options was good, but the raise once a year could be more giving with the change in the life change"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed my years at Wachovia even though it was a typical cut throat environment!  I just strived to do my jobs to the best of my abilities and in the end I was rewarded with promotions!!
good,"It is an okay place to work, but there are other opportunities out there that pay you more for your experience and work ethic. The people here are incredibly friendly."
good,Wish there was more opportunity to become full-time employees. The work was interesting and beneficial to the company. The managers I had were great to work with.
good,"Had some great experiences but also some poor ones at Wells Fargo. I primarily had great  managers and fun team members. "
good,"Manager was not the best; I feel as though all employees were not treated equally. When it came to scheduling and attire other employees would get in trouble while others wouldn't, etc."
good,Learned alot about the mortgage industry and met great people. The company underwent a large public relations challenge which negatively impacted the fiscal health of the company but it does provides hard workers lots of opprtunity
good,My recent manager was very condescending and jealous. She used very harsh words and bullying tactics when coaching team members. When she was upset or had a bad day watch out. She would criticize everything.
good,I have been with Wells Fargo for 10+ years.  I've moved from a teller to Operational Risk Consulting within that time.  Through my time I have enjoyed the ability to grow and thrive as part of this company.  Overall the company is a stable and job security for me has never been a concern.  The managers I have worked with have shown a vested interest in watching me develop and progress in my career.  Overall I am satisfied with my career.
good,"Location i was in was a grocery store, so hours were different. Tue-Thur was slow, so the day went by long. Co-workers were fun. had fun while working there."
good,No sales pressure. 9-5 job. Fun place to work. Good changes within the company to promote stronger and better banking practices. Easy company to maintain work with.
good,II was a contract worker and did many thins.   I was not part of the everyday meetings or culture.  The people were pleasant and I felt no stress.  It was an ok place to work.
good,"It was only 8 of us in West Hartford location when I started a year ago and about 6-7 MLO, then they laid off several times eventually close out branch with 2 MLO left. My manager was great I will miss her. Benefits mediocre, no sick days (just 3 PTO for it in your PTO bank), can't buy vocation days. Stressful as usual with this type of job."
good,"I've learned that it's best to lead by example , don't ask someone else to do that you wouldn't want to yourself, Wells Fargo is a great co to work for"
good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful company to work for. I enjoy coming to work everyday and communicate with people and build rapport, as well as long lasting friendships with customers and team members."
good,WellsFargo has a great deal of opportunity to get work experience but compensation is very low. I have worked with this company for over one year and 6 months. I have met some wonderful people and gained a wealth of knowledge.
good,"Wells Fargo was a fantastic company to work for.  The state of Arizona doesn't require two 15 minute paid breaks, so although you get a 30 minute lunch break, you are then standing in one single place for most of the day which can take a toll on your legs and feet pretty quickly.  Management handled all of the previous scandals very well internally and showed the initiative to move the company in a positive direction."
good,"Wells has gone through several major changes recently, from process to structure.  A few of these changes were truly needed but many of the changes have, in-turn, had a negative impact on the business, engagement, and compensation of Team Members."
good,"It was okay. Very simple, if you don't know the answer, someone who does is always just a phone call away.. after a while everyone is just like family."
good,It is a very fast pace work place with great training and staff to make sure you are very comfortable with the material and can provide great service.
good,"Overall a good company to work for"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The bank is compliance-shy.  The management is more concerned about satisfactory audits and appeasing compliance then doing what is logical and right.  Client is secondary to profit.
good,"I was happy that I could balance my home life with my career through my remote position at Wells Fargo.  I only left when they decided to no longer support a remote employee program within my department.  I was unable to relocate to my home office of Des Moines, IA."
good,I worked for multiple locations across the country and each branch is completely different. The company as a whole is great but local management can really sour employees.
good,Review Leasing documents to ensure customers needs are being met and policies are being followed. only downfall is not a lot of advancement opportunities in Leasing
good,"Excellent entry level job with multiple options for advancement. Stressful call volume made up for by insentives, discounts and paid time off. Also they are very accommodating to challenging environments."
good,"On the teller line you do various functions like: depositing cash to withdrawing, cashing checks, money orders, cashiers checks, gift cards, temporary checks, exchanging foreign currency and rolled coins. I learned how to work under pressure in a fast pace environment. Management was great, both my manager and supervisor were fair people. They cared about their employees and always rewarded us when we met our branch goals. Also on the first of the month we would get Panera bagels and Starbucks coffee. The hardest part of the job, was dealing with conflicts and confrontations with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the team work and dedication in our branch. We all became a family and really good friends."
good,It is a very diverse and accepting place to work. Hard workers seem to get more work while slackers seem to go unnoticed. Lots of networks and clubs to participate in and grow professionally.
good,"no comment"
good,A typical day would involve meetings to determine what applications needed to be deployed and to what Lines of business needed software or updates. the harderst part of the job is not knowing when you can be let go off of a contract without the ability to see your project through
good,You had an environment where you interfaced with the Branch bank personnel.  This was great because they could funnel referrals to you to help their clients who needed assistance with investment products and or planning for their retirement. It gave the customer more options to work from and made us all more competitive than other banks; because we were based rite on sight in the same Branch.
good,"great entry level positions"
good,I was a Loan Office while at Wells Fargo. I enjoyed the banking environment and on a daily basis. I got to interact with people making their financial goals attainable.
good,As an underwriter I learn a lot and love the idea of helping people.  Did a lot of traveling helping people with Loan Modifications and Repayment Plans as well as Moratorium helping them to keep their homes.
good,"I have had great opportunities to cross train, which helped me succeed and move into new roles.  The compensation is below the EMV, but the benefits are great."
good,Great company to work for if you want stability and career advancement.  Pay continues to diminish even though productivity continues to improve.  More focus is needed on the employees
good,Position with the company allowed me to assist borrowers in need and learn new skills. Company as a whole cares about its employees. Good working atmosphere.
good,"A very stressful, fast paced job, but a great work environment.  I worked in a small office with a great group of people.  I felt like I was part of a family.  My supervisor provided guidance and support."
good,"Wells Fargo overall is a great place to work and begin your career.  However, once you have reached a certain point in your career there appears to be a lack of opportunities for real development and advancement."
good,"Overtime is always available"
good,open up the bank in the morning take your drawer out from the vault count all your money and enter it in the system. thru out the day assist customers with deposits and withdrawls. Push credit cards and opening accounts on customers
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I really loved working at Wells Fargo, even though it is stressful and fast paced it was still very fun and great to build relationships with customers. The reason that I quit was the relationship between me and my manager was very bad and i could not relocate to a different department. I do believe that this is a very great company to work for and i would work for them again."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the home equity loan department, supervisors, managers and co workers were caring and fun to work with along with being professional.  Working in the Branch though was not enjoyable but there was a lot going on with the higher ups at the time.Here the workers were very disgruntled and made for a stressful work environment."
good,"its a good place to develop your professionalism and upgrade your cash handling skills. very demanding career, lots of information to be achieved on a daily basis. overall a good place to develop ones self in the corporate world."
good,"awesome colleagues and people you meet along the way"
good,"I started in customer service and within a few years went to sales and  retention. I enjoyed the diversity , every day there was something new or challenging to due. There are several opportunities within Wells Fargo Bank."
good,"I help people when they are not able to work due to a hardware malfunction. I help managers coordinate projects to make sure that the equipment is on site on time for Wells Fargo employees. My office if very laid back. If I have to spend 8 plus hours at an office, this would be it. The hardest part of the job is getting people to realize what we do is not as simple as ordering a pizza. You cannot place your order and expect it in 30 minutes. The best part of my job is the people I work with in my office and my coworker around the country."
good,"Good Benefits for employees"
good,"In the 5 years of being with the company I have held 6 different jobs but the amount of work I was doing and the salary I was getting paid did not add up. Very competitive when it comes job growth now with the sales goals being taken away. I love the direction they are and have been moving towards but a lot of team members feel that you will be ""stuck"" longer since numbers are what set you apart from others."
good,I enjoy working for wells fargo and if you are hired you will to. I really like all the changes that have been made to make the work environment fun for the employees.
good,"You spend our time on the phone assisting customer with Fraud claims on there Checking or savings account, You have to determine if the trans is valid or this it need to be disputed."
good,Wells Fargo is the best place to work when it comes to job work / life balance. I will recommend it to people. I have worked for them for 15 years now I would like to take new challenge somewhere else.
good,large company with a lot of talented people. Change comes slow but it's well though out and the impact is felt industry wide. The size of the company can be overwhelming if your trying to mark your mark but there are opportunities to form bonds with mentors and leadership
good,"There is a strong HR presence, so you can feel safe there. There used to be a strong competitive element, but not in the office I'm currrently in and I'm guessing this will go down due to the recent sales scandal."
good,Wells fargo was overall a great place to work at. It is a very friendly environment where everyone is welcomed. They also help students pay for some of the classes. They pay structure is very fair. I learned a lot from this position and would recommend to anyone who is trying to pursue a career within financing.
good,"if the management is solid, you'll do great. it's pretty straight forward. have a positive attitude, be ready and willing to help, and smile"
good,"I was given freedom with regards to time, if I had to come in late, they worked with me. Work was satisfying. Pay scale could have been higher. Overall it was a great place to work."
good,"Great benefits/ salary, workplace culture and work environment. Supports career growth and cross company collaboration. I recommend to have a taste of it."
good,I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo and mostly enjoyed the people I came into contact with.  The work was very detailed and the people knew their work.  Overall the teams I have worked with were very eager to help and just as eager to accept your help.
good,"In this department you have to get all the work done before anyone is able to leave. No matter how much work is there is to do, the team of eight to ten people have to get it done. Fast paced work environment, loved the job, and the hardest part was sitting down all day"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"it was a great experience took a lot of daytime, there are no more sales goals. highly focused on customer service which was great."
good,"After working in the participant account services area, I moved on to Mortgage services.  Very interesting and intimidating to cold call customers regarding their interest in our services. Unfortunately this area closed after one year."
good,"My tenure at WFA was during an extremely turbulent time in the market. Historically turbulent. It was often unknown what event, macro or micro, would generally drive the market and financial advisor inquiries. This was exciting but stressful. Learned something new every day though, which isn't something you can say about many jobs. I greatly valued this experience despite the physical and mental wear and tear."
good,The job was not too stressful and balanced in my department and management was ok. They promote learning new things to a certain extent due to requirements by upper management. I enjoy working with my coworkers who make the days go by easier. The hardest part of the job is being able to advance and get the proper experience needed to advance within the company. New jobs with better salary is hard to achieve when moving up within the company.
good,Working here gives you much credibility for other employers. I did not like the job at first but I learned to tolerate it. It can get a bit repetitive and management could be better at showing appreciation. The benefits are incredible.
good,The management at the branch I was located at could be improved. Service manager is slow and lazy. She was also unprofessional. The branch manager was far better.
good,must be able to produce sales. it is pushed highly and that is where i had some issue. i will not sell a credit car to someone that can't even handle their accounts
good,"Wells Fargo is a wonderful company in regards to benefits that it offers, working in a production environment is stressfull and long hours are needed, so prepare for OT."
good,Great place to work in regards to teamwork and the people I worked with. It is very hard for position advancement within the company. It is almost impossible to transfer to another branch outside of your district.
good,My management team micromanaged highly to the point it felt like workplace harassment. My job became stressful by the day impacting my health and happiness. The company overall was a great company to work for. It just depends on the department your working under and whose your manager for your department.
good,"Wells Fargo was a good company to work for, but the salary for the tellers was very low. I loved my job but it didn't pay my bills so I had to resign."
good,"Due to the contract role status - found the department was unstable and training poor. Yet, management openly encouraged and supported job searching internal or external due to the turn door culture and unpredictable status of department"
good,Over all I  enjoyed the job I  did.  Management was very demanding and had no regard to family life. I enjoyed  my years there and would have continued to move up in the company
good,good atmosphere and people. good time off. you are able to get out of the job what you put into it. people are usually upbeat and there is a really nice cafeteria with starbucks as well.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for.  The benefits are great.  the insurance division can use some work.  Management does not listen to suggestions but they do ask you for them.
good,"Management is horrible in some locations, advancement relies on your relationship with your manager and not your work ethic. Very few raises, tellers are treated as if they don't matter."
good,"Pull reports, make sure team members review 2-3 loans a day each, typical day consists of multiple tasks and conference calls about files if tasking back for more information"
good,"The processes were very old and did not provide any chance for improvement. It was a B grade lender in Canada, with it's parent company in US. It was very difficult to meet targets because their interest rates on loans were very high in the market."
good,"Wells Fargo has good benefits. Work Life balance is easy to achieve. I have ample time off from work. I have no issues when it comes to needing and getting time off. "
good,"always moving , a lot of selling to have customers to open new account, achieving daily goals, hardest part was calling customers to have them new accounts over the phone"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I work with some really great people but the job is just too easy and the pay is not enough for me to live on my own.  There is little opportunity for advancement.
good,Great place to work. Management promotes advancement opportunities.  Very collaborative attitude between groups.  Flexible hours and telecommute options.
good,"While contracting for Randstad i was able to work at Wells Fargo Advisors where i was trained in Quality Assurance, how to analyze data, train new incoming contractors and learn how to function in an office style environment."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with my customers. This is a company you can definitely grow with. They will provide you with training.
good,"This position required extensive data extraction, manipulation, grooming and analysis in addition to executive summaries to be composed for senior management and shareholders.  I was exposed and learned interactions between / among various database formats and platforms (e.g. MS SQL Server vis-a-vis Teradata, etc). The most difficult task of the position regarded learning SAS IML on a very short and steep learning curve.  The most enjoyable part of the job was 'set' hours and a conventional work week:  Typically 40-50 hours, Monday through Friday."
good,My typical day at Wells Fargo was mostly dealing with potential customers looking to purchase a home. My role was to dial outbound calls an also take inbound calls to customers. I would educate the customer an also take through a pre qualification to see where they stand at first before purchasing a home. It's very important to me to always make sure the customer is satisfied an to make sure to I answered all their questions.
good,The area that I work in is a very secluded area on the operations side. We do not have a set schedule it is usually come in and stay until the job is finished. Some days are good and some are bad. We work in close area no windows very secure. I call it the banks little sweat shop.
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,The group of individuals are great to work with.  We act as a real team. Management is there for our support and this group performs year after year without the need of much management.
good,A typical day at work consist of a team of individuals working to assist our customer in succeeding financially. We believe in having conversations with our customers to understand what the immediate and near future financial goals and concerns are. I have learned to truly ask questions that help individuals self discover ways to position themselves for success. My management style is to be hands on with coachable moments and observations. We believe in being a team. We all help one another and that is the core of Wells fargo. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the changes due to some unfortunate individuals making decisions that effected the trust of the community and the Wells Fargo Brand. The most enjoyable part is knowing that each and everyday that you have made a difference in someone's life by assisting them in achieving there financial goals.
good,At the time very heavy on pushing sales. Hard to meet goals that are set for you. But Wells was my best job. I enjoyed the banking world. I would recommend Wells as an employer
good,"good benefits, no culture of inclusion, you always work more than 8 hours but you need to enter on system just 8"
good,"Demands integrity and excellence.  At management level, the expectation is you put in the hours to get the job done.  Co-workers care about doing their best.  Generous PTO.  Flexibility with schedule as needed."
good,This is a good company to work for and provides a lot of opportunities. Good company to start at to develop your skill set. Training is very helpful and useful when receiving new assignment / projects. Company supports they're team members thru personal / work matters. Showing you that you matter.
good,"A normal day at work would consist of opening procedures, morning meeting. Taking care of customers all day and help ensure they meet their financial needs. Multitasking, great phone skills, ability to quickly research information."
good,"No more sales goals, a lot of questions regarding fraudulent accounts and affiliation with DAPL. Super busy around 1st of the month. Team Members seem to come and go. Not too much room for promotion unless relocating to different line of work.Very Team Oriented."
good,Loved my short time there.  It was a great experience.  Very sorry to move on.  I am actively looking forward to returning there again some day in the future.
good,"Pros: Competitive PTO, great learning environment "
good,"Researched customer's concerns to see how and if able to assist"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great benefits, Great people, Great place to work! Very time consuming, and can be stressful. Compensation is good. be prepared to be skilled in selling"
good,"Large IT department with good budget. Very good with training to advance skills. Managers of varying levels of skills, some much better than others. Advancement was possible and encouraged. Bank regulations very important to internal functioning."
good,"I personally saw things that I didn't care for on how my store was being ran. The manager was incompetent and care free. The store was in a small town, everyone knew each other so with many employees there it was like high school all over. There were complaints filed against some staff and the manager and due to the tight nit group things couldn't be handled appropriately. The company goals are good, but when it comes down to stores employee interactions it can fall short."
good,Management not well organized. Sales still being pushed.  Really hard to get moved up or get a raise. Hours are barley reaching standard hours. Work environment can be fun.
good,I enjoy working here. The culture is nice and the members are friendly. Fast paced and a lot of information to retain. Many advancement opportunities.
good,"Same job tasks performed everyday,"
good,"Relaxed and fair expectations. You just don't get paid very much compared to industry standards.  Their commitment to the African American community is a farce. They only pay it lip service. If you are committed to this effort, another choice might be a better one."
good,"Great place to work, but no pathway to advancement unless you are in the right position or know the right people. If you work hard and the right people are watching, you might advance."
good,"It was great technology wise one of the better systems in the banking business.  I loved the job, and the people I served but the branch was to far of a drive everyday"
good,"It was a good environment, not too stressful. I was able to balance home and work life. Until things got stressful with family, then I feel the job wasn't as understanding."
good,"Growth and promotions are very slow and new technologies are not tried readily. onsite offshore model, controlled is more with the Team leads than individuals. Fun at work is given more importance"
good,"Depending on what department you work in will depend on if the manager follows Wells Fargo Philosophy.  "
good,Overall a great place to work. There are some areas that really need improvement. Procedures need to be tested more thoroughly before they are rolled out.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work as they are concerned about their employees health and well being and have good benefits.  I enjoyed having a good working relationship with my Managers and co-workers.
good,"productive and fun workplace, The staff was very friendly and would help out with anything you needed. The customers were also very friendly as well and would make your day interesting."
good,Management was very unorganized. 5/6 managers had zero management experience. The other had been a stay at home mom for 12 years and was hired as a manager. Much favoritism practiced. sweeps problems under the rug to avoid scandal.
good,"Excellent Work | Life Balance. I've worked at Wells Fargo for 6 years, and my position has been eliminated. My last day is May 26, 2017. Excellent culture."
good,Receipt of files for review. Entering information into the system. Following up on issues. Management was good and the workplace culture was great. I do not have any comments on the hardest part of the job as I found it quite easy to learn the software and practices and enjoyed working there.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I am currently still employed at Wells Fargo. I have worked in multiple lines of business and I have learned a great deal about the businesses within the bank and value everything I have learned. My development has grown from all the projects and experiences that I experienced during my time employed by Wells Fargo. Overall I am pleased with my development.
good,"I loved working at Wells Fargo! I made lots of friends with my coworkers and I grew close to a lot of the customers I saw. I learned a lot about banking and good ways to budget. I had two managers at Wells Fargo, a branch manager and a service manager. I loved my branch manager and thought he was very supportive and was a great leader. My service manager had a different style of managing then I preferred. She tended to be unprofessional and overshared things about her personal life. She was a great person, and friend, but was not as great at leading a team as my other manager. My other coworkers were very friendly and very fun to be around, I loved going in to work everyday! The hardest part of the job for me was the fact that we were understaffed and my service manager didn't handle the pressure of that very well. The most enjoyable part of this job was being around great coworkers, and seeing our regular customers every week. I was able to build relationships with amazing customers and I miss seeing them everyday."
good,Enjoyed the experience. I was able to travel the United States for multiple events and overtime was always available. Great opportunities for networking and great locations.
good,"Used strong customer service skills to greet, assist and sign in visitors to maintain office security."
good,both inbound  and  outbound calls to collect  on past  due accounts. I didnt  like getting yelled at for calling  at  dinner time or  because they were only 1 days past due.
good,"Micromanaged but not to stressful in the process, Just come to work, answer calls and make the most of it. Really easy paced and great people just management can be a pain!"
good,I can only speak for my area. I have found it to be well organized with good people and good support. Software has been surprisingly stable. Management provides good communication.
good,"Great place to work, however it has a lot of problems. You don't get ahead by being nice and fair. A lot of going up the ladder happens if you rub your elbows with the right people"
good,"Heavy workload, many reports during the week/day. 40hrs is not enough for all the responsibilities given, Overall good place.to work and good co workers."
good,This job was a fast paced environment. Production driven. I enjoyed working here because my time at work flew by it was non-stop work never slow. The worst part was it was micromanaged they made you feel bad for needing the restroom. I really enjoyed the people and work other then that.
good,"Good place to work.  They let you work from home.  Good work life balance.  As a contractor overtime is fround upon, however, they will work with you and let you take comp time"
good,"Good place to Work but on higher designation with more experience. Over all work life balance is good, less pressure and not very much to learn. Increments and hikes are slow and take a long to grow financially."
good,"Constant reorganization within the company, creating stress and uncertainty.  Pays competitively and benefits are also competitive.  Would recommend to others looking to work in the financial services industry."
good,I have learned more about real estate transactions working here. My Title experience has been very useful in my current role. The Team I work with is exemplary.
good,"working at WFHM was a great opportunity to process and close, as a one and done representative. There were a lot of changes and it didn't allow a person to truly develop a skill set."
good,Work is provided to each desk. Your job is to meet each customer needs in a deadline order.  Each accounts has specials instructions and  deadline. All work must be completed before end of shift or until finished
good,"Running checks and balancing them for 5 to you hours daily."
good,"To be quite honest, it is not a bad place to work. The issues are to many employees for the same branch for mortgage. They fight between each other for positions."
good,I worked there a long time ago (1988-2000) and I have no idea what it is like to work there now. It was very stressful during my time. My understanding is that they moved offices to Mendota Heights a few years ago.
good,"Wells Fargo is not a bad place to work.  Especially if you have a good manager.  Breaks are fair, company is fair.  Room for growth always seems tight."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed talking to people from all over the United States of America.  I helped people with Bill pay issues and problems getting onto the website.  It was fun helping people.
good,wellsfargo always keep customers first. providing best service to the customer is the top priority. company treats it's team members the way it treats it's customers. we find nice people around.
good,"The flexibility and PTO is fantastic. Management and advancement opportunities leaves room for improvement. It is easy to get stuck in a role, and new HR policies make it difficult to apply within the company."
good,"Opening the mail and getting it to the right person, and putting it in to a database. The  different types of insurance policies My manager was very nice. When I had to train someone for my job. I have met so very nice people."
good,A typical day in my leadership program consisted of being trained by experts in the field in regards to retail banking. Hardest part of the program that it was shortened due to the financial crises in the industry.
good,I loved working at well Fargo because I learned more about banking and finance. the management team was great. Unfortunately I had top stop working there because I was offered a better position at another company.
good,"They did not need me for a long term job. Not enough time to give a thorough review. "
good,"Wells Fargo gave me the ability to advance my career over 10 years and moved my family across state lines.  Culture is different in all areas. Even after the 2016 debacle.  Some leaders are still stuck in the old way of life.  Pushing for sales or other targets that are measured.  I was a mid/senior level Manager.  I always did the right thing for the customers and didn't get caught up in the mess.  Wells has the ability to be a great employer.  Much of that will depend on your manager and region you are in.  If you are a manager just beware that HR will take a large portion of your ""spare time"".  Everything is very political and difficult to get through.  "
good,"Great company culture, with a good work/life balance. I've definitely grown as a manager while working in a fast paced environment. The cross-functional aspect of the job has given me some great exposure, and I feel the experience has given me the ability to succeed in any area of banking."
good,I enjoy where I work and the people that I am working for. I think that if you enjoy who you work with it makes work so much more enjoyable to do.....
good,"All around a good job, they always rewarded you for achieving any goal. Pay was good, environment was good as well....the supervisors asked for a lot at times but it was ok."
good,"5 years of being at wells I have seen a lot of changes, They are headed in the right direction with job expectation for the job, SLOW advancement now. Once you are out of the Retail Branch side, you life is much Better."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work and the pay is great with annual increases. However it is hard to move up in the company due to structuring of applicants.
good,The company is on the rise after its downfall in late 2016 due to unauthorized accounts stemming from 2011. It has since ridded itself of sales goals and now is focused on great customer service.
good,"Lots of opportunity if you can figure it out; manager quality, work/life balance can be highly variable depending on the quality of your manager; good benefits if you can figure out the time to take advantage of them"
good,Good place to work.  Lots of Incentives.  Competitive & rewarded.  Good work environment for new graduates & re-entering into the workplace. Management gave monthly coaching & really seemed to care.
good,"No room for advancement beyond team lead.  Stable company to work for. Team player skills definately required. A typlical day as a team lead, come in watch your sales numbers and reps aht, check your quality assurance records for compliance fail reviews that had to be done within 24-48 hours. Answer questions, take escalations, monitor your reps."
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo includes routine daily work.."
good,"Wells Fargo every department is ran differently"
good,Great workplace. Good people. System issues: needs improvement. Most Supervisors are newly hired and not knowledgeable with processes. Great employee engagement activities.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a productive place to work that allows each employee to take charge of their career through personal and professional development training and on hand experience.
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo was to start the morning in a fast paced call center assisting customers with their bank, credit and debit card accounts. The things that I learned at Wells Fargo was to be able to take criticism and be coachable to learn, because it made you a better learner and gain more knowledgable of the product and services. the workplace culture was great because it was a diversity atmisfere that made everyone comfortable. I would say that the hardest part of the job was to try to learn what certain customers were calling in for when you cant speak their language but by working for the company for a while, I learned a few basic words of some of the languages to tell what language line was needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was me being able to help my customers and make sure tht I did everything possible to solve the problem and bring happiness to them."
good,The co workers are great but the rehiring process is not the best. Once you leave it is extremely difficult to get back in and you would think they would want to retain employees.
good,This company is great to work for. They help give you all the tools to have a great career. The hardest part is the sales portion of customer service. They have strict guidelines to follow. Management is eager to help.
good,Very good place to work. Learned a lot about banking. Management was laid back making the office culture pleasant even on hard days. The hardest part is not wanting to make errors since they can be costly. Like everything from office environment to pay.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work. There's lots of opportunity for advancement and it has a good overall culture. The compensation is average. The only drawbacks are a lot of pressure for sales, and the fact that you can easily lose your job, regardless of years of service."
good,"My day begins with emails to out attorneys, responses and information that is requested.  I am currently responsible for collecting data for objections, proof of claims, and drafting motions for relief.  I have extensive experience in chapter13 bankruptcy chapter 7 bankruptcyknowledge.  Repossession guidelines state by state. Reinstatement and redemption knowledge.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team."

good,"Best place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working with Wells Fargo, they give those who are driven the opportunity for advancement. I had the get pleasure of having leaders that motivated and encouraged me to be better."
good,"This is a truly great company to work for. They have very competitive pay and if you're willing to put in the work you can move up very quickly. They have great benefits, even if you're only part time, PTO, Insurance, team member accounts. I faced some issues with management and the way they ran their staff but that can be said about almost any company. After the sales lawsuit the company truly changed for the better. They are focusing on the most important thing in business, the customer."
good,"Wells was where I learned to sell. At the time I was there, the culture was much focused on adding value to a customer's experience every time. As I put to practice their process for sales, I learned how to sell well. Great company."
good,"For the short time that I worked at Wells Fargo, the coworkers were nice, resourceful and helpful in helping me understand and perform well to get the job tasks done well."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Management is focused on compensating long term employees regardless of evaluations and work performed."
good,With as company so large there are many positions available to learn. From cash vault to management the possibilities are wonderful. The benefits are great for the working employee.
good,"In my days of working for Wells, they had a huge emphasis for sales and this resulted in some of their good people leave. Recent changes  promoted them to get rid of goals. Great employees and greta culture."
good,"Loved the job, coworkers everything. The training WF provides for their new contractors is very well laid out. The only issue I had was that Apex systems has very, very bad medical coverage with regards to costs."
good,Worked for Wells Fargo for roughly two years. Enjoyed my time with the company. My department was relocated out of state. Was offered a promotion and moving allowance to relocate. Opted to decline the offer due to recent home purchase. Cannot complain about my experience.
good,My position was eliminated from this company in June 2013. Was Executive Assistant and Paralegal to the General Counsel.  Worked on many projects and had high level assignments.
good,"Wells Fargo has excellent work benefits.  They provide paid time off and other benefits that are family oriented.  They have team building events that are paid days, also."
good,Have enjoyed working for this company for 10 years. I have had several opportunities to move up and around at the company.
good,"I work in operations, analysis and data entry. The company embraces diversity. Management is encouraging. Not much change from day-day, values employees"
good,"Came to Wells Fargo at an entry level customer service officer.  Within a short period of time, I was able to advance quickly.  Management was very supportive of career advancement.  Work life balance was a challenge."
good,Wachovia was an industry leader and I was enabled to grow professionally and personally throughout my career and time at this company. I left the company for advancement.
good,my experiences with Wells Fargo has been very good. While working in Wholesale Banking I've achieved a lot of experience & knowledge in every aspect of a job requirement from being a manage resource to now an entry level manager.
good,"Productive place to work at. Sales and service are very important to this Company. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with sales goals, almost unachievable."
good,typical day of work is better work culture and there is better support from the management and coworkers hardest part of the job is working extended hours to complete the work
good,"I have the pleasure to work at Wells Fargo for several years.  I have not only grown as an underwriter, but Wells Fargo has challenged me enough professionally that has caused me to grow in expertise."
good,"This is a sales organization where you are compensated for your efforts. There are solid managers in place, and plenty of room for advancement. However you work hard and have a poor work life balance."
good,Interact with customer and others and learn a great deal about how the banking industry works. Management helps you learn way to grow and improve on customer service and communication.
good,I spent over ten years of my work life at Wells Fargo and they were great. I would love to continue and have a future with them.
good,"I truly wish this company was based more so on service than sales. Beside that aspect of the job you can advance within the company if you put forth the effort. But, the company isn't for me."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"During my time with the company, I had six different managers I was working under.  Some of the managers made it very difficult to go to work where others made each day go by fast by their energy and dedication.  There is a lot of growth opportunity, but again it all depends who you are working under if they are willing to help you grow."
good,My first teller job. I learned a lot about banking. All co workers were friendly when I came and welcomed me. Company has a lot to offer in advancement
good,Depending on whether it is a school day or not makes a large difference on what we have to do. Most days we start the day with running morning group which consist of the kids going over issues on the dorm from the day before and what they need to do to improve. After that the kids will do activities where we supervise and most of the time we participate with them. At the end of the night we have group therapy where I we would talk about their issues and what caused them to be there and what they have learned so they are not back in the same circumstance.
good,"As the Lead Teller, I had many responsibilities. One of those responsibilities was stage coaching. Stage coaching consisted of supporting the team in a variety of ways, including approving high risk transactions, and helping team members to deliver value through financial conversations. I would often ''blow up the teller'' by introducing myself, explaining my role, and then introducing the teller by name and addressing how great they are at helping with financial plans."
good,"managment and staff were all very nice at the branch I worked at. If you want to advance and go the management route they will groom you, if you want to go into banking or investing they will put you on that track as long as you show initiative and meet your sales goals."
good,"Responsible for reviewing, analyzing, approving and underwriting moderate individual consumer requests and products within company and industry guidelines. Dependent on division, functions may include evaluating and ensuring overall loan documents are accurate, complete, and compliant; reviewing of financial statements, credit reports, applicable ratios (i.e. Debt ratios, loan-to-value) and other supporting documentation; using an automated"
good,"this is a very busy environment. we have our underwriters and closer teams that is supported by leaders and Admin staff. we try to maintain a diversity atmosphere and fair environment. our focus is to  provide Wells Fargo customer an exceptional  experience within our company guidelines and comply to all regulations that we are required t o do so. We have a very close team, here at our location."
good,company use to give good benefits and don't have to much pressure on employ regarding work. some of the co-workers use to be good.
good,I greeted customers and helped with their transactions as well as provided financial services like educating them on new promotions and options the company offered that may have been beneficial to them.
good,You are constantly busy and expected to sell products or services to customers even though they just want to do their banking. Too much pressure is put on sales for tellers. No real chance of promotion or advancement. Pay is mediocre at best. Lots of turnover at our local bank.
good,"Good work culture as Team members are supportive,Fun loving which helps me to reduce stress and give more production."
good,"Don't be fooled; you would think that being on the phone means customer service. On more than one occasion I've heard a conversation like this go down:"
good,"a typical day at work, early in the morning is to complete is to compete yesterday work that came in after I left work.  Enjoy co-works  help or me helping them. The hardest part of the job is to  learn new way of doing new job, and the most enjoyable is when you learn it. And say to yourself that was simple."
good,"Everyday is a new learning experience, get to meet great people, interact and build rapport with customers."
good,"Good company to work for, plenty of opportunity within the bank.  Retail and back-office positions are spread across the country,"
good,"A typical day for me at Wells Fargo was opening the store and getting everything set up for my tellers for the day, making sure everyone had enough cash & supplies that they needed and also running a morning huddle to let everyone know where the branch stands in the district. Throughout the day I would have 1:1's with each team member to go over their last weeks numbers and set new goals and expectations for the week ahead. One thing I absolutely loved about the job was how close everyone was with each other, it was like a big family away from my actual family. Managers were amazing at their jobs and how they coached their team members. I can definitely say that I learned my leadership skills from my previous management."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to begin your career. They have a structured work environment for new analysts. They invest a lot in your training on the job. Management in Canada is a bit lax compared to the states as it is a new enterprise here.
good,"Expect to produce and to be flexible. Depending on the manager you have, you may or may not advance quickly.  Once you find you advocate, then you are good.  Communicate career advancement opportunities to MGMT."
good,A little unorganized for such a large company. The training wasn't the best when they brought on a whole new program to this area with all new staff. They could have done a better job with the support and training.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Good place to work and good work life balance."
good,"giving great opportunities learning to be diverse in banking industry.  helped with accounts receivable, mail room, supply room, office equipment, and maintenance requests on floor worked on."
good,"Great place to work started my career at Wells Fargo, met and worked with great people lifetime friends. Typical day fast paced environment, worked as a team to get the job done."
good,"Good company, a bit on the conservative side. Starting to be affected by decreasing margins and increasing regulatory requirements. Sterling reputation compared to some similar size brokerage firms."
good,"great company, great culture. big on customer experience and their customers, as a manager its hard to find a work life balance since your salary"
good,"Co-workers are very friendly and helpful, very team oriented job. Not the best with team management at my particular branch. But overall very good atmosphere."
good,I'll be honest the call center work life is extremely boring call after call but it's not hard at all. Pay is good for the job that it is and there is definitely room for advancement. I would recommend this job to any entry level candidates!
good,"Wells Fargo puts a lot of money into training you for a position, but then when you get on the floor it's totally different. They also have unattainable goals that numbers have proven that can't be reached but they continue to put pressure on you and that is what makes it a stressful environment."
good,"No hard parts"
good,Office environment of cubicles made the workplace sometimes very noisy and frustrating; I prefer a quite place to work.  Customer service was always first and often required extended hours.
good,Wells Fargo is a very high pressure sales company but as for compensation and things like that they do a very good job. There is also good opportunity for advancement.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, providing its employees an excellent work/life balance. The size of the company makes achieving meaningful results difficult and time consuming."
good,pay is good. Many rules and regulations to memorize and adhere to which are subject to change. Very numbers/sales driven environment.
good,"Wells Fargo was my first corporation to work for have great benefits and a lot of growth opportunity. I have gain knowledge in Bankruptcy, Foreclosure, Loss Mitigations, and Risk/Compliance by work for this company off and on within the past 10 years that have gave me opportunity to expand my knowledge and advance within or with another corporation."
good,"I love the family environment and diversity. the flexible hours and engagement with upper management, I  also like the great benefits such  as 401k and  paid holidays. and the option to volunteer for your favorite charity."
good,"Good benefits good people but sales goals are to high, Environment is family like. Strict on customer service satisfaction."
good,"I worked with people all day using a computer to access there accounts. did deposits, withdrawals, made sure everything was correct and updated. They did not give us proper breaks all i usually got was a 30 min. lunch during an 8 hour shift which made it hard to function properly and was very tiring.

good,"The job was pretty much easy when I get used to with the flow and what I do. The co-workers and manager, which team I was belong with, was nice and friendly to communicate. They will answer and help almost all the question you struggling. They do ask for volunteer overtime. When we hit the goal for the team, there is snack and food as a little treat. I really love it. Just one problem when I get hired on, they offer pretty much lower than my recruiter."
good,Working at Wells Fargo is very fun and easy because the people are so respectful and caring. I learned about customer satisfaction and ways to work with them.  I also learned how to balance working with a team to achieve our goals.

I either find the answers to questions myself or find the correct person to ask.  We also reconcile custodial accounts of our investors and make correcting entries to fix out of balance accounts. We also provide audits for outside companies and internal audit information.  My area is a team oriented and goal setting style dept.  Management is a lose style and mostly hands off unless production numbers are not hit.  Hardest part of the job is trying to explain the processes that we do to loans that a outside investor does not understand the money movements.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the work atmosphere.  It is a fun group of people that I work with and there is great communication and teamwork.

good,I had a good work experience with my team members. I feel that Wells Fargo needs to provide more job specific training and not just generalized training. Due to the type of training they use it makes it very difficult to do your specific job. I felt lost for the better part of the first month. I felt as though I was training myself through asking specific questions and extensive notes. Work director did not provide much support.
good,Large company with top-notch technology.  Lots of support for volunteering in the community and balancing work with kids and other personal issues.
good,it was good teller job. high preasure on sales however. high demand on customer service work under minimum supervision
good,"My various roles at Wells Fargo, and predecessor banks, allowed me the opportunity to be involved in sales, underwriting, relationship management and growing lines of business to a contracting credit exposure environment. I was involved in relationships, largely real estate related, from the onset in many cases through full work-out as the overall market eroded in the face of a near collapsing economy and rapid deflation of a housing bubble. From this experience, I learned not only good relationship fostering and growing skills by introducing new products and expanding the bank's breadth and depth of product offerings with clients but also how to manage through difficult economic circumstances while maximizing return to the bank in the form of minimizing losses."
good,Day started off by coordinating work. I learned how to handle large accounts like walmart and homedepot. Management worked with your weeknesses and strenghts. Since the department was always very buzy not to much time to talk to co-workers. the best part of the job was learning new products.

good,Was a decent place to work with management team offsite which made it difficult to see progression in the company. Learned new skills related to fund transfers and how payment messages work.
good,"Worked here for 7 years, they gave me a lot of experience and opportunity for advancement. They do demand a lot, you have to work hard if you want to get anywhere. Leaving because the work/life balance deteriorated."

good,"Depending what area you work in, the traffic of customers can be overwhelming at times. I worked at a very busy store and sometimes wanted to panic and run out. Customers are irate, rude, and angered by the banks policies at times so you cannot be sensitive! If you are full-time, Wells Fargo makes it hard for you to have time off to balance your needs as a human. Money and job security is good,however, and paid time off & holidays makes that even better."
good,"Had a good time working for Wells fargo. Contract Position at Wells Fargo to help them build the Treasury Information Reporting and Transaction Search applications.

good,"Greeting walk in and phone customers and assisting them with mortgage issues.  Assist manager and loan officers with collecting documentation needed for underwriting review.  Pull credit, order title work, order appraisals. I was responsible for overseeing rate locks and maintaining spreadsheets to keep track of loans being processed.  Loan officers and processors were very dependent on my ability to watch their deadlines.   Very small office with only 3-5 people so everyone had to work well together.  I worked well with all the loan officers and really enjoyed that part of the job.  The hardest part was the constant changes in the mortgage industry causing a lot of customers to get upset with the continued requirements and requests for additional information.  The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customer and knowing you were helping them get into a home of there own."
good,"I loved working at Wells Fargo. Great hours, pay and benefits.Co-workers were fun and helpful. Ability to work individually or as a team. Challenging atmosphere and multiple responsibilities made every day a little different. I learned how to manage vendors and work with all walks of life to obtain a single goal."
good,"Involved in each phase of development.  involved from designing of the data structure to deployment of the package,  involved in  creating the report."

good,how to deal with different and difficult situations with different people from different background.its one of the best places to work.

good,A good place to work but not into sales for my customers who just wanted to come in and do their banking.  The customers that came in daily is what kept me going!!
good,"A typical day at work for me is building relationships with the city (code officers, HOA, neighbors, etc.), special investors, and attorneys working on the files and making sure our properties are in compliance with the city.  I love the fact that my work required me to function under minimum supervision and being able to meet dead lines and minimizing risks.  I learned how to maintain properties through ordering work with our vendors and reviewing the HUD, FHA, FNMA files and staying within their guidelines.  I had to put together over allowable and corporate proposals as needed.  I also love being part of an environment where the team worked as a team and being there for one another as needed.  We also brought in treats (I love to bake) for everyone to enjoy but did it as a team.  One of the more harder things to do was the corporate proposals but none the less it was doable.  I am a great leader any is open and enjoy working as a team."
good,"I started working as an encoder and moved to computer sales balancing. Data entry, vault control etc.. Then went to address changes with 100% no errors. Ended up with mail distribution then was laid off because of cutbacks."
good,"management very understanding about life and work balance, they start you off with pto which is awesome benefits are very affordable and they match a large percentage of the 401k they even offer benefits to their part  time employees however there isnt much pay for tellers and there is very aggressive sales goals other than that they are a very good company to move up in."
good,"A great company for those looking for advancement opportunities. Great benefits and competitive 401K program."
good,This position had excellent pay and benefits compared to the local market. Management could use some more training about the processes the employees learn. I voluntarily taught my supervisor how to use a certain system.
good,"Pros"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,"Nice facilities, good people.  The nature of a contract in an entity with an unstable corporate history.  Everyone afraid for the future.  Acquired by another entity under federal mandate.  Not fun!"
good,"Wells Fargo Financial Canada Corp not only understood what project management was but embraced its methodologies and leveraged its tool like no other company I've had the pleasure of working with. "
good,Plan the day with the team on sales goal and objectives for the day. I've learned how to coach and develop team members to be ready for future advancements. I've learned to manage my team by coaching and training but having fun through out the day. My coworkers feel like I am there to help them. I can't say there is a hard part of the job. The key is to be consistent with all aspects of managing the branch. The most enjoyable is working with a strong team that wants to make it happen for you and the branch. And after achieving that the whole branch gets recognized.
good,"great place to work but sales had to be met, i always met sales goals,it was a very slow branch so at times i would to follow ups for the whole day."
good,Great for people who like to see new things. And learn from a group of peers. Co-workers are very much fun. The floor managers are a great group of people. The best part of working here is getting to meet great performers. Seeing things live that you see on YouTube.
good,I was a MS Access Database developer.  My manager was a good guy who understood the development lifecycle.  I enjoyed working there.
good,"Every day is different, easy to keep busy.  Never ending sales goals each quarter.  You must be able to navigate through the merky waters of inner office politics.  The pay is low for the stress.  The bank gets audited about three or four times throughout the year and it is always nerve racking experience that sucks all the air out of the branch for those few days.  Limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"Hardest part was making sales. Easy to move up and get promoted. Company only cares about sales, sales, and sales. Most managers help you move up, and challenge you to do so."
good,"I learned how to manage a pipeline , professional business atmosphere, employees are helpful to assist in advancement"
good,"Typical day at work started at 815 and ended around 530. We would get the branch ready for opening, process transactions from night drop, do buy/sells to make sure we had enough cash/coins. We would process all customer transactions. Balance our drawers at the end of the day and do all closing procedures. I had the best coworkers a person could ask for. The hardest part of the job was transferring to NC from Fl and getting used to the different rules for the same company. I enjoyed every aspect of my job as a teller, I loved the interactions with my customers. I learned a lot about the products that Wells Fargo offered. I was not impressed with the management team at the branch that I worked at. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers."
good,"continually assisting homeowners, realtors and authorized third party with inquires consisting with customers accounts and the company's needs"
good,"great company.  Served as food service director for a year and 4 months.  Was let go based on a current business decision, unit could no longer support my salary as a manager."
good,"Currently working in the busiest call center at Wells. High pressured and intense position. For the most part the co-workers are very nice but some have issues with the contractors, as Wells dows contract a lot of jobs. Hardest part of this position is the calls are back to back.Very little down time to regroup."
good,"Good company with some room for advance, however the micro management and totally rude why some of the managers would speak to the employees was just not right."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Need more training for employees.  Need two days off in a row instead of working two days, off one day and then working three days and off one day."
good,"~great work environment"
good,Wells has been a great company to work for. Managers are there to help when needed and there is a true concern for our customers.
good,Working at Wells Fargo is a dream job met with many challenges. Daily activities of meeting with customers and financing the american dream. Great earning potential based on market and referral partner performance. Flexible schedule allows for family life although to be successful it can take away from family time.
good,I take between 60 to 100 calls a day. I work with high value customers. I have learned a lot of ways to de-escalate someone. I have also learned a lot of over the phone skills and how to seem personable to a customer. The atmosphere is the hardest thing to deal with on a daily basis. Not to say anything bad about the people here but management could be better to make phone bankers feel more comfortable and like our opinions count.
good,Every Day was Different. The Fun part about Wells Fargo is that the face to face interactions with the customers was the best part. Getting to know people and building relationships.
good,There was a lot of favoritism in the field if you didn't meet your quota then they would kinds blow you off
good,The scheduling there is great. It allows me to be able to work and attend my kids activities!
good,"The days were fast paced as in any call center environment."
good,"A typical day was taking inbound calls from trust customers/administrators/beneficiaries and providing them with complete and professional solutions to their requests.  As senior employees did a lot of the trade orders which I loved to do."
good,"The employees and most managers were nice. The hours were consistent and great. They understand that there must be a balance between family life and work.  On the flip side, when there are goals to be met, it gets rather intense and it isn't exactly the most fun place to be but that's life."
good,l learned a lot about the details of the mortgage business at Wells.
good,"A typical day at work starts with me logging into my phone and computer. I answer the phone and verify it is the customer i am speaking with related to the account i pull up. "
good,"Some of the brightest folks I've ever worked with. However, like any other corporation, making changes in processes can be an uphill battle. If you're good with status quo, or are hired as a full time employee and have the time to nurse long term projects, then Wells may be a good fit for you. They have a good work-life balance and decent compensation."
good,I came in with no experience regarding home mortgage. They made sure I learned everything I needed to know; answered every question I asked to the best of their knowledge and if any problems arose they made accommodations. I learned that a good attitude is everything and if you work hard they will work with you.
good,I performed the same functions I currently perform at Yates Insurance - personal lines account manager.
good,Lot of prospecting and calling. Well know company but becoming too big and mgmt. is changing. Good benefits and ok healthcare. Pay is decent. Culture is changing and more like a big bank
good,Very Stressful as far as the sales quota is concerned. The managers push very hard and about 50% of the time its overbearing and stressful
good,"Great company to work, lot of opportunities for Team Members."
good,"A typical day at work includes taking inventory, responding to emails and phone calls, coordinating events with other Wells Fargo members, processing invoices for payment, updating information in the database, and completing projects to help the training courses run smoothly.  "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"working at green tree was very rewarding personally, i met some really great people. everyone was friendly and related to each other respectfully and management had a open door policy which made work easier for everyone. we also have group activities periodically like potluck and picnics"
good,"Come into work, grab my cash drawer, sign on to my computer, have a huddle with my team, then start taking transactions. Management can suck at times due to the lack of leadership skills, but at the end of the day your team is still family."
good,"Online banking customer service, referring and educating customers about other products offered by Wells Fargo."
good,As a security guard the job was basic routing and I learned more about the work the vendors were performing. I learned the general aspects of a database and it's maintenance work.
good,N/A I learned that working for Wells Fargo has two different sides.
good,"Helped customers over the phone on a daily basis with their account information such as balances, transfers, or filing disputes. I also answered or helped out customers with any additional questions they had about their accounts."
good,A lot of work means great pay + overtime. No work equals layoffs.
good,"Daily I monitored a pipeline of loans that were scheduled for hearings for foreclosure sale that were in review for options for workouts to avoid foreclosure. I evaluated income & asset documentation, spread & analyze credit to determine affordability based on the guidelines set by the investor. I had to maintain a quality level at or above 90% of which I maintained a 97% quality rating. The environment was typically production based but due to the sensitivity of the type of files that piece was somewhat lenient. The goal was to decision at least 2 files per day but was not always attainable for various reasons dependent upon each days workload. The management style was micro-managed. My peers were mostly experienced underwriters and we worked closely together to meet the goals of the team. I enjoyed being able to work with customers to help find alternatives to foreclosure. The dissappointing side was when I was unable to find an alternative and the property had to go to foreclosure sale. Learning the legal side of the foreclosure process was a huge asset."
good,Really enjoyed each work day. Learned allot about processing loans.enjoyed the team that I was working with. Enjoyed helping people save there homes and helping them get into a new home.
good,"I had been with the bank when it was First Union, then Wachovia Bank. I worked collections when I first started. It was a pleasant place to work.  When Wells Fargo took over I was in the Mortgage dept working with people who were trying to get their mortgage remodified .  They were unorgainized when it came to the customer.  Also management was in another state which made it difficult to get answer to questions we had"
good,"I take calls 8 hours a day assisting customers with their credit cards such as fixing account issues, taking payments, credit limit increases, fraud issues, disputes, explaining how to properly use a credit card, and much more. I learned how to deal with irate customers and actively listen to other people problems and to not take things personal when a customer is calling in angry, because they are just frustrated with issues pertaining their credit card. The management is nice, understanding, and willing to help all their employees. I love my co-workers, because they are fun to be around and they make the work day go by fast. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your numbers throughout the day to meet your sales goals, because some days customers do not want any new products or services. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a fun laid back environment and getting bonuses every quarter if you quality."
good,"Wells Fargo is a GREAT company to work for; a call center is NOT. It's difficult being a phone banker! Even though the job is not physically demanding, it is mentally exhausting. If it weren't for the great social aspect, this place would be murder. If you need good money for not doing very much, this is the place to be, but if you aspire to do anything with your life, DON'T GET STUCK IN A CALL CENTER."
good,"Was a nice company to work for, was with Wells Fargo for 15 years and learned more about Management and how to deal with co workers.  Loved working with customers and building an relationship with them.  Enjoyed solving problems and hitting monthly and quarterly goals."
good,"Great company, nice people.  nice culture.  I've learned a lot working here and have a great working relationship with everyone here."
good,"Good company to work for. Make sure your questions are answered and you understand your duties.  Negotiate, negotiate, and negotiate.  Pay attention to your training and know that what you learn in your training class you will need twice as much knowledge and experience.  Good luck"
good,"1. Good compensation"
good,Managers get away with all things in poor taste.  The hard working employees who generate the income are treated very poorly.
good,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is a very good company to work for, but however they have incorporated selling products to their customers. They want you to sell their other products to customers rather than handle their mortgage issues."
good,If your looking to establish yourself in the job world. This is a good place to show face. And stand out.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Met with customers to provide personal financial counseling and lending services. Managed customer's portfolio, service relationships and cross-sold various products. Formulated scenario terms and payments for home equity loan/lines applications. The management team was great at keeping the team motivated and updated with all training and compliance. The hardest part of the job was getting the credit loan applications approved.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer's and introducing them to new or better products and services."
good,"The campus is fully of diversity, not the cookie cutter business suits you see in corporate america.  Diversity is a big initiative for the company and that shows with all the team member networks (affinity groups) on campus.  "
good,Wells Fargo has provided me opportunities to learn new skills and apply them in each role I have obtained.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with and building relationships with many partners within the company and outside of the company.  I enjoy being viewed as a leader and have the opportunity to share my ideas and expertise daily to ensure we keep our vision and values top of mind.
good,"This job gave me very valuable customer service experience, however, there was no room for advancement and managers did not seem very qualified."
good,"This job had many sales demands from their tellers which actually made the job a lot more difficult then it had to be. As a teller we were actually sales people instead of simple tellers. I never minded talking product to customers, but its much harder when they did not train us on the products and we are speaking through thick glass. Every teller had sales goals which majority of the time I was able to accomplish. But most days people only wanted to complete their transactions and leave, not stay and talk products they did not want or need."
good,My first bank job as a teller...enjoyed it very much! Co workers were great...very helpful.
good,Great company. Solid management teams that show desire for your to improve.
good,Was a good place to work at.  Co-Worker were very friendly and out-going.
good,My boss needed a stepping stone to use a few of us to save her job and cut about 8 of us when it came time to lay offs.  She had 4 people that she took with her and left the rest of us in the dept to fend for our self..
good,A large number of employee's were hired with a two year contract.  All were let go before our contract was up.
good,Process paperwork from various business partners to upload into an online site to view. Co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Come in make calls to same customers from internal ""leads"" system. Talk to the same 150-200 customers every month. Your Co-workers are also calling the same ""leads"" so your customers get to talk to everyone in the branch monthly. Go to Lunch. Maybe close a loan or do a credit card app. Go home. Really need to bring back the ability for credit managers to market outside of the ""leads"" provided."
good,Wells Fargo is a great company with a good culture and opportunities.  Internal advancement does is available but compensation may not be competitive.

good,Great atmosphere and great people to work with. I really enjoyed my time and experience within this department.
good,"A typical day at work involves prioritizing and completing multiple tasks.  In my time with the company I've learned how to manage and take ownership of our job process.  The team works well, always willing to assist one another and works hard to meet production and quality goals. The hardest part of my job is being able to manage multiple tasks during the day and always meeting or exceeding production and quality goals.  The most enjoyable part of my job is serving on committees as a spokesperson for my teams ideas. I recently completed a mentoring course so I can mentor new employees coming into the department."
good,"Very friendly environment with positive co-workers. The hours sometimes were hard raising young children, however things worked themselves out."
good,"In my time working at Wells Fargo HBS, I interviewed at least 100 Wells Fargo employees looking to move to my team.  Despite making low wages at a company that wouldn't hesitate to lay them off, I heard over and over again that they LOVED working for Wells Fargo and would never leave unless forced to.  One co-worker had been laid off five times, but kept coming back.  It is hard to quantify what makes a company, especially such a large company, feel like a family, but it was undeniable.  "
good,"Customer service, Vault duties, Safe deposit boxes. Most challenging part of job was figuring out how to deal with angry clients."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "

good,"- Strong pipeline management"
good,Coworkers became good friends. You spend long hours working for this company so might as well enjoy the people you work with. I honestly didn't mind working so much because I loved my bosses and they were good to me.
good,"A great company to work for even though some managers tend to not let team members balance work and home life equally. Requires a lot of last minute overtime."
good,"Sales and customer service oriented, learned how to overcome objections when offering a product to a customer. Management is ok, depending on the level you are dealing with. Awesome co-workers. Dealing with angry customers would be the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable would be being able to turn that experience around and get the customer to leave with a positive attitude"
good,"Arrive to work and engage in a morning huddle about the goals set for the day.  Count money, check emails for updates, call and confirm appointments.  Beginning meeting with clients.  Set more appointments.  Review store goals."

good,It's a pretty decent place to work and I enjoy working here but would like to explore other opportunities. I enjoy the atmosphere and my co-workers are delightful. Management are very adaptive and willing to teach.
good,"My job entailed supervising a team of 14-26 bankers a team lead and a team helper. My goal was to give the tools to the bankers on how to reach and exceed their goals and how to manage their activities to keep on track. I would recognize people for their achievement’s, and improvements. My peers and I would help each other and support our teams in our absence. We would strive daily to meet our daily goals while attending meetings and management functions. I consistently exceeded all goals and I developed teams that were strong and supportive of each other. I lead the team by letting them know we were each an important part of the team and of our success"
good,Helpful and knowledgeable management team and team members
good,"I do not have any information to disclose at this time."

good,"The culture is very open"
good,"Great management team"
good,"Overall Wells Fargo is a great place to work. Although Home preservation can be a bit stressful, the satisfaction comes in knowing you have helped to save a family's home. I learned  a great deal during my employment about government programs, laws and investor guidelines pertaining to the loan modification process.  Management did their job to ensure work was completed timely and efficiently.  The hardest part of the job was calling a homeowner to tell them they don't qualify for assistance and recommending short sale.  This was hard because you are basically telling people to move out of their homes. Also making sure they understood the importance of timely submission of proper documents for the review.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me, was to have someone frantically call for help, and after a few days be able to call them back and advise them they were approved!"
good,Wachovia was a very productive place to work. This company just didn't balance well with life changing events.
good,it was alright. very goal oriented. have to hustle on the daily

good,"Good company, with good benefits, but too worried about sales, rather than what the customer actually needs."
good,Productive and excellent workplace to start a new job. That was a good place to learn new skills.
good,I learned a lot about finance issues and solutions. It was hard when the Call Center shut down and we were laid off. Still unemployed. I miss it.
good,I would get to work wait for check aoms to come so I could match check with the aoms. make labels send them out to the right  state and county. I learned a lot more about computer working with  a fast pace. my co worker were great we all worked as a team to get what we needed done. Really wasn't anything hard expect getting to know all the computer systems which didn't take to long. the most enjoyable part was just being able to do my job in get alone and do what we needed to do.
good,"Goals are set to stretch you as a person, and make you tougher as a professional."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Not much to say as Wachovia was purchased by Wells Fargo Co. during the recession.
good,I worked in the operational departments of Wells Fargo. A typical day  was dealing with brokers and sales assistants as we assisted them in addressing the needs of the customers. This included the use of email and telephone to communicate effectively. Used computer software programs and databases to get the job done. Co-workers were client-focused. Hardest part of the job was the changing economy led to various restructuring that lead to displacements and outsourcing of jobs.  The most enjoyable part of he job is the professional approach the managers and the employees take to the job.
good,"Great management, very flexible especially if you are a student."
good,"Helping customers navigate through the website."
good,I enjoyed working with my teammates. Job is very stressful and does not compensate enough for job responsibility.
good,Great place to work with good management that cared and support you in your daily work flow. Every day there was something to learn and to follow to meet the high standards they required of everyone.  Our customers were satisfied with our customer service and sent in survey card's to let each all know what they felt about dealing with us.
good,"approving / rejecting asset movement requests"
good,"An average day of a Wells Fargo Home Preservation Specialist includes reviewing/pre-underwriting income documents, speaking with mortgage borrowers, and collecting modification documents."
good,"Work on client escalations such as"
good,"An average day is fairly hectic, calls start coming in immediately, and continue until you end your shift. It has increased my time management skills considerably. The hardest part of the job would have to be some of the customers, they can be irate and bold compared to having face to face customers. But the company does its best to make the environment fun  and productive. Overall good company if selling is your focus."
good,"Great managers.  "
good,"Great company to work for, treats employees nice. Branch neatness could improve."
good,"Planning your day based on  information listed on pipeline reports to help you stay on task.  A very challenging position which flexibility and prioritizing your day is very crucial in order to meet deadline dates such as contractual due diligence, lock expirations, closing dates, document expiration dates."
good,was challwnging and had good experience working with Wells Fargo
good,"It was a good company to work for. They gave promotions and raises based on performance. "
good,great place to work at but the management loses sight of the customer when they have us pitching the products down customer mouths even after they had said no for 5th time
good,It is a job! I love the people that I work with though! My work schedule is nice. And the benefits are not bad at all
good,"A good place to work, but career wise not fulfilling. Most of the management seem to know the business. My manager is very knowledgeable and was a good mentor. In my opinion she is the best manager that works at my location."
good,"Typical call center environment. Seems like you are working for a totally different company if you land a job outside of WFCC. Lots of opportunity, however a lateral move may be offered."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good company with great name brand and history. Compensation seems to be lower than competitors for similar positions.
good,The second I get to work early in the morning I logged onto my account to start my work. I use computer throughout the day. I have to work well with others and analyze documents accurately.
good,"Review all case files daily."
good,"I really enjoy some of the people I work with, but they haven't been much help in training and preparing me for higher positions. Its an easy company to work for if you don't want to move up quickly. I have expressed many times that I want to move up in the company, but none of my managers help to make sure I know the things I need to know no matter how much I ask."
good,"Great opportunity to transfer to various departments. Reviewed closed loan packages, later began loan processing. Early years spend on Bank side in Control Dept."
good,"The Benefits and resources are top of the line.  Sometimes upper management can be too far removed from ground floor development, and a lack of communication keeps it that way.  "
good,Not a bad place to work. Communication among managers could be better. Coworkers are a blast to work with. Great goal based incentives
good,Wells Fargo is a great company if you can handle the Sales stress and constant employee turnover.
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work. All of my co-workers were great to work with. I loved the fast paced environment when it was busy. I learned a lot about the mortgage industry in the 8 years I was here. I knew nothing about the mortgage industry when I started, and have worked my way up from a low level processor to a mid level underwriter. I loved the work and enjoyed going to work every day."
good,"not much job security or advancement"
good,This company believes in the promotion and advancement of its team members. They are great at helping team members achieve their short and long term goals.
good,This company is great to learn professional skills however the management is very interchangable went through 3 different managers in three months. Unorganized establishment
good,I enjoyed working for Wells.  The people I worked with were knowledgeable and professional.  Benefits were good and management was fair.
good,"Salary is awful, and it is all about the numbers daily, no matter how great you have done the day before or the down turn of customers coming into the bank, and the credit restrictions they have for customers to get loans"
good,"its a okay place to work able to make good money"
good,"learned a lot about credit and how it affects life"
good,"I enjoyed most of my time working for WF, major downside I encountered was being hired through a temp agency with a consistent reminder of ""being hired on."" The promises were alluring, however the focus that was hindering a permanent position was ever changing, along with the ""connection,"" the representative of the temporary agency I was hired through."
good,Wells Fargo Home Mortgage provides great opportunity. They provide great resources to help you manage your business and are always ahead of the curve when it comes to industry changes. They are a company that will do what it takes to get the job done.
good,The management teams that I have worked with during my time with Wells Fargo have been extremely supportive in assisting me reach my career goals. They also give a great paid time off package and are understanding when you have a young family
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"My time at Wells Fargo was one that was a difficult change for me coming from a totally different background. The company provided serious training so I was able to perform my job up to expectations. Managemen was hands on and worked with each employee to discuss how to perfect job responsibilities so we could meet or exceed quarterly goals."
good,Be prepared for change the pay is fair and nothing beats the work hours and holidays off. Overall a pleasant place to work.
good,"Audited and reviewed production and compliance reports."
good,"Wells Fargo has been by far the most conservative company I have ever worked for, but regardless, I learned a lot that I took with me to both Pier 1 Imports & Bank of America. Although, I consistently felt as though I was at risk of losing my job, I worked my hardest to ensure I did the right thing. I loved the compensation benefits and the hours. I would work a little extra and get some overtime (this is before they cut down on the overtime hours). I loved the people that I worked with because they all had some kind of experience. I also had the experience of teaching new people as well in a managerial role and learned that management was not for me."
good,"I enjoyed the people, management and the culture. I have no negative words to say about this company"
good,"worked on daily basis on a dialer, great people to work with. hardest part of job had to work with many systems and one monitor, difficult to multi-task within many systems."
good,"I answer any where form 30 to 100 calls a day helping customers out with online issues and other banking needs."
good,Fun place to work. Set schedule is great. Part time employment is also a plus.
good,Very fast-paced with a lot of customer interaction. Lots of sales.
good,Great place to work but I have been here for a while now and would like to see what else is out there.
good,It was awesome helping put the customer in a better financial situation and to see the stress level in their life be gone.
good,"A melhor parte do trabalho foi trabalhar com os clientes, conseguir superar todos os obstaculos que os clientes tinham para realizar seus sonhos em ter sua casa propria."
good,"Scanning insurance health claims"
good,Love the atmosphere would love to continue in the mortgage industry
good,"A lot of what I do involves high levels of teamwork and communication throughout the business. There is a strong sense of teamwork and collaboration between all parties involved, such as managers to underwriters, to closers, to loan officers, and even the customers. It always keeps me on my toes with the different levels of compelxitites and multi-tasking. I am always learning new things and setting goals."
good,"A typical day at work starts with a conference call, or a regional team meeting chaired by our boss, or team meeting with my folks (Branch Managers/Small Business Bankers/Investment specialist). And or a  review of the previous day outstandings, to do list and plan to make up for sales & service goals not met WTD/Previous day."
good,Good communication w staff and dr. it became a close net family
good,"A typical day is standard bank opening procedures, preparing cash and tools needed for the day, greeting customers, processing transactions and assisting customers. I've learned a lot about products banks can offer and how they can benefit people, making sure the customer is satisfied and taken care of. Management is great they are always there to help us 100% of the way, they emphasize teamwork. My co-works have taught me a lot and are also always available  to help.The hardest part is unhappy customers. Working together as a team to solve the problem always helps and over the last seven plus years of customer service experience I've learned how  to deal with unhappy clients and work to make sure any and all problems get resolved as quickly and easily as possible. The most enjoyable part is helping someone out whether it be a loan to get a car, go to school, or simply opening a new account for the first time, building rapport with customers and seeing people leave happy makes my day!"
good,"Working for Wells Fargo taught me about saving, investing, and building personal credit.  I learned to set goals, meet them, and to challenge myself in a friendly atmosphere."
good,"godd benefits. However, sales goal is very high. moreover, you have to work very hard to fullfil all the requirements and sales."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The position of Operations Processor is a great stepping stone into Wells Fargo and the office life.
good,"When negative amortization loans were all the rage, the company did not give in to the temptation to offer those.  That decision, and many others, have left the company in great shape.  Looking out for customers?  Yes.  Looking out for their bottom line?  Always."
good,A typical day at Wells Fargo is structured towards customer service and a sales driven environment. The primary objectives of this position are to provide financial solutions that will benefit customers of all financial backgrounds. Working well in a close team focused environment allows for co-workers to build friendships as well as work well with one another to help achieve the strong sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have successfully helped a customer who is becoming financially sound and understands the benefit of the products and services I have offered or established.
good,"Processing Home Loans:"
good,"I spend my day working with realtors, builders and other bank employees to bring in business. I make sure the dream of owning a home or keeping a home is true for our borrowers"
good,Good company to work for minus the glass ceiling. More employee retention could serve investors well with lower turn over rates and more effective quality productivity with more management cooperation towards employee work/life balance.
good,A typical day for me  is to review my pipeline and work my loan reviews by submission date order. I'm in constant contact with my processors and loan officers to inform them of the status of their loan and possibly any restructuring thoughts to ensure that the borrower is getting the loan that fits their needs. I enjoy putting the customer first in helping them to achieve their dream of home ownership.
good,"The Service manager that I answer to was a very nice and cool guy. He had a plan of what a team should look like and he carried it out. Everyone worked as more than just coworkers, but rather as a team or as a family competing to reach a common goal."
good,"Good place to work, banking benefits are good, co-workers were friendly and the most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible hours."
good,I am on a help desk and answer between 30-40 calls a day. I have been trained in every line of business that is offered on the help desk. I have learned how to be super patient with customers and their needs. My manager is very fair and respectful of my work/life balance. I work 95% of the time from home and have done it for 7 years of my 11 years at this company. They offer great benefits and the work from home program is very beneficial and honestly that has been my reason for staying as long as I have had on the help desk. The hardest and frustrating part for me is the rules always seems to change for being off the phone and being stuck to the desk all day can get very stressful on the body. I enjoy working with users/customers and providing them with the best customer service I can provide. I am just looking in a new career direction and unfortunately this company does not promote that often in this role.
good,"Wells fargo is a good place to work and I enjoy working with some of the people there, especially since I've grown to know some of them as family. There's just a part of me that feels it's time to move on and explore other options."
good,"Each day we look forward to our daily loan assignments.  Many do not lead to misrepresentation, but it is exciting to perform the necessary research when it does."
good,"This is a pretty good place to work if you want to work for a bank but don't want to put in 70+ hours a week. However, that is reflected in both your paycheck and advancement opportunities. Most Wells Fargo employees have been working for the bank more than 5 years and that leads to little to no upward mobility."
good,"selling products "
good,"Wells Fargo has been an enjoyable experience, but from what I can see it is hard to move up without waiting a long time. "
good,"work monday-saturday between the hours of 8-9"
good,I am blessed to be a part of this organisation. I got many opportunities to showcase my talents and skills. 
good,A great place to  work and assist customers with financial goals. Educating customers with credit and banking requirements is very rewarding.I personally believe that my co-workers are the best when it comes down to assisting with goals and identifying customers needs.
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work for their benefits and compensation. They had a diverse working environment and I worked with a lot of great people."
good,"Nice working environment. Overnight shift. Management was pleasant and willing to work with you and listen to any concerns. Really enjoyed working with my co-workers.  Hardest part of the job, it was overnights."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The work flow was poorly managed, and the department received very little respect from other departments with respect to advancement.  The calls were easy, but a few managers jumped to threatening to fire people as a means of motivation"
good,"A Great place to work. I have learnt a lot from the company, Managers, leaders and co-workers. I always got recognized for the good work i did here. "
good,Great place to work. The pace is very fast and lots of overtime. 
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was fun but I felt like need based selling was over looked. They were to focused on the sale and not the customer's true needs to better their financial situation."
good,I learn something new everyday.  I have been part of the management team for over a year.
good,"- Very low walk up customer traffic which leads to difficulties in meeting sales goals"
good,"Ever changing environment, must be able to multi-task. Growing business that constantly changes with the market. "
good,"Wells Fargo was a productive and fun workplace with a lot of exciting incentives each month.I have learned a lot about IRA accounts,my coworkers were team players,the hardest part of my job was learning that my assignment was up and I had to leave the work place,the most enjoyable part of the job was the comfortable atmosphere,my coworkers and mangement "
good,"An FHA appraisal underwriter, completed appraisals would drop into my personal queue for compliance review and value approval. An average day would involve not only the review of several dozen appraisals, but also customer service provided to both internal and external inquiries. I learned the FHA residential appraisal underwriting guidelines as well as how the home's value is determined and supported by the market. The expectation from management was that there be a high output with minimal error. I had a high respect for my co-workers who fostered a friendly and helpful environment. The hardest part of the job was attempting to placate/calm down highly anxious internal department staff (loan officers, processors) who work directly with the client (borrower). Often deadline promises were made by them independently from the  appraisal's approval and as such, an appraisal compliance issue would disallow the loan closing to take place. This would, of course, adversely impact our client yet FHA guidelines cannot be circumvented.  Inversely, there were many times when, as the appraisal underwriter, the closing could take place on time due to extra efforts made to ensure this and thereby becoming the most enjoyable part of the job, enabling our client to move into their new home on time."
good,"Prior to merger with Wells Fargo, Wachovia was focused on customer satisfaction.  We spent our days trying to ensure that our customers could interact with us as they chose: via phone, in-person, online: and have the same experience. Whatever systems/applications that could be shared between our lines of business were shared. I loved the fact that personal initiative was well rewarded."
good,"Wells Fargo PMO was more concerned about forms, processes and procedures than they were with actual project management."
good,"Sales, great tranining ! good co-workers very polite. best part of the job was the co-workers and customers.  "
good,A good company with family values. Met some great people who introduced me to the financial world
good,"The most difficult part of this job is being on the phone constantly. However, there is a great deal of satisfaction when a mortgager's home is saved.  Managers and co-workers are great, and always ready and willing to assist.  My favorite part of the job is the computer work - entering mortgager information into several different applications, and resolving problems when data does not load correctly."
good,"This is a fast paced work environment with a lot of multitasking duties. Helping and coaching tellers and working with other personal bankers in the branch were important components of the job. Taking care of the customers and ""wowing"" them, while meeting high sales quotas can be stressful at times. Managment needs do be reported constantly about daily activities and sale results. Most enjoyable part is the acknowledments of returning customers. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. Needs more leadership support in order to make the jobs and goals obtainable.
good,1. A great place to work.
good,Management wasn't the best. Strict rules with home mortgages. Quite a few irate customers. The management was unwilling to help the team with difficult tasks and wanted to do their own things. Co-workers were a pleasure to work with though.
good,"Professional and healthy work environment, its fun working in wells environment along with the managers and with the teams."
good,The day starts off by logging into our phones to start taking phone calls from borrowers with properties in foreclosure. We service the accounts with all general status information. We provide additional options and help with solutions for the borrowers who have the intent of keeping the property.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"• Research written default inquiries, partnering with other departments such as Wells Fargo legal department, Customer Satisfaction for complete resolution on active and purged loans."
good,Log into phone and begin making phone calls. Be very careful about the tone of voice and language used. Certain phrases are necessary to be said and any variation can cause a written review leading to termination. Push the customer to spend as much money as you are able in order to meet the monetary goals set by upper-management.

good,Was fun working
good,"Typical bank industry. Same daily activities. Process transactions for clients, refer services and products. I learned more about the aspects of banking in general. I absolutely love my co-workers! The hardest part of the job was referring products to clients who were clearly not interested."
good,No two days are ever the same and they have great benefits. Branch managers are very involved with our every day and give great feed back.
good,Wells Fargo is a changing environment and was in the process of going to different ways of completing their tasks.
good,I enjoy WF. I have been there 5 years. I am looking to advance within my career. WF has limitations on advancements and promotions within current role.

good,"I was working through a temporary agency with Wells and overall I enjoyed my job, the work was tedious but it kept you busy and the co workers and management were great!"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Most relationships were forged prior to the various mergers and have been in place for many years.
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to start your career. They offer a decent pay and great benefits. Job advancement is possible if you are sales oriented.
good,Loved the one on one interactions with my clients and the wonderful team environment.
good,I worked as an inside sales representative for wells fargo auto sales. Its a fast paced and goal orientated position that needs complete focus to strive in. Working with customers throughout the nation our goal was to help them with thier financing of vehicles and also had products to help customers better succeed with their financial goals.

good,Like working with Wells Fargo but at the time of displacement felt they overlooked valuable employees
good,"Great start-up region for WFIS in Carolina's. Strong team, minimal overhead per start up production, successful sales growth initiative. Unfortunately the untimely corporate merger resulted in a short lived opportunity."
good,"I did not get to continue after training was provided due to a personal reason. My son had passed away in May of 2010. Other than that, I really enjoyed working for Wells Fargo, they had a good benefit package, great place to work and great people to work with. At the time I couldn't focus on my work that needed to be done, due to my son's passing."
good,"A typical day at work includes completing a minimum of three cases. On a daily basis we receive alerts and referrals indicating possible suspicious activity or an unusual movement of funds. We search internal and external sources and determine if the activity is unusual. If we believe the activity is suspicious, we then write a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). We are also responsible for submitting account closure recommendations to upper management and report findings that we believe are high risk to the bank."
good,Optimistic co workers who always tried to keep up with the rapidly changing company as it transitioned from Wachovia Bank to Wells Fargo
good,Work sometimes starts early and ends late. You have to be a team player because you and your co-workers have team goals that need to be met.
good,Great people within my line of business. I learned a lot and grew professionally.
good,I am responsible for making sure checks are out to customers on time also keeping a clean work area. Customer service skills are also a part of day to day routine.
good,"Good place to work, learned alot from them. Ever changing as the results of the current environment."
good,Most days involve collaborating with sales and operations leaders to identify profit drivers and requisite capacity. Influencing decisions impacting market share and profitability.

good,On the phone
good,"A typical day at work is pretty routine, same stuff day in and day out. I learned how to use their computer system Horizon. My management has always been very personable and tries to be accommodating. Co-workers are many so it is hard to say how they are exactly. Hardest part of my job if doing the same thing for hours on end, I tend to like variation and a challenge. They do try to spice things up now and again with the Fun Bunch putting together meals, games and social activities."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of openening the bank, setting up the tellers with thier goals tasks and cash for the day, interact with the tellers and customers, answer any questions that they might have. Buy/sell cash from vault, order cash. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with all your great customers when they have nothing but good things to say about you, but it can also be the most difficult thing is when they dont."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Helped customers succeed financially! Was expected to cross sell and met quarterly sales and customer service goals!!
good,Great place to work very fair nice co-workers manager is great
good,Not much chance for advancement. Company was more interested in making numbers than employees.
good,"Monitor staff. Answer questions, train on systems and processes, Insure compliance standards were being met. Handel walk in sales for new products and make out bound sales calls and sales presentations off site at prospects location."
good,"Providing options for high value clients while learning creative ways to develop personal relationships within the banking industry. Great place to work and atmosphere that promotes advancement. Though meeting clients needs, while providing them with best financial options can be difficult, the experience you get from banking relationships is very essential for personal financial investments toward saving for the future."
good,Teller
good,"The customers and the coworkers really made the day enjoyable, even when there are down times in the economy and banking seems to be at a low. There are people that can really turn your day around by letting you know how much you helped them and how great your service and care meant to them."
good,"Typical work includes balancing your pipeline for your loans. Call consumers to make sure they are turning in required documents for the refinance loan. I learned about mortgage loans, and more about the banking industry. Management was poor, the turnover for management was steady, so there was always new managers coming in, and then leaving. Co-workers were a joy to work with, and always avilable to assist, if needed. The hardest part of the job is to have consumers comply with submitting all the documents required, if some were needed. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the environment; with a cafeteria located on the premises, there was no reason to leave the campus, and risk being late back from lunch break."
good,It was a great productive enviorent. It was a calm enviorment to work at. I also met alot of people that wasn't in my age group It was very diversed
good,Very good place to work. However it became complicated due to switching departments. Going from talking to 5 people a day to 45 a day within a few months. That was a problem to due to if you moved to different area you wouldn't get bonus for the next month. Enjoyed the learning experience and the training in becoming a great collector
good,Wells Fargo was a good company to work for. There is plenty of opportunities to advacnce.
good,"Stored, retrieved and sorted loan documents for the Heilig-Myers bankruptcy case"
good,"Although it is a great company to work for, it does have it's challenges. Sales goals increase yearly, personal accounts change, which makes it hard for the consumers, and advancement opportunities are there.. If you know the right person."
good,Great place to work. Giving opportunity to work with a great team
good,"I worked in a variety of positions over 8+yrs but in my last posting I cashed checks, took depositis, referred sales over to bankers and I answer clients questions. I learned alot about operations and how to sell to clients. Management could be challenging at times which is typical at most companies. Co-workers were pleasant to work with which helped in terms of job stability. Hardest part of the job is trying to make every customer happy. The most rewarding part about this job is seeing my customers leave with a smile on their face."
good,Competent Leaders
good,-Interacted with customers to help them with their finances.
good,Interacting with customers processing their transactions. Helping customers understand things going on with their account that they may not understand. Fun work environment with co-workers. The hardest part was making sure you stayed in policy and procedures. The most enjoyable part was the customers.
good,"A typical work day include making call. I learned different collection strategies, and loved my co-workers. Everyone knew what their job was and did it. The hardest part was living on edge, not knowing when our department would be displaced. The most enjoyable part was the department gatherings where we took a few moments out of the work day to eat, socialize, and get to know each other."
good,This company is all about sells. If you do not have any sells you will not survive.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Nice office space, nice working environment. The commute to work was fair. The parking was nice because it was free."
good,"Reviewed, researched and analyzed data, transactions in daily basis to prevent loss and detect suspicious activities."
good,Follow policy and procedure.
good,"I Was not happy with my management at the branch, It was alot to do with schedule problems could have been better."
good,"The environment was excellent, but we were only there until the merger with 1st Interstate."
good,"Working for Wells was nice, you had plenty of opportunities to turn a upset customer into a happy camper."
good,"A typical workday involved meetings with clients (conference calls and face-to-face) and diligently working to make sure clients accounts were as they should be and specific client needs were met. I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced, multi-tasking environment, while at the same time keep a level head and facilitate a professional and respectful rapport with clients and fellow employees alike. I worked in a small firm that had a ""family"" feel to it. The hardest part of the job was learning how to delegate tasks. Sometimes I try to take on too much. The most enjoyable part of my job was working closely with our clients."
good,"Enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. Disappointed that office was closed. Expense cuts impacted Milwaukee, St. Louis, Fort Wayne and Louisville offices."
good,"The organization is a typical corporation. It comes down to the bottom line so sales are pushed hard. There is a slight disconnect between upper management and the local branches, but it is to be expected in a corporation that is this large."
good,wells fargo understands the work lfe balance. Good Bank to work for
good,"I enjoyed working for QPS, they have very strong leaders. I was let go and actually wanted to move forward within the company they had me temp for. I would like to find another company with the same opportunities."
good,There are many room to grow and great work space. Sale goal can be a little stressful.
good,Endless opportunity for the right candidate. I was in a sales environment with a strong focus on achieving marketing/sales goals.
good,Wells fargo is a good place to work. They are very flexible with work schedules and have learned a lot while working here.
good,This was a good place to work until like most any other big company it became too focused on pleasing shareholders rather than customers and employees.
good,"I had a good experience in Wells Fargo, they pay it was not that good is underpay compare other bank institution. The culture is very strong and people treat you like family."
good,"Amazing benefits, cant get a decent schedule unless you been there long. Overall best job I have ever had. Will consider going back. Hopefully get a decent schedule."
good,Contact center that consist of mostly inbound calls. It was an overall good experience. Development opportunities for other departments within the same building makes it easy to network.
good,The cons are it’s hard to advance from one position to another. The pay can be more.  The Management team is good with communicating and working with the team members.
good,"Provided administrative support, which included travel arrangements."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I am a teller. It is a fun, sometimes stressful, overall good job with good hours and benefits. Even as a teller there is a lot you need to know and there is always something new."
good,Great company to work for. Many areas to grow and learn. Everyday different. Learned the banking industry and what it takes to maintain and grow the business from a Client Associate perspective. Attending meetings and learning lunches were quite beneficial to learning the job and the clients..
good,Love the fact you can control how much you want to learn about banking policy and procedures  and about the financial industry in general. They provide a plethora of resources you can take the time to read and take courses on your own time.
good,"It was a good job, sometimes I’m"
good,"It's an okay company to work for. I was able to work in different positions and learn new experiences. The culture was okay, I enjoyed some of the people that I worked with and my hours were very flexible."
good,"good work life balance."
good,"Good but demanding place to work.  Cost/margin pressures as in all Banking.  Management turnover creates uncertainty also pressure to move jobs away from NYC to Charlotte, NC to lower costs."
good,"Overall a good place to work. The loan operations center in Boise has a gym and cafeteria, which is a plus! Tons of opportunity to grow if you are willing to put in the work. I've seen so many people move up over the years."
good,"Amazing benefits. I work in a branch, specific work time hours is a huge thing for me. Compensation is not as good compared to before. Salary is ok. Closed on major holidays and that I love."
good,"Management seems a little shaky at times. Otherwise, its a good place for first job, or for a senior role. The entry level jobs don't seem to have much room for growth."
good,"great experience working with such a nice work place."
good,"The work I do in my department is very easy, but it is extremely difficuly for us to get interviews for other departments. There are also a lot of procedural updates that make it hard to complete all of the assigned work."
good,"A typical work day includes reaching out to customers in my portfolio to learn about their business, understand what drives them to do what they do everyday, and also identifying new business opportunities, setting new credit lines, and analyzing clients financial statement to help them with our products and services, with the help of partners in other departments, Treasury management, FX, merchant service and FDIC coverage solutions, etc. to help them succeed financially. I am accountable for maintaining assigned existing business relationship, Manage and work with BDOs in the field to bring in new businesses, negotiating, structuring, approving, and monitoring all types of loans."
good,It's wells fargo so you will get some flack as they don't have the best reputation but the office environment is positive and they treat the employees well.
good,The benefits including health insurance and 401k match are some of the best I have seen anywhere. They also provide a great work life balance with PTO days.
good,I was able to review documents that allowed for the company to have better legal records. I worked with my peers for 8 hours a day reviewing documents and staying on cue.
good,"I would recommend to wok for Wells Fargo, it is a large good company to work for, one thing I didn't like it was difficult to leave retail banking, If an employee achieve and reach expectation you will be promoted withing the retail banking."
good,Management needs to review the new implementation changes over career growth and Internal job movements along with salary bench marking across the same role in the industry.
good,"Mentoring, coaching and providing optimal customer service is a huge part of who I am so being employed with Wells Fargo allowed me to hone those skills and utilize them on various platforms."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,it was a very short project. and the begging stage of the project was too much work and meeting every hour to develop the systems and managers need information frequently
good,The flexibility to deal with life and work at the same time. Understanding from management when you need to take care of your home life during emergencies.
good,"Always be ready to learn, willing to teach new material. management always there for you, when i need in help or answers to any questions. they were a helping hand"
good,While working team captains may come by and sell popcorn or etc to give as a donation to whatever company their trying to help. Work attire is business casual.
good,"It is a great company to work for, management does a great job to make sure the employees know their daily tasks and are able to meet customer banking needs."
good,Great company to work for if you're looking for a stable company with good benefits. They have 16 weeks of parental leave and you start off with vacation time. There's no need to accrue time before a certain amount of time to start taking time off work. Awesome vision and dental benefits. Medical depends on which package you choose. The only downside would be if you don't have a good management team to lean on then it can be a little frustrating. There's also a little favoritism when it comes to moving up but all depends on your manager. Overall its a good place to work with pretty good pay compared to other big banks.
good,"Good company when it comes to benefits . While other areas could use work , over all the company does offer great benefits for employees and the customers"
good,Good place to work.  They were understaffed at the time I worked there.  Compensation was on the low end for the work performed.  Management was good but I felt I knew more and had more management experience then they had.  I was underemployed there.
good,They have good benefits and ok pay...there can be time that they dont always value their team members but they are a good job to work for and they do treat people ok!
good,great company to work for only negative thing is hours of operation i'm a full time college student and high school football coach so my schedule sometimes conflict
good,"hard to advance in company, interview is based on answers to questions with no recognition on skills or achievements. Company itself is great but advancement makes it discouraging"
good,I enjoyed the work environment. Management lacked fair communication. Upper management positions don't open often. Great position for customer service. Good job security. Fair benefits.
good,Had a good run at WF. Nothing bad to say. more opportunity for advancement would be the ticket for staying at Wells. There was a lot of turnover at wells during my tenure.
good,"Focusing on customer service and acquisition is crucial for success."
good,"Wells Fargo's culture is very diverse and it is a culture of inclusion. The best minds from all backgrounds come together to use their talents. There is a high demand for excellence. Productivity, securing the customer and the business is the number one priority."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo I was able to connect with other organizations to help business clients with credit card processing and cash flow issues. The culture has changes and continues to change for the better, but with changes comes adjustments."
good,I enjoyed my time working there. 2 food courts on site with free parking. It is a bit packed through give the site size and the flex cube system has its flaws.
good,"Typical large financial institution.  Difficult to be a difference maker, but easy to come to work and do your job and go home.  Culture is fine, but it is easy to get lost amongst the many."
good,"I was at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. It was OK. It was a job when I needed one, and there was an opportunity to help people to keep their homes. I worked there during the height of the housing crisis. The biggest downside was the fact that there was a great deal of chaos going on at the time, and it made the workplace a bit chaotic."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It's a corporate environment.  Decisions are given from the top.  Overall it is a good experience.  If you're a ""go-getter"" it can be rewarding and fulfilling if you adopt a positive attitude, but, will ultimately be influenced by your immediate environment, management, and customers.  Most district managers I've worked with are very supportive.  The company offers great benefits and better than average work/life balance."
good,My regional coach was great but we licensed people are under the supervision of a branch manager who doesn't really understand what we do as licensed advisors. This is not ideal. Salaries seem fair. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want.
good,"Good branch atmosphere "
good,"My team members are the reason I went to work every day. They made it easy for me to do my job. Good benefits, incentives, and PTO. Overall Wells Fargo is a good company to work for."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work. Since the transition, I believe the company has listened to its employees and pays more attention to clients actual needs."
good,"Easy to learn something,"
good,The experience was very good learned alot regarding IRA accounts. Customer Service was very important.  Some simple questions from the customer and you had your customers that needed to know the answer immediately
good,"Managers all they care about is themselves and don’t care if someone has a family, they want you to work extra hours and schedule you like you don’t have a life.."
good,"A working day at wells fargo is filled with expectation, challenges, learning and excitement, i gained lots of expirience as a scrum master with this organization plus the management is flexible, and collaborative. the hardest part of my job was at the beginning when i was still starting out, had to gain some skills such as accountability and reporting and they have the culture of giving basic training to their new employees, the best part of my job was during the sprint review( DEMO) whereby something new  is being demonstrated. wells fargo is place to be"
good,Great place to work but there is always a layoff season.  They try their best to keep who they can as I missed three layoffs.  My layoff was due to the overflow location closing as we supported another location.
good,"Learned new skills, interesting work assignments, technology very advanced, remote opportunity, self paced, great managers, great team, quiet work environment"
good,I worked there for almost 3 years and I felt like I was stuck I stayed a 20 hour teller when I wanted to be promoted. I did have issues with management. Between managers they had lack of communication and they would make things personal other than professional. Working hours were great but my dilemma was I needed more hours. I was a very good worker but I felt my work went unnoticed
good,"Great communication between processors, underwriters and second level underwriters. Recognition of talent and hard work. The environment is good to work at."
good,"All of the people were great to work with. I enjoyed the team atmosphere, but there were no challenges on the day to day and it gets boring. At first, the work was interesting in learning all of the processes but after a while it became dull."
good,"WF does not mention that in order to advance in your career or transfer to a different departmnent, you MUST move if you live in MO or KS. Not many opportunities for Tellers."
good,"My manager was supportive, inspirational and a great communicator. I was able to build relationships across the larger marketing organization and the sales teams I supported. Those relationships granted me permission to recommend and execute outside the box programs to help sales meet their revenue goals. It was a great partnership!"
good,Good environment and great coworkers. Managed Merchant Services team for inside sales. Downtown location great access to restaurants and shops. Fun Job
good,"Life in general is stressful but they make it much more stressful than it needs or should be."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Please note, I was actually pretty kind & generous with my scoring or “star evaluation”.  "
good,Wells Fargo was a nice place to work - I worked there for nine years and never had an issue - left to make more money in the industry - they do a lot of training and keep everyone updated
good,Good chance for advancement.  Upper management too involved in daily work.  Micro management.   Did not allow branch manager to make his/her own decisions concerning sales goals.
good,Gotta learn everything fast and long training process and be sure to move quickly usually super busy everyday. Have patience and always be sure to ask questions when in doubt
good,Typical day would be coming in to assist phone banker needs. Checked in with supervisor to verify section required for assistance. Answered escalated calls and phone banker questions regarding customers accounts.
good,"Wells was an enjoyable place to work since individuals at the firm are most very approachable and down to earth. A typical working will involve morning meetings, number crunching, conference calls with larger group, personal chats with team members neighbors etc. The hardest part of the job is probably trying to convince mid-level and upper management on investing into new technology."
good,"-Well Fargo is a good place to work and improve skills"
good,"Wells Fargo is a very fair company and a strong organization.  They have a well organized cohesive sales culture.  They provide all the tools needed to be successful with your job.  There is opportunity for advancement within Wells Fargo if you work hard and push for promotion.  The benefits at Wells Fargo are also exceptional compared to competition (401K max to 6%, full medical, generous PTO, etc.).  Wells Fargo is also a very diverse company and hires people from all walks of life."
good,"I was hired as an external consultant BA in the PMO office. I noticed people who were unqualified making decisions that the knowledge required was so basic, like databases, offering solutions that disregarded simple but fundamental principles of database design. The analyst in charge of my project didn't know the difference between hierarchical and relational databases. I observed people keeping quiet, to keep their job, and not object to the boss's opinion. Hopefully, as more women climb up the corporate latter, there will be more freedom for different views and more open discussions from various sides and angles...The out-of-the-box thinkers will get a chance to flourish and once again, it will be back on track."
good,"It was an okay place to work for. Bottom line though, it is a big Corporation and it likes to act like it cares about employees but we all know we are just a number to them. I Feel like they care when it is convenient for them, or have found themselves in a lawsuit."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was a great experience. The company takes care of their employees. Training is there when it is needed. As long as you do your work and show up, you will have job security."
good,Management was great at Wells Fargo.  Really caring great training.  I was on a team that Wells Fargo only hired by contract for 18 mos at a time.  You have the option to come back 6 mos after your last day to work another 18 mos as a temp.  There was a little confusion about how much the different temp agencies paid mine was quite low
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work, very diversed in culture. Great mission. Customer satisfaction was the goal. The dress code was casual and comfortable."
good,"I would contact small business owners with existing Wells Fargo checking accounts to offer Merchant Services."
good,"I think the culture is great and the executives now are taking the allegations seriously, but upper management are still shady.  I even called the ethics hotline and they researched it and found out I was correct and did nothing about it.  Total joke! As management you have a lot of tasks to complete so you stay extremely busy especially if you are a service manager.  They take on a lot of the work.  I even had a district manger say it was one of the hardest jobs-so true. Bonus is fair, but a lot can do with how your boss evaluate you so don't burn that bridge.  They celebrate birthdays and really try to help you promote to the next step with training which is great!"
good,I was a little upset with how they terminated me after coming back from bereavement when losing my baby  other than that I loved the team I was part of and there was always fun events going on that challenge and motivated us to succeed
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for.  They take good care of their employees and provide great benefits and other services.  The only negative i have to say is that they are becoming a little too focused on metrics and not the quality of services.
good,"Was laid off after 16 years, which was rough. Benefits were great and I always had wonderful managers. Job advancement was a little difficult in the marketing world however."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It is a fast pace heavy phone work environment.  You need to think quick on your feet and research within your database to make accurate decisions to provide to your customers.
good,"Great place to work very friendly coworkers. Aramark is who I worked for not Wells Fargo. Aramark is the catering company at the Wells Fargo center and the ball fields. Its a union job payes at union scale after 27 events. Face paced great management, hardest part if items were not thawed, the people working around you great chefs took time to not only show you how but explain why."
good,"Wells Fargo Bank is an ok company to work for but managers hire whoever they like instead of the most qualified candidate, some of the positions become available but there's always so much favoritism that is pointless."
good,"Work is hard most days. "
good,"The work-life balance at Wells Fargo was difficult for managers. Most like me were in charge of compliance and the teller line and that required close to 65 hours a week of time. There were a lot of sacrifices made by managers in terms of family time, and there was always sales pressure on the retail bankers. To say the job was fast-paced, competitive and a little stressful would be putting it mildly."
good,Accommodating place to work at if you’re a student but if management know your lack of interest of getting promoted then they will try to get rid of you
good,Great place to work. Co-workers are really friendly and our customers are pretty great. It's a small branch in a small town so we get a lot of regulars and get to build awesome relationships with them.
good,"A lot of opportunity for growth. Entry level positions provide quick advancement to focused, engaged and dedicated individuals. 1 year commitment before you’re allowed to post out to another department."
good,Good place to work and great people.  The  only issue was being promised the ability to move closer to home and them taking it back once in the position.
good,"It's very easy to find friends here. Everyone wants to get along and wants to help each other. I felt very welcome when I first arrived. However, lately I have been having a medical hardship. The company itself has done more than I believe any other corporation or company ever would, but it seems the people I interact with each day could use some sensitivity training. I'm technically living with an invisible disability that impacts my ability to make it in to work every day, and my coworkers don't seem to be very happy with me. I understand there is more work when I am not around, but it would be nice to know they are considering the fact that I'm hurt more by my missed days than they are. I have to live with the reduced income and fear of losing my job every day, along with the depression of my body just not doing what it should. I also feel the managers are meant to pressure those suffering into trying to work more than they can, at least this is the pressure I have been feeling. I even had one of my managers tell me to not take advantage of my FMLA as if using it when I need it was a bad thing. There could be some sensitivity training all around in this company to the many different invisible ailments that keep some from being able to work."
good,They don't give nor have the proper tools to do the job effectively.  People are overwhelmed with work and don't have time to train new people. Thank you!
good,"I have been lucky to work with great group of people. "
good,It was a nice work place in the administration side. Team work was excellent. Benifits were good and they do special things for the employees and activities.
good,The leadership is great and encourages a work life balance. But the overall company does not have an innovative work environment. Slow paced and 8-10 years behind in tools and technology.
good,I have been trying since I was hired to get full-time at my own branch. A few months back I started applying to other locations but still have not gotten a full-time position because there are so few openings for the number of applicants.
good,Throughout the day there is a variation of appointments and walk-ins that make up the customer interaction. There is a strict adherence to policy with every interaction to ensure the risk protocol is met.
good,I had a great experience at Wells Fargo.  Culture was great and everyone seemed very supportive and FTE's or full time employee's paternal leave was respected while he took a month off.  I would recommend Wells Fargo to anyone looking to work in the Finance space.
good,"During busy hours, helped with constant stream of customers with financial needs"
good,If management was more together and would fight for the employee when needed it would be nice and the pay needs to be better.they are not up to par with pay meaning they ask for more work but they dont compensate for the added work.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I don't have many things to say about the company. I enjoyed my time there. The benefits were great, my team was great, and it was unfortunate that our entire department was laid off."
good,"On a typical day i would review and process full file loans which were purchased from other banks. I performed an extended mortgage loan review, including, but not limited to; Credits and Liabilities, Income, Assets, Verification of Employment, and Citizenship."
good,"They pride themselves in promoting within company which is completely true. I had a great experience starting as a Teller, moving up to Customer Service and Being offered a position as a Personal Banker. The only downside is the Pay"
good,"I loved the job, just wish it was permanent. Great people, great environment. Easy work load. I got the job thru Talent Bride Staffing Agency. Would work for Wells Fargo in future should an opportunity arise."
good,"I don't really have a good or bad review to give so I am choosing to not say anything, this was a separate department from the bank and is no longer part of Wells Fargo."
good,"I loved my job had great benefits and a wonderful team. My direct supervisor taught me so much, gave me the freedom to do the things she taught me, run the teller line and prepare to advance. When she was promoted her replacement slowly stripped me of all my responsibilities and as I struggled to recover from an injury, instead of supporting me, she did everything possible to make things worse, eventually forcing me out."
good,"Great company to work for. However, some markets are stale and don't allow for quick advancement. You have to be comfortable where you are and wait for the right opportunity to come up."
good,its a great company to work for if you want to build your financial career. they are very flexible with your days off and most of the time approve pto when requested
good,"This new Wells Fargo Era is really good, NO SALES, just customer service centric. What I don't like and is getting really stressful is that our management has been hiring a lot of lazy people. What do I mean by this? "
good,I prefer not to provide a detailed review of Wells Fargo at this time due to the organizational changes that are ongoing as well as the myriad of legal issues and negative publicity that the company is still experiencing in the media.
good,"Time management is vital to performance. Performance reports support the business initiatives and drive the results on the agent level. All are rewarded fairly for their  contributions,"
good,"I met some of the nicest professionals at Wells Fargo and stay in contact with a former manager of mine, as well as, internal business partners.  "
good,"great company to work for very supportive good training provided good leads. Loan processing  was slow at the time I was there."
good,than ky you for the time it took me to do this and really have zero benefit to helpping me find a future job again thank you. i couldnt figure out a way around it so really i am giving no good or bad comments
good,"Managed mortgage loan underwriting and loss mitigation  operations. Process a variety of home loan mortgage documentation duties on VA, FHA, and Conventional loans."
good,great opportunities to move up the ladder. been with the company 9 years and 6 positions later. wouldn't change it for the opportunities that I've had.
good,"Wells was a great place to work and has longevity it your willing to moving to stay with the company. They often close and open new locations, or  restructure so I was never comfertable in a location for more than 5 years.   I was laid off twice at Wells Fargo, I was offered other positions if I was willing to move to Utah and then North Carolina. But they do promote from with in most time and do coach up and train."
good,company strives to improve its reputation.  many changes in short period of time.  not always in the best interest of the team members.  Benefits and comp are great.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The overall experience working there was fine, it was very busy so there wasn't ever a full moment however my particular Branch Manager wasn't a very pleasant person or manager she was very mean, angry, and spiteful. I honestly hope never to work with that manager ever again unless I'm willing to get an ulcer."
good,Everyone seemed nice when no recruits started their training classes. All info was available to make sure job could be done correctly. Systems where easy to understand.
good,Wells Fargo's working environment is very comfortable. The company allows you to develop in your skills and grow. Every shares the same vision and reaches for that goal every day in dealing with their customers and team members. Management is supportive and helpful when you need them to be. Hardest part is dealing with a lot of changes and obtaining the knowledge of those changes in a short amount of time to be able to explain and project it in a way the customer or team members will understand. Most enjoyable part is being able to develop and learn more in a position that will create an opportunity for you to move up.
good,Most people within my floor were very friendly and professional to work with.  We celebrated holidays and personal achievements. My manager was willing to work with team mates when personal time needed for family.  And she was always available even outside work hours.
good,"I do manager a team of 15 people and everyday I help to answer questions and give advice to them. Conduct team meetings, coach, and offer weekly 1 on 1 on performance"
good,A typical day at work is fast pace but able to get the job done in a timely manner.  Able to work with management and  co workers in a family setting.
good,It was a productive day at work.  We were sometimes offered different schedules that we can bid on.  They reduced quite a lot of Collection sites to just three hubs.  Lots of employees lost their jobs if they were not able to relocate.  Seats were moved quite often and they changed our supervisors without not much notice.  The pay was really good and so were the benefits.  401k was 100% match and we were given free stocks.  Wells Fargo has a bad reputation and this was the hardest part about working for them.  They tried to improve transparency.
good,I worked as a mortgage underwriter for 2.5 years and left to accept employment elsewhere closer to home;   I enjoyed my time there and with few exceptions my direct managers were supportive and flexible.   The benefits are top notch
good,"I loved what I do at wells, just don’t feel appropriated. I feel like as if I’m not in the position to advance at Wells Fargo unless I’m trained in different departments. It’s definitely harder to be cross trained at Wells Fargo versus my previous employer."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo depends on the location, some branches you my not want to leave, some you wanna run away from. Its an amazing companies to work for. The managers just have to be good."
good,"Many at Wells Fargo that I interfaced with were excellent to work with."
good,"Wells Fargo Bank is a very large corporation with divisions spanning many disciplines."
good,"I liked my job and the customers. I also loved our district manager. Bad thing is, once I had to take off for my brother in law passing I was treated unfairly and had to request to be transferred. That December I had to have surgery and work was not wanting to allow me to take off work, I again was upset. Then I ended up leaving due to my surgery."
good,Wells Fargo was a stepping stone for me! But of course many people can stay and make Wells Fargo their long life work. Interesting place to be learned a lot and helped the employee to achieve their goals. Overall good place to work
good,"Overall I really enjoy working at Wells Fargo.  Outside of recent upper level management changes the company has been a great place to work. I can work from home full-time, it has great work life balance, 28 days of PTO + banking holidays, and it has a career path filled with promotions. The only downside is the compensation. Standard 2% - 3% raises per year unless you apply and move to another position within the Bank."
good,I enjoyed working with the team; very resourceful. Knowledge base Well Fargo has great tools to make work easy and for training. Working and going to school was easy
good,"Good company to work for: "
good,Not much career growth but great stability. The only career path is within the current role with limited transferable skills. Not much turnover in management.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I showed up in Pittsburgh, and got hired the same day. They issued me a WF security guard badge, uniform, a S&W model 10 revolver, some .38 rounds, and a Chevy S-10 Blazer SUV. (I had to return it every Sunday night after my tour) If I recall, it had the Wells Fargo logo on it, and a red pancake light for the dash that made more noise than the engine when you plugged it in. I worked a 12 hour Sunday shift patrolling a few miles of mountain trails leading up a mountain to the top of some mine shaft in Wampum PA. They were truly goat trails and at night it was a little creepy. They were polishing some big lenses for a telescope inside the mine shaft. My only connection for check-in was a landline phone inside a construction trailer. Other than the creepy night patrols, it was pretty docile which included plenty of down time for a little school work."
good,"What you get from working at Wells Fargo is what you put in.  You’ve got to know your goals and limitations.  What you lack can be made up with proper training and hard work.  If you attained what you believe to be adequate qualifications and you are not being rewarded , then take your talents somewhere else."
good,It was very monotonous work same thing everyday.  I did get to listen to music and books on tape which was a plus. I did get to go outside on my breaks. The lighting was hurtful for my eyes
good,Wells Fargo is a typical large employer. Great culture - loved my team members but a lot of bureaucracy that was hard to get through. Benefits are better outside of branch.
good,Great benefits and good team to work with. Good amount of vacation/sick time all holidays off. paid time off with paternity leave and or death of a family member. great retirement package.
good,"Worked here several years ago. Had to leave when WF Financial shut down. "
good,This can be great place to work for if you are one of those people that will not take no for an answer and will keeping calling until customer says yes to open a new account
good,why hiring is soo hard  and  i heard they only hire base on your credit score. you'll need to be fair in the hiring and let others get a chance to get hire
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with the customer's, helping them out and learning new thing's everyday!"
good,"The workplace culture was great.  Being a contractor, there was very little room for autonomy and the schedule was very regimented.  The management team was located in another state, so at times there was a lack of communication."
good,Sales goals were crazy when i worked there but everything other than that i really could not complain about. A very organized company. The benfits were also excellent with a 6% 401k match.
good,"Senior management at Wells is very supportive of its team members, and in spite of what is heard in the media, Wells is an amazing place to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job I do is the interaction I get to have with team members, and the implementation of a groundbreaking learning & development program for Wells.  I have learned much about experiential learning and how it differs from practical training.  I appreciate Wells' commitment to bettering the customer experience."
good,Always something new to learn. Everyone who I was surrounded with were with were super helpful and encouraging. I would definitely come back and starting working with Wells Fargo again!
good,I like the company as a whole. I bank with wells and overall a great experience. I worked there for 8 years. Many great opportunities. Nice people and team players.
good,"A good fit for me regarding my experience with the mortgage side of the banking business. The campus is really big with a professional environment. The position kept me busy which I was satisfied with. "
good,"They compensate you well for what job you're doing. Stay in your lane though.  Reducing delinquency is your goal, but for whatever reason their main concern is starting out of the news, customer service is key but they allow customer to steer the direction of your goal."
good,"I enjoy the work that I do. I enjoy working with the bankers, insurance agents & the customers. I enjoy working with the members of my team. I enjoy my Team Lead & Manager."
good,Did not work long enough to form an opinion. Resigned to pursue other options. During the time I was employed there was an unusual amount of pressure to open accounts and sell services.
good,"Great company to work for "
good,"Fast paced work, process deposit, research information for clients.  Friendly environment, really enjoyed the co-workers and management. Hardest part of the job was making sure trades were executed within seconds, most enjoyable part of the job were the people in my department."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"You work very hard, follow the requirements and you'll do fine.   I do not have anything further to say relating to this review.  You have a typical day at work, you learn about your position."
good,WF has afforded me the opportunity to work independently and to advance my career while providing a good work/life balance.  Job displacement 8/2018 resulted in job loss.
good,"Wells Fargo workplace culture has greatly improved. It is a fast paced workplace, but rewarding. The management I was under needed more training to be an effective manager. I would go back to working for Wells Fargo if the opportunity presented itself."
good,Wells Fargo is a large organization. Heavy on bureaucratic procedures makes it very slow to adopt any bleeding edge technologies.  Good work life balance and a lots of opportunities to grow within the organization.
good,Lots of red tape and old ways of thinking.  Proprietary systems are very out of date and frequently go down.  Because the company is so large they silo off many functions so your job function and skill set is very limited unless you continue to move to different departments which can prolong your monetary advancement and levels of leadership.
good,"Great career advancement. Need to get more structured in management and making sure branch runs smoothly. "
good,"A great place to work and better if you have a good manager. "
good,Wells has a unique culture in certain LOBs in that internal politics can play a significant role in well you can do your job.  Departments can often have performance goals that complete with other departments working on the same project resulting in different priorities within the same project team.
good,"The internship taught me abundantly on the environment of commercial banking. I learned about cold calls, credit analysis, revolving lines of credit, and other metrics that Wells Fargo utilizes in providing companies and customers alike with top quality banking resources."
good,A typical day as a customer service rep for wells was on the phone constantly until you were promoted to where you were able to work on harder tasks like taxes and escrow. The public sentiment on wells was extremely negative when I worked there and answering 70 phone calls a day from people that dont like you caused many coworkers to burn out quickly.
good,I would recommend working for Wells Fargo because they do have alot of core values that are important in the corporate world. They regard family time just as important as work time.
good,"Migrating to an agile environment in a high risk banking application is never easy but it was an exciting and challenging assignment."
good,Client oriented bank focused on both external and internal success. Company offers various avenues to expore other opportunities within the bank and encourages employees to seek job diversity.
good,"Fun work atmosphere, strong work life balance, good pay, excellent benefits, advancement opportunities, relocation options. Collections can have stressful moments and meeting or exceeding goals requires effort."
good,"Early morning through mid afternoon were usually fairly busy.  Later in the afternoon, things were normally pretty quiet.  Limited opportunities to advance was the main reason that I left the company"
good,"its a very fun place to work at. my workday starts at 9:am. after settling in, i go for a brief standup meeting which recaps yesterday, plan today and forecast tomorrow. then i go back to my cube and start doing what i like best ( running scripts and troubleshooting errors) while looking closely at the SLA document and staying within it limits as much as possible. by 5 pm i sign out for the day and return home always with a smile on my face."
good,They pay well and offer plenty of room for advancement and rewards. And have decent PTO and holidays. They also have awards for a job well done. They do have a poor work life balance at times but also offer remote work.
good,This was a fun workplace that prided itself on team effort and creating the best customer experience.  Sometimes the job would drag when it was slow and the branch I particularly worked at had quick and frequent turnover with managers so it was difficult to maintain consistency and have managers available.
good,"Overall, Wells Fargo is a great place to work. Like any job, when poor management comes into play it can completely ruin your experience. The pay is fair and it was a great learning experience for me."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people better their financial situation. A typical day at work is going thru documents and making sure clients know what we need in order to help them.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The workplace culture was fun and enjoyable.The company had great health benefits and always placed family first. The hardest part of the job was the constant change in sales goals and inconsistency with policy.
good,Teller and customer service duties in the bank. I enjoyed meeting my customers and making sure their needs were met. They also are very friendly with days you need to take off for your daily life balance as well.
good,"For the TLDR, see the pros and cons. Wells Fargo has one of the best training regimens for its staff. However, once you are active in your role, a strict sales goal that must be adhered to, in addition to apathetic management will ensure that you will see a very bleak future before too long."
good,"They allowed most of the team to work remote which was great.  As time went on, US based developers seemed to be replaced with offshore folks.  The company had a policy of trying everything possible to send work to India before spending $ local which seemed a bit un-American."
good,"Wells Fargo is like any other big corporation where Pros and cons exist for employees. In general, the work atmosphere is a good one, but certainly can be stessful at times. "
good,"I was a personal banker while at Wells Fargo, it was a very competitive work environment while everyone was trying to hit their daily goals. I did learn a lot about finance and balancing the risk and returns of your credit and money."
good,lack of training for advancement was the main issue.  There was a lot of work and it was very fact paced.  The pay was definitely equal to the amount of work required.
good,Wells Fargo Overall taught me a lot. Learning to assess the need of customers was a main focus. Ability for promotions an job training for advancement are available at the tips of your fingers. Great entry level positions available to open the door to the banking and financing industry.
good,"Days can be busy or slow. You learn a lot about different processes for money, checks, banking, payments, loans, credit cards etc. "
good,"great manager, worked on a database and received work from email. I worked with the lines of businesses who ordered appraisals and the department i worked in placed request for proposals out to vendor who would then bid on the jobs. I would then award the job once our internal appraiser would instruct me to. I was also selected to participate in new data base testing and then train our internal appraisers, which we also referred to a Job Managers."
good,"Typical day was reviewing book of business to uncover potential sales opportunities and manage the portfolio of clients."
good,"Wonderful Technical Teams. With lot of linear growth for people to enrich their skills. Too many meetings sometimes, yet productive at the end of the day"
good,"Terrible pay compared to it's competitors. Other than that \, this company truly values their employees and has great career growth programs available."
good,Enjoyed working as a contractor at Wells Fargo. It was a nice work environment and I loved my manager! I learned several skills I took to my next position.
good,I enjoy coming to work and taking what I learned to accomplish my daily tasks. I enjoying working with my team and the workplace culture here is wonderful.
good,"A great company to work for. Excellent work place culture, they treat you like an adult. You are responsible for yourself. Need time to network and possibly get a mentor. Overall score 8 out of 10"
good,"-Management for my team was exceptional! My team's manager really understood and cared for everyone on the team, which made work life balance the best it could be! I felt absolutely comfortable talking to my manager about any issue and was never afraid to speak my mind. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo has great benefits and give a VERY generous amount of PTO. The pay is pretty decent as well. However, there is a lot of micro managing as well."
good,"I loved being able to work independently here. And it was quiet and easy to concentrate. Loved the daily food  trucks, cafeteria selections, and Kaldi's Coffee!"
good,"The work place culture is very competitive, due to it being easy to advance. I started as a teller so the next career step would typically be lead teller and so on."
good,Decent job. Didn’t see myself working here for a long time.  Not a career job in my opinion.  Great and fun environment when it came to my co workers.
good,"teamwork was the best part - lots of motivation to achieve goals in each office, great team atmosphere, many resources for employees to gain knowledge"
good,Nice to meet new clients and help them with their financial needs. Sales goals were a bit extreme especially if you were working at a branch in a small town.
good,"I always wanted to retire at Wells Fargo Advisors, I worked at Money Towers Smith Barney for 11 years before being recruited to Wachovia Securities , now Wells Fargo Advisors. I spent the next 9 years at the Syracuse branch. I was involved in a high net worth advisor team and helped them grow their business expedentially while i was becoming more advanced in my practice. I had a very good job, but it was difficult to be in an environment with some people in charge that were not abiding by the HR policies and rules, for four years, i endured at least 6 individuals not acting fairly towards me. not only for myself but for a large group of others, who all ended up no longer employed in our office. I had been a senior executive assistant for over 21 years and I wasnt able to endure the work enviroment and it was taking a toll on my performance and my life.  At the time, my husband died as well... so my life had taken some dramatic turns and I ventured away to start my own company. I have three companies now. I am a personal trainer, interior painter and housekeeper for wealthy."
good,it's really a friendly environment. people even not job related are very nice. the  deepest impression  is that  everyone from my floor works so hard. one of the managers always shows up very early.
good,I held a temporary position at Wells Fargo through The Palmer Group.  I worked for great managers.  Enjoyed my time there.  I would recommend for my friends to apply.
good,"There were some great perks working within the operation center such as very cheap lunch food that had a fair quality which helped lower overall costs on employees. The culture was acceptable but when working in close proximity with others for hours every day did pose problems with petty concerns, such as heating and cooling (hundreds of computers need to be cooled due to the longevity of their respective operation) could cause issues with certain employees that spilled over to everyone else. Management was fairly good at taking everybody's concerns but petty politics and ""cliques"" did seem to emerge, taking away from what I would call a good place to work. I would highly recommend working for Wells Fargo be it inside a banking location or operation center, be it you can face the mundane problems that are affiliated with most places of work."
good,"Working remote so it's hard to comment on office culture. Not much support from the existing team. It seems like they've gotten faster than they can grow their staff to support it. Great place to be if you are into security, i,.e. CISSP, Splunk, etc"
good,Fun atmosphere. Management is collaborative and understanding. Great team environment. Great benefits and 401k is good with a generous company match. Good work environment
good,"Highly dependent on team/management, great experience overall. Worked with some amazing people, however management understanding of core processes was lacking."
good,"While working for Wells Fargo I've learned a lot, from cash handling to setting up customers with banking products that will benefit their financial needs. Management was very helpful when needed and worked around great co workers that wanted everyone to succeed. I enjoyed my time spent because helping customers become successful with their finances was a passion of mine."
good,"Great place to work for but when sales incentives were removed and replaced with Team bonuses, several of the employees did not give through in going above and beyond for the customer. Therefore having some employees work harder than others."
good,The Wells Fargo Operations Center is a great place to work if you don't mind the call center atmosphere.  It was my first desk job and I quickly realized that environment wasn't for me.  I didn't like the lack of personal interaction or movement throughout the day.  Just sitting in one spot taking constant calls was not enjoyable for me.  The wage is great and the training is extensive.  Very friendly and welcoming office.
good,wells fargo was a fun job to work at while it lasted great learning opportunity working with others fun group activities to meet other peers all well.
good,Great job but the company is downsizing and there is a lot of competition for currently posted positions. They are trying to change the culture of the company and the direction it is going. More for lending
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work. I've been with the company for 12 years. During that time, I've met many wonderful people and learned a lot about the banking industry. I am grateful for my time with the company."
good,A great place to work with many opportunities for learning and growth. Extremely competitive. Good job work/life balance. The hardest part about working here is the sheer numbers of fellow employees being laid off.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I have held a number of positions at Wells Fargo and up until my latest position I have been fairly pleased with my time at the company. The work environment is very team oriented and the company does a wonderful job of implementing career plans with team members and the managers help with achievement towards their goals.
good,Enjoyed my time with the bank.  Very good management and business direction.  The regulatory environment can be overwhelming but that probably applies to most large banks.
good,involvement in company functions are the key to exposing yourself to potential promotions. Using the verbage  from the vision and values and goals mission is also he connection to management profession
good,at Wells Fargo they were a great place to work for I was with them for over 5 years enjoyed coaching and training the team members one of the best training programs I have seen in a long time.
good,Great if you have never had a job with lots of benefits or paid time off.    Wells Fargo does have a way of stifling certain people and not others. The pay is fair.
good,Branch was a high volume  that made the day go by faster. Customers were friendly and a pleasure to work with. Fast pace environment with several great locations
good,Nice building and facilities. Terrible traffic. Managers who care about the people working with and for them. Committee's created to allow for fun and comraderie.
good,"Wells Fargo treated me very well. I really do believe it makes a difference who your manager is and the culture of the department. I had great pay, great benefits, and managed a great team. I would highly recommend a position in Credit Consumer Solutions."
good,"Job is very easy, not very hard at all especially if you have previous banking or call center experience. The workplace culture is very laid back and friendly. Supervisors are down to earth and personable. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the schedule but it works for me currently where I am in life. I also feel pay could be a bit more based upon my experience but from my understanding for this position everyone starts at the same and it's non-negotiable (at the time I was hired anyway...)."
good,Because of strenuous compliance and regulatory requirements pace of change in IT is pretty slow. Though new technology is tested implementing new tech takes a lot of time to complete testing before use.
good,Very laid back work environment and very friendly co-workers but not very fond of management as they were a very tight circle and if you were not in that circle there was no chance for advancement.
good,When I worked at Wells Fargo there was a lot of stress and high sales pressure tactics being used. Wells Fargo has changed since then and I can not speak on it since I left the company before the changes came.
good,"Wells Fargo offers great benefits, 401K matching up to 6%, and do offer competitive salaries.  However, managers are generally not invested in their team members development."
good,Given a task and was free to develop solution as I saw fit with light handed review of code by supervisors. Other personal were generally available to answer questions.
good,"Companies has been thru a lot of changes last 2 years, Growth and advancement has gotten even harder at my level. Companies announced it will reduce staffing 5-10% over the next 3 years."
good,There is a lot of teamwork and cooperation between different departments. Experience at Wells Fargo was very good. Unfortunately my position was eliminated.
good,Worked a part time back office job for several years. Great thing about Wells Fargo is that you receive Full health benefits and PTO even as a part timer. Pay was decent. They offered differential for all employees working after 4pm. No adv opportunitites though. Management and morale was subpar.
good,"•	Preparing for internal and external based audits on pipeline functionality"
good,"It was one of my first professional jobs and it taught me a lot of what I know today in sales and customer service. They had an amazing training program from what I can remember. I've been through a few different companies since Wells Fargo and they, by far, had one of the best structured training programs."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I have not worked at this company in several years. However, at the time of my employment, Wells Fargo had a very open and welcoming feel. I enjoyed working for the company."
good,"Wells Fargo is full of very helpful resources that you can take advantage off to grow, learn, and really get ready to take your next step away of the company or stay with Wells Fargo in a different “family”."
good,"Great place to work, management has been fantastic, I am just looking for career advancement to help expand my knowledge and apply my current variation of skills in a more advanced role."
good,"Teller positions are diamonds in the rough. They require almost nothing as far as minimum requirements, and offer quite a bit in the way of compensation. The only downside is that the professional atmosphere and history/culture of banking obfuscates the realization that it’s still retail."
good,It paid at the time $9.00 an hour and that was enough to get by but now with the increase in the cost of living within the economy and certain communities I would like to make a little more to accommodate my living expenses.
good,"Working here exposed me to the banking and financial world. I appreciated the experience of banking I received like loans, credit cards, checking and savings accounts, line of credit, etc."
good,Read email print pipeline and work from close date onward. I enjoyed my co workers and mgrs. switched very often so that did add stress and make me feel as though I never wanted to be in mgmt. for that reason.
good,my typical day as a consultant included going in and working on various OFAC screening sanctions projects. Management was clueless which worked perfectly for me as an advisor.
good,You're making this a required field so I'm filling the required number of characters. This filed has nothing to do with my status as a job seeker. So I
good,Working with a dedicated portfolio of Corporate customers payroll dept. Wells Fargo Wells Net product was used to support there ACH accounts receivable and payable as well as direct deposit.
good,Processing loans. Contacting customers for documents needed for there home mortgage. Forwarding these documents on to the underwriter. Contacting the Loan officer for additional things that are needed.
good,I loved working for Wells Fargo despite unrealistic sales goals.  My manager was a terrible person which is why I left. I liked my coworkers and the customers.  The company itself had a lot of resources for employees.
good,"people and place were great just wish I had more time there  the hardest part leaving everyone "
good,"This was my first Call Center job, shortly after taking the position I learned I do not love call centers. Employees and management are fun and easy to get along with. Call volume in the summer months is rather low and the company continues to hire more people for these positions. Advancing to another position in the company proves to be a bit challenging, however it is easy to move to move up through the positions within the call center."
good,I started as a customer service phone banker. Later promoted to Product Specialist I then II. I enjoyed the people working with me and I was good at my job. I liked working there. I only left because of an emergency out of state. I ended up having to move to Florida.
good,I did enjoy the majority of my time with WF. Allowed me to grow as a manager and coach and also gave me the opportunity to learn some new business lines.
good,Work was an upbeat and engaged environment.  The culture can be negative at times based on the need to deliver results but management handles the stresses of the day to day process well.
good,"At the bank we are loosely scheduled with our breaks, lunches, etc. Leadership is very understanding when you have a situation come up that was out of your control. I like the company."
good,"Environment and work itself used to be fun, unfortunately getting bigger has destroyed the environment and it fees hostile and stressful."
good,"I worked there thru a temp agency, but was treated as a employee of Wells Fargo.  The work was study and my co-workers were good to work with.  My position there was a temporary position and when it ended I left for a permanent position with another company."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"busy atmosphere , room for growth and management. Diversity in the culture and fun most times with team meetings , hours are crazy . Offer benefits and discounts for multiple thing ."
good,"Fast paced job, a lot of telephone calls throughout the day, some simple requests others more difficult.  The team itself was outstanding on the Customer Service end of the company."
good,there was good and bad. I like the coffee the vending machines only had diet soda. didn't meet my supervisor 3 months into the job. banker coach. Billpay
good,"While my experience at Wells Fargo was over all positive, I feel that the company as a whole needs to focus on its people...they are too quick to mass hire temp employees, only to lay them off 6 months later. I was lucky to have a great mentor that managed me in my time at Wells. Yet, in the end I endured 3 separate layoffs during my tenure there. In the end, I was forced to look elsewhere for a more stable company that took more conservative approaches in hiring and laying off associates."
good,"I Love wells Fargo, I enjoy also working for the company, the only thing I would change differently is paying there employees a little more. GREAT BENIFITS."
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, and being able to assist home owners during the foreclosure process.Providing the customer options to avoid from going into foreclosure. I held title processor positions, mortgage collections, mortgage loan adjustor."
good,"I've always taken pride in the Teamwork mentality.  Some departments have great teamwork connections and some don't drive teamwork at all.  I have spent the last 15 plus years with a great company.  The company has afforded me great experiences and opportunity.  With all the negativity as of recently, the environment has changed drastically. The re-branding of a broken image is very disheartening."
good,"it was a delightful job with a pleasant manager and great staff.. Unfortunately due to the work being outside, it was very difficult during the hot summer days with very few moments to stay out of the sun. It affected my health and had to see to doctor who ordered not to be outside for prolong periods."
good,"Great leadership and productive and supportive work environment.  All of the expected benefits with a large corporation, plus extras, like additional holidays, more paid time off, and paternity leave.  Great place to work and great people."
good,I worked at wells fargo for a 1.5 years the environment is nice at times but you must be cautious of management. The company is not managed well from the very top which can make it stressful on the operations.
good,"Morning meetings / warmups (huddles) with Team Members including activities to energize. Affluent client segments meetings with Financial Advisor, Private Banker and Licensed Bankers, Leadership meetings to discuss overall state of the branch, high potential candidates for career advancement and current customer concerns."
good,"Generally, Wells Fargo has been a good solid place to work with plenty of opportunities to move around and learn different things.  They have given me an opportunity to do various roles in accounting, finance, and systems analysis."
good,I was a contract but I did like the pay. I did not like the hiring process. It's slow and not clear for understanding. You fill out all applications take the test associated with it and never hear back.
good,"Wells Fargo was a great opportunity to learn more about my job level and to be able to branch out into other areas. "
good,Working at Wells Fargo is a relaxed slow paced environment place to work I feel you can grow with the company and learn a lot working with them. I enjoyed working with the company the managers are great to work with the employees are very helpful and excellent to work with.
good,"I enjoyed the learning curve from the training and the support for helping customers. I believe that before the change in management that Wells Fargo wanted to be focus on customer but the goals of the business outweighed the goals of the customer. However, I believe that Wells Fargo is progressing steadily to the level of being a supportive pillar in their customers' lives."
good,Great pace to work for all types of people. Culture was amazing. Stressful job but can be relaxed with the proper mindset. Advancement can be difficult due to so many others looking at the same opportunities.
good,"Good place to work. I have referred other to come work at wells Fargo. "
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,good place to start a career. training is very thorough and professional. you will spending a lot of time learning on the job. managers are all friendly and willing to help.
good,"Usually come into the office at 8:30AM. Open the vault with a lead teller and the safety deposit box area. Proceed to opening up SVT/ SVP and doing cash with drawls/ deposits for customers. I learnt about banking products during down time hours. Learnt about the roles of a financial advisory, branch manager, leader teller, personal banker 1 and licensed bankers. Coaching occurred weekly and overall was great to learn about the company as a whole."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and my managers willingness to help and listen.  He encouraged all of us to come to him with any issues we had.  He encouraged working on other projects within the department for continued growth as an employee.
good,"Great place to work, the people are wonderful, offers work-life balance. Management is always willing to sit down and talk through  problems and assist and guide employees."
good,"Wells Fargo had decent benefits and the occasional encouragement letter, ""thank you for providing great service"" to the employees, as if it would make us feel better about the transition over from Wachovia Bank to Wells Fargo Bank back in the 2010/2011 period. However the transition was a brutal for both employees and customers alike. Everyone was upset about the lower savings acct, MM, and CD interest rates, stricter policies, less incentive to open new accounts, and much more."
good,"Good company to work for if you like to live and breath the Wells Fargo way. ""Growth"" is starting to become a focus again and new products are starting to be focused on. Feels as if management will always hold a carrot out in front of you for the next promotion but the promises are empty."
good,"Wish i could work remotely or with more flexibility for professional/personal life balance. Great company benefits and ability to grow, expand in barious groups."
good,Pretty great place to work at and very competitive salary. The only problem is the recent social media publicity. It is sometimes difficult to  represent Wells Fargo in the community because of exaggerated media backlash.
good,I work well with pressure and I learn so much working with WF. I got training that i still use in all my past jobs. I left for other opportunities for insurance.
good,"The department that I worked in had managers that seem to care about their team and wanted to help with advancements. During overtime, lunch was provided by the mangers. In my department, the managers did NOT micro manage, and my team was pretty close, we all worked well together"
good,"Good benefits, secure job but still trying to find work/life balance for employees. Re-organization of management could help in a lot of areas. To many managers with overlapping duties."
good,Enjoyed my time working here. It was a fast-passed office that was different everyday. The management needed a little more training but overall it was a pretty good place to work.
good,"I believe Wells is a good decent company to work for.  Just like any company, there are pros and con depending on the type of work you do and your responsibilities.  If you work for the bank, there are set hours; If you work for the mortgage division, your hours can and probably will exceed 40 hours especially at the end of the month, and you maybe asked to help out other areas. That is just the nature of the mortgage industry."
good,"WFB was a good place to work. Occasionally a department will be shut down in California and moved to a more cost effective location (out of state or offshore) which of course can be difficult for current employees,"
good,It's a good place to work and has good benefits. It has training for all aspects of the job. There are fun quarterly activites which involve everyone.
good,"Responsible for the oversight of a team of asset managers who focus on the management and disposition of all types of foreclosed commercial and residential properties, including agricultural land (both active crop and dormant types) and unimproved land."
good,I thought that Wells Fargo was a good place to work.  They let you balance your work and personal life and offered great benefits with a stellar 401K plan.  In my position there was no typical day which I liked as it kept me interested in the work at hand.
good,"The work atmosphere was very relaxed. The team organized well. As long as you got the gob done you would be well liked."
good,Great flexibility with work & work hours. Worked with company personnel in all time zones as well India. This made for interesting work in dealing with a diverse segment of the population and solving problems.
good,Excellent career experience and pathway. Advancement opportunities are numerous and available.  Management is approachable and caring.  Great diversity.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Typical day starts on eastern time and end on west coast time. Typical project spans 20-30 application and is very hard to coordinate the QA. "
good,"Fast paced environment and very stressful at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers. I was not fond of trying to get customers over to see a banker so that they could open more accounts or products, which the customers had not inquired about."
good,An amazing brand of BFSI to work for with great exposure. The senior management is accessible and listens out on the concerns with respect to complaince. But the credible challenge should be done with proper back up.
good,"If you can be on the phone and answer upwards of 100 calls per shift you would like it here. I, on the other hand, did not enjoy being tied to the phone answering call after call for my entire shift. "
good,Only reason I am leaving is because i moved to PA. Great group of people to work for. Depending on the manager you work for and the Line of Business will determine how far you get with this company.
good,"Wells Fargo is customer centered but adheres to policy. Assist customers in meeting financial needs from simple everyday transactions to more in depth look at financial goals with a banker. Team members are friendly and work atmosphere is comfortable and quick paced when necessary. The hardest part of job is handling customer concerns that are beyond scope of position. Enjoyable part of job is interacting with and gaining a better personal knowledge of customers, from those who visit daily to monthly."
good,I worked in the Disaster Relief Home Preservation Department. It was definitely a rewarding team to be apart of. My Manager was awesome! Team managers expectations were definitely about surpassing daily goals!
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work, honestly. If you don't have children or anything that would hinder you from working your scheduled time. Benefits are hard to beat. Amount of PTO starting is amazing. Amount of Knowledge required for starting position can be daunting. Most of staff are amazing people to work with and great leaders."
good,"I really enjoyed my job. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the sales aspect. They say you don't need to push the customers, but if you don't get sales then you will get written up.  I feel like I got lucky with meeting most of my metrics, but I witnessed others who tried and didn't succeed. It was very unfortunate because this was the only aspect of the job I do not approve of."
good,"A typical day would be me learning and providing good quality and production while I'm at work, Workplace environment is always helpful for me simply because who wants to feel uncomfortable at there work place, I feel as an employee its our jobs to exceed and go beyond measure to provide excellence service and I treat that with everything I do."
good,"I would still be at Wells Wholesale Mortgage if they had not excited the Wholesale market.  Though I delivered to various processing sites, most of the staff understood their jobs and delivered to our clients."
good,good place to work had to leave because of personal reason .worked as a phone banker the training was very indepth and helped me grow in my career. working hors were flexible and good co workers
good,I enjoyed my time working at Wells Fargo.  There was a strong IT team that always worked well together.  Office politics were present but rarely came into play except during end of year reviews and promotions where it w=seemed the decision making was slightly biased.
good,"inbound and outbound calls about home mortgage; taking payments, explaining escrow accounts etc, all while operating through systems using an computer"
good,I love my job! My team members are great. There are wonderful opportunities to grow. I enjoy my customers the most. I really look forward to taking care of their banking needs daily.
good,"Entering information, auditing scanned and entered files, make phone calls, make copies, shred paperwork."
good,good place to work and great people to work with. as a contactor you do not get paid for holidays or the time you take off for personal reasons. Most of the managers do understand you need time just like everyone else.
good,"It's a good place to work, especially if you are looking to start a new career or if you need some extra cash. They offer good full benefits for both full and part time."
good,"It is a pretty loaded work environment, on top of making sure you keep up with the work load, you must maintain face in front of the customers. if you work well under stress and can keep up with people, it's really not a bad place to work. They can be stingy with their work policies but not impossible to work with. I'd recommend this for the person who wants to work with people and is capable of advanced organizational skills."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Good place to work until the bottom fell out and the site was closed.  There had been multiple options for advancement and career path choices.  The people were great to work with and management was engaged with the employees and the day to day operations of the call floor.
good,"I started out working in the Education Financial Services dept doing collections and was there for 4 years, i relocated and had to switch to phone bank. Between the 2 departments they always preached about internal hiring for management and how they want everyone to develop and move forward, but they already know who they want, and if your not who they want you aren't going ANYWHERE. I wasted 5 years with this bank being told I was gonna be in management, that I was perfect for it, that they were training me to be the best manager I could be - then got a big fat NOTHING."
good,"have been working at Wells Fargo full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,"High sales pressure on employees was the major issue in the past which is not a case any longer. I think there seems to be a huge gap between the company's eagerness to achieve high customer satisfaction rate and the desire to achieve the goal with few staff members. The lack of a good pay also plays a pivotal role as it impacts employees' molar or it fails to motivate them to give their 100% effort consistently. "
good,The sales goals caused stress. The managers were under pressure to reach goals; we felt the pressure. I worried more about numbers than the customers.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place go work. Customer Service is always fun though it can be hard at times. You must have thick skin because you're servicing customers who have banking issues.
good,"Assist with customer daily transactions"
good,I love working for Wells Fargo since they gave me an opportunity to grow within the company.  My greatest challenge with this company was the sales culture.
good,"due to the fact of handling other peoples money it can be stressful at times. "
good,"Hardest part was reaching sales goals monthly, management was real strict on goals. The working environment was nice but the pressure of having to sale everything was overwhelming."
good,"Good pay, competitive company, tons of room to grow"
good,"Working as an operations Clerk is ok. Once you get the hang of things, it’s very routine and can be boring at times. It seems pretty hard to move up within the company due to favoritism"
good,"WF offered great benefits. I would still be there but the department I worked was sold to another bank. The annual raises were extremely disappointing. Even if you were at the highest level on skills, some years 'because the bank didn't have a good year' I would get 0.05 per hour!"
good,"My employment was with Wells Fargo Financial (formerly Norwest Financial)."
good,"The work area,where I worked most of my time at Wellsfargo was a very productive environment, the people I met over the years was great. I enjoyed my years of service"
good,"There is always work that needs to be done. They have a lot of projects and meetings. So you juggle from your Day job to Project work, but it can be very enjoyable."
good,"My key responsibilities were to hire staff and counsel them. In addition to this, I was also responsible to promote the bank business and this was generally done by sales meetings and conference. As a banking branch manager, I also had to oversee the different operations. I also kept a record of profits and productivity. I am confident  based on the skills I have learned in this role that I can carry out the responsibility of the banking branch manage and many other different career opportunities I am confident, have leadership qualities, a multitasked good with solving problems."
good,Well's Fargo was a great place to work. They had a great management team that allowed room for growth.  They utilized the strengths of their team as well as made sure that we didn't get bored or stuck in doing what we did.
good,The overall culture of WFA was great. Diversity and Inclusion are at the forefront of that culture.  They are great at attempting to develop leaders.  Sometimes they do need improvement at the middle management level.
good,Working with great people was the biggest benefit for me. Everyone got along and had a great atmosphere. I enjoyed helping the customers with some of their issues and finding a workable solution to their challenges.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The team that I worked with to remediate some deprecating servers was top notch. Working there was a positive experience with positive supporting management as well as peers.
good,"To start, I want to mention that I love Wells Fargo as a company, the job as a Teller just isn't for me. Wells Fargo has taken quite a beating in the media over the past few years but they are making quite the effort to get in customers' and team members' good graces. They really seem to care about the well being of their employees. They have many programs open to you, like Networks (i.e. LGBTQ+, Latino, Women, etc) that you can join to make new friends and share stories, volunteer events, fundraising, and environmental initiatives."
good,They're making changes for the better in their business model. But downsizing. Would like to see them value the employees again not just worry about the public
good,"everyone was likeable, polite. on a usual day was to answer incoming phone calls from customers about their accounts. learned new ways to approach customers in a way that is more empathetic. the hardest thing was at times it was back to back calls and you couldn't get a moment to breath sometimes."
good,"I only worked here as a temp, but I can't say I enjoyed my time working for Wells Fargo. But I didn't hate it, either. The work I did, scanning checks and invoices, was nice. It was fairly easy once you got the hang on it, thought there were always wrenches thrown into the gears. Strange checks, weird errors, those sort of things."
good,"Residential appraisal specialist is responsible for completing the general function of a residential appraiser including field inspections, reviews, appraisals according to industry standards as well as being a participant in staff appraisal team."
good,"The training was excellent, I really enjoyed working with my trainers. My supervisors were good.  The job is difficult if you are not experienced working in this field."
good,"My time at Wells Fargo was during the mortgage boom of the early 2000s, and the money was flowing quite well for everyone.  My shift included two fifteen minute coffee breaks, and an half hour / hour lunch depending on which department I was in at the time.  Benefits were good, and the pay was competitive.  Different departments handled different states and regions, and management varied between each one.  Overall, the management was good and wanted their employees to be productive as well as happy.  The hardest part of the job was managing heavy pipelines as well as being able to interact with all types of customer situations.  Workplace culture was focused of saying yes (to the detriment of the country) unless it was obviously fraud or affordable."
good,I had 36.5 productive career. Overall great place to work.  The culture is improving and remains ready to improve. I learned a great deal in my time with the company.
good,i enjoyed working there! however the sales goals they used have were pretty hard to reach and pressuring. I am so glad they eliminated that to serve better the customers.
good,There is really not a lot to say about my time at Wells Fargo. It introduced me to the profession I enjoy and been fortunate enough to have grown up under their guidance
good,"too many re-orgs, IT management was inept.  Never fixed merger issues.  Overlapping management everywhere, need to start over from ground up in technology"
good,"nice place to work overall. good benefits, good people. Looks to promote from within so there is opportunity to advance. No more sales goals makes the focus on customers mostly."
good,Downsized due to industry slowing in mortgage area led to leaving. Otherwise may have stayed long term. Did enjoy the opportunity to work on special committees like the Diversity Council. May opportunities for civic volunteerism.
good,Wells Fargo recently changed it's workplace culture by changing the sales culture and taking away sales goals in retail banking. The company has added a seventh strategic priority of rebuilding customer trust due to the allegations of unethical sales practices at the retail level.
good,My tellers were great to work with we got alone very well.  Management did not know a lot about banking.  Goals were difficult because of location.We did get rewarded when we did make goals whether it be a bonus or a gift basket.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed the work and all my co workers. it was nice to have a work family. Everyone helped each other out, when they got hit with a lot of work. We worked together to make sure everyone got out of work on time."
good,The tax team was awesome to work with.  Manager was extremely nice! However it was for seasonal purposed.  Would love to be a perm employee for the team.  Learned a lot about the company.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with financial transactions, making sales referrals to colleagues based on product and service needs, managing branch cash, adhering to strict security standards."
good,lots of growth opportunity.  Could be a stressful environment. Your success depends on your manager. Operations is a large part of the retail culture.
good,Each department is different and management is run by how the management style of each  supervisor. Hard to get information from H.R due to company so big. Everything is automated and computerized in website. All work is done in computer.
good,"Pros:"
good,I did not like having to do quotes and force or convince customers to open new or different accounts. My manager was all for forging them. There was not cooperation either for time off because the service manager was always gone so we could not take off.
good,Very fast paced job while I was employed there had the opportunity to meet some interesting customers and employees. Management was very helpful in employee advancement and growth
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company. Fast paced and things are changing very continually. Managers can be hit or miss. If you are in it for the customer and focus on their needs, you will love this job no matter what."
good,"Wells Fargo was a relaxed work environment with team interaction at some point everyday. The typical work day can be fairly relaxed or fairly busy, depending on the work you receive that day."
good,"I loved my time at Wells Fargo. I worked with a great team and had great support from management and business leaders. However, the centralization of marketing and new processes instituted over the past two years has made it all but impossible to do your job. It is no longer the same place to work. It's unfortunate that this coincided with all the various issues that hit the larger organization. The two things combined have created very low morale for team members. The bones of the organization are good, one hopes that the pendulum will swing back. The inefficient marketing processes will be reevaluated and dissolved and the brand will survive and restore itself."
good,Good opportunity to advance within the company. The compensation is better if coming from an outside company but the overall opportunity is worth it. I would recommend
good,"I left the company just before the scandal broke.  The work environment could be pretty stressful and toxic.  On one hand you were told to do what is best for our customers and on the other we have extremely high sales goals that you were required to make.  Every employee had to at least hit "" threshold"" just to keep their job.  However if you wanted to advance your manager would require you to hit Gold or platinum for two consecutive quarters to be promoted to the next position.  This resulted in  many dishonest and unscrupulous acts. It also created a hostile work environment because many times the people breaking the policies, procedures and laws were being rewarded with awards, bonuses and promotions."
good,Great team work and fellow employees to work with. Always a new project to work on and expand the teams knowledge and experience. Great environment for promotions.
good,"It's a great company to work for with great benefits, but they do need/are adjusting their pay structure to be more in line with the market.  Once all of the changes are in affect, hopefully it'll be the perfect place to work.  How long it will take to implement the changes and will the public still trust/wait on the process is the concerning part for the present however."
good,"its alright, the employment opportunity was great however the management could have used help. otherwise I wouldn't have left. the company as a whole is great though"
good,"Typical work day involved prioritization of loan processing documentation. Review of new loans onboarded, loans to be underwritten and reviewed. Maintaining effective and timely communication with customers, loan officers, title partners and interested parties. I thoroughly enjoyed customer contact, addressing and resolving issues to customer satisfaction while maintaining applicable guidelines and compliance regulations. I did not find any part of my job duties or responsibilities that I was unable to effectively handle or perform."
good,"I enjoyed working here, they have a lot of great opportunities the only thing I didn't like was the fact that they are only hiring for temps, I would love to become a perm employee with this company."
good,"A typical day at work in my department you don't know what to expect. Managing a SOR system against the Ledger system allows for a lot of surprises. I have learned about various wholesale products, derivative systems, enhanced my communication skills having multiple dependencies to complete BAU an meeting deadlines for QC and Reporting Deliverables. The workplace culture is friendly welcoming, and diverse. The hardest part of the job is receiving communication promptly from other dependencies when certain answers are needed to effectively complete the task at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture here at Wells Fargo and having the knowledge to complete my job effectively."
good,"Daily changes with policy and procedure, always learning something, advancement opportunities, can be a fun environment but also professional, stay on top of your game if you want to learn and advance."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"good support from USA leaders, learnt good technologies. fun loving and enjoyable. good options for moving across and build network. infrastructure facilities are good"
good,"Work hard and you will be rewarded. "
good,"Typical day included assisting clients as they walk in, whether it be to open a new account or maintenance an existing account. Responsibilities also included proactive outreach via outbound calling to personal book of business, staying in compliance with bank regulations, performing daily branch operations (balancing vault, daily tasks that promoted branch efficiency, etc.). The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with my co-workers but most importantly with the clients and developing the relationship on a deeper level than just their bank needs. The hardest part of the job was balancing the expectations of the bank when it came to staying compliant, while also meeting the many sales goals set forth for my position."
good,"Personally, I believe Wells Fargo is a great company and offers many opportunities for growth within the company. However, I do not think my branch's management is up to par."
good,n/a nothing to share at this time.   Worked for them since 2004 and went through several mergers.  Each merger prevented upward career opportunities.   Time for a change
good,"Good Job. Lot of good banking knowledge. Help and educate customers on policies and procedures around account maintenance, and maintaining a well balanced account"
good,"Management was excellent.  No micromanaging.  "
good,"I love working for Wells Fargo, but they don't pay what the market is for the job that you are doing. The need to take care of there employees.  I love the people in this company but management needs to step it up and take care of there people"
good,Wells Fargo Advisors overall is a nice place to work and gain experience. I enjoy working with the advisors and clients at Wells. The things I learned at Wells Fargo Advisors/Wachovia Securities has helped me a lot.
good,"Wells Fargo is a large company so it was sometimes hard to express some issues, communication issues between department were present my team was filled with good people and my direct manager was great. they were great with time off and other needs that may have come up"
good,"The Wells Fargo facility I worked in was new and very beautiful.  It offered every amenity an employee could want.  However it was so large and so many people worked there it was very cold and impersonal. Top that off with unreasonable expectations for perfection it made for a very stressful job. Not enough money, benefits, or facilities to compensate!"
good,"I was transferred by this Company from Florida.  I moved my Family back to Memphis.  I worked for them in the Memphis office until they closed the office down and we all transferred to GN mortgage with same crew and manager."
good,This was a great job. I enjoyed working as a CSR processing work orders for property repairs for the many corporate building that Wells Fargo maintained nationwide. It also gave me an opportunity to realize how much I enjoyed Data Entry.
good,"The work was interesting and challenging, but the office politics were not great.  My group was relocated out of state and the new group head was rather petty and immature."
good,"Good company, but like any organization, some groups are better than others.  Company is in remediation mode and extremely risk adverse - not asking the question - what is the art of possible rather how do we not get in trouble?"
good,"I wasn't paid enough for the job that I was doing. Im old enough to know What my work is worth and that my job title was not the actual job I was doing. So the company could keep from paying my specific position appropriately. For a company thats values are based on integrity and honesty, I found that to be a very hypocritical business practice. Aside from that part I did like my job and they provided me with the tools I needed to understand and excel in my position"
good,"When I worked here I was a temp and only received certain calls, so there were big chunks of time where I was doing nothing. I got in at 7 am and in my group, it was only me and one other person and between 7 and 8 I would only get one call. There were points in time where there was an hour where I did nothing. There were points in time where I was busier and would get multiple calls an hour. They did let us do whatever when wanted to do online when we were not on the phone. I got 2 15 minute paid breaks and 30 unpaid lunch."
good,"Like any big company it's easy to feel lost in the fold. But comparatively, Wells has a lot of resources to help its employees feel well-oriented. The team I worked with was very helpful and nurtured me since Day 1. Benefits are excellent, the company goes above and beyond for any type of life emergencies, they really take care of their own."
good,You get back what you put in at Wells Fargo. Be prepared to work really hard! You're responsible for the success of your team members. If you take care of them then expect the same in return.
good,The people that work for Wells Fargo are great.  They made the job enjoyable.  Helping our customers was fulfilling.  The most difficult part of the job was not having any control over outcomes of the next assignment.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Upper managers do not know your functions and try to pretend they do. This caused many stressful days trying to answer to them/for them, causing issues."
good,"Good company to Work with especially for women. it has good infrastructure, it has huge customer base. From Top management is really good but with entry level mangers are little difficult to work with."
good,Great place to work.  Enjoyed the type of work I was doing.  My coworkers were friendly.  There were many good things about working there.  I would certainly recommend it.
good,"Provide excellent customer service while assisting customers with bank transactions "
good,I typical work day started at 8:30 am. I would update my reports and begin my conference call with management as all files would be micro managed to ensure that all files closed in a smooth and timely manner.
good,I was able to advance easily but the compensation based on the workload could've been better.  Rate pricing was competitive but the minimum sales requirements should be less stringent.
good,The typical day is about working  on company spreads and working with relationship managers. The culture is fairly dull and nothing like most companies. Everyone is in a silo working independently.
good,"Wells Fargo is in a challenging and often changing industry that comes with multiple projects, challenges and asks, however Wells Fargo does its best to make sure people feel valued for their work and dedication.  They provide multiple avenues for feedback, coaching and praise and make great effort to support Diversity and Inclusion."
good,"I began working with this comoany way before it became wells fargo, it was signet bank. I really enjoyed my time there all the way through it becoming wachovia. I think it's a great place to start working if interested in getting involved in the financial world."
good,"Wells Fargo is one of the best organisation I have worked with. Good Management and learned lot of new things."
good,"Worked in retail banking before the big controversial law suits and before they restructured their sales incentives. Management is usually bad, had three different managers and only one was decent and he retired."
good,"Excellent Discounts and Perks; Flexible Shift Swaps and Available Overtime; Extensive, Continuous On the Job Training and Development; Issues and/or Concerns they make a STRONG Effort to Make it Right."
good,"I enjoyed my 12 years at Wells Fargo Insurance. The culture was diverse and collaborative and the management show an real interest in their staff. "
good,"Wells Fargo advancement opportunities are excellent, especially for women who are often promoted into positions of authority. Wells Fargo offers a great benefits package and, as an employee, I felt valued"
good,Wells Fargo Bank is a challenging yet rewarding place to work.  There is some pressure to be perfect but its all in the best interest of the customer.
good,I enjoyed my time at Wells Fargo.  I had intended to work for a few more years then retire from there.  I did not get that opportunity.  The benefits were far and away above most other companies that I have worked at or for.
good,"My time at Wells Fargo was spent working in an agile software development environment. "
good,It has been a good career experience. The company has resources and opportunities to grow.  You can reach an advancement plateau. This company is growing through some major growing pains due to the scandals.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed working with employees. I learned a lot while working for the organization. You would have to provide top service to clients and continuely be scored on how you service the client
good,"Relaxed environment, telecommuting available. Great people to work with. I have no complaints about the company. Great pay raises and bonuses every year."
good,"I got a 2 month contract to develop reporting for a specif group, really enjoyed the work environment, not too much stress and great room for contribution."
good,While working at Wells Fargo I never felt out of place or judged. This was a high stress job if you did not reach your sales goals. While in the position we had not only personal goals as well as team goals which i though was wonderful because it made the team moral huge because we had to all lift one another up to make sure everyone was doing their personal best.
good,"Great position but layoffs always seem to happen. Unfortunately a whole department would get wiped out at a time which leaves no back up plan. Otherwise great pay, manager was fantastic and overtime was offered"
good,"Good place to work for people who can work on temp basis. Great work balance, life balance and salary. Management is great, very supportive and easy-going."
good,Limited career advancement if you are looking to move past the retail division. It's difficult moving to the operational side as they want you to go through the whole retail phase first which sucks
good,"Processing emails, filing of securities, mailing securities to clients.  I enjoyed my job until one day my manager told me they were eliminating my position, pack up my things and leave the property."
good,"If an associate is performing below standard, there are many coaching tools to assist them.  It is a very fast pace company, where policies constantly change from day today."
good,"Working for my department was simple and easy "
good,"Management in general is poor and unprofessional, show favoritism and the Home Mortgage Facility located in Fort Mill, SC.  If you work thru a staffing agency and then offered a position, the permanent offer is less money offered for salary"
good,I started off in a call center role as an inbound sales specialist and loved the job. The management and culture was great. Great work life balance and opportunity for growth. I moved out into a Branch locations and was warned by fellow co-workers that had branch experience that it was terrible. The warnings were true. The branch locations I worked at had a branch manager who seem to be very unhappy with the job and company. During training the branch manager showed up late every day. The branch manager really set up my co-worker and I for failure. Other than this terrible management experience Wells Fargo really was a great place to work.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work.  They have opportunities to work from home.  Good support from Management.   I had a very good manager, she was supportive and easy to work with."
good,The work environment was very friendly. The management was very helpful and tried there best to help you succeed. They would take time out of there day to make sure you understood the material. Would recommend to anyone.
good,"wells fargo has been a great company to work for, the past few years ive had many opportunities for career advancement but as of late I been wanting to get out of retail banking and step into more of a corporate role."
good,It was fun to work at Wells Fargo and learn more about banking. You have to demonstrate your capacity and skills to move up to a higher position. The hardest part would probably be sales! Other than that it was a good place to work.
good,"I worked on contract but i enjoyed the same respect as the permanent employees. Despite my accounting background, i havent been successful in securing a job at wellsfargo even after putting in several applications. I have an MBA in accounting!!"
good,Wells Fargo had a monument atmosphere and felt your opinion mattered. This was  company I looked to make a career and retire from however I felt upper management carefully organized silently better; our careers at Wells Fargo would have continued rather than our site closing down.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Enjoyed my time at Wells, my manager was really nice.  She understood the ins and outs of the business.  However for the work the pay should be higher"
good,Great company to work for.  Excellent management support.  Need to follow up on internal leads systems though.  Some what watered down and did not lead into actual sales.
good,"Worked at Wells Fargo for a while, was a good experience for someone in the transitional phase. Staff was encouraging and supportive. Fast-paced. Sometimes long evening hours. Good pay."
good,"Great place to work management was so supportive and Helpful , this was a very fast paced environment we got monthly end of month catering all of my peers were wonderful we had an awesome team."
good,"buenos beneficios, pero mucho stress durante la jornada laboral"
good,I learned a lot working for Wells Fargo. I learned more about how important customer service is and i loved to make a positive impact on customers overall.
good,"Required to be self-motivating with limited supervision and very knowledgeable of all aspects of the mortgage loan process.  Typical day you would review 5-7 loans, rate the finding of the loan by input into Wells Fargo's system.  If issue was identified this would be presented to management and decision would be made whether it was a finding that would be presented back to that department.  Enjoyed having flexible work hours and limited supevision."
good,Great people to work with to collaborate on getting what the customer is looking for in a home equity loan. Managers are willing to help to achieve customers expectations.
good,"Phone banker title is pretty literal, rarely do anything off phones. After awhile it can be tedious but you do learn a lot about banking and how things work in the background of it all. Co-workers tend to be great and friendly but rare to actually make connections since you'll be on the phone 99% of your day on a normal day."
good,"Upper Management could not delegate orders and needs. Pay freeze, as well as hiring freezes. work culture is great short PTO and work life balance was horrible."
good,"My time with Wells was enjoyable had the best co-workers, however Wells Fargo's management did not recognized your hard work, as hard as I worked my job was not appreciated or fully recognized."
good,"Responsible for reviewing, analyzing, approving and underwriting consumer requests and determining appropriate workout or liquidation options within company and industry guidelines. Functions  include reviewing credit bureau information, tax returns, financial statements, and or other supporting documentation to recommend/approve requests within decisioning authority levels using automated tools or traditional underwriting; responding to customer inquiries and credit decisions; ensuring customer files are current, complete, and compliant with company standards; contacting partners to gather information to make appropriate decisions, and explaining  rationale behind credit decisions. Credit guideline experience is critical"
good,The job is flexible but compensation is not competitive. The management team is strong and warm. A typical day at work is talking to customers to resolve issues with their accounts. Offering options to keep their accounts from being closed. Most enjoyable part for me is when i have to get them to setup payment arrangements and hardest is when their accounts are being setoff and they express their dissatisfaction in a very personal way.
good,"I already did this. really? I loved my sup, didn't care for the job - sitting at a desk 9 hours a day. Great products - lots of rules and restrictions for each state to keep track of."
good,WF is your usual cube farm type employer.  Pretty good benefits and pay.  Like anywhere else there are good jobs and better ones.  Good managers and not so great.
good,"Good benefits, most depts have cliques that I didn't like working around. Management hit & miss, a lot of playing favorites. Good policies, software and systems were up to date and user friendly. Onboarding & training were good."
good,"The Benefits are phenomenal! "
good,The company has good benefits and is a good bank to work for. There is room for advancements but it’s difficult to advance in some districts . Time off and good
good,"I loved working here and meeting people, but management was all about sales."
good,It's a good place to work as far as job security and benefits. Can be stressful depending on which department you work in. Plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Plenty of opportunity for growth!"
good,Best part of the job was providing solutions to customers.
good,Great job but at times it felt competitive for sales with your teammates. Management was okay if the manager you got knew what they where doing half of the time.
good,"Despite the bad press of past bad practices, this company has gotten better for both customers and employees.  Pay is competitive and there's plenty of room for advancement."
good,Face paced work environment.  Work load challenging but rewarding. Getting to know customers is a great part of the job.  Learned to balance workload with customer needs. Good health care benefits.
good,"Many good benefits including 401K, PTO, dental/vision and medical insurance. The company itself has a lot of ups and downs. In 2011 I was laid off and a few months later called back to work. There are not as many mass layoffs, however, it's still possible. The company has given me a lot of opportunities to grow but it is definitely a place where you have to brown nose to get ahead which I hate. Merit alone will not get you where you want to go. I've been passed up on many occasions because I refused to suck-up. That being said working hard and being a bit of a hardass helps too."
good,i couldn't meet the unrealistic sales numbers and watched colleagues perform questionable tactics to meet their sales requirements. i was fired for not meeting these requirements 6 months before they were forced to stop selling.
good,"It all depends on the department you work at. Working on the operation side of the company has very limited stress on the workers. Also it depends on the teams and departments, you can have flexible work hours. The management team is cool."
good,Good experience overall - talented people - attentive managers. They treat contractors with respect. Typical day is spent on conference calls with a distributed team and working on PM deliverables.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo and there is ample opportunity for advancement within the company. Overall, great people trying their best to succeed daily. The management structure can vary greatly depending on what area of the bank you are working in. I felt like management could have been more involved in the coaching process when it came to the sales process and customer service. I worked with some great managers who really valued delivering great customer service so this was invaluable to me. I did feel like the sales positions were underpaid. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was building relationships with my coworkers and my clients."
good,I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a real career in a call center. They offer room for promotion. The hours for this call center a good. I enjoy helping customers with the work i do.
good,Great management and team enviorment with a non stressful daily job. Quick and efficent typical day at work. Learned mortage practices and foreclosure procedures
good,Please read more reviews about this company before joining. I had two wonderful managers who took to making sure we had the tools needed to do our jobs successfully.
good,"Below Average pay but good work culture. Supervisors are friendly but Managers are little hard to others. Overall, it is good for people who do not mind low pay."
good,"Put in 21 years, all with exemplary reviews, but when displaced, there was little effort by the company to retain myself or other top performers. Current feeling is that the company is afraid of anything that would be considered a risk.Good flexibility for a work and life balance"
good,"Good work culture.  Team is a priority.  Allowed to post for new jobs after 1 year in most positions, so I moved up 3 positions within 3 years.  I would like more pay for my work though."
good,"For over 18 years Wells Fargo gave me opportunities to learn, grow, and advance my career through both internal and external means.  They encourage work life balance and continue to offer more benefits for family."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Working for the company itself is good, there i smany benefits just the lack of staff they hire and also the staff who are in charge can be a problem."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with....the facility had great resources and accommodations for its employees...the location of the facility was centrally located.
good,The job is challenging and allows for continuous learning.  Building positive working relationships with clients makes the job enjoyable and allows for customization of services provided.
good,"It's a great place to work for to get cash handling, customer service experience. If you start off as Teller don't be afraid to ask for help. Team Members there are willing to help and encourage you to get better. Management was great for me, not sure about other places."
good,Good place to work for experience and benefits. I loved working for the Digital team because work/life balance is encouraged. I would work there again -- just looking for something new.
good,"Loved the actual job, if you were motivated to involve yourself in projects there was always something different to do. Expectations of position were clear, praise was regular, could have used additional constructive feedback for areas of improvement. Recognition options limited in our department, but overall atmosphere was fairly relaxed, fun, and enjoyable. Responsible for training classes of new hires, those advancing to new positions, and leadership. Some virtual training as well. Access to unlimited resources to develop your skills, however you have to seek them out and want to do them, nobody is going to tell you to for the most part. Most difficult part of the job was handling issues outside of our direct control when partnering with others, partnership not always the greatest."
good,I mostly enjoyed working there and the did a good job a promoting from within. There was a large push for sales and ever increasing sales requirements.  Not sure what it is like now but then every year they expected more regardless if it was realistic or not.
good,"Stores operate at a short staff level and higher management covers staffing by taking from one to try help another. Then the other store lack to produce customer service level that they expect. So you reach out to help another location then get yelled at the next day if customer should mention they had a bad experence inside a branch because lack of staffing."
good,this was a great company to work for. I left for family reasons. co-workers were great the manager was great. healthcare was great. every relaxes job.
good,"Company was more focused on meeting sales goals than helping customer anymore so I decided to leave, since then they have turned around and do not have sales goals any longer, so it has improved to work at."
good,"Acceptable place of employment. I have not worked under the guidelines of Wells Fargo, the current corp so I cannot speak on how it is to work for said institution. Really, my review is irrelevant."
good,Wells Fargo was an overall great place to work. The environment was fast-paced and the jobs were extremely competitive. There were times when there was a team collaborative environment and other times is was cut-throat. It depends on the department's culture.
good,I really enjoyed my work with Wells Fargo until the company was exposed for massive consume fraud. After that happened it was difficult to earn client trust and do my job.
good,"Everyone experience is different at Wells Fargo depending on location and position. A typical day on the job are generally smooth but I do anticipate to deal with those few difficult customers. From my experience as a teller at Wells, I’ve learned tons about fraud. I’ve developed above and beyond customer service skills. Also I learned to have high patience and make sure that questions are asked to ensure needs are met and things are done right the first time around. The team memebers I’ve worked with are very supportive and assist one another on a consistent basis. Branch and service managers are consistently involved also. The hardest part for me is sometimes there are times you can’t satisty every customer. I always look at that you can do everything in your power to try to give that customer an excellent experience but some people are never content."
good,"I worked on the retail side of the bank. It was very fast paced and the way to succeed is by listening to your manager. If you did what they asked, there was a pretty good shot of moving up the ladder. Your manager could make or break your experience. Some were too aggressive with sales, and you had to find a way of not compromising your ethics even though the sales goals could be steep. The one drawback that I didn't like was that some managers would look the other way when it came to ""gaming"" or falsifying/manipulating sales. Luckily, most of my managers were aggressive, but strongly discouraged any sort of gaming. I've heard that since the huge lawsuit, things have changed for the better from the top-down. I would work there again in a heartbeat. Pay was lower than expected."
good,"Great place to work, good team work.  This is a very busy work environment and management is great a supporting the employees.  They have great benefits for all employees."
good,Worked your scheduled shift answering calls from customers concerning their issues or questions with banking accounts. Presenting new products to customers which could benefit them.
good,"Great job. Love working for Wells, but they are moving procurement jobs over to India so contract with them was temporary. Would recommend Wells Fargo to someone outside of Procurement."
good,"The law department is collaborative. The paralegals and attorneys work together and help each other. If you are having a problem and ask for help, someone will know the answer how to find it."
good,"Totally prodctive and high paced when volume allowed, During times of slow pace, it is important to look through resources and attempt to turn that loss of business to an oppourtunity,"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"The number of employees, the sheer size of the company, post merger created a change in the culture of the company.  The recent banking industry mishaps has taken a toll on morale and the overall feeling at the company."
good,Good place to work. Good benefits. Job security in most departments. Competitive salary. Competitive salary. Mostly trained supervisors. Assistance with putting you on the path to the right career.
good,"We were a very diverse group of employees, with multiple levels of expertise, in the Subordination department; we all enjoyed our jobs - sorry they moved all processing & underwriting processes out of state and closed Boise office"
good,A very organized company with a lot of priority to risk mitigation. Management is very supportive to team members career growth. Workplace culture is very welcoming and has a great respect for diversity.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company to work for with their bennies, and the pay is decent. but they ask so much of us to deal with very upset people and lawsuits and they dont give us anything for them. Yes we get quartly bonuses..used to be monthly but they took that away..and the pay is decent."
good,"Fun place to work... Spent time outside of work with other team members. Focus on customer service, paired with having fun, and having a personal connection to most customers"
good,Seems as though upper management is advancing a good bit. There have been numerous org changes during my time here. The group always has a clear path ahead. Need to be able to adapt to change and act quickly under tight deadlines. Manageable work.
good,"I was a contractor. Management was very polite, but they never gave the impression or feel that the contractors were actually part of the Wells Fargo team."
good,none i enjoyed working with my previous employer Wells Fargo. I and very greatful for the people i met and worked with the help my knowledge in banking reach significantly high.
good,"Great people, Good leadership, stressful job, and low benefits. What you would expect from most help desk jobs.If I didn't have bills to pay I would continue working here."
good,"Good place to work, very talented and passionate team members. Exciting product offerings and care for the customers. Liked the fast-paced environment which at times was very stressful, but very rewarding!"
good,You get a lot of costumers and have to be able to provide fast and accurate service with each one. The management were very insightful and helpful no matter the circumstances.
good,Good place to work. There is a very good working environment. I would recommend WFA to anyone in the market for a QA position. Guidelines and expectations are spelled out clearly.
good,"The job is easy to learn and not hard. But if you have a degree its not nearly enough money in my opinion. The people are pretty cool, and management is as well."
good,It was an okay place to work. Not much expectations but got boring. Not much job stability if they get in trouble due to all the lawsuits or budget cuts.
good,Usually well balanced work load. Managers keep you on your toes but without micromanaging you. Fun place to work at. Except for the pay a would say is a good company to work for.
good,"There is nothing terribly negative with working here in my experience. The only thing I could say is, with all larger companies, change takes a while."
good,"Lack of technology and inability to spend money on improvements, is what is turning actually really interesting job into a nightmare. need more hires and support tools"
good,Advancement in this company is all about who you know and not about the hard work or qualifications one may have. Advancement is very hard at times. But company is good to start off with.
good,"The company is good and the benefits are good as well. The culture tries to support the team member as well as the customers when they can. If you are ok with the changing environment of banking, then it is a decent place to work."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Work would be stressful but training was extensive so I was educated sufficiently to perform my job. The management had high turnover. Fellow employees were enjoyable at times and gossipy at others. I really enjoyed helping people but it was hard to deal with upset customers
good,Good place to work. Fast paced and you should be a self-starter. Management was helpful and allowed you to take classes to improve your on-the-job skills.
good,Wells Fargo Bank is a productive work environment. They follow the PMBOK project management procedures and very stringent with following the compliance of project methodologies.
good,Inclusive workplace environment. Career growth is promoted. Job work / life balance is management's priority. Performance incentives are fair. Benefits aligned to industry average.
good,"I enjoyed my temporary work for Wells Fargo, I was very pleased with the work environment . I would describe it as a fast paced professional place of business where employees are satisfied .  I experienced a wonderful team as well as a very active ,attentive supervisor."
good,"this a very nice place, nice people, nice location and nice overall company to work at but the only set back is that the opportunity for advancement is very limited."
good,"Some days were slow and other went by pretty quickly! I really enjoyed working with my coworkers and the customers. If you have a knack for customer service then this a good fit. The money is good, time off, and a good environment!"
good,I had a great experience at Wells Fargo and regret leaving.  My business unit was ethical and fair to the customers.  There was a lack of opportunity to grow within my department.
good,not available....Will be relocating to new employer within Wells Fargo Umbrella....Not commenting on current....But have enjoyed my time in current roll meeting all necessary needs of employment
good,"Nice place to work, just lacking job advancement is all.  But that is mainly due to the location of this office.  Not a lot of competing businesses around."
good,Great start but it was just an internship and temporary.  My time as I have said was brief but gained a lot of insight into the world of banking which eventually led me to the retail world where I gained an assistant manager position at Blockbuster.
good,"Productive environment with competitive goals in a team setting. Goal are  tracked and posted daily to motivate employees on a daily basis. Most changeling aspect of the position is time management. There are daily goals that must be achieved, and without time managing skills, impossible to meet. The best part of the job is helping people in there time of need."
good,"There are pros and cons to working in a large corporation. If you have the mentality and ability to find a career path you enjoy, you will blossom. I have been very fortunate in my career path and have enjoyed the jobs that I have had and the managers that I have had."
good,"It's a decent place to work. The company provides great pay and benefits, but its also just another retail job. Once you learn about the job, there's nothing else to learn until (and if) you move up. The only way to move up is to apply to an open position and go through a couple interviews. If for whatever reason the position is modified or altered ( for instance going from a 30 hr position to 40 hr) then you have to start all over from scratch and reapply and redo the interviews."
good,"There is constant movement all day and the moment that there is a lull the current branch manager is delegating their tasks to every one else. I enjoy and prefer working hard but when the credit is being taken by someone else it becomes a little frustrating."
good,"Student loans is fast paced with plenty to learn, but lacks an opportunity for advancement. The hardest part of student loans is learning the ins and outs of student loans."
good,"While working with Wells Fargo I have learned about all the mortgage investors such as working knowledge of the following investors: F.H.A, Wells Owned, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Bank & Private and VA, I also gained experience with building relationships/rapport with customers."
good,Establish relationship with clients and their financial needs. management was great and knowledgeable. workplace culture is great establishing friendships with coworkers is easy.
good,"Have learned a lot about a different type of working industry, however due to recent restructuring, the lack of potential advancement appears to no longer be there."
good,"a great place to work with excellent benefits, very rewarding and great hours, i really enjoyed the peers that i worked with, I dont believe they always train management to understand other jobs."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Underwrite and review mortgage loans "
good,"Great company to work for. Unfortunately, all of the lawsuits, are making it more hard to work. It's not relaxed. Too much pressure, and it's hard to reach goals."
good,I was able to increase pay and responsibilities at Wells Fargo more so than any other place I've been employed.  Unfortunately the sales goal expectations were too aggressive and induced employees to use unethical tactics to meet company performance goals
good,"New offices are nice but in a terrible location. "
good,"1. Wells Fargo is a company where we can have an opputunity to show case our talent and improve our knowledge and communicational skills."
good,"The company is a great company to work.  Many areas you can transcend into. For the most part, co workers were friendly. Room for career grpwth. Great hours."
good,The requests of the supported business lines are often unable to be met without causing security risks and must be taken extremely seriously. They treat their employees fairly and I had little to no issues in the work environment.
good,"Most people that work at wells are awesome.  The bad press is tough to get past and many customers are fishing for bad press to give Wells. They offer great benefits (time off accumulates from day 1, dental, 401k, etc)"
good,"Good work life balance."
good,Its a good working place and employee friendly company. There is no  Onsite opportunities. There are always good scope of learning and improving yourself. You also have an opportunity to move to different roles and skills over the time.
good,Good place to work but company reputation in the marketplace is  challenging to work thru daily.  Great networking throughout the enterprise and team members willing to help.
good,Learn something new each day; fast pace; strong teamwork mindset. Promotes diversity in the workplace.  Many programs provide opportunity for advancement early in career.
good,Great environment to learn better customer service and gain experience handling large amounts of cash. Most difficult part of the job is balancing customer service with maintaining policy.
good,Overall good company to work for. There are constant changes depending on volume and needs of the business. Each division has different perks and overall my division became a close family.
good,I was a regular teller and i handled cash on the daily. I made sure to help each customer and make sure they left with a smile. I sold foreign currency as well as normal currency.
good,You work on loans inputting information in a system for 8 hours a day. The managers are really relaxed and let you perform however it helps. You are ale to get days off of work easier than other jobs.
good,"If you are someone who does not care about anything else besides making money, this is the place for you. The way to make money here is to work lots of hours and not have a great social life."
good,"Fluxuations in policies makes work difficult, but customers and coworkers make the job worth it. Ability to move forward is limited and encouraged only if you have the right connections."
good,"Love assisting my clients on a day to day basis. They make my job worthwhile. I learn so much about my clients and at the same time I gain their trust, by simply listening and understanding their concerns."
good,"Wachovia was a very good place to work, unfortunately, due to the economy we were outsource.  Th job itself is very challenging as we deal with various customers with multiple account."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Always on the go. very fast. High attention to detail. Management is a toss, benefits could be better cost to the employee. Best job stability for a big company."
good,The people are friendly and easy to get along with. Most manager's are flexible. The pay is market rate. You can take courses through Wells Fargo. They don't want to take time to train you if you are not up to speed.
good,Wells Fargo was great to work for while getting my degree. They were flexible around my school hours. They also assisted in paying for part of the degree. People were great to work with. I just didn't see any advancement in the department I was working in.
good,"You need to be good at networking to advance here. Sometimes your relationships are more critical than your work to succeed. Do you work at an average level and make good networks, and you'll succeed."
good,In the past it was difficult to work for due to high pressure. Due to the recent changes it has gotten 100 times better. Overall it all depends on who you work under and the location that will determine your success
good,Team building focused company with a twist of fun learning skills.  Harderst part of job was month end stress but we always made it thru with a big whoop!  Workplace was mostly fun and light hearted even with the work load heavy.  Team work makes the dream work!
good,"Loss mitigation.  Supervise a team of collectors and collections specialist that service accounts in the range of 5 to 120 days past due.  Assist with hiring and on boarding new hires. Provide training and prepare daily, weekly and monthly progress and performance reports. Assist manager in their day to day activities. Handle escalated calls.  Work with other departments to assist and resolve any Dealer and Customer issues that may arise in an efficient and siwft manner.  Identify, prepare and mentor team members for leadership roles."
good,"very team oriented!"
good,Great work environment with room for growth. Helpful in providing learning courses and development courses as well. They also were very flexible with scheduling and day to day activities.
good,If you get a good manager whose willing to promote within and move your career forward then you're good to go. So ask a lot of questions in your interview. Otherwise you're screwed. Not all managers in Wells are the same so asked questions.
good,"The company has great benefits. Great paid time off and compensation if preforming well. "
good,"Pleasant and productive environment."
good,"Make sure you are a well rounded person whie employed here. Plenty of opportunity for promotions, downside policy changes happen frequently so be able to keep up."
good,"Created, developed, implemented and supported user friendly transition tool for Wells Fargo, (Central Triage-Multifunction Tool) a resource management approach to deliver appropriate service for transitioning asset accounts from (FA) financial advisors to other areas of service.  Processed data by extracting and analyzing large amounts of data from various data warehouse environments. Broad experience using data cleansing techniques, Excel pivot tables, formulas, and charts. Identify and report trends and patterns found within the data set, and makes recommendations for business and process improvement."
good,For 5 years I worked hard and moved up quickly at Wells Fargo. There was so much room to grow and so many ways to learn more do interesting things through the company. I loved the energy and him culture and the technology and processes are superior to most company's. They have great benefit packages and tons of perks. It was stressful and faced paced and demanding but I loved it. Everyone is hard working and a team. Of course when it started becoming unbearable with the SALES goals and the information brought out recently became a reality for me it was my time to leave. I wasn't mad at the people i worked with but I was disappointed in the company and new culture at what had become acceptable. Not everyone engaged in the behaviors that came out but it was hard to stand by and watch good people be fired for not being able to keep up and other good people doing things they thought they were supposed to do in order to hit goals. Being a part of branch management it became too stressful and I couldn't stand by and watch anymore. I would go back if I knew all of that wasn't a factor anymore because it really was an amazing place to work in all other aspects.
good,"Definitely a great place to build a more competitive spirit, and to learn how to use to team work to gain knowledge.  The main thing that I took issue with is that the sales push was too excesive, even boarder line threatening at times."
good,My coworkers on my team where wonderful to work with every day. Internal and external employees are pleasure to work with. Overall a good company to work for.
good,I loved working here for the time period given. Helping clients and customers and researching how to resolve issues made me feel like I was really doing something for someone.
good,"This job isn't bad at all. Especially since they stopped the retail banking of it. That was only bad part of it. Other than that, no real complaints. Good pay for the amount of work, good life/work balance."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo was a great company to work for, with an amazing benefits package.  In the industry, pay was on the lower end of the scale in comparison to comparable positions elsewhere."
good,Wachovia doesn't even exist anymore and it was boring as everl. Everything is really slow paced. everything can be done on the phone now. Don't even bother
good,"I really enjoy the people, the environment and work culture. I enjoy the customer inner action, management development. The hardest part of my job would be innovation"
good,"Balanced placed to work, learned communication, customer service. Loved people I worked with everyone was treated fair. Got great feed back from peers and management."
good,"Good work place and culture is awesome no pressure as per the requirement we used to work ,life style is superb and shifts are good to work in this company"
good,"it is an ever changing environment! an unofficial saying in my old department was ""the only thing that is constant, is change"". it is a very stable company overall. most of the people were nice and genuine. in certain departments they provide great opportunities for entry level positions and opportunities to grow."
good,"The phone bank is very much about your numbers more than you as a person. Once the selling goal stopped things got much easier and more fun. Talking with customers was the best part, there are some wonderful people in the world."
good,"Wells Fargo is a solid and reliable employer.  In many business lines it is a great place to start and learn an industry.  Like any organization, there are pros and cons."
good,"Great company.  It is very corporate, so they might not be the right fit for everyone.  However, I would still be there if my department had not been outsourced to Minneapolis, Minnesota."
good,"A typical day is making calls in the morning, assisting clients with their needs. Making sure we are doing what's right for the clients. Helping managers with everyday task, following up with clients. coaching tellers on opportunities for sales"
good,"Very nice company culture.   "
good,"Collections is high in volume with inbound and outbound calls. Its a great place for entry level, and also gives an outlook of how cooperate America is ran."
good,"The department I worked in was once a very stable place to work but the changes in the check writing world made it a place with a finite future.  Prior to the tragedy of 9/11, I never considered looking elsewhere."
good,I had a positive experience working at Wells Fargo. I learned a lot in order to prepare myself in a business field. I learned many different job duties and enhanced my understanding of various programs and customer service.
good,Its a really good company to work for with a friendly environment. they offer many good benefits with 40 plus hours and holiday pay and vacation pay to.
good,A lot of opportunity to advance your career. Potential for growth within the company. Hard work is rewarded and praised. Community events and company picnics promoted a family atmosphere.
good,"Not looking to write a review. Good place to work, management in my case was not good, but many are.  Unfortunately I had a bad situation with my direct manager."
good,Grear learning eXperia nice but hate the difficult  it is to move up!! If you want to work there is a good place to get started but not so good to move up
good,Typical day is spent on the phone answering questions about possible online fraud. The training is great and I've learned about the many ways fraud is perpetrated and how to help prevent such fraud. Never a dull moment. The culture is great and management is hands on and encouraging. The most difficult part of the job is maintaining a low Average Handle Time while dealing with complex fraud concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customer and helping allay their concerns.
good,managers seemed to care about the employees opinions and made accommodations to change work environment . the pay is low for the many responsibilities
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,as I have worked with the company for 4 years I have learned  a great deal of financial literacy. WF is a great place to learn to adapt with a variety of cultures and everyday business interactions.
good,"Working at Wells Fargo is great for people who are not sensitive. The benefits are great and so are the coworkers. But this job is not for the faint of heart as some customers can be verbally abusive. So, I would suggest this job only to people who are strong mentally and want to work for a team based company."
good,A very good opportunity for a contract employee with excellent potential for permanent hire.  Many different skill sets are needed in their workforce.
good,This was a great place to work where the colleagues where helpful and supportive.  The team truly had a shared vision and goal.  Management was nasty at best.
good,"Work with Wells Fargo home owners with refinance. "
good,"I worked as a collector for a bit, it was really hard due to all of the rules you had to follow but other than that the company tried really hard to get you away from that stressful part of your work."
good,Banking industry recently has changed and affected the daily work requirements. More unkowns and responsibilities without the necessary support in all areas has made the position more challenging.
good,"I was a contract hire at the Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Center thus briefly experienced the Wells Fargo ""experience"".  The training was extensive, intensive, and quick-paced. Our manager was very friendly but even more professional.  I got the impression that as long as you work long and hard, Wells Fargo will take care of you."
good,"Good place to work but is slow. Politics is always a given but if you keep your logs of work and know what you are doing, you can retire here. Promotions are something which do not come easily if you are not part of the organization for a long time, it seems like on first come, first serve basis. This is little demotivating but I guess that is how it works."
good,"Positive Environment to learn, great team players."
good,great place to learn and grow if you are really inclined towards learning. Continuous Improvement culture is the DNA of this organization. Management is really good and supportive
good,"A seemingly standard office environment typical of large corporations, but with friendly and approachable management and in my experience helpful and inclusive employees. A bit bland, but that isn't a bad thing depending on what you are looking for. Tons of opportunities to move up/across departments and the managers I've known have always been receptive to change and listen to what the employee wants."
good,Good company to work for.  Will recommend friends and family to their banking services. Benefits and compensations are great. They are hiring new graduates.
good,"Job was fun, and very productive, co-workers where fun the management change so did the environment, there was no chance to grow with in the company.."
good,Good Place to work depending on the management you have.. They have good benefits lots of pto depending on your seniority and it all depends on the branch you work for.
good,"some upper management issues, good compensation package. great immediate supervisor, very proactive in safety issues. great PTO/vacation accrual, made our own monthly schedule"
good,Company struggles to allow employees work life balance. Phone calls on days off and during vacation are very frequent. Company does train employees that want to grow if they meet the expectations of current roles.
good,"This was one of the most exciting places to work because the customers were great! They would always turn a frown upside down. Whenever i was feeling low, a customer would always say the right thing to make it all better. The employees were like family. I love counting money, helping my elderly customers figure out their withdrawals and deposits."
good,In my role as a teller I was responsible for customer transactions and guiding the customer to a finance banker that would be able to provide the customer with the necessary products they required. The management was supportive and helpful with providing the team with the support and motivation needed.
good,"Wells Fargo and it's team members are working hard to gain the trust of the community and customers back. Wells Fargo offers a fair salary, a diverse environment and solid communications."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I worked there many years ago, but I remember it being a fair and professional work environment. I expressed that I wanted to advance my career there, and they were helpful with that."
good,"I worked an eight hour day depending on what day of the week it was could be extremely busy."
good,Fast paced to assist customers with their financial needs and assisting with fraudulent issues on their accounts and returning any and all fees that charges may have incurred.
good,Working at Wells Fargo helped to create professional relationships and to create rapport with clients. The company made sure that employees were involved in fun activities at work.
good,Its is a call center. They try to make the environment the best they can. It is a great job for people who can deal with being on the phone 8-10 hours a day.
good,"Work life balance maintained"
good,"Wells Fargo Insurance purchased my previous employer Acordia, Inc.  It was difficult to get management to  move over to the insurance side when they were used to banking."
good,"Wells Fargo is a good job to have if you are interested in sales. The call their branches ""stores"" and there is a quota each quarter for tellers, and each quarters those numbers increase. Very challenging."
good,I loved my job. But If you we not a top seller far a products for the bank as a Bank teller you will be treated horribly. My boss was fun as well as a team player but once he was promoted new boss was horrible
good,"Good company to work with, good learning opportunity.Salary hike is normal.Those who are willing to work for US client for them its good.No onsite opportunity"
good,Good Work place with challenging day in a hectic work schedule where web can learn new things with team mates .scope to learn new technologies sucesfully.
good,"The company with the educated and experienced management."

good,Wells Fargo is a wonderful place to start your career. it is a very employee friendly company where colleagues as well as leads are very cooperative and supportive in all respects.
good,"Wells Fargo is a great place to work. I am involved in various projects to enhance my analyst experience due to me expressing my interest to my managers. Its all about what you want for your career and letting upper management know. After that, its their duty to put you in position to accomplish these goals, that's what I like about working with Wells Fargo.You learn with Wells that customer service is key to success with your job. The workplace culture is fun at times due to occasional events we have for different holidays and times of the year. The hardest part of my job is not having the option to work from home at times but due to the environment it's not that bad working with everyone I work with here. The most enjoyable is the occasional events with have to keep the culture from being boring and repetitive."
good,"Within our department the workflow was steady and the days went by quickly."
good,"The pay isn't bad and the workload is verify manageable, however, its not a long term job. The cap is about $45,000 at my job and there is no chance of advancement unless I move laterally then hope for a promotion after a year."
good,"Wells Fargo is a great team oriented fast paced work environment. There is tons of room for advancement, and incentive pay and benefits. Ideal call center job."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo was a good company to work for.  The work environment was good, people were good.  Very nice place to work and great co-workers.  Would recommend to anyone."
good,"Really enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. Great work life balance, advanced opportunities and culture. Commission structure in mortgage department needs some improvements."
good,Wells Fargo hires for people in a process in many roles.  Thus it can be difficult to advance within a role (ie from an Analyst 2 to a 3) for a star performer since they are filling a role not an overall mission.
good,..assist bankers and clients with payroll options for their businesses.  Train bankers/ tellers how to locate possible referrals to acheive the business
good,Looking to relocate to a location closer to home. I found it hard to advance within Wells Fargo. They are a great company with great benefits and competitive pay.
good,"Good work life balance and good domain knowlege learning ."

good,High performing team of experienced and dedicated commercial real estate professionals.  Excellent national exposure to highly regarded team members. Ongoing training opportunities encouraged.
good,"Overall the job was indeed a great career, however it became difficult to manage personal life with work. The job is a sales position the bases performance on the quantity of loans closed and funded. When potential customers call on weekends, guess who has to answer... YOU, unless you don't want a paycheck!"
good,"Fast paced environment, productive, a pretty diversed work place. I was able to enhance my inter personal skills and leadership role. Management is very encouraging on it's employees growth and career advancement."
good,During the time that I worked for Wells Fargo it was mostly a good place to work. There were a few managers who took things too far and destroyed the culture and had no understanding of work/life balance. Most of my time there was very enjoyable and despite having high sales goals I was usually given the tools to allow me to succeed.
good,"Good place to start a career, but not much of what you learn will be transferable if you stay too long. Learn what you can, put in your time, and look for other opportunities."
good,It is a decent place to work. The company is big on hiring within and on career development. The hardest part about the job is sometimes not having the undivided attention on upper leadership until something is wrong
good,"Work day was typical, just answer calls, people were nice and it was very sales driven. Can earn bonuses. Must learn really fast and be able to handle irate customers."
good,"Great people, but as expected, can get lost in such a huge organization. Had really good work life balance though. Would recommend."
good,Structured organization with renewed focus on customer/client experience.  Diverse employee base and continued progress with the combination of internal cultures.
good,Work whit clients that are relocating for their job. Assist them through the transition into their new home. Work with their company and relocation coordinator
good,"Very few were fired full time despite initial promises."
good,"Great opportunity for advancement. Work environment is great not too strict, get to relax and have fun when appropriate. Learned a lot regarding the automotive/lending industry."
good,"No Comment...Too much turnover, managers inconsistent, feeling that their is age discrimination, did appreciate earning 3 weeks paid vacaton"
good,There is great training and strong benefits. They have changed their strategy and are focuses on customer relationships. Working in private banking I was able to learn a tremendous amount about wealth management and account management skills.
good,"Some good mentors, very diverse workplace, enough work to go around, good education initiatives. management does their best to work with family or health issues as to not impact employment or job."
good,"Great place to work-Work Life Balance-Knowledge about mortgage industry,Work Culture is good,domain mortgage info,"
good,I appreciated being part of a big company with a great goal.... to help people refinance their homes to help lower payments or term. The hardest part of the job was the large pipeline. Our files grew from an average of 40 to upwards of 90+ in a matter of weeks and was very hard to keep in touch with customers as often as the company required customer contact.
good,If you're a people person then this may be your place but be weary of you expect hard work to move you through the ranks. Otherwise it is solid work and the options for advancement are endless.
good,"Good work life balance, excellent team. Enjoyed working with the team. Management is so, so but doable."
good,Good ole boy company! Teams are a lot of fun! The work is a lot of fun. Helping people is always rewarding. Benefits are great! Some team events. Pay is good.
good,Working at wells fargo is a good place. There are many goals to reach and it a can be overwhelming. they have great benefits and a great retirement program.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Wells Fargo, and I truly learned a lot and in doing so, I was able to move up within the company fairly quickly. Wells Fargo is very good at hiring and training their people to be successful, productive and comfortable on the job and position hired for , but very bad about laying off and closing departments."
good,"A good company with good benefits. However, a lot depends on your management team. "
good,Good company to work for which has great benefits. They care about taking care of their employees as far as providing them a great work environment. The pay is sufficient.
good,The training class was fun and helpful.  A normal day at work would be going in a few minutes early to get set up at your computer and log into all of the programs that you would be using then making and receiving phone calls. There was a good level of competition between coworkers to earn bonuses and awards as top performers.
good,"Wells Fargo is hands down a great place to work at. The people work well together and if you get good managers your experience will be beyond amazing. The only downside would be the fear of losing your job especially as a teller, personally I worked for the company for 4 years and loved it and wanted to grow with Wells for as long as I could but was short and unfortunately let go, It's hard when you put so much time and effort into the job. Overall though amazing experience."
good,I help customer's get into a new home everyday and helping customers as well on Refinances. It is a great reward to make someone's dream come true on a daily basis.
good,"I like the work atmosphere here. "
good,"Always a risk working with money, but loved my branch and staff although a lot of times we were under staffed. management was ok but could have better guidance."
good,Nice hours and nice people. Management was a little dicey. The benefits are really good! I learned a lot about the mortgage industry.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Most enjoyable was being able to work with customers that are going thru difficult financial situations and offering several payment options.
good,"Case, Cases, and more Cases!!! LOL Opening up your case load for the day is a surprise. You will never have the same day (cases) on a daily basis. Every case is different and can be exciting, sometimes too exciting! Sometimes I will catch myself going too much in my investigation cause it can get that interesting in trying to figure out where the money is coming and going. I have learned patience, accuracy, and to pay attention to detail in this job function. My management team here is great from the supervisors and leads and above. There are no wrong answers and the team are very open to carrier advancement/development. My coworkers have so much knowledge in different areas of banking from being a teller down to home equity, so if any of us have a case that is not familiar someone is bound to have that work diversity knowledge."
good,"Even with all the negative press and the stigma associated with Wells Fargo, it remains one of the best companies I've ever worked for. The departments I was a part of were productive and very supportive. They're in a period of transition and hope that they can rebound from this difficult period."
good,"Great job for learning banking. Strong sales goals, but their management team will work with you to excel. The work atmosphere is enjoyable, and the supervisors try to make everyday fun."
good,"I love my team members and manager, I love my job and the people I interact with on a daily basis. I enjoy the responsibilities that I must perform each day"
good,I have learned how to maintain my sales quotas and call volume/adherence at this company. It is fast paced with usually 100+ calls in queue on a day to day basis. I've learned to become a patient person and understand different people and their situations. The hardest part of this job was that Wells Fargo had no flexibility for me to attend college or advance. The enjoyable part was our cookouts and teambuilding activities
good,"I enjoy working for Wells overall.  Compensation is a bit archaic, however, work-life balance is good.  There is plenty of diversity for LGBTQ groups but not much for people of color and advancement in leadership positions."
good,"Advancement opportunity"
good,"Once you are out of training they increase the demands.  Sales quotas, call handling time, and even time on your breaks.  If you don't mind being attached to a headset for 8 hours, this job is really good!"
good,"I had no major complaints with Wells Fargo, the company treated its employees good. The only negative thing I have to say is the sales pressure and management at particular branches"
good,"They have an amazing compensation plan. I am able to balance work and life without thought of failing in one vs the other. On a day to day bases, I am aware of all the expectations of me."
good,good place to work. small community mindset. good mgt and leadership and good support. Customer supported management with positive vision toward future.
good,Great company as a whole. Great upper and mid-level management with a large support system in place. Workforce consists of highly motivated and intelligent team members to help assist with the loan process.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of an individual coming in to the bank and having to interpret a possible a need for them and solve that need. In many cases it's either making the right decision for that clients need for an account or even solving an issue that may have not been understood or can be confusing. What I learned from working in this type of environment is that it comes with a wide range of needs and want; everyone has a perspective and different needs and being able to solve those needs has made me become a better communicator and problem solver. With the banking position you have other co-workers who have similar goals as you so it's relatively easy to bond with them and share alike stories. What I find most difficult about the position is the needs assessment; being able to find a need for the individual and actually dig deep to find other possible needs they weren't thinking of, along with daily tasks and goals can sometimes be hard to achieve. I definitely enjoy being able to make a different in individuals lives whether if its small by fixing a fee or even sitting down and goal planning."
good,"Anyone working in sales should at some point in they're career work for Wells Fargo."
good,"I have been displaced twice so far in 14 years with the company."
good,"Image Department at Wells Fargo was very results oriented and care to serve internal, external customer services.  We had many team meetings to communicate within the department.  Strong leadership."
good,Learned so much about the company and grew my experience. Great company to learn how to understand customers needs and build long term relationships with them.
good,"Its definitely a fun place to work. It is shifting from sales to service so I felt it was constant stress trying to adjust. The health benefits are great, and the people I worked with were amazing."
good,"Team environment"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Could use better pay and benefits. "
good,Everyone was always very friendly and willing to help you with anything that you needed. The employees and the customers were always very friendly and enjoyable to work with.
good,If you like sales then you will like being a teller and personal banker. I enjoyed the customer service part of the job. I just didn't like how pushy you had to be every time you talked to someone.
good,"Work culture is good and its  a kind of better experience learning new "
good,"Love this job until they started making us to customer calling."
good,"Wells Fargo is overall a great place to work. They treat their employee's well and truly care about your well being. As a manager however, there is a lot expected of you and work-life balance isn't really a thing. Which is important to me."
good,"My employment at Wells Fargo has allowed me to expand my knowledge on Commercial Asset Lending over the years. My position as a collateral examiner is highly travel intensive. A typical month can involve days to multiple weeks of overnight travel. The position also has multiple deadlines that require the examiner to demonstrate time management skills. Also, the position requires working on various projects in teams that change with every collateral exam. The hardest part of the job is the extensive traveling, but it can also be very enjoyable depending on the location."
good,"Aerotek overall is a good agency and consistently communicated with me. "
good,Great benefits and culture.  Opportunities for advancement within the right departments.  All inclusive and diversity centric employer.  Overall great place to work.
good,"Very difficult meeting guidelines to get full bonus potential, sort of feel led on when they act as if everybody gets it when it may be less than 10 percent of company. Some supervisors great, some not at all, they will make or break you forsure!"
good,"I have to say, working at Wells Fargo is certainly different. It is very busy but, I like it because I like to be challenged. Great team member interaction as well and lots of room for growth."
good,Wells Fargo speak for it self it a great corporation. I believe you just have to find your place in the corporate world. It is strict work environment.
good,"Same company as Wells Fargo Good place to work, sometimes over time is required, flexible hours, fair salary"
good,I would prefer not to provide that level of detail here at this time.  Would be glad to discuss these things in an interview.
good,"Very good company to work for. great pay, raises, and benefits. Experience will, however, be dependent on the individual coworkers working with you. May possibly work with amazing people and employees, or may work with completely horrible people. Otherwise, I should have never left the company, just the region."
good,"The company has been very helpful in developing my skills, but you have to love the culture of banking. Very sales driven, and puts a lot of emphasis on moving products. If you are willing to deal with that, and willing to accept that it is not all that finance based, then it is a great company to work for."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,A typical day at work is having the desire to help customers achieve financial success each and every day while maintaining sales goals and enjoy talking on the phone to people all over the world.  Meeting other people was always exciting but Wells Fargo provided this opportunity through the phone bank which was incoming calls only.  I learned lots about different cultures and ways to help customers over the phone as opposed to in person which presents challenges when you are trying to access the needs of an individual and not being able to see facial expressions or body language.  I like my other co-workers and we always encouraged each other and challenged ourselves through team contests and company competitions.  The hardest part of my job was to listen to the foul language that would come from a few customers but on the flip side the most rewarding part of my job was to hear the smiles through the phone from a customer who was so happy you helped them save their account from theft or simply lent them my ear to just listen.  I learned it sometimes doesn't take much to reach a person when they need it the most and to also maintain great professional demeanor even though you can't see the other person on the line.
good,"Great working there, unfortunately at the time of my employment"
good,The work/ job culture is Production environment with a rapidly changing environment. You will garner new skills periodically and grow in your job skills. This company is big on team players and leadership.
good,This is the role where I learned and achieved the foundation of much of my HR training. My manager in this role had been in staffing for 20 plus years and she was able to provide valuable coaching and development.
good,"Decent Job for getting into banking, pay is okay.  Good opportunity for overtime, good benefits.  Time is monitored all day, given set amount of time for breaks, lunch, ""project"" time, etc.  Hard to get out of Dept once you're in."
good,Have the ability to meet with different customers on a daily basis and sometimes with the same customers everyday.  Assist in finding new products that can assist my customers financial future.  Help leading new tellers into their new rolls.  We have a great team that can get the job done but also help and encourage each other
good,"Flexible environment, good and friendly colleagues . Job culture is also good. Rapid growth, good investor, the directors are very well mannered and good to employees."
good,Working at Wells Fargo is not too bad. Working saturdays can be annoying and sales can be frustrating at times but my coworkers are very friendly and I do not mind going into work when I do.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company that gives focus on customer satisfaction. I was trained how to handle different kinds of customer to help each customers on their needs.
good,Customer service reps get treated very poorly by customers the supervisors are decent my was awesome credit card is better than consumer and there is nothing fun to do on your breaks unless you smoke
good,"it's who you know."
good,"Assisting customer's with deposit, withdrawals and making payments for personal loans, auto loans and their mortgages.  But it's more rewarding when you can help a customer discover different ways to save and plan for the future."
good,"Wachovia was a great place to work.  Very high volume, however great leaders and team mates.  This was a temp position and once Wells Fargo merged, they dumped a lot of their temps."
good,"Depends in what department you are working, but for the most part management does care about their employees. Statistics are very important, high producers are well compensated, sometimes quality will suffer due to high production numbers."
good,"its a night shift environment however it has enjoyable workplace"
good,"Wells fargo retail is a double edge sword. Theres the decent to great pay, good benefits but if you dont get sales then all thats out the door"
good,"Wachovia Dealer Services was a great company."
good,The only cons I had was the competitiveness. Even Management was pushy about meeting or exceeding sales goals. If you don't mind being pushed to sell things to people even if they don't need them then you wont mind this job.
good,"My team was amazing and very hard working, management is working overtime to make sure employees are taking care of and customers are satisfied at all times."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"-taking calls back to back for 8 hours a day"
good,This is a good company you can use to advantage your career. The advancement opportunities have slowed down within the last few years.
good,I learned a lot about the banking system and how it functioned. I enjoyed the work and helping the customers the most. My manager was fantastic and always had ways to motivate us to do cross selling of products and referrals to the bankers.
good,"Aggressive sales quotas to meet daily and quarterly. The company accommodates to almost all emergency situations, which is nice. I learned how to step out of my comfort zone and approach complex matters with confidence."
good,While at work I did a lot of team games and awards to help motivate everyone on the team. The job was taking in bound calls with an average of 70 per day.
good,"The Wells Fargo experience is wholly dependent on your management team. The office politics can be difficult to navigate, but it is overall a good place to work with reasonable benefits."
good,"I worked for nearly a year with a very reputable financial firm.  My role was to analyze mortgage applications and either move them to funding or suspend the loan due to issues with the application.  I learned how to be a professional and how to hold myself accountable.  While reviewing loans, I had minimal supervision and became very self sufficient.  My role required a high level of attention to detail and I prided myself on achieving a high quality score each month for my work.  Management was supportive but there was not much room for growth.  The hardest part of my job was knowing that there was not much room for advancement and that some analysts had been doing the same thing for over 10 years.  My most enjoyable part of the job was being a team member who's role played an important part in the overall success of the department.  I knew there would be ramifications for errors and being able to consistently receive high accuracy marks was a good feeling."
good,A typical day at the position of Collector 2 was speaking with customers over the phone about their checking and savings accounts to try and work out a resolution on their past due accounts to bring them current.
good,"deep focus financial analysis, learned lot about global financial institutions, friendly and responsible management and nice co-workers."
good,"Come in, sign on. Count money all day and deal with customer's. Must have great amount of patience to deal with sometimes rude customers. If you are not the most detailed person, this job may not be for you."
good,"Very supportive in helping each and every employee grow, TMN is an amazing tool that WF has used to allow people from different walks of life and cultures connect, engage and inspire!"
good,"Wells Fargo's vision and values are great to help the customers succeed financially. I learned great customer service skills and was able to form long lasting relationships with both clients and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the sales, because of the location of our branch. We were limited to what we were able to promote to the customers and being in an affluent area was difficult given the products. I am indifferent about the management because there is a high turnover rate. Otherwise, my co-workers and I were able to run the branch without any hiccups when we were between managers. We were always laughing and kept each other on our toes. Wells Fargo is very philanthropic and contributes to many charities. They provide paid volunteer hours and always give opportunities to participate in charity events."
good,"I loved the company, I honestly would still be with this company but I had family issues and had to move on. I loved it so much I would like to return on day"
good,Diverse and inclusive culture where employees feel connected with the organization.  Job development and career advancement opportunities.
good,The workflow is very busy. I learned to work until all tasks  were complete. The Management dedicated. The co-workers worked steady. Giving co-workers direction. Celebration of accomplishment.
good,"Fun, great pay and benefits. Raises are given as well. Relaxed atmoshpere. Some leads are really good some are lazy and some are rude."
good,Wells Fargo was my fist job after graduating college. My days while working at the company had many routine tasks to complete while it also offered lots of diversity and opportunity to work on my problem solving skills to meet customer expectations. The people at Wells Fargo were excellent to work with.
good,"Goleta Team rocks, strong management and a good working atmosphere, company goals continue to change, company provides 401K, good benefits, discount for cellphone company, advice to anyone working here ""do everything by the book"""
good,"This is a fun and challenging environment, the company has goals and visions. Your work day and performance goal fall directly in line with the vision of the company. There is never a dull moment."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Peple should join wells if they want to settle without any tensions and enjoy their life."
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work. I plan to leave just because I want to move to a place where it is not freezing and close to ocean.
good,"Tough sales goals. They are attainable but to get a real payout is unrealistic. Benefits are good, maternity leave is not good compared to other financial institutions but not awful."
good,"a typical work day varies not everyday the same, if you have a great manager you will learn a lot about sales and products, Management all depends on the location your at, you can make some great long lasting friendships"
good,"I was lucky enough to work in a fabulous work environment at a small branch. I considered all my co-workers friends. That being said, the sales goals are ridiculous. It's nearly impossible to reach their threshold without being deceiving and vague to customers. I chose to have a good work and moral ethic, and never used those techniques. I built relationships with customers every day. Once I felt comfortable enough with them, I was then able to gain their trust and understanding that I wasn't just giving them a sales pitch. It's hard to find that balance."
good,"Wells Fargo was a good place to work. There was little to no supervision required. Supervisors were wonderful. You worked from the time you signed in until you it was time for you to go home. I learned how to close on the front-end of a loan, being that my past experience as a closer was on the back-end (REO). The hardest part of the job was being able to remember all that you learned in training. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. The co-workers were great!"
good,"I assisted customers with providing the best customer service possible, while helping them manage their money. I"
good,"Had the pleasure of working with clients, loan officers, closing attorneys & vendors to complete the loan process.  Customer service was a main focus point."
good,"Most enjoyable are the team members I work with on a daily basis.  I truly enjoy all that Wells Fargo offers.  Good Benefits, 401k, stock options and the inclusion."
good,"Great place to work day by day, managers and coworkers are great. But very high stress environment and the higher up management expects a lot from it employees"
good,"Underwriting is great learning experience, good pay, great coworkers, a lot of policies and procedures to learn, but worth the challenge."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my work is helping customers to reach their financial goals. I have a very good relationship with my managers and co-workers. "
good,Fast promotion opportunities. Very low staff so having a sick day is very hard if you really are sick. Upper management doesn't really know how to manage the district well and deny for more staff. Recruiters take months to get a new employees.
good,Wells Fargo is a stable workplace with abundant availability of jobs.  A typical day for me at was balancing receiving data requests from business and fulfilling those requests and developing larger scale projects.  The most enjoyable part of my job has been problem-solving various reports and projects.  The most difficult part of my job is navigating the documentation process of reports developed.
good,"Worked in the WEB Marketing area.  Challenging, but rewarding work.  Interesting projects and very interesting personalities."
good,Wells Fargo gave me opportunities to advance my career through classes as well as positions built around building tomorrows leaders today.
good,Solid company with really good benefits. Income potential was really strong. The position was commission only sales.
good,Lots of re organizations that result in working with a number of managers - some really good - some marginal.  Good company overall
good,This job allowed me to advance me with the skills and experience. work at you pace and make sure that I got all my work done in time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"great benefits"
good,"Management is supportive and does encourage growth and development, however there little time to learn new tasks and skills based on the continuous work volume.  The department is very much quantity driven, and this tends to take precedence.  Thus, there's a high turnover with credit analyst; over 20 credit analyst have quit over the past two years.  Other than this management is sympathetic to most aspects of the job."
good,"It depends on what market the branch is located in, but it will depend on the management on how much they push you to sell. To move on in any part of the company you must have good sales to be considered."
good,The management team is very friendly and are good at communicating information of any type. The work is fast paced so need to be prepared for that from the get go.
good,"As a service manager my day was very busy, but rewarding. I had the privilege of watching co-workers grow and become better at their careers and succeed at personal goals."
good,"A typical day would start by calling on clients for loans, deposits and non bank products.  The goal was to set and sell as much as possible.  Incentives were based on how well you were able to sale."
good,Lot of opportunity to learn and move around in the company.  Very large enterprise so can have a lot of opportunity to work on things that smaller companies don't have to offer.
good,"Typical day at work would be achieving further to current days target with accuracy and staying motivated."
good,"very customer service focused, great vision and values.  Company is really focused on living their vision of helping the customer succeed financially through great service. translation meaning if you don't get enough credit card sales you must not be helping the customer succeed.

The work required me to work with a highly disbursed and matrixed work group.  I learned a lot about TPM documentation and keeping the project on - track in the a highly dynamic environment.  It was rewarding to see newly designed applications take shape and work for the very first time.

good,Permanent salary is usually below market rate.  Silo positions where very little is provided for career development opportunities.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Still learning the role and company. Management appears to be  solid but I am still fairly new to the organization. There appear to be allot of opportunities for growth.

good,Great place to work with a team that was like family.. I was provided with great experience.The most enjoyable part was helping my customers succeed financially.

good,It is a very quite work environment. The work culture is a traditional style and everyone follows the same procedures. The hardest part is not having many responsibilities like I wanted to because I believe I am more qualified and capable to contribute greatly. Enjoyed the challenge and there is always new things to learn
good,Working with Wells Fargo the last 3 years has been a very good experience for me. On a typical day of work I would sit with at least 8 customesr a day and help them with any service issues or new products they may need. While working here I have learned to build excellent rapport with my customers and have learned to cross-sell all different types of products that we offer here.  While offering exceptional service. My managers have all been very helpful in coaching me and guiding me when needed as well as helping me move further up in my career. Although me and my co workers all have the same goals we have learned to work together so that all of us our on pace with our goals. The hardest part of working with Wells Fargo would be the change of new procedures and policies we need to follow and the most enjoyable part of my job would be being able to help all of my customers on a better road to financial success.
good,"A typical day was going downtown Denver to the office and researching investments for clients, developing marketing campaigns to obtain new clients, and interacting with an office full of professional people.

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo has many different opportunities for career advancement, as well as for expanding your knowledge of various lines of business. The retail branches practice an aggressive approach to sales which challenges associates to learn different sales techniques, and hone their people skills."
good,Cross sell expectations are going to destroy the customers experience after all tenured employees are fired. All that will be left are employees that cross sell and could not resolve a true complex issue.
good,WF was a great company to work for.  Working with remote offices was easy and advantageous to all.  They were good to employees an fair to all.
good,"There was little to no correlation between training, and what we actually learned on the floor. The management team is all very professional, but everything is handled internally. The hardest part of the job is making sure you follow every law and regulation 100% of the time. The workplace is very diverse, and it's a fun job to work at. It's easy to get fired if you make mistakes easily."
good,Typical day is never typical. 8:30 to 6:30 is commonplace with weekend work mandatory. .learned alot about sales and how to work within tight time constraints. A close co-working group is key to getting the work done..Hardest part is the constant shifting of priorities and processes to meet compliance parameters. Most enjoyable is getting to know clients and getting their referrals.
good,"A typical day includes inbound calls, customer service, collecting and catering to customer needs. Providing good customer service and maintaining calls"
good,I enjoyed working with a diversed group of people.  The Staff were friendly and helpful.  I was always sent on great assignments and most of the time AI wish they did not end.
good,"Wells Fargo is a very good company to work for, there are many areas of opportunities for growth!"
good,Wells Fargo is a great company to work for but you have to work in one position for 6mths to a year before you can even apply for another position that may be better fitting. The sales goals minimums keep changing and the payouts keep decreasing. Sometimes a little more sales driven than customer based.
good,"Answering phones, handling all customer monetary transactions, work at a team, helped to develop new tellers with hands on training,  I loved working with my team and customers."
good,Opportunity for growth for sure. Decent pay if negotiated well. Lack of integrity with in management. Try it at you very own risk.
good,"Answered incoming calls from bankers about policies/procedures pertaining to banking.  The hardest part of the job was striving to meet quotas even with difficult, long calls.   The most enjoyable part of the job was the beautiful office environment and extensive classroom training."
good,Wells Fargo is good employer to work for. Some technologies are outdated and they are working to catch up. loyal to employees.
good,"My primary job at Wells Fargo's Exception Payments Department was to accurately key data information into Exception Payments' internal database for correspondence from Wells Fargo customers who wished to close their accounts at Wells Fargo. After said information was input, verification of each customer's bank account, identity and signature was performed, through online database information and/or through customer contact via telephone. If all information was verified to be true, then payment through closure of the account was made via Cashier's Check or domestic/international wire. If any of a customer's information was found to be false, then the customer's account was not closed and denial correspondence was sent to the customer, stating the reason for denial or requesting further information."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is very good to their employees offering flexibility in work schedules, great pay and benefits, ongoing training, accommodations and more."

good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Attached to a larger bank however you have the freedom and ability to make a great deal of money.  You have to be very self motivated and a good networker to increase your income.
good,"The team I worked with here at Wells Fargo is by far the best team I have been on.  Everyone is so very friendly, willing to help, and make work fun.  Our manager is an amazing person that truly cares for all of his employess and tries to assist with your career goals.  The work can be stressful, but the tools and guidance given are amazing."
good,"This can be a very rewarding but very stressful business to be in. Must adhere to many rules and regulations which can sometimes contradict the sales piece of the business."
good,"I worked in the call center aspect of wells fargo, it was a great experience overall. the people there were very helpful and it was a great place to be coworker and job enviroment wise, the job itself though is very stressfull and the work you have to commit to does require a level of emotional distress. The pace is very fast and the customers are not any less prone to outbursts and since it is the dealing of their finances you are more prone to being dehumanized by the customers you are dealing with, as this is nothing new from a customer service or inbound call center work, note wells fargo is very taxing and not for everyone."
good,"WFB changed after they bought Wachovia, the company philosophy drop down. 10 years a go use to be excellent company to work and growth. Their sales goals is excessive too high and the demands of sales is horrible. There are wonderful people to work, most of them but there are small minority that are bad as a team members. Is hard to get in this days family leave absent and lately family matters are not important anymore."
good,Most rewarding part was getting families into their new homes. Frustration was a daily emotion when dealing with all the 3rd parties when trying to get the loans funded.
good,A good place to start but harder to find progression due to set in management. Spots do not open often. But worth looking into if trying to start out in the corporate world.
good,One of the best things about Wells Fargo is the work/life balance that is afforded to you. They provide you flexibility to work from home in most organizations.
good,"Typically, I was in charge of reviewing complex loan scenarios and either approving or denying applicants based on whether or not their profile met the standards as determined by Wells Fargo.  Quality control and procedural application were of the utmost importance."
good,"•	Collected on designated high risk accounts while demonstrating good customer service skills "
good,"I was here for this company for 15 years till the doors closed."
good,"Very fast paced work environment, ability to grow within the company quickly. If interested in banking, this would be a great place to start. Must have the passion for sales to work here."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo but am being displaced in July."
good,"Very sales driven culture, especially for a bank. See about 100 customers a day. Coworkers are great, most are like minded individuals."
good,Its a good company to work for . There is only 2 things that make it bad. The sales and management. They expect you to shove down customers throats products that they don't need. If you want to move its all about numbers about how many products you can sale to someone. They expect you to be super nice and what I mean by super nice is they expect you to kiss customers butts to keep them happy. They will do any thing to keep a customer that has a lot of money happy. For example if you have two customers that are both needing to have fees reverse but one has so much money and the other not so much they will tell the customer with a lot of money yes and the other one no. Management is the worst . they do a lot of micromanage and too much favoritism.
good,A typical day at Wells fargo was  either very exciting and filled with a multitude of tasks to do a day. A very fun work environment with great management and customers. The hardest part of my job would be challenging myself to set higher goals and accomplishing them. The most enjoyable part of my job at Wells Fago would be meeting great customers on a daily basis and being able to help them in any way possible. I enjoyed working for the company for the little time that I was there.
good,wells fargo is a great organisation where we can have fun at work but no salary satisfaction. the hardest part of the job was complete night shift for my process.
good,"On a typical day here in my department it is busy and yet very productive. I have learned so many things from the nature of investments to legal procedures and law requirements from state to state surrounding estate measures. I have had  a pleasant and normal healthy interaction with managers, as well as co-workers. However the most difficult part of my job in particular would be the consistent demand of requests and communication between both clients, internal reps, and 3rd parties. We all work very hard to meet that demand and while sometimes it is not always easy it is enjoyable to see how we can make our clients happy and felt considered as a valuable asset."
good,Well performing company that has done well during before and after the countries financial recession. The company has an established brand.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good company to gain experience with. It is a well known, reputable company that will only keep growing with more people being interested working for them.

good,"Worked out in the motor bank. I enjoyed the fast pace environment, and enjoyed handling large amounts of money. Training program was great. Easy going coworkers and management."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo has been a really good experience for me. Going from working minimum wage jobs, to my position at Wells has given me more stablitity. I have learned a lot about banking and credit cards specifically, the information I have learned will be useful for me for my entire life. I've met so many different people, Wells Fargo is a company that values diversity so I have had the opportunity to meet and work with a wide variety of people, which I really enjoy. The hardest part about my job I would say is having to do the same thing all day, every day. Answering the same questions for differenet customers over the phone is repetative. A typical day at work is answering phone calls for your eight hour shift. Occasionally we have meetings or training to complete. I feel that I know just about everything within my position. At this point I have to decide whether I want to advance at Wells Fargo or look for a different postion. I always like to look at my options before making a decision and I am hoping to find some alternatives. The most enjoyable part of my job I would have to say is the people I work with. That would probably be the most difficult part of leaving as well. But I really miss having the face to face communication with new people that I don't get at my current position. I know any position I work I will have the opportunity to meet new people so I can't let anything hold me back."
good,"Great company to work for and amazing co-workers. Management  varies, it's based on your productions, however they do provide you with all the help, training, tools and assistance to get you were you need to be. They won't let you fail and will do their best for you to achieve your goals. The job is stressful, but that's with any job and you make the best out it !!!"
good,A typical day would include handling approximately 20 inbound calls along with making many outbound calls regarding home preservation options for customers.  I typically would assist other representatives when they needed help with either processes or computer issues.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when we are able to assist a customer in saving their home.
good,"Strong Company good leadership, benefits very good, Good local team and faculties are very nice and security is good. Parking is easy."
good,"A typical day would be: pulling pipeline report, prioritizing loans, updating loan officers and management, work files in order of close date/rate lock date, update customers, submit conditions to underwriting, get files clear to close with the 25 day requirement"
good,I only worked as a temporary position but there was a lot of room for growth with the company. It was data entry so it was not that exciting but there was a good salary.
good,"I work with large pool of customers on a daily basis. My goal is to help them succeed financially and educate on all our products and services that our company offers."
good,"A personal banker has quarterly sales goals they can meet to make bonuses.  I was responsible for opening bank accounts, processing loans applications, and assisting clients with all their personal and business banking needs."
good,"Working for Wells Fargo was a great experience for me, depending on the roll you are in your duties can vary drastically. Working at the phone bank is great for beginners who need a foot in the door but it is not a job I would recommend long term, they micromanage everything and everyone- even the managers- the position is labeled customer service but you are required to ""refer"" aka sell products to each incoming caller in order to succeed there. Although the job duties aren't the best and micromanagement sucks the people you work with are fun and there is usually some kind of game or challenge - around sales goals- going on that make the day go by fast and keep you more into what you are doing. "
good,"I started this company when it was Wachovia and I thought I would retire from this company. This was a company that truly respected their employees."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is  being able to game plan with peers and execute plans to achieve goals.Typical day at work will be calling prospects to make appointments and reach each quarterly goal.

Learning to deal with 20 different personalities has been challenging but at the same time rewarding both on the job and off. Hardest part of the job has been the volume of work due to a few people leaving either through advancing their career or medical illnesses. I enjoy achieving different tasks of the job, the sense of completing things really keeps me loving my job."

I've learned alot in the banking industry such a daily policies and procedures. I also learned how the default department tries to assist borrowers to the best of there abilities.

Had to stay positive daily to represent the company which i really enjoyed working there, it would goive me a great attitude throughout the whole day . Hardest part of the job was definately standing in one place for over 8 hours, That i did not enjoy. I am a person that likes to stay active all the time and walk, move, talk to people."
good,"In most respects it is a good company to work.  We were asked for feed bacl on what could be improved to make both the job and the work place better.  After you proved your work ethic, you then had the ability to move your schedule around a bit or get coworkers to trade for needed times off.  Really great in doing that.  Most of the time I was able to speak to management about a concern or a question that needed more clarification.  Sometimes the hardest part of the job, was having to work on a Saturday when I had the ballet or if there was a special function I waned to participate in and the hours made it difficult to do.The benefits were very good and had several selections to choose.

Review all the emails and determine if any deliverable need to be scheduled, remind team members, lending managers of various reports to update.  Deliver various items to direct manager for their daily meetings.  I enjoy working with the various team members, Underwriters, Closers, Lending Managers and Lending Officers, everyday is a different task depending on the loans we receive.  Its been a great opportunity to learn the industry and learn the different aspects of mortgaging.  My direct manager is extremely busy so I make sure I take care of all of the small items and make executive decisions depending on the situation.  The team is approximately 49 Underwriters and 21 closers, 6 Lending Managers, 3 Lending Officers who are always busy trying to help families gain their homes, so day to day we are extremely busy trying to meet our goals."
good,We closed and reviewed loans. Documents review and quality control.
good,"The job, management and co-workers were all hard working team players trying to reach similar goals.  Managers did everything for the branch to succeed.  Co-workers would alway give a helping hand in any way they could.  "

good,"standing for the whole shift takes a toll on you as a teller, but overall good job."
good,"Good bunch of people to work for, sad to see the company get sold, great work environment"
good,"Manage the Teller Line by ensuring each teller has enough cash to service customers.  performed shipments in and out to ensure branch was within cash limits on a weekly bases.  conducted monthly audits of cashboxes to prevent internal fraud.  Conducted daily observations on tellerline to ensure we were providing exceptional service to our customers, also provided coaching and feedback to strengthen skills and change behaviors.  "
good,This company is the leader in the mortgage industry due to their conservative position which has kept them moving forward while other companies have not.  It is a good company to work for and the leadership team truly cares about their customers and their team members.

good,"Helped customers with bank transactions. Introduced new products and promotions to the customers. Handled a cash drawer, and counted the cash vaults."
good,"Typical day at work is assisting homeowners with information regarding reinstating loans in default,discussing loan modifications,short sale and mortgage release options. Management is very friendly and meet with team members at least once a week to discuss self development and metrics regarding work performance. Hardest part of job is listening to the homeowners talk about their hardships such as divorce,death in the family and other hardships can be very emotional and heart breaking but when a homeowner is able to obtain a loan modification to save their home, that feeling is priceless."
good,"I have been with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage for 10 years and though there have been challenges in regards to restructuring, I could not have been blessed with greater leaders or co-workers."
good,"There are only 3 branches, and advancement is very unlikely, unless someone retires.  Sales oriented and multi-tasking is a must.  You work M-S 8-5:30 or 6.  Management depending on your store will either be very apart of your development or just sit back and hope that you get to where ever your goal is one day.  I do enjoy working with my co-workers and as a leader I try to make coming to work enjoyable.  We have pot lucks, after work dinners, bowling, etc."
good,Sales driven. Looking to do what is right for the customer.  Co workers are awesome.  Hardest part is constantly hitting your sales goal.  Best thing is helping customer succeed financially.
good,"Sterling Jewelery Company Branch,"
good,"A typical work day starts with meetings at 9am, then testing of applications, additional project work and then more meetings that last until roughly 4pm.

People often work from home in the evening."
good,"working in side a branch, dealing with customer inquiries and sales targets, customer service in an office atmosphere (inperson, inbound and outbound calls) leared a lot of customer service and respect towared co workers and customers"

good,"Successful Application of a Share Point Site"
good,I enjoyed the employees and the customers were great. Management wanted us to succeed and were great charismatic leaders.
good,"This is my first job right after high school. The hardest part of my job as a teller would be sales of accounts, because we had sales goal to meet each month. I did enjoy interact with different type of customers daily. The pay rate is pretty decent for someone who is just out of high school."

good,There was so much to learn about home ownership and what the necessary steps were to assist those going through hardships.
good,"This company was a team players place to work. good management."
good,Wells Fargo is a very diversified company that provides a professional   and friendly work environment.
good,A typical day at my job is never typical and you never know what type of situation or customer you will be working with. Every day is a challenge and I learn something almost every day.
good,"Oppertunity is there if you want to stay with banking"
good,"Intense work environment, understaffed. Rewarding in terms of experience and development."

good,Learn everything you can and take it elsewhere to earn what you are worth.
good,Excellent support from underwriting and  servicing.  Customers state they are very happy with service and would continue to do business with Wells Fargo
good,"Able to advance, educational benefits, bonus, competitive salary and great experence"
good,"Most days were very busy. I learned how to multitask a variety of responsibilities with a great deal of pressure. My management support was amazing. The only down fall was managers with-in this organization move around a lot, so you are constantly learning a new management style. My teller team was very competitive and compliant with regulations. I enjoyed providing assistance for complex transactions and assisting customers with financial needs."
good,Enjoyed working hand in hand and one on one with customers while performing account maintenance and sales
good,In this position I worked with account holders.  My primary job was to introduce them to new services offered by the bank.  When Wells Fargo bought the company many of us Personal Bankers were laid off.  Overall I enjoyed working for the company.
good,Overall the job is fun.  However when it comes to advancement they put too many restrictions and what is allowed.
good,Would return to WF it the opportunity arose. Typical day was very busy with a known set of work expectations.  Company is top heavy with management.  A lot of free meals.  Great co workers.  Learn how to structure my day in order to complete tasks.
good,Using Competence and innovation and customer focus to drive business and decision making.
good,Routine job and customers are pretty friendly...GREAT BENEFITS AND 401(k) PLAN
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"This company is supportive in growing their employees. Being a large organization, there are opportunities all around."
good,"Our management strives for customer loyalty. We want our customers to come back to us over and over for their mortgage needs. The management is very understanding, they are flexible with work and life and they treat their staff fairly. The hardest part of my work is during the busy season of spring through fall, when we are low on underwriters with certain authorities, it can be very difficult to maintain our 48 hour turn times which is very hard for our customers and our processors. "
good,"•	customer service, quality control, documentation, phones, "
good,"It's a bank.  Yes, they care about their employees, but it's still a big bureaucracy and everything takes so long to be approved."
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work and the company clearly has it's priorities in line. Profitability is number 1 and their employees are number 2. Maybe it was my manager that made me feel valued, but the company benefits and compensation was definitely fair. Unfortunately profitability was declining due to higher interest rates and I was laid off. The severance package helps, but the fact I don't have a job anymore hurts."
good,everyday is a challenge that brings on new adventures and excitement.
good,"Wells Fargo is an excellent company to work for.  However, if sales is not your forte, then this is not the company for you.  I worked here a year and a half, and I can say that advancement is primarily focused on numbers, how many accounts you open, loans, credit cards, and other products and services.  The management staff is supportive, but you are very much micro managed.  The compensation is not worth the effort if you ask me.  They justify the low base salary because there is the potential to earn bonuses.  However, you are also EXPECTED to make your quarterly goals.  As I said before, if you like sales, then this is a great job."
good,I love working for Wells. Work culture can differ from dept to dept.  I loved managemnt in both departments that I've worked in.
good,"Good work culture"
good,This was an excellent financial opportunity.  The fellow employees were great and the corporate culture was also.
good,"I manage a team of 19 team members at this time including 3 in Des Moines, Iowa.  Besides being a Work Director I am also the only Team Lead along with the Subject Matter Expert in all areas of my department.  In addition to this I also train and coach each team member and write new and update current procedures for all processes in our department.  The hardest part of my job is to be a wealth of information for all of my team members on all processes.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my team members become as knowledgable as they can be and take pride in their work."
good,Very cool and secure job.No tensions.Transport facility is good.Finished my contract and willing to work there.
good,A typical day at work consists of following up with prospects. Also contacting current book of buisness and assisting with the processing of files that are in underwriting. I do alot of cold calling to try and establish new business and set appointements for face to face potential clients such as CPA's and realtors.  My immediate branch manager was a great person who provided great support and understanding. We worked closely and had a great rapport and over 7 years of work history under the same manager. I enjoyed the flexibility my job provided. As long as quota was being met and exceeded there was absolutely no micro management and I was able to work from the office or home. I had a great working relationship with everyone in my office. We were like a family unit.
good,"Typically received loan applications to credit approve or decline.  Contacted loan officers and processors to discuss loan application issues at submission.  Contacted as well to discuss unusual items that may be needed to come to a credit approve or decline.  Received documentation for review to calculate income, assets and review credit situations in order to move the application to closing. Completed review of any changes the customer may have wanted at closing table"
good,"In tech, there are mostly good things to say about this place.  Some good projects and some excellent professionals, either the full timers or the contractors."
good,Thsi company also moved there processing center to Ohio.Otherwise I would have stayed.
good,"Trade Floor Support  high paced , no two days are  same. Training is great,"
good,i learnt to work as a team and to grow as a team. i enjoy working in my team as in we had lot of fun during birthday parties and team outings.
good,"*Work individually and in team to achieve monthly financial goals and allocating weekly report to manager."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,great experience and would do it again in a heart beat. Personal banker pay was great and you learn so much on the job and in banking every day. branch sales goals are a little crazy depending on what branch you work at but other than that its great.
good,i was a great place to work with great benifits and thirty days PTO right when you start.
good,"A typical work day consisted of reviewing all open, ongoing loan files that need additional paperwork and verification of needed loan documentation acquired/requested and ensuring that all received paperwork was complete, met the necessary processing guidelines, and was being processed within the prescribed deadlines."
good,"I would say Wells Fargo is a good company to work for.  A typical day at work for me includes being on a phone speaking with customers trying to go through a review process to see what options are available to them for retraining or liquidating their property.  I also would include working with daily reports, and another portion of my day would include working with specialty teams to roll out new procedures/systems/policies. "
good,"A typical day of work starts of by greeting everyone at work a big smile always makes another persons day no matter how bad or good of a morning one is having its gives a pleasant feeling.Then starts the typical day at work reviewing the previous day work done, calling customers back to make sure they were provided with excellent service and review what we did for them,make sure they were satisfied and had no further questions. Reduce wait time for customers in the teller line by doing straight deposits and help with any other banking questions they had. Lunch time is great  we usually have lunch with co workers in the break room, share some goofs and laughs. However, when it comes to helping each other with customers, opening an account, closing a CD or even dealing with difficult customers  which is the hardest part we stand up and lend a helping hand not matter if it wont benefit us in any way. As long as we are making our customer feel valued and that they have received the best level of service , had all their concerns and questions answered."
good,"Teller responsibilities, including cash handling, sales referrals, and compliance."
good,"Opportunity for growth, and different roles to transition to."
good,"Great Company to work for with great benefits."
good,"Sales environment, Great manager, Extensive knowledge in mortgage programs"
good,Good place to work with excellent leadership.  My department was moved to Alabama so the department was closed.
good,One thing that I loved about my job at Wells is I was always busy.  I cant say that enough.  I don't like jobs where you sit and twiddle your thumbs looking for work all day.  One thing is you had work from the minute you sat down to the minute you walked away to go home.  Yes we had overtime most of the time but that again didn't bother me its extra cash on your check.  I went in the mornings most of the time so it didn't take away from home life or school.  You get the job done you were fine.  My only problem is getting advancement was a chore.  Training on additional programs was always promised and then taken back.  I would say that was my only issue.  Some of the teams we had were pretty clicky like high school which was pretty childish as well.  But the good thing is we got to use head phones for our music.  So plug in and tune out was always nice. I did have the best managers while working there.  They helped me out during some medical issues I had and so understanding I couldn't have asked for more from them.  I wish I could have them with me at all my places from past to future.
good,It was a contract job but I learned a lot and would return if they were still around
good,"A lot of customer service interaction. Community banking can be great for small town lifestyles, room to grow but competitive."
good,"•a typical day at work- obtaining sales goals and helping customers succeed finically. "
good,"Good place to work"
good,"A typical day included setting up goals, balancing both your cash and the vault, customer service, and sales."
good,"good company , good pay , co workers are good! management like any other company has good ones and bad ones!"
good,"I like being challenged at work . I am very driven and competitive and very focused. "
good,"I was working in a back office, home mortgage operation as an operations analyst.  The work environment was very slow paced as an analyst.  Things were beginning to go through major changes as far as processing went.  As a fresh out of college graduate I was excited that i got to work with higher management right from the start. As an Intern I was invited to leadership meetings to develop new ways to be a better leader, and increase lean processing."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"It was a great place to work, the hours are awesome, the benefits and training are good. The environment is friendly and can be fast paced at times but there is a lot of product pushing especially credit cards."
good,worked in the tractor trailer and ag division for the credit and collections of commercial leases.
good,Always on the go and high volume. I have been put in charge of improving the out bounds area within their process. Their volume has increased greatly and has required long hours.
good,Overall Wells Fargo was a great company to work with. The benefits were great and the pay was great but the work environment was stressful at times. The best part of my job was working with the tellers to help then progress with Wells Fargo and helping them become successful.
good,"I took between 70 to 100 calls per day, I answered customers questions about their accounts while up selling different financial products to them.  I learned how to have patients and to empathize with our customers. The management at Wells Fargo were very understanding and helped to improve helped with areas that needed to be improved. The atmosphere was very friendly and everyone worked together and helped each other at Wells Fargo. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and overdraft fees on customers accounts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I made someones day, and the contest that management would create for the employees to have motivation."
good,"A fast paced but fun workplace where you need to be flexible as in this business change can be a constant.  Enjoy my co-workers and the hours I work.  I have learned how to deal with many different scenarios and experiences in this job, and look at this as a positive experience."
good,"I truly love my job. I enjoy the team I worked with. I love helping the customer with their transactions. Assisted the teller with challenges. Oversee the branch.  What I learned was the ability to meet all challenges the bank made. I provided support for  teammates in work and personal, as they did to me."
good,My last project with Wells Fargo was the windows 7 migration.  We were extremely busy on a daily basis.  My coworkers and myself would bounce questions on each other about the migration.  This really helped us to put our actions into motion.  The most difficult part of the job was that we could not keep employees on the project and that burdened the rest of us.  The employees that stayed were all very nice and we would joke around and try to make light of a very difficult project.
good,"Management likes to balance a home and work lifestyle."
good,A typical day at work involved meeting alot of people and dealing with quick transactions.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is looking for a solution to help home onwers stay in their home. I am required to review income and financials, credit reports, and other required documents to determine a work out plan for the customer. The hardest part of my job is meeting with the customers face to face knowing that there are no options. Having to infom them we are unable to provide retention options is the hardest bad news to give. I have learned many things about mortgage, credit, paystubs and deductions, policy and government guidelines and how to stay productive along with keeping up with quality due to policy change."
good,"It was fun to work in WF. I learned completely different financial application and automation tool. "
good,"Wells Fargo has a very aggressive sales culture, which depending on the banker can result in something that doesn't benefit the customer so much as it benefits the banker and institution. I felt because we were dealing with people's finances and credit, it should be relationship based with clients. The company does promote that through their marketing campaigns, but at the branch level those ideals quickly dissipate. Fortunately I was able to find a great balance with my return clientele. References I can provide will attest to the fact that I was able to keep my work relationship driven, by building that rapport and trust, I had a large volume of return clientele and referrals from them in my pipeline that I was able to match my sales goals solely due to that. Through building relationships and having those conversations I was able to do what was best for the customer and provide the product that suited them best for what was going on in their life, after they had built a relationship with me as their go to banker they trusted me enough to only come to me because they were always treated well and walked out completely satisfied. "
good,"Loved working  here, learned a lot form this company better opportunitys out there from this learning experience"
good,Excellent work place with good pay but very little job security.
good,"Personal Banking taught me how to fine tune many of my skills. Such as customer service and communication, profiling and sales, being creative when setting up offsite meetings, and keeping my motivation and staying positive"
good,alot of learning experience. trainings to get you to enhance your knowledge
good,"Fast pace call center environment"
good,Assisting clients with complex banking needs while expanding their relationship with the bank through needs assessment and offering products and solutions to business owners. Focus is on authentication and elevated authentication for online banking needs or profile maintenance through multiple program windows displayed across multiple monitor displays.
good,At Wellsfargo Advisors you have to use your time wisely during the day; Since it was a fast pace job at times during the day. The co-workers were very cooperatives when needed. I learned so much in the time I worked at Wellsfargo Advisors. I have to say it was worth the experience and the knowledge.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Work was somewhat challenging at times, but, in the end, it became a repetitive job. Nevertheless, there were always new things happening at the same time. Customer contact was very lively and keeps you on your toes. "
good,"Started as a 20 hour teller now a lead teller and through my increasing sales and above average customer service skills I was able to get promoted to Lead Teller. As a  Lead Teller I manage all the tellers in my branch. I am responsible for providing guidance, training, and support to all the staff that I manage. "
good,"Wells Fargo was a great place to work.  They have wonderful benefits and wonderful people working for them.  I enjoyed getting up and going to work every day!  I wish that I could continue to do so, but I was laid off in July."
good,"take in deposits and cash checks. "
good,There is a reason that Wells Fargo is by far the largest mortgage lender in the country--they are very good at what they do.
good,Reviewed medical claims for insurance benefits.  I worked there for almost 7 years.
good,"Great company to work for, but the sales push was ridiculous!"
good,I was Wells Fargo Mortgage back during the housing boom.  2000-2005.  we were taking alot of home loans over the phone.  The business was expanding and there were numerous advancement opportunities.
good,I learned a great deal at Well Fargo over the past years.  I have created very strong family like bonds with my co-workers that makes coming into the office almost feel like coming to my second home.  My managers have always taken great interest into our ideas and have readily given me advise in both personal and work related issues.  I have also gotten the privilege to meet a lot of interesting people in working directly with other companies on a daily basis as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to bring the ideas and requirements of the customer to the developers within Wells Fargo and have this application created that I know will help our clients with their day to day operations in a more efficient manner.
good,The management team is good at wells fargo and they help the team members in each and every possible way. They take care of even the minute to minute details which would help you better in processing as wells giving more profitable to the company
good,This is a very structured and organized company. They offer great PTO as well as Holiday pay.
good,"My job consists of helping internal customers with projects. As projects come in, while working on some of the projects with various team members, I also allocate other projects to three team members. Management is very supportive and lets us do our jobs according to company guidelines. I enjoy helping and working with people and have learned how to make each project a group effort. The important thing is to reach our goals on time, within budget while looking how what are the best options and opportunities presented before us. I work with people from all parts of the country with different backgrounds, which I truly enjoy. The hardest part of the job is at the end, when the project is complete and I know it may be awhile before I speak to co-workers that I enjoyed working with, but there are new projects and new people to meet everyday. I've been here 12 years and feel that there's more to learn and am looking at other opportunities as they present themselves."
good,"L & D training sections are good."
good,"Management was very supportive, enjoyed the team environment"
good,"In this role, I was able to learn other areas of the division, at this time the department had 5 different line of business'. A typical day would consist on travel arrangement, travel expenses, dictating from dictophone recorder, running VISIO reports. "
good,"Well Fargo is a great place to work if you want work life balance.  Sometimes things happen slowly as there are definitely layers of people that are incompetent.  For the most part though, people are really nice to work with and know their stuff.  I have only met about 10% that is completely incompetent."
good,Great place to work. SUPER culture. It is very teamwork oriented.
good,"Originally worked for Wachovia, but when the bank failed in 2009, it was bought by Wells Fargo.  The companies had cultures that matched in some areas and clashed in others.  Being on Wall Street, you definitely got to see how many other banks operated and it was obvious that Wells had a more relaxed California vibe to them which was great, in my opinion.  The major area that I found them lacking was in technology.  The systems they used were archaic and obtuse.  Wachovia, which was a large bank but still had a smaller NC bank mentality had far superior systems from the top down.  Learning the Wells systems required numerous nonsensical DOS codes that had to be entered just to get basic information.  I hope they've adopted some of Wachovia's legacy systems by now.  "
good,"Wells fargo offers great benefits and fair pay. They have a laid back attendance policy and understand ""life happens"". However, there are (in my opinion) too many numbers you must meet. You can only be on the phone with a customer for a certain period of time, so when customers need to file a claim, need explanation on what is going on with their account or have several questions they encourage you to rush them off this phone. This again in my opinion is a #1 way for customers to feel like wells fargo does not care about them as customers or as people. Bank accounts are something that is very personal and very important to everyone. The management tells bankers to make the customer feel like a person instead of an account yet wants us to get them off the phone right away regardless of their questions or concerns. The hardest part of the job is hearing about their problems and there being nothing you can do to help them thus making the customer more agitated. The most enjoyable part of the day is 5 o'clock.. quiting time"
good,"The day starts with a quick review of events scheduled. Then calls are made to clients to schedule presentations as well as enrollment meetings. Requests for proposals are addressed and dispatched. Once completed, I meet with my assistant to delegate tasks and report itinerary for day. I address any questions she might have and provide direction for work she will be completing for me while I am in the field."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells Fargo Financial- "
good,"I work 3:00am or 4:00am to finish. Sometimes may require 12 hrs."
good,"Performance Reviews"
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo , as a teller, is a story in it's self. From you remembering 20 different passwords and maintaining money and information. I learn the meaning of team work in this establishment. Believing in each other to reach a common goal and giving encouragement. Depending on how you are with meeting new people, is how you will form relationships with your co-workers. You form a bond over time with the people Wells Fargo and they too become a small branch of family. The hardest part was the goals and sales. For someone who wasn't asked to go out in the community to make sales, like others, it became difficult to reach those goals. "
good,"A typical day was supervising and managing the periodic disbursement unit with balancing and reconciliations. I learned that I had leadership skills the management was great. Co-workers still look to me as a leader today and it has been more than 10 years since we worked together. The hardest part of the job was moving on to other opportunities which provided me an opportunity to pursue and complete my education. The most enjoyable part of the job was researching, resolving and reconciling accounts that were out of balance....I loved the problem solving aspect of the job, being a leader, and being promoted to trust officer was my greatest highlight."
good,"Great physical place to work-fitness center, daycare, physician's offices, and national franchised restaurants.  Throughout my career I enjoyed a friendly and flexible workplace environment.  As a result of mergers and a decline in the company's profitability, afforded all the opportunity to identify cost savings for the company with many sources of recognition for the efforts thereof.  Great place to work, but many changes had started to take place due to a changing economy and market share.  "
good,So far its been the best company i have worked with. Everything about the company was really good.
good,"Typical workday can include;"
good,"I enjoy working with Wells Fargo but I'm also seeking opportunities for advancement. My preference is to work in Saint Louis County."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wells Fargo, but the sales culture is too much.  I had enough when I saw bankers literally signing people up for credit cards and other banking products and services (insurance, online banking, ect) without the customers consent or knowledge just to maintain some daily sales goal that they had to hit to not get griped at.  Otherwise every other aspect was top-notch and I would have remained if my ""moralality hadn't been so high"" (a quote from my manager)"
good,"I would open mostly and start my day with greeting and servicing the customers. The most challenging thing was reaching my goal with sales because they are set pretty high, but I made sure i did so. My co workers and I worked great together and my supervisor was very supportive and understanding. "
good,good management great place to work and great people to work with
good,"Wells Fargo is a great bank for a career and offers many opportunities for advancement. It's a high performing bank with high expectations of it's team members in terms of daily expectations, processes, and time commitment. However, when successful, it is a very rewarding company in terms of advancement, compensation, and recognition."
good,A good solid place to work with good benefits and a good management team.
good,they shove extra checking accounts down every one throught
good,"enjoyable work enviorment, high values in the workplace, high culture, great customer service"
good,"Wells Fargo has a great training program in customer services, mortgage and personal lending, and sales.  This training provided me with the foundation I needed to advance my career as an account manager."
good,Best in class organization with employees all dedicated to achieving the vision and mission statement of the company. Teamwork is a valuable and a necessary asset.
good,"A typical work day was: I unlocked the store, checked the mail, prioritized my work load, between real estate loans and or auto loans if any, processing of any loans that I was notified that were paying off. I answered the phones all day while working, met and greeted people for appointments or walk in's. Notarized documents for our deals, or any folks who needed documents notarized. Used all clerical skills, interacted with Loan Doc 3's and Underwriters all day on phone and through company email processing information."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Typical day:"
good,"My review of the company overall is a great place to work. Switchboard operator, preparation of mortgage documents and processed checks."
good,"I managed existing accounts by posting payments, resolving disputes, and handling collections on delinquent accounts.  "
good,Excellent company to work for but employment was unpredictable due to changes in the economy. 
good,"Typical production environment where I oversee 5-15 associates in their daily functions. responsible for maintaining integrity, safety, production, quality, and overall good morale in the workplace. I provide training, assistance, and step by step understanding to associates while maintaining the companies and customers expectation of quality work."
good,"Never typical.  Met with prospective clients and clients.  Helped design investments (stocks, bonds, tax shelters ( oil drilling, historic rehabs, catfish farms, windmill farms...) when tax shelters were profitable)."
good,daily task is to attend to the needs of every client that enters the building. Over the eight and a half years I worked there I learned alot about banking rules and procedures.
good,"It had started off great, the people were great and we had fun. However, the goals the management wanted you to achieve were unrealistic. You were told that it was not hard to meet quotas when it actually was because they were always changing. When you thought you were doing a great job all they had to say was that you need to work harder. If you are a great sales person and do not mind being yelled at EVERY DAY by the customers then this job will be easy for you. The management only care about the sales and not the actual customer service part of the job."
good,"Great experience, lots of sales a lot of fun when working for the right management team ."
good,"My job is busy day to day handling incoming requests, issuing bonds, billing policies, and solving client questions. I am more recently getting the chance to request, review, and analyze client financial statements, which I enjoy as I like more of a challenge. My boss is a very nice lady and my team is very small but close. The hardest part of the job is time management as I handle so many things throughout the day, but I think I handle it well because I know how to organize and prioritize well. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the clients and getting them what they need in an accurate and timely manner."
good,"Working with co-workers and customers was the best part of the teller/customer service job. For those who thrive in a semi-inside sales position, this is a good job. If your personality leans to the customer service side of things its going to be very stressful when you dont sell enough."
good,Great teammates in the Production Support area and very supportive of teaching you new applications and systems.
good,"Fun and positive environment to work for, I have worked for a few call centers and this by far is the best call center environment that I have worked in."
good,Communicated with portfolio managers on a daily business to review past investments and introduce new ones. Continuously learning new investments ideas and strategies. Worked mostly independently prospecting for clients. Helping and servicing clients achieve their goals was the most satisfying part of daily routine. The hardest part of the job was prioritising calls and reaching clients on a timely basis.
good,"When I started at the company, it was the best job I have ever had in my career in banking. Very stable company, great access to management, terrific working partners within the whole organization. Work was challenging, but very rewarding. Co-workers were always friendly and helpful. This firm had and has superior products and services to offer to its customers and spends a huge amount of time and money toward continuous product improvement and development of new services. Most enjoyable part of my job was being associated with a fantastic national team within my work group. I remained a proud employee of this firm throughout my entire time at the company."
good,"I was part of a 6 man team across the USA testing and deciding which methods/business practices were better between Wells Fargo and Wachovia during their merger. They were all very nice, smart business people."
good,"A typical day was to go into the office and pull up my pipeline. I would see where each loan stood in progress and get each one prepared for closing. I would then make outbound phone calls introducing myself and schedule an appointment with the client for a financial review. My goal was to uncover needs and develop solutions for the client, and build a relationship with the client. I had high loan and deposit goals, which I exceeded every month."
good,Wells Fargo places a focus on productivity and sales. This position took place in a call center environment surrounded by a number of co-workers. The hardest part of the job is that it is not always perdictiable however that is the a very exciting aspect of the job as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people with their financial need and setting them at ease by the end of the call.
good,Strong brand recognition
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Upper management was great to work with. They made sure you had all the resources to be successful. The downfall was growing to quick in a time that the economy was inflated.
good,"• Provide financial consulting for personal and business clients, evaluate their long term financial goals – establish, cultivate, safeguard, and expand long-term relationships with clients • Work with small to medium sized businesses to meet financial needs and requirements of business ownership and management • Strengthen new business, prospect and identify qualifying leads for existing customers • Continuing education in industry financial products, proper asset allocation; operation and administration of Wachovia policies and procedures • Exceed Sales and Customer Service Goals for Department and Self – Top Tier Producer in Total Sales, Asset Growth, and Loan Production • Successfully completed Wachovia Management Placement Curriculum, serve as alternate Branch Manager in Banking center as needed • Integrate Compliance practices in daily work activity • Conduct weekly motivating sales meeting with teller staff"
good,working with bank customers sales and service
good,"Learned alot at this company and started my career there. However, due to the aquisition with First Union I had to look outside opportunities."
good,This was a six week assignment but was a pleasant experience and the training was very good.
good,Co-Workers are great
good,"Not many companies these day's offer the flexability to work from home. Wells Fargo has taken it upon themselves to allow certain employee's from my department to work from home. I was selected to do so and it's VERY nice for family/work balance. I have 2 kids, so being closer to them is a great bennefit! My office is downtown and the commute to get to and from was over an hour each way. Not many team building excercises are available. Lots of pot lucks and during the holiday's, there are cookie exchanges, but other then that, everyone stay's at their desk and doesn't talk. It's a very quiet environment in the office."
good,"With Wells Fargo, a typical day involves getting to work early to be organized, also to reconnect with my associates. We also have a short meeting to start off the day with positive attitudes to assist our customers. We are extremely busy throughout the day, and always help each other remain upbeat."
good,Typical financial industry environment with lots of opportunity for growth
good,personally i love my job but it is had to get more pay aside from how long ur with the company.
good,I believe Wells Fargo is a Great Company. I do feel that it is geared towards a younger employee team.
good,"Daily Team Huddle with new expectations for sales quotes and management turnover, I learned to go with the flow, there were many changes daily, confusion out getting credit for our sales and changes to our duties daily, nothing was very consistent , lunches were changed as you would be walking out the door, although i always tried to go with the flow and do what was best for the team. The best part about my job were the customers and giving them quality service which I personally felt that every customer was important and valid no matter what. I loved my customers and my teammates that worked hard for the team."
good,"Responsible for building and maintaining relationships, with a resulting high degree of customer satisfaction. A “WOW” satisfaction."
good,"Wells has a large number of experienced and competent individuals on their project teams. There is a little too much bureaucracy left over from the Wachovia merger, but they are working through the final stages. In the end, I look back on my time at Wells favorably. My hard work was recognized and I was advanced twice."
good,"As a dispatcher, I spent nearly 100% of my time on the phone responding to or following up with customers who have account orders placed. Responsible for logging each call via PC daily. In a typical day there would be at least 75 or more calls. I was able to increase my ability to multitask. I was able to get along with co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was the lack of benefits or job security. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people on most of my calls."
good,"Open accounts, service customers needs and make sure to balance your cash everyday."
good,Hardest part of the job is finding non business clients and getting to meet them face to face. Wells Fargo provides many outlets to help you with the job and the goals are attatinable with the right practices.
good,"• Answering Wells Fargo team member questions regarding benefits, policies, programs and online tools associated with human resources."
good,Wells Fargo was a great company to work for.

good,Excellent compensation for the IT Professional and a challengine work environment.
good,Diverse group of employees solely focused on the customer.
good,Working with customers on a day to day basis to gather documentation to review for potential modifications. I have learned a lot about the different types of mortgages as well as learned a lot about credit policies and procedures.
good,"Work long hours but you learn a lot about giving the best customer service in all types of interactions and situations. Co-workers are great, most tellers are part-time and also go to school. Bankers tend to be full-time ""lifers"". Very hard to earn a raise and it's also high risk since bank robberies are on the rise. It is great meeting knew people and you learn a lot about mortgages, other types of loans, laws, taxes and other financial situations that can help you personally in the future."
good,Assisting clients with their banking needs.
good,Sometimes the bank is a great place to work and other times it's not.
good,"Intrduced new programs, and training for every emplyee our division."
good,Wells Fargo & Co is also a great avenue for a financial services career. Progression is a little faster I believe at Wells Fargo & Co. I enjoyed my time there.
good,Productive place to work with a great working enviorment at Wells Fargo.
good,"Fun to work only because of friends made, managers are uptight on sales, training sticks to what credit cards are instead of teaching how to sell irrelevant products to callers"
good,"This is not a company you will like if your into finger pointing and blaming someone else but if you take pride in what you do, strive to excel while following procedures that are established for loss prevention, and utalize the resources they provide( they do provide) then you should do well."
good,I worked at Wachovia before it was sold to Wells Fargo. Best job I ever had.
good,"Wachovia was a good place to work. I learned a lot about my department and responcibilities. The people I worked with wear team plyers. Wachovia is now wells fargo which in turn laid off long time, dedicated, experienced employees."
good,"fun team members to work with, great way to inprove in customer service relationships."
good,"Typically I arrive 30 minutes before everyone else.I'll start my day by catching up on email and voice mail and if there are any urgent requests' I'll immediately get to work on them.Then I'll start planning out my day and make a list of everything I plan to accomplish.And if I'm in sales I make it my top priority. I learned how to manage time,and delegate work to co-workers.The hardest part of my job is for me not to delivery what I promise. And accomplishing my goal above and beyond expectation. is my most enjoyable part of the job."
good,As a contractor I only rated the items that applied to me.
good,The most enjoyable part of my day is meeting new people and helping them with all there needs and having them leave happy. The hardest part is the managments scheduling or lack of. I have learned how to get the same work done in then same amount of time with half the amount of people.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wells fargo is a great place with room for growth however, sometimes they put the sales goals over everything. Employees are forced to sale sale sale! Management has changed 3 times in the year that i have been there, which shows me that no ones job is secure! The higher ups frequently visit which makes the company very personable! The benefits and pay are great."
good,"I interact with multiple levels of management and team memebers on daily functions and reporting needs and staffing. In addition, I work in a high productive area in which I multi-task daily to ensure the needs of the team members/co-workers and management are met and deadlines are completed."
good,"8-9 hour days working with clients/customers in a fast paced, upbeat environment. Sales was a big part of daily tasks, as well as handling large amounts of cash, updating legal documents/logs, balancing cash vaults, ATM maintainence, customer service tasks, product knowledge, educating customers and advising them on the best ways to save and invest their money. I learned a great deal about the value of customer service and visual appeal to clientel, the impact of professional marketing materials, and how to be a sales woman. Management was very tactful, as was the job, which was good for me to keep on schedule. I worked very well with all of my co-workers, a sturdy support system was very much needed due to sales aspects and responsibilities.The hardest part of my job was learning how to better my sales tactics (I tend to be more of a customr service oriented employee). The most enjoyable part of my job was making customers smile by enhancing their financial situations."
good,It's a phone job so you get a variety of customers to talk too. The cafeteria is expensive and not worth the cost. It is hard to advance in the field.
good,It was a great place to work. As a Mortage Consultant you were in and out of the office at appointments. Everyone was easy going that worked there and pleasant to be around. I learned a lot from my managers and the seasoned consultants that were there. that was very beneficial to me. I t was difficult at times but you could always pick up the phone and call someone in the company to ask questions.
good,"A good place to work. I enjoy customer interaction, building relationships with them."
good,Each department worked closely together; each person were responsible for a certain bulk of work but would help other coworkers if needed.
good,it is a fun place to work with great people who work here. it does provide a nice compensation plan if you can wait 4 months to bonus
good,"a typical day at work is answering between 60-100 calls servicing all types of customers concerns. what i can take away from working here is listening to the customer's complete story before answering any questions. Immediate managers were understanding and willing to help you succeed, however upper management was unapproachable. co-workers are very supportive as it was a team effort everyday to reach our goals. the hardest part about the job was sitting for eight hours :) the most enjoyable part of this job was getting that customer that is frustrated and yelling at you, but by the time you finish the call they cant stop thanking you for meeting their needs"
good,"Out of my 13 year stint at Wells Fargo Bank, I was able to utilize my skill set. The employer has great core values, and plentiful avenues for advancement"
good,"A typical workday consisted of taking care of incoming customer traffic. Supervising employees, observations, coaching, training. High volumes of cash handling, solving customer account concerns and issues. I had some supervision myself, I managed various employees. The hardest part of this job was dealing with higher management. I enjoyed the employment all around."
good,Assisting existing and new customers with existing and new products while generating new buisness through calls and refferels.
good,"I analyze different financial and sales reports to determine and plan on service and sales goal. I also lead 14 direct and indirect reports through consistent coaching, leadership, risk management and team building activities through out the day. I am also responsible for ensuring my team is operating with compliances under audit and operational regulations and guidelines."
good,Stable company with flexible hours and schedules. Great environment
good,"Really friendly co-workers. Flexible schedules, some really nice customers."
good,I love my management team and they are a great support system.
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering incoming calls and acting as a financial consultant with each customer. I normally assist customers with bank deposits, transfers, claims, disputes and payments. I enter confidential account information into the companys data base and after assisting customers with their needs i normally upsell a new product or service that can benefit the customer financially. Managment is normally out each day greeting us and checking on indivial and team metrics. The most enjoyable part of my job would be ineracting with customers and the use of computers. The hardest part of my job would be not being able to interact much with customers or professionals physically face to face. My co-workers are very friendly and fun to work with."
good,"comfirm appointments, make cold calls, work with existing clients, meet with new prospects. Open new accounts, set new appointments for the week."
good,9am-7 pm work day:
good,I enjoyed my position with Wells Fargo. I felt I provided a much needed service to those who were in danger of losing their homes. I excelled in taking care of stressed homeowners by helping them calm down and then providing options to help save their home from the dangers of foreclosure. Were it not for a poorly diagnosed illness I would still be In this position.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Wachovia Bank was an exceptional place to work for. Of course, there where the ups and downs of a Corporation of this size. What I liked most about it was the family oriented work place."
good,I enjoy my position at Wells Fargo. Sales is the top priority. Management offers plenty of incentives.
good,"Assisting Service Manager,Tellers, and Customers"
good,"The training at Wells Fargo has to be some of the best in the business. They truly take the time to make you feel comfortable with your new transition if you're new to the company or if you just got promoted. The work seems overwhelming at first but if you're willing to put in the work and grind it, you'll absolutely succeed. Lazy people, don't apply. If you're looking for a low wage job with more job security this isn't for you. You need to be proactive in what you do and willing to keep an open mind because there's so many ""right ways"" to do things. You can feel a sense of pride in what you do once you've seen the fruits of your labor. It definitely adds to the whole experience of the job."

good,Good company to work for with a family; great work/life balance; flex time offered; typical work day
good,great company. great benefits. I have learned a lot. Nice co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed Wells fargo except for the fact that they are getting carried away on their sales goals and monthly service fees for customers. Management was great and the environment was wonderful except for the fact that most of the personal bankers seemed to hate their job but stayed because the pay was good. Teller pay was pretty good and the quarterly payout if you make your sales goals was great. Overall, it's a decent job but high expectations."
good,-Good place to work
good,"I enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. Management is pretty good for the most part. My co-workers were great, I even have a life long friend that I made while I worked there. The hardest part was starting every quarter over again at zero. However I was successful most of the quarters I worked there. The most enjoyable part of the job was the value place on the job I did."
good,Care about developing employees. Small but diverse team and great unity within company.
good,Good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work would start by setting up teller stations for the upcoming day, reviewing the vault and during the day processing customers transactions and businesses by adhering to all applicable laws and regulations governing bank operations. I've learned that going out of my way to please customers earns their businesses more efficiently and makes work more enjoyable. Management is very professional and very willing to help us reach our goals. The hardest part of the job is consistent pressure to bring in businesses for the company."
good,I worked in a production area high pace job. Researched and reconciled customer disputes and other financial insitutions request. Hardest part when we didn't have all the tools need to complete the request in a timely manner.
good,Loved the job. Supervisor brought personal problem to work. Overall good job

good,"A days work was very busy, and I liked that. It was a good place to work. Management and co-workers were great."
good,I do not have typical days at work which is one thing that I like about my role at Wells Fargo. Internal Audit is a great place to get exposure to many different lines of business within the bank. My co-workers are mostly a pleasure to deal with and there are numerous opportunities to work on different teams. The hardest part of my job is communicating issues and getting support from senior management. The most enjoyable part of my job is the continuous learning.
good,"Wells Fargo is fast-paced and does well in managing their releases, implementing upgrades, and business continuity and fail over activities."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Learned a great deal about financial planning
good,"The co-works at the company are wonderful. Very easy to get a long with and made the day great. The work could be stressful. High stress enviorment, fast pased.

good,"I enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. People were nice, management was good. Job was fun. Only thing, due to the economy, job stability was gone."
good,A typical day at work can be either busy or slow depending on the time of month. Its a great place to work whether to want to learn and move up or if you are comfortable and want a steady paycheck. It is what you make it.
good,"Experienced a taste of corporate culture. Gain basic knowledge to financial services industry. Get to meet a lot of successful individuals, business owners, millionaires, and professional athletes."
good,Wells Fargo continues to provide excellent customer service and leadership skills within its organization to best suit the customer and their experience with their bank. Wells Fargo is demanding of quality control and professionalism but in return treats their family of employees very well and is always looking to improve within the work environment. Their cultural diversity and acceptance make it a great place to work.
good,"Most all staff is fun to work with, fast paced work environment, great for people out of college"
good,"As the Regional Sales Manager I was responsible for hiring, training, coaching, and ethics of over 35 Sales Professionals, and 10 support staff. A very good position as I gained much valuable experience."
good,"Wells Fargo strives on customer satisfaction, integrity and diversity."
good,Stable work environment for those in need of employment. No room for personal growth and no compensation increases or incentives.
good,Working at Wells Fargo taught me many skills. It was a challenging learning environment. The negative thing about the company is their neverending pressure for sales.
good,Solid background & history with many employees & job security.
good,Wells is a great company to work for with respect to job security and an inclusive culture.
good,Management expectations are high and at times demanding. Given the right circumstance growth opportunities do exist.
good,The company allows flexibility to allow you to have family time and be able to tend to appointments etc. the only bad thing is pay. You have a lot of training opportunities within the company which is also great.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo offers a variety of employment opportunities with room for advancement. They offer competitive pay and an ability to learn. The benefits such as time off and family care are amazing.
good,Wells Fargo takes care of their employees. I enjoyed my time with the company! They have good benefits and there's a lot of opportunity to move around within the company; whether it be moving up or laterally.
good,"Quality career felt like managers weren't to intersested in helping the employees. Medical, Vision, Dental were offered along with 401k options with Wells Fargo matching a percentage of what you invested each pay period"
good,I enjoyed my time there.  The people were very nice.  The work was interesting.  Equipment for contractors was inadequate.  A typical day was attending a lot of meetings or phone conferences.
good,Great company - would work there again. Benefits package was very good. Great team of workers. Company training was very good too. Cant think of what else to say to make up the required minimum of 150 words.
good,"I am working in Wells Fargo form more than 1 year, Work Culture is very good, Team Members are very helping, Facilities  are very good but you will not learn new technologies much, they are working on old technologies ."
good,"All positions were remote, but the team worked together well and support each other.  The shift was 1400-0000.  The hardest part was the inability to take any time off."
good,I loved my job and my co-workers. Wells Fargo goals at the time were a bit high and we had to walk business to business trying to get people to open accounts which was not a safe thing and when it was really hot or cold it was not a pleasant thing to do.
good,I enjoyed the challenge of learning new things in a constantly changing environment. I enjoyed my team and working there was a nice experience overall.
good,"I have enjoyed working here, I am really looking for more advancement than currently possible within the company. They have amazing benefits and truly appreciate their team"
good,I’d work there again.  The job was great and the management was always eager to help out with coaching and job leadership.  Once sales goals were eliminated it made the job much easier to focus on customer service and care.
good,Employees are like family. Enjoy working here because of the people I work with. I learned a completely new way to provide customer service because of Wells Fargo which I will always carry with me.
good,I think Wells Fargo is a great company to work for but I wanted to move to another area of banking but the pay was less and I would loose my seniority so I decided to start my own business from home providing these services. I like to be around others so I'm looking for a company that I can provide excellent customer service as well as interact with other people.
good,"They have amazing benefits such as paid time off and paid 4 month maternity leave. However, it is hard to move up from the teller position as not a lot of positions open frequently."
good,"The company as a whole is awesome to work for and they offer a ton of HR support as needed. The only issue is the politics of the individual districts. Most positions that are vacant usually have someone in branch or district just waiting on the formalities to be completed. They also tend to value, (in terms of salary) targets coming from outside the company."
good,It was good working here. It depends how u take it. I worked in india so overall I would good 3.5 out of 5. Shift was good. Promotion s were not on time.
good,"The people I work with are generally all pretty consistently great. I don't have much to strongly state about it one way or another. The compensation is fair, especially entrance level. PTO and benefits are hard to beat."
good,Working at Wells Fargo can be a great place for someone to learn and enhance their skills. If you enjoy working with people this would be an excellent job. You must be able to take advice and cannot be afraid of objections.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"First of all not everyday is the same. some days are better than others. when i get to i start by checking my team velocity , to know how work is work is improving. Schedule meetings and send emails to my team members."
good,"Friendly customers, steep policies, constantly observed, always worried about training and policies, friendly staff, great benefits. Most enjoyable part is customer recognition."
good,Personally the branches i was at had great management and I was able to grow within the company. My branch was like a family. I was able to engage with my customers and had a variety of options to offer to them
good,A typical day at the job entailed monitoring client's accounts for fraud.  I gained a wealth of knowledge about fraud prevention.  Management was very supportive and invested in your success.  The workplace culture was inclusive and supportive.
good,This was a great beginning to my career.  I learned much about the industry and had many great mentors over the years. I truly enjoyed the culture of caring during my time with the company.
good,"They strive for diversity and inclusion and helping people reach their financial goals, not just for customers but also for their employees. They offer great benefits and career opportunities."
good,I have learned a lot of things working at Wells Fargo. I have enjoyed my time there but I am looking to further my career and going through the promotion process with Wells Fargo has been slower than I would like it to be.
good,"Wells Fargo offers great benefits from Medical, Dental, and Vision to attorney insurance.  The hours are also flexible and allow for planning around a family."
good,"Good employer, great benefits, very community minded and strongly encourages volunteering.  Lots of opportunity to move within the company in different roles."
good,I loved working for the company. I made many long lasting friendships. My manager was awesome. She was very supportive of my work. The only reason I'm not there is due to company wide layoffs.
good,I think you will find the job easy to do once you go through the proper training. I learned about how to be ready for a change at all times. The management does not have close/good work relationship with employees.
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work as long as you’re doing something you like  "
good,"I was able to work my way up the ladder in a short amount time. I started as a banker, and within a year, I was promoted to a Business Specialist. One year later, I became a Business Sales Consultant."
good,"Wells Fargo provides great PTO packages, compensation and benefits.  Work life balance is encouraged.  Company is a 300 year old risk averse bank, so technology isn't as cutting edge as a more innovative tech company and company is constantly re-orging"
good,"I actually love working for the company my first year. but the longer I work there, the more benefits they’re taking away. We had a couple of incentive programs we could take advantage of that have now been removed. PTO is great and you have paid gov holidays. Managers are great and very helpful."
good,"Good company to work for, but needs to  compensate more for sales and additional job skills learned. Wants you to bring in more business but doesn’t compensate like other financial institutions."
good,I out was a great company to work for. Good teammates and good supervisors that helped me reach my goals. Very honored to have had that experience there
good,The facility has an onsite gym and cafeteria with options for breakfast/ lunch. In addition opportunities to  stay involved in community service are available.
good,Solid company with good benefits and pay.  Team members are highly skilled and motivated.  Environment can be aggressive at time depending on department.
good,"My tenure at Wells Fargo has been enjoyable and if it were not for the limit on contract length, I would readily continue to work here."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo has been a great place to work and grow my career  opportunities are present as long as you are dedicated and work hard. In a company this big you have to find a way to stand out
good,"Sometimes it felt like we didnt care about the customer needs. Good pay otherwise, and Wells Fargo is a well structured organization, just sometimes the rude customers that were screwed over by the bank were a huge burden on morale."
good,"good work place. work life balance. God salary. Good work environment."
good,"It was a pretty sweet gig. Kinda regret leaving. Moving up is a little tough though. It's more about who you know than your work ethic but, if you have people skills, that should be no biggie."
good,Had a goof work/life balance but the job itself was a bit boring. You're doing the same thing everyday for 8 hours a day. If you don't mind being seated in the same position for 8 hours then the job is bareable.
good,"Fair management, overtime season can be stressful, interview process fair, work culture is positive, your career is what you make it so keep a lookout for opportunities"
good,"Wells Fargo is a good place to work. Pay is decent. Co-workers and employees are held to a higher standard! Schedule is optional once you have reached a certain time within the company! My overall experience with Wells Fargo was good, minus the pay. Great job for beginners of customer service."
good,The only complaint I have is lack of work/life balance and inconsistency with remote access.  I’ve held 2 roles with partial remote access that management elected to remove access within 6-9 months of accepting the position.  I’d negotiated a higher salary had I known I would be commuting full-time 120+ miles a day.
good,Its flexibility and cooperative efforts between lines of business has helped me moved forward and has given me a peace of mind about our work culture.
good,Meeting every morning to discussed sales objectives and goals.  Follow throughout the day to track progress toward sales goals.  Enjoyed interacting with customers and assisting in meeting their financial goals.
good,Wells Fargo is a good place to work with ample opportunity for advancement.  If you work hard you can succeed. They offer good pay and solid benefits.
good,Overall it was a good part time job. It would be a great job to be in while attending school. I switched jobs due to needing to increase my hours and pay.
good,"Over all it’s a Good Company "
good,"They pay was decent for me since I have another income from my spouse, but could improve. They are big on community events and team member recognition. My manager and team were great and very supportive and helpful."
good,great place great people dedicated to making you successful. enjoyed working there. personal reasons i had to go. nothing bad to say. culture great! would have stayed if other situation wasnt present.
good,"Casual working environment I looked forward to going to work each day, each assignment was fun and challenging and that's what I like about my occupation as a maintenance technician"
good,"Teamwork makes the Dreamwork environment."
good,I absolutely loved working at Wells in Fargo Grover Beach CA. My supervisors were very supportive and helped me move up in the company. I started as a regular teller and within a year I was promoted to Lead Teller. I loved my customers and my coworkers.
good,"Good hours, great management, and awesome people that I got to work with and meet. Not a hard job at all. But you do have to memorize a lot of things."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,competitive area. sales need to be done. main goal is to fulfill customers needs and make sure they are satisfied with the product you have mentioned to them.
good,It’s okay but I felt like I was doing the sane thing every day. I’m just tired of the schedule but I really like the compensation they get there as far as meeting your goals
good,Over all good place to work. Good advancement.  Great people to work with.  Fun atmosphere. Good choices of schedules.  Would go back in a heartbeat if there were one in Missouri
good,Good job for those with good communication skills and a lot of patience. Good maternity leave. Job just wasn’t for me anymore. I had a bad branch manager but a great SM
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo as a temp for Talent Bridge, they welcome me and made me feel very much comfortable and at ease.  I was able to do my job with no mistakes and I was always congratulated for that."
good,"Good company to learn collections if your new to it.  They give you a great deal of time off compared to other company’s ive worked for."
good,Co-workers are friendly and make you feel welcome - overall the work environment was good. You receive good benefits even being part time and the branch manager was always focused on both the staff and customers.
good,Wells Fargo gave me the platform to start my professional career in the finance industry. It gave me knowledge and experience in order to start making my own career path.
good,"Very good Management and learning opportunity."
good,"Options for advancement, kinda stressful work environment, great benefits, and quarterly compentions. No longer sales culter more customer service based."
good,"During my time at Wells Fargo I learned a lot. The knowledge I learned as helped me to grow as a business professional. After a year I was able to get promoted and advance. Advancement at times is not easy, as many candidates will often look to move up, but many opportunities arise. Although at times there is drama in the bank, if  you can look past that and keep level headed, you can go far. Overall, a great start and  not a bad place to work."
good,"Good place to start a career in finance, you'll learn a lot by being exposed to all different kinds of businesses. Pay is better then average, good benefits."
good,"Depending on the branch you work at, you will either have little to no traffic or an overwhelming number of people to serve. Customers, depending on the area, may be pleasant or they can be hostile. Wells Fargo as a whole is not a bad place to start and build a career but be very aware of the area you are applying because it can completely change your experience."
good,I worked hard and long hours but was an enjoyable job. Had great co-workers whom  I am still friends with. Loan processing was a high stress job trying to meet all deadlines.
good,As a fresher I have seen how the corporate works and also I have learned worklife balance. The management is very cooperative .The work culture is friendly in nature.
good,I enjoyed all my co-workers I enjoyed my store location and I definitely enjoyed my customers. They offer good training. All in all great company to work for
good,"Wells Fargo is a fine employer.  The difficulty of working their is that the company is constrained by past bad decisions.  Also, employees are very geographically dispersed, which makes relations building difficult."
good,"Working in wells fargo made me to be a panctual, time management and sincere to my work, working hard, competitive environment, encouraging team members for their performance  etc....."
good,"Great place to learn and explore various specialties. Typical day is full, expect to stay busy. Hardest part of the job is the size of the organization and finding resources to maximize efficiency."
good,"I was laid off in 2016, however my manager offered me the opportunity to relocate, which I accepted.  I relocated to Des MoinesIA Then was laid off again October 2018"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great place to work, fun exciting and good team work! Enjoyed working with Wellsfargo and would love to work as an FTE "
good,"Comfortable place to work. But as an HR specialist I feel my pay rate should be more."
good,"It is highly regulated and one little mistake can cost you your job. Everything is about risk and therefore job security is not good. Everything that you do, you have to record in details to cover yourself."
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work and the interview process was quick and informative. Management played favorites but other than that I would definitely recommend this job.
good,My time as a teller at Wells Fargo was great. We got to focus a lot on our customer service. The company had a lot of volunteer opportunities that Wells Fargo offered. Their work/life balance was as you expect from working banking hours and the pay was very reasonable for entry-level positions. It is a corporate like company so it isn't for everyone but for those that enjoy it you have a lot of opportunities to move up with in the company. They do offer financial help services for employees and have some mental health initiatives for those that need that helping hand.
good,"Its an exceptional workplace, we have a foodcourt like spacious pantry. gym and its new built building looks like a hotel because of its amenities. Wells fargo also offers alot of benefits for its team members. One thing I dont like about it thats why I was burn out its because of its management team."
good,"Due to department relocations, and layoffs.I can truly say I really enjoyed working for Wells Fargo. Hopefully I can once again.Good work environment."
good,"It was a nice place to work.  I would steer clear of the commercial banking sector, however.  There are better opportunities to be sought outside of this niche."
good,"Wells Fargo is large and diverse.  There are many opportunities for job seekers who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn the job and work hard. Whether you are looking for an entry level position or a continuation of an established career, Wells Fargo is an excellent choice to pursue."
good,"Great company’s to work for "
good,The overall culture of Wells Fargo is a large Company that narrows your responsibilities to one task. You are not expected to know other aspects of banking besides your role so you can focus and gain experience on that one role.
good,"While it's a long standing company, it's still in the news with the Banking Issue of 2016. Management is very supportive and friendly and want you to succeed. However, for the amount of knowledge one must have for this job and what is needed the wages need to start at least $3-4 higher than what is listed. There are so many different variant scenarios that it is hard to sometimes get an answer. Plus, I still have a morality issue working for a big company who has harmed it's consumers."
good,"Enjoyed the Ongoing Online Coursework Required to stay informed in the laws and regulations of the company in all areas of products."
good,"Team Lead: "
good,"Wells Fargo is a great company. I like the culture and values. I worked with great US counterparts in San Francisco, Reno and San Antonio."
good,"I loved the people i worked with and had a great time. My issue however comes from the fact that after less than a year of working there, it was announced that out branch was closing and were were all going to be ""displaced"". It came as quite a shock to us as a team, considering were were located in a busy tourist town. Despite the closure take place, our team was very close and made it though, and Wells Fargo compensated us for the closure. Overall though the closure was stressful, the company itself is great, and i loved working there for the time I did"
good,Pretty good company to work for.  Lots of tools in place to help employees succeed.  Great work/life balance and not very stressful.  Decent benefits.
good,"Wells Fargo did a great job of recognizing their team members. Aside from the aggressive sales atmosphere, this was actually a great place to work. The benefits were great! I would go back if I knew things had changed sales-wise."
good,"Work days could be fast or slow depending on the day. Management around me was A+. "
good,"Great company that really believes in serving others and helping its customers . Together we go far! Wells Fargo has great work life balance, enjoy working here"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Very regimented and structured regarding PTO and time off, as well as lunch periods, but the people are very good to work with/for. If you work hard and meet your job requirements, you can be rewarded."
good,Decent job and learned a lot of life lessons. They do promote within and but its competitive in the work place to get the next position up. Like most corporate has some BS
good,Loved the job and supervisors was great. No hard to move up if qualified and if an opening is available. Vacation was awesome. They give you 23 days  from the first day of work. However pay can be low depending on what department you are in .
good,"Good people to work with, customers are also nice to help.  Upper management still focused on sales goals although they call it something else.  But its still the same."
good,"It was a great place to work, they had good hours, and pay was good. At that time they gave commission for opening new accounts. The push for tellers to sell was pretty much the reason why I ended up leaving. They would wants us to sell to every single customer and it was getting out of hand. I think they stopped doing that now so it should be better."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the complexity of the QA position and all that it entailed. The hardest part of the job was the work-load or job production.  The workplace culture was relaxed. even during the challenging times.
good,Wells Fargo is a work life balance organization. You have the opportunity to grow and advance with getting involved along with networking. The company also focus on Diversity and Inclusion.
good,"It was a pleasure working there, the only thing about it i was placed on a bad schedule for my schooling. They were unwilling to work with my schedule, which made it tough for me to attend school."
good,The company was well trained. The associates would be great to talk with. The management would make sure you're following the correct steps with customers or others on the phone.
good,"My employment was during a refinance craze,  rates very low and lots of loans needing to be reviewed. Very strong commitment atmosphere.  The scene of pride made the long days endurable"
good,"Amazing People around, Learnt a lot of things, Amazing workplace culture, the most enjoyable part of the job was having events very often for the Team Members to have a great time while at the office."
good,"Best part of the job is the amount of Paid time off you get. Starting in January, you automatically are granted 144 hours for Paid time off which is 18 days. Every 3, 5, 10, etc. years, you get an additional 40 hours which is 5 days."
good,"Wells was a great place to work but my only complaint personally was the lack of flexibility with your schedule. There are quarterly shift bids but otherwise if you need to move your hours, which I did, you can’t."
good,"Working with Wachovia/Wellsfargo is a great experience. I  have had lots of room for growth and have worked with some great people with so much knowledge. Everyday you learn and grow. I have worked closely with many mentors, and also able to develop and coach many team members ."
good,Typical day at work includes working on scheduling and ensuring that the team is highly engaged. Customer experience is another huge focus as well as managing daily risk.
good,I encourage anyone who is interested in a long-term career to apply at Wells Fargo.  The broad range of benefits and career advancement offered is enough to compete with even the best of Fortune 500 companies.
good,No bonuses or overtime but always has weekends off. Benefits and 401k contribution help to prepare for future as well as tuition reimbursement for similar fielded studies
good,"Mostly good. Please are friendly. But very hierarchial and slow. Some of them in the managers are legacy and insecure. So if you happen to work with them, your career growth is gonna be slow."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"goal are set in place and were easyly   achieved with very little supervision. I learned how to work effectively"
good,Great benefits and over all great start to a financial career. Pay is decent and benefits are unmatched. Found advancement opportunities seldomly arise.
good,I loved what I did and the pay was good but more so the reward for helping work with others in a tough time as to get that delinquent but to not make them feel worse as to truly sympathize with them yet also give them guidance to see I wasn’t the bad man rather someone to assist was wonderful. My bosses and teammates were great but to walk In one day and be told the office was closing was sad but Wells Fargo paid us all one months wages and too beyond that accordingly to your tenure along with the benefits as well. Very solid company and know it was a business decision and they still took care of us while seeking our next career move!
good,"I like it even though some employees are racial and can make your day a little stressful. Other than that, it’s a good place to work. If it was a 8-4 job it would be a great place to work but the long long hours makes it a stressful tiring place"
good,Wells Fargo is a very large company with many layers.  They do promote a diverse culture and have excellent training programs.  Management on the local level is very good.  The job itself is very stressful.
good,Wells Fargo is a great place to work. Some departments are better than others; could be more collaborative and innovative; has provided a flexible work schedule for home/work balance.
good,"The only con I have had was a home work life balance, depending on your manager this may be more or less doable. They have great pay and a lot of room for growth and love to promote within."
good,"WF Wealth Management has really been a great professional experience. Through an extremely supportive team I have been able juggle not only a professional and family life, I have also been able to continue my education."
good,Although there was a lot of pressure placed on sales the company did value strong customer service skills. The compensation was fair and the management listened to their staff.
good,Develop relationships with others in the industry to develop a network of referral sources to gain clients.  Process loan applications and fulfill requests through funding.
good,"My time at Wells Fargo-  i started my day by logging my computer. open all of my work related apps."
good,"No place is perfect, and there are some managers that are not in the right positons to lead people, but overall the culture of WF does what they can to make sure employess like where they work."
good,"Banking job, very pushy environment. Lot's of reports and goals, must be self motivated, training is available. My suggestion to employees who wish to build a career is to study and apply for financial licenses."
good,"Wells Fargo has had its challenges due to the decisions made by top managers, which affect the employees that interact with clients face to face. Yes, they have tried to make up for the issue by giving us two additional PTO days and increasing the 401k match for one year by 1%, but they have significantly decreased our incentive pay and have not increased banker pay. Tellers, on the other hand, have the luxury of beginning their careers at Wells Fargo at a pretty decent hourly rate. The pay gap is closing between tellers and bankers and that honestly should not be since bankers have exceedingly more responsibilities, especially licensed bankers."
good,"Working at Wells Fargo was fun, but stressful. It’s a fast paced job that required you to provide AMAZING customer service. The hardest part working at Wells was pleasing every customer expectally when I wasn’t able to give them their money. Rude customers on a daily. The pay isn’t enough to live on your own and raise two children. More for a college student."
good,I obtained a great customer service skills at Wells Fargo. I enjoy helping customers with their day to day banking transaction and see them succeed financially.
good,I enjoyed my time working here but they definitely want you on top of your numbers. I had to make the decision to leave because i was not happy doing the job.
good,"The culture here at Wells Fargo is Awesome, the company does a great job with work/life balance. The ability to work in an environment to work from home as needed is Awesome!"
good,I loved working with my coworkers and the hours they provided. I enjoyed helping customers and made a great relationship with every single one of them.Unfortunately I had to leave for more pay for another company.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I've worked at the call center for a few years. I was there before the drama and stayed longer than anticipated. The pay has gotten much better since I started. Evening shifts get an additional 15% pay for hours worked after 4pm if you work for at least 4+ hours after 4. Example... if you work 3:30pm-12am, from 4-12 you get additional 15% which sucks for day shift employees who have worked for years and new people can come in and make more money than tenured employees. I have a decent amount of PTO. The benefits and great. Insurance is good. Training is good. It's an extremely easy job but can be stressful bc teamleads can be a bit clueless and useless when you need help with situations that aren't typical. I've had some pretty decent supervisors but my current sup is awesome. If you do your job and mind your business you wont be bothered. Bonus isn't much to look forward to. It's given once a quarter and is based on how well your team performs so if you meet all the metrics to bonus but your team doesn't, you dont bonus. It's based mainly on QA, surveys, and handle time. They've added a lot of extra work (online banking) recently with no extra pay to compensate for it."
good,"Try to give this option of flexible work shift for the employees "
good,"Many well documented issues in the media, has led to slightly unstable public opinion, I had a terrific experience there mainly due to excellent immediate management team."
good,"You get worked hard here in network team. Shifts start 4am and some days are 12 hours long back to back. If you can handle that, you will go far. It is not for everyone and not sustainable for most long term. Good pay though."
good,Wells Fargo has been an intrigual part of my career. I work with smart and kind people. Managers and supervisors are wonderful. The culture has recently changed for the better.
good,Great work/life balance. Their maternity and paternity leave is excellent (16 weeks for both moms and dads). Option to work from home. Ample paid time off.
good,Great place to learn and develop professional skills. The company culture created a caring/team environment. Work-life balance was very challenging at the management level. Great development and mentorship opportunities
good,"The manager I was working with was great as were my cousin workers."
good,Great job!  Overall I learned most of my day to day skills in the workplace from this company. Very thorough in all their processes and leaves you with the expectation on how to regulate compliance .
good,Great company to work for. I wish they did not close the CA offices. Job was fast paced. I enjoyed the teamwork. Learned various roles for the Corporate Risk department.
good,The workplace culture in our office was enjoyable due to the diverse team members. My direct report was upbeat and positive.  Area manager was not interested in getting to know his team. That was unfortunate.
good,"Good Work Life Balance and great work culture. However the Some managers are micro managing/employee unfriendly and HR isn't doing anything about it."
good,Overall this is a great company to work for. There comes a time that you may need to look outside of the company before you are able to get the type of salary jump you would like. The internal policy regarding promotions can really limit the compensation you receive.
good,"Great place to work. Professional, caring environment and opportunities for advancement are great. Fair performance reviews, salary and raises. Good healthcare. Volunteer programs offered."
good,"I worked for Wells Fargo for 3 years and I will say it those was the best times. I've never been so close to any peers before. I loved my jobs, my managers and the people I work with."
good,My overall experience with the company was good. I have no major complaints. I felt a little stagnated towards the end of my tenure and didn't feel like my manager believed in me to move forward and help me grow past my position.
good,"A typical day would consist to reconciling deposits made into the securities account for the entire brokerages national foot print.  Once this was completed, usually hundreds of trades per day, a multi million dollar wire was sent to a third party brokerage house as settlement.  The culture was fast paced and demanded perfection.  Errors and delays could cost the bank tens of thousands of dollars.  As a young professional I embraced the challenge of the position and learned how to deal with the high stress environment.  The role prepared me for all of my future endeavours.  Management was hands on and always very supportive."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"A typical day at Wells Fargo would be cashing or depositing funds of our customers into their accounts, meet with management team for new ideas on to improve the customers services"
good,"I myself began at Wells Fargo as a Bank Teller and was able through training, testing and job experience rise to the position of Research Analyst dealing with mitigating possible legal issues that could arise from regular business operation with customers through out the nation. The biggest challenge with this position was compensating for the difference in banking regulation through out the nation. Overall I would say the company is a good place to work if you are willing to get out of your comfort zone and try different positions."
good,"I would sit at my desk all day and take calls from customers who needed to make a payment on their account, or I would call them and set payments up. a lot of gossip went around in the area that I worked at and I was not a big fan of that."
good,Merchant Services was my favorite career I held at WF. My leadership team was amazing and super supportive. Always looking to help me grow and advance.
good,"looking back the challenges were there on daily basis with expectations on goals on products, investment opportunities, balancing our draw on our shift."
good,Great job out of college but climbing the corporate ladder can take several years. Each day a new scenario is brought to your attention so you're always learning. There are a plethora of managers here at Wells Fargo and most are great. Annual bonus for this position up to 10% of your salary. Call center environment but roughly take 3-4 calls from the queue a day so it's not a constant barrage of customers calling.
good,"as soon as you walk into work it was focus on work work and more work never time to relax have fun.  the moment you take a minute to have a conversation you forgot to respond to an email or get on a conference call and now you in trouble.  there are about 10 or more conference calls per week which you have to be on or else, that doesn't give you enough time to coach team members"
good,Great expetience and challenges. Learned a lot. Constant development and vast of options for career growth. Excellent training and great culture. Sales goals were crazy to gain compensation.
good,"This is a good place to work.  It can be hard to advance.  Top benefits, competitive on regional and national level.  Executive and management culture is poor.  Overall culture is fairly good."
good,"Meet with customers who have needs that the teller could not do."
good,Wells Fargo decided to move the location from Greenville nc to Raleigh and I decided not to go. They offered fair moving packages and were very fair in the severance.
good,It was a great entry level role at Wells Fargo and they promote from within. I would recommend providing more opportunites for advancement within the company for growth.
good,"Great company. I think they should pay a little more, but what employee doesn't. Wells Fargo really give you the opportunity to move up and progress in the company."
good,Management pushes yet encourages you. My teammates are go-getters and help me want to become even better at my position. I wish we had an opportunity to earn more hours. Part-time is just 20 and that is it.
good,I was able to balance my full time schedule working at Wells Fargo and going to school full time. This job gave me a better understanding of customer service and providing professional service to customers.
good,"Relaxed environment, work was very monotone as your sitting in a chair all day. Great pay and overall easy job once you get past listening to your own phone calls during weekly coachings."
good,"Wells is a huge organization with set in stone procedures. As a result, when a situation required a quick decision to benefit the customer, it was nearly always impossible."
good,"Fast paced, stressful.  Great local manager and lots of good people willing to help one another.  I liked their Custom Construction Program and other larger banks products."
good,"Great place to work, team environment, true to culture, tools are provided to do the best possible job, paid voluntary work, flexible work schedules, onsite gym facility"
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great company to work for. Once they took away sales goals, we focus on what is right for our customer. I like it better that way because the company as a whole now has a general interest in what our customers need to succeed financially. The company has great pay, amazing benefits, and many different discounts on brands worldwide!"
good,I have worked at Wells Fargo on and off for the last 15 years.  Although I have been laid off twice I would go back again...…………………………................
good,Great place to work if looking for benefits and good pay. Some managers need improvement though. Overall it is good. Customer service is a priority and sales of course.
good,"Fast paced environment with a very friendly culture. Wells Fargo has a lot of departments to work for , but career advancement will take time unless you obtain an advanced degree or something of the like due to the large number of employees."
good,"If you are looking for a job that will all your competitive drive to motivate you, Wells Fargo is a great company for you. Be ready to maintain a high level of productivity as well as quality and be challenged to excel at the goals set before you."
good,working for wellsfargo was my first banking experience so of course it was very tense and stressful but also exciting. I learned a lot and meet good people.
good,No additional comments on the company I would like to provide at this time. I certainly don't like being forced into typing a minimum of 150 characters
good,Great company to work for. They have great benefits for their employees.  Working in the call center was a fun environment. Left the job due to relocating my family
good,Wells Fargo is an excellent company. I actually didn't work for them that long. I was a Wachovia IT technician whose position was eliminate during the merger.
good,this is a great company to work for if your a full time permanent employee. contractors aren't so lucky after 2 years. it is best to seek full time employment elsewhere. working for the company will look great on a resume but the chances of being hired on permanently are slim.
good,"Organized company. Great training. Quality and accuracy are of great importance, but so is production, you are required to complete a specific number of files daily"
good,"Had great befefits and lots of pto, some times its hard to advance if you work in a rural area. Undourtunatly my location is closing but if it werent i probaly would not leave"
good,Wells has a good culture and strong personnel. The Company is focused on doing the right thing for its customers and making amends for any past impacts.
good,What I enjoyed best from working at Wells Fargo was that I always had support from my coworkers. The job was so easy for me to do I loved coming in to work and helping my every day customers. A typical day at work is that you are always on your toes always working and helping customers.
good,I had 10 years with this company. I was fortunate enough to be able to advance every 1-3 years with the help of my managers support to help me grow to reach my goals.
good,"very relaxed, laid back, fun place to work.  Great people, fun times.  Lots of celebration when necessary.  Free company lunches often.  No one leaves.  Only way for promotion is someone dying or retiring.  Great PTO policy, hard to leave because of that.."
good,"Loved being a part time teller.  I had lot's of fun with clients and staff.  Some days could be more stressful but with a good team, it was fun. I thought i was paid well for a part time position."
good,Growing opportunities with different kinds of webminars and trainings provided. Celebrations of employee birthdays and different holidays all year around.  Very productive enviroment.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,The best part of the company is the quick ability for advancement. There are countless resources available for peer relationships and career development. The hardest part of the job is completing all tasks while managing stressful environment. There is rarely protected time to get caught up.
good,Overall a good company to work for.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the presence of WFC in the charitable giving environment.  There was plenty of opportunity to grow within the company.
good,This was a great opportunity. I was able to I cried the job with just having customer service skills no banking knowledge. The job didn't offer benefits time paid time off we had on scheduled breaks. Sometimes it would be busy depending on the day of the month or the day of the week and also the time of the day. We had scheduled morning meetings before the bank open to discuss anyting that was left over from the day prior or any new information that was forwarded to us to help us with the current workday.
good,"It's an easy job with good pay. Great place to start your banking career. There are great benefits and a number of opportunities to grow. However, you have to be in the position for one year before you can move up"
good,"Maternity leave was amazing - 16 weeks paid. Tellering got boring after a couple years though. There aren’t a ton of opportunities in Aberdeen, but advancement is pretty easy if you’re open to moving."
good,"Worked as first point of contact for customers coming in for appointments with Home Mortgage Associates. Answered questions, made photo copies. Worked with Home Loan Originators with Home Loan Packets as needed."
good,"I have worked here for almost 10 years. Exceptional company especially if you get on a team with superb management.  Since the organization is so big, there is room for advancement or ability to apply to different financial services based on individual skillsets that are further cultivated once in the door. From banking, mortgages, auto loans, marketing, sales, operations - with locations across the US; there is ample opportunity for team members."
good,"Great place to work however, I worked for an Independent Wealth Management Office.  All products, services, systems and procedures were Wells Fargo associated."
good,The job is quite boring to me because I like dealing with challenges. They're stressful but they give me more opportunities to push myself forward and learn new things.
good,The people who work at the company are easy to get along with. There are many different avenues to advance yourself within the company. Good intra-company network and extensive paid training.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working remote with Wells Fargo and will go back in a heartbeat.  Management is great and expects you to know what you're doing and that I agree with in my field of work.
good,"8 hrs work days"
good,"Enjoyed working at Wells Fargo.    Thought Wells Fargo was a long term employer but Fulfillment center closed and 167 employees displaced.  Working with Wells Fargo was rewarding and stressful all in one.  I was a senior Underwriter and received numerous calls daily for sales partners with questions regarding guidelines, system, etc.  I underwrote 2 to 3 loans and reviewed several loan stipulations daily as well as cleared loans to close.  Ensuring loans meets guideline criteria for purchase of investors, quality was first and foremost the most important aspect of underwriting as well as getting the purchaser to the closing table.  My immediate manager was great.  She was understanding while adhering to corporate policy."
good,This is a great place to work at if you don't have to be a phone banker. A typical day at work would be taking calls back to back and having a 30 min lunch. The hardest part is trying to always leave the customer happy but if you can't give a fee back you already know you getting a bad rating.
good,"Being a part of the Wells Fargo team can be very rewarding, if you take the time to really become a part of their philosophy. Many come just to get in the door and work their way up, without fully understanding the everyday experience."
good,"I'll say it now and I'll say it again...Wells Fargo treated their employees great, They really set the bar for leadership/management expectations I had going forward. I attribute Wells to launching my career."
good,I worked for Wells for over 15 years.  Enjoyed every day of it. I couldn’t stay with the amount of pay I was receiving at the time. I wouldn’t have any reservations on going back to Wells Fargo.
good,"Generally a nice place to work. The work flow could be more streamlined, however Wells is a huge company. Work/life balance is decent depending on location."
good,"I was able to use skills from previous employer to enable me to do well at this job.  in addition, I learned other skills.  "
good,Great company to work for. it gave me the platform to challenge myself on daily bases while always having customer's needs in mind. The culture is geared toward enhancing current relationships and welcoming new relationship. As manager training and setting the tone for all team members is the at most important task. This is both great challenge and joy at the same time.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,I enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.  I was disappointed my particular position was eliminated.  However I would work for and recommend Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to other job seekers.
good,Ein sehr guter Arbeitsplatz. Work-Life-Balance ist da. Ich empfehle es meinen Freunden
good,"I worked here as a contractor in the tax reporting area, I learned a lot the people were great, The supervisor was a super person very fair. would love to work her again."
good,Wells fargo open door for all hispanic residents in maryland state specially in montgomery county regions with all the experience the company gained in california state help all northern branches to work confortable with the hispanic comunity!
good,"Loved my job and the company. Downside was the company restructuring, the rolcate positions often and close offices often. Management was typical corporate management. Keep your head down and do your job!"
good,"Back in the day, WFHM was a wonderful place to work.  All the employees and management were kind and worked hard. The offer management courses and training all the time to better your career."
good,"Certain supervisors of different teams did not seem encouraging of your career opportunities. Only got coached for productivity performances, but never received praise for performance when numbers were there demonstrating the success of my performance."
good,The upside was 100% remote - stable. Well paid.  People knew what was expected and requirements were clear.  Very strong QA process and the business was highly involved in what you were delivering.
good,Workplace has changed over the last 2 years. we have gone from a sales culture to a customer service culture. Our goal is to help the customer the best we can. In the process of doing this Team members are not paid the same. Use to be paid out on sales and loan volume. not the case now.
good,"Very routine job, minimalistic changes ever occur. Management is respectful and work with you when necessary. Job entails working by yourself in a fairly fast paced environment at a desk on a computer for 8 hours a day. You can ask for assistance when necessary, but majority of time is on your own."
good,"Like most places every office and district will have its own culture. Most work environments are dictated by how willing you are to adapt and how sincerely their morals align with yours. Wells Fargo has been through a great deal of scrutiny lately and needs to continue to follow their mission statement and continue to evaluate staff and invest in compliance measures. "
good,Wells Fargo is a seasoned however re-established Leading financial institution. They have restructured the goals and expectations creating a more service based culture.
good,You are given the tools you need to succeed in your job and the autonomy to make independent decisions. However; there is a clickish culture at Wells.  If you do not fit in; they let you know.  Some of the workers can be unapologetically rude to newcomers. The clicks stick together and make you feel isolated. Very unwelcoming environment.
good,"I enjoyed working there and the pay was good. I was a data processor, so the work was fast-paced and there were a lot of policies that changed frequently, so it was also stressful."
good,Wells Fargo has always made it a point as long as I have been an employee to make sure that we all know what is going on around us and provide support when it is needed. Overall I would suggest Wells Fargo as a great place to work.
good,"They gave me an opportunity and I am grateful. I worked there for six years and only left for a better opportunity at a different company. It was by no means easy, however, Wells Fargo helped develop me into a good mortgage professional."
good,"This was a face paced environment.  The management was often changing.  The hardest part of the job was not being hired on full time because regular employees could not process at the volume of some of the other employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was employee interactions, games and picnics."
good,"Good team members and a good culture. The company is racially diverse and the opportunity to move to other positions within Wells Fargo are plentiful.  Unfortunately, all the lawsuits that's been going on lately can effect the job security."
good,I loved working for Wells Fargo! great team environment with a lot of opportunity to learn and development professionally. Great teller Management tm.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Overall the company is a good one. I was unable to maintain my position because of my dad's illness so I became a caregiver for him. The work life balance became too much to juggle. I was responsible for opening personal and business accounts, processing loan applications for both business and personal and responsible for the training of new bankers."
good,It was a great place to work and provided me 7 years of constant income with an opportunity to experience three different job functions. I left on my own accord of no fault to Wells Fargo.
good,"Professional working environment, very aggressive, constant work available.  Worked as a contractor so assignments are never that long.  Wish I could have been hired as a permanent worker and had better income."
good,Advanced Business financial literacy and relationship with a fun culture . Easy tools and resources to work with. Engaging both employees and Customers in day to day activities
good,A person will answer calls and help customers make their accts better. The hardest part is when the person didn't manage their money & you can't help.
good,Sometimes I felt the quotas were too high for our area. The best days were when management brought positivity into the workplace. I enjoyed working with the customers the most.
good,Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. I really enjoy my job. My boss is very reasonable. Wells Fargo is the largest company that I have ever worked for.
good,Offers great culture for remote/telecommute opportunities.  This is helpful as there are multiple geographically dispersed teams that may need to collaborate in this manner.
good,Wells Fargo has a great work environment. I love how they embrace culture and diversity within the company. The benefits were great and management worked well with the employees and other departments to maintain a positive and productive working environment. I have had various roles at Wells Fargo but regardless where I was it was always pleasant to come to work and be a part of a great team.
good,"Great management , Always willing to answer questions. The job and teams have a lot of camaraderie. Another benefit is you can move around within the company and try different positions."
good,Wells Fargo provides 16 weeks of maternity leave which that alone makes it worth working there. Competitive pay makes it very hard to work anywhere else.
good,people and management was a good team. I don't know how it is now. They always ordered free lunch for us when we did over-time. Supervisors were really helpful when needed. Co-workers were all friendly and worked well together.
good,"My experience there was very positive and free of the current ""scandals"" that haunt the bank.  Personally, the professionals I worked with had a very high degree of integrity."
good,"This a good company but their management team is not the best. They need to understand that everyone has life issues, yes they do provide services to help you when you are going through some life changing events but however you can receive it because you haven't worked this long or your supervisor doesn't approve this etc."
good,"From new leaders with fresh perspectives to better ways to care for our customers and team members, we’re making changes and taking action to build a stronger Wells Fargo."
good,"Wells Fargo is definitely a big bank and somewhat disconnected to the local community.  However, they have fair compensation and great overall benefits."
good,The job was some what stressful and required mandatory over time. I miss some of my co-workers but not the heavy work load or the stressful atmosphere.
good,Wells Fargo has many benefits and I always got long with my coworkers due to a promotion of team bonding and teamwork. If you work in a hgh traffic district you can grow with WF.
good,"Co-workers for the most part are great, easy to get along with. Bad hires here and there. Great opportunity for growth and also great benefits. Pay is very descent but not too many sales goals or opportunity for commission."
good,Work environment was fun and worked well together. Very nice facilities were provided.  Our office was located in a really nice location near plenty of restaurants and shopping locations for after work.  location was conveniently just off the interstate highway.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,the workplace culture was pleasant.  I learned a lot about how to clear title issues from my peers.  Involved in weekly meetings to see what trends were happening in the mortgage title world.
good,"A lots of opportunity theirs a lot to grow, many positions are challenge but possible, sales can be done, also training is great they teach you with proper classes."
good,WF provides a good work/life balance and management is always there to help you when you need that.  It is a relaxed work environment and enjoy the culture in my department.
good,Great job however they no longer specialized in Sub-prime financing and my position has been eliminated.  Travel expenses always covered and upper management support was always available.  I left the company only because my children were young and the travel was too much being divorced.
good,"I was at Wells Fargo for three years, so I experienced a few turns overs in staff some managers were better than others. My over all experience was a good one"
good,"Typical bank , very political. Once you're in with the right people you'll be good to go. If not then get comfortable in your current role. Unfortunately, your chance to elevate within your role isn't solely based on performance."
good,Wachovia/Wells Fargo is a good company to work for. I worked part time on the second shift. My manager kept us up to date with everything going on that affected our work duties.
good,I worked in a new downtown office building that had more empty cube than occupied cubes. It was a little difficult to establish working relationships.
good,"Wells is a very large bank.   That means lots of bureaucracy, lots of rules, and lots of regulatory headwind.  Though the people are smart and conscientious, the work is challenging, the environment is professional, and there is a plethora of technology."
good,"I enjoyed the competitive enviroment at Wells Fargo. I was held accountable for my performance, and my teammates cheered me on as I reached my goals."
good,Great company in many ways.  Benefits flexibility accepting of all people. Pay could be higher. Great training and provides all proper equipment. Accommodating to those with disabilities
good,"My typical day involved some meetings, some focused work, and some time to be involved in team coaching or events. I learned a lot in my time there: about the banking industry, regulations, and new technologies. Most enjoyable part of the job was collaborating with my colleagues."
good,was a great job while it lasted. the management was great and the pay was good for the job i was doing. everyone i worked with were amazing people. would love to go back.
good,A typical work day consist of processing many different types of transactions. You see the most customers and depending on the day it can be slow or fast. Management does a good job at trying to accommodate your schedule. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customer who do not understand that there are policies in place and they must be followed.
good,"Wells Fargo is a fast-paced place to work.  Customers are usually lined up at the door and in the drive-thru to get assistance.  Can be hard to go to lunch on time, or get off on time."
good,Work life Balance is great - High level management are good but not all of them. They prefer to hire from outside instead of promoting good employees.
good,I had 2-Commercial Real Estate VP that I worked for. I processed paydowns/payoffs and advances. Booked commercial loans and reviewed collateral. Talked with customers daily and enjoyed them.
good,"Great managers are present, as well as ineffective and power hungry managers. Just depends on group and team."
good,"Wells Fargo provides many opportunities for my own advancement as long as I was willing to put in the hours to find them. They dont go out of their way to find talent within and promote them, instead you have to work to be an outlier to get noticed. Not a good job if you believe in work-life balance, especially in management- it's expected that you're working 50-60 hours/week. I have fun when I go into work and the culture is great- everybody is passionate about their jobs and providing financial solutions to our customers."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Our hours and pay were good and fair.  The benefits were good but on the pricey side.  The people I worked with were amazing and good at what we did, our managers were outstanding, and all of us had been there for several years.  Unfortunately, our division had been shut down due to things that were beyond our control, and that weren't our doing.  If I could go back, I would."
good,Very dedicated and talented workforce.  Everyone works hard and collaborates.  A good company to work for.  Good developmental opportunities are offered.
good,"I actually enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. It was a friendly place to work and everyone seemed to get along well. There was quite a bit of training,and therefor everyone was qualified."
good,"Review high risk conventional, high-balance and super conforming loans throughout the western United States. This level was set by corporate based on loan quality, production and customer service excellence and is the highest level in site."
good,"I truly enjoyed all of my positions within the company.  I learned a great deal about the financial industry, which I am thankful for.  The only reason I left was for another opportunity with a significantly higher salary."
good,"My largest complaint is that it is difficult to move up without knowing anyone. Nepotism is pretty out in the open, and I can't say I can blame anyone leveraging their opportunities, but as a person who came from a modest background without any connections, it is frustrating to watch. The job industry itself is enjoyable, but it can be tough dealing with clients who are personally insulting you due to the scandals at the top. They treat me great at Wells Fargo, but I do feel underpaid as their are people with equal or less experience and less education than myself whom have moved into other higher paying positions because they had a connection somewhere. It's all about who you know, it seems. My managers and the on-site managers are fantastic people, the corporate events are a blast, they make time/adjustments for your medical needs and they have a very diverse and cultural workplace. Overall, I'd say Wells Fargo is a fantastic place to work with the caveat that you will have to know someone or get to know someone to move upwards within the company, but I cannot say that isn't prevalent at any employer."
good,I learned all the fundamentals that was need for my daily job process with the help of others are my managers.Come in to work and manage your daily work tasks and go home.
good,Had a great time working in Wells Fargo (WF).  I had enough autonomy that I could manage my personal and work life.  I was able to be introduced to a wide variety of technologies while working for WF. The people i got to work with were great which brought a easy team like culture for the group and able to bounce off different ideas to maximize results.
good,Finding the right department was difficult at first. You are planted in a 1 year commitment before you can apply anywhere else in the company. Moved up into a different part of the company but the last switch offered lower pay for the same work as others who were paid $2-$3 more with the same or less experience. Did not allow negotiations for a pay change or increase.
good,"The cons were a highly structured environment and good plus. "
good,I really love working as a DBA. It is an opportunity to know new things every day. In my project we have really good team work environment which makes the work place enjoyable.
good,"I loved working on Saturdays, I loved the PTO, the hardest part of the job was cutomers yelling at us if there car was blocked. The easiest  was the saless dept."
good,"Poor management all around. Worked in the mortgage industry which was very volatile and risk of being laid off many times."
good,I really enjoyed working at wells Fargo I just lived in Gresham and was taking public transportation so the commute was not really worth the pay or hours.
good,"Typical day is stressful. Hardest part is due to micro management,   Encouraged new learning skills, diversity culture, Potluck's were most enjoyable."
good,"Great experience and opportunities within the company. Positions are well paid, most managers are qualified for their jobs. You are able to receive mentors in order to help you grow to reach your goals."
good,"If you are fine with repetitive transactions and having to have long conversations with customers, this is the job for you. Very much so a worthwhile job, but can certainly become exhausting."
good,Management understanding of needing time off for various things and willing to be flexible with schedule. Great maternity leave benefits. Some poor managers can bring culture down. Some are inexperienced and unwilling to seek experts out of different processes. Job security at the moment is unsure.
good,"I think this is a great atmosphere to learn and advance, given the opportunity. The training was at a casual pace and the requirement for new hires are within expectations."
good,"my supervisor was awesome, my team was awesome. It was a call center and i didn't mind the job at all, it was the constant trying to sell them stuff and all they wanted to do is handle banking issues. I mainly left because the commute was so long and traffic was horrible. A 45 min drive took me sometimes up to 5 hrs to get home if there was a wreck."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Other than frequent changes, it's an overall good company to work for. Development opportunities are encouraged from upper-level management, and at times, be stagnant depending on the department."
good,"Wells Fargo is a competitive mortgage lender.  Workplace culture was very collaborative, as underwriting always is.  I was well compensated for the work."
good,"I don't mind working alone so I was okay with the job, however it was a temporary position so I was not offered any benefits or paid time off. Also it was Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, not a banking branch. Management was great. They had no problems training me on any tasks I was unsure on how to complete, but you are expected to pick up on it quickly as they have a lot of responsibilities as well. We had meetings, but they were monthly, basically ensuring all employees knew each other, especially those of us through temp agencies, and that we knew who to report to regarding our daily tasks and which Loan Originators we were responsible to help out. I learned a lot there and it was different as they let you sit with each department to learn all aspects of the job."
good,"I’ve worked with Wells Fargo for over 20 yrs. My career experience there has been something I am proud of, and will never forget. Great working relationships!"
good,"Wells Fargo acquired our company, ABD Insurance & Financial Services. Went from a private 880 employee company to a banking atmosphere of 330,000 employees."
good,culture at Wells Fargo has improved greatly since the reset in 2016. The working environment isn't about micro management but about long term relationships.
good,Wells Fargo was a good place to work. They did what they could if you needed time off for your family. The bonuses were great if you were a top collector. The health insurance was good and their additional services for mental health was great. Great people worked there.
good,"working with team members and business partners to resolve illogical conditions and outstanding issues, daily phone calls with business partners, Submitted information to treasury for approval and to review information to determine if the loans need remediation action by another team."
good,Hired as a contract Home Preservation Specialist.  Department was put together in haste and it showed but overall I learned a lot. Training was week compared to expectations of performance.
good,"No flexibility with schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers. It was stressful during layoffs, I was lucky to not be in the group that was laid off."
good,I enjoyed the time I spent in my tenure with the company. The environment was one of a close knot family and my manager wanted me to succeed as well as others I worked with closely.
good,"great place to work for, had no compliations, just was unable to advance and left for school. Great benefits, great 401k, great team to work with!!!!!"
good,Good company to work for that provides ample opportunity for learning and growth. You get you interact with intelligent coworkers who you learn a lot from
good,worked here for 12 years would have been content to stay longer had I not been laid off the benefits were great and the pay was fair. I was able to work from home for half of my last year there which was very nice.
good,Employer allowed the opportunity to utilize corporate library for self-development to enhance career path. The training was superb.  The environment was minimal supervision and the team work well daily.
good,Great place to work! Environment is business casual. Need to be flexible and accepting of change. Great benefits! Overall a great company to work for.
good,What you'd think from working for a bank. Good working hours and good home life balance. They do need some work on how they do raises across the board. They raise the starting pay but wait months to raise the pay of already established workers. This should be at the same time.
good,I liked the WF I worked at. Most of the colleagues were supportive and ready to help as I needed. I enjoyed every single day working there. It was fun to interact with different types of customers every day with different kinds of transactions and problems. I learned how to deal with different types of customers and solve their issues. I would recommend others to work with WF. It was a great experience working at WF.
good,wells fargo has a good work environment. I really enjoy the people I work around everyday. they make a difference in the work place environment and keeping things balanced.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,It was a great place to work overall. The benefits were great. I just didn't get the chance to explore my talents and skill set. I will highly recommend wells fargo.
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers. I appreciate everyone's hard work and effort they put in. I love my supervisor and how they are willing to make sure I try to get 40 hours per week.
good,Raises are non-existent. 1% was the raise for the last 3 years that I received even though my performance was a 4 out of 5. The discount opportunities are awesome.
good,"Since I was only an intern I didn't get the full scope of the business life at Wells Fargo. However, I gained a lot of confidence in my personal development while I was working at Well Fargo. I learned how to manage multiple task. Management was very helpful in providing ways to improve managing duties and assignments on the job. The hardest part of the job was that there were to many people to really get to know. The most enjoyable part was the feeling of accomplishment after giving our final presentation as interns."
good,Good work environment with little risk of running into trouble at work with customers. Watch out with managers because everyone looks out for themselves and people play favorites.
good,When I was there the old manager as leaving and the new one was coming in.  So things were not smooth at all.  People didn't know about job security and the customers were use to how the bank was run by the old manager.  I'm sure by now things are a lot different.
good,If you are looking into more clerical/ office positions this Is a good place to start. If you do not like call center environments do not apply to this position
good,"I work in the Lockbox Department.  Very metric-based, and deadline-based job.  I work as a Data Processing Clerk 1, keying checks, invoices, EOBs, and supplemental documents.  I also multi-task in other functions/desks within the department.  A production oriented position."
good,"Loved working at Wells Fargo with the Team of Advisors. Clients became more than clients,  they became great friends.  Never a dull moment it was fast paced."
good,Great people to work with always looking out for the best interest of the clients.  Excellent communication with all employees.  It was truly a team effort and was great!
good,The people you work with are great although the management  staff could use some help. They were more worried about the products you sell not about the customer.
good,"It was a good place to work and I loved the people that I worked with.  But lacked job security. I was bounced around from being a contractor to taking a major pay cut to become an employee, then back to being a contractor.  I was appreciative of having a job, loved my clients, loved my work and they paid well.  But the insecurity of not knowing if you will have a job the next week was stressful.  These layoffs and changes were not based on the quality of your work but of departments changing and upper management decisions."
good,"Good company still facing the challenges to correct the errors that have blemished the reputation of the company as a whole.  "
good,A fast paced environment to work in but makes it easy to yield good results with a cooperative management. Two way communication and the feedback is valued.
good,"Productive workplace. Site management was very responsive, knowledgeable, competent, and supportive. Upper management was not candid about the direction our site was going to take, and they were uncertain about consent order guidance. Instead of a prompt response to requests for guidance, those without the authority to do so were put in a position to make executive decisions then deal with the consequences."
good,"I like Wells Fargo but work life balance is not there. they do not pay enough compare to other banks, but you do learn a lot. the management is pretty awesome there as well. I enjoy helping my customers succeed financially"
good,"I was a contractor when I worked there working partially remote, partially onsite.  I enjoyed those I worked with. There was some training.  The management was accessible as well."
good,The environment was fast pace due to the high volume of calls but management was great at identifying skill sets and providing employee incentives an rewards as well as career advancement opportunities.
good,It was a great place to work overall. Just have to watch out for sketchy people. But besides that everything was great and my general manager was awesome!
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Great people. Great work/life balance. Rate of pay is okay but not aligned with cost of living (in California). Management accels in passion and business need, but is definitely lacking in competence."
good,I was a specialist in the Home Asset Management Accounts Dept. of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. I helped homeowners to understand the best way to use their account and how payments were processed.
good,The work life balance is ok. The managers may be a little difficult but they are understanding. The Statesboro branch does switch store managers very often.
good,"A good place to receive entry level training and learn the key steps of credit analysis.  However, there were limited opportunities to advance into a underwriting or higher role."
good,"I enjoy the work environment a lot. The management is great."
good,"a typical day would be accepting, processing new accounts, providing customer service for existing accounts holders and resolving any problems customer may have."
good,Great at giving intermittent time from work for family and personal medical issues.  Fast pace work environment.  Wonderful opportunities with in Wells.
good,"Call Center - typical day on the phones with bankers going through procedures and policy requirements. "
good,"Great place to work at. One manager who makes for a terrible work environment is still working there. As long as you do your job it is easy to move up, takes a couple of months before they allow you to move up."
good,"Hardest part if the job was a certain times of the week when calls in que would be near triple digits. Advancement seemed few and far between. Still, it was a useful learning experience that I use even now knowing how the banking process works."
good,"Management was wonderful, structure of work environment was productive and above par. Office was always clean. Atmosphere was laid back. Sick/vacation days were more than reasonable."
good,Very professional but laid back environment. very sales driven. opportunity for growth with a lot of dedication and hard work. nice benefits and educational experience with exposure through differnet culture activities
good,"I am not applying for any banking jobs, want to totally go a different direction, WF is a great company, good benefits and 401 k matching; will not be applying for another bank postion."
good,The culture of the workplace was good and you always had chances to improve yourself and your opportunistic.  The management team was good and always looking at ways of helping you.
good,"Wells fargo cares about its employees, good pay, good benefits and they show they care about your work life home life balance. They will help you succeed in your role and moving up in wells Fargo."
good,The level of professionalism at Wells Fargo is far beyond what I was accustomed to. The vast majority of workers are incredibly Team Oriented & Wells Fargo provided a lot of Leadership Development training.
good,"Wells Fargo is a very inclusive and diverse company, the training was very informative and the managers and staff are very intentative. Wells Fargo is overall a good company to work for."
good,there's your ups and downs like any other jobs. the pay is great and the benefits are outstanding. but in all over all this place is a great place to work.
good,Wells Fargo is very corporate and was well organized.  The job was something I had to take due to the recession. I was grateful to have a great boss and a job.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,Wells Fargo is a great opportunity company. It will develop your skills and your and your growth in the company. Friendly joyful happy environment. Great career to go into and grow.
good,"Worked on foreclosures for FannieMae, very busy and could be stressful as we had productive numbers to meet, works overtime almost every day.  Loved being busy."
good,"Great place to work. Good leadership, large regions, diverse duties. Budgeting and variance reporting extensive, but doable. I would recommend this job to anyone looking."
good,I spent around a year working for Non Conforming Mortgage department. The staff was high energy which was good as the workload was high. The management was adept at attaining information and updates as well as communicating with the staff.
good,The job is challenging and has many new facets to learn every day - however they seem to continue to put more and more pressure on this position enforcing new process changes and adding items to the role/position without compensation. I have tripled the amount of work I do on every loan application in the past 3 years.
good,Wells Fargo as a whole is great place to work. Management needs some work in some departments. i enjoy the people i worked with for the most part. Being a Team Lead is a very tough position if management doesn't back you up.
good,"The job I do can be stressful.  More is added to your work load and accomplishing tasks gets harder the more work you have.  I believe the company to be a good, solid company."
good,"If you are looking to be stable in your life and settle down; prefect job for you. Super repetitive, some might consider ""boring"" just because every day is almost the same as the next. People are nice, no huge drama issues. Very chill work environment. The biggest issue I can find with working here is when times get super busy; I don't think higher management can come to realize how much work gets places on the lower departments. Another issue is the huge gaps of pay for the employees doing the same job. This sometimes becomes discouraging when you encounter the peek times and the person with the higher pay is even complaining. Outside of those two issues I really love the time I spent working for the company. HR listens to you. Manager can be some what understanding."
good,Great working conditions and the employees are nice to work with.  The atmosphere was relax and not pressured.  I would recommend anyone to work for this company.  I have worked there as a contractor and I would go back.
good,"It's a good company to work for. The PTO benefits are great and the work culture is good.  "
good,"I have complete oversight of my position.  My manager gives me plenty of space to do my job, he does not micro-manage.  The work environment is very nurturing. My colleges are incredible to work with.  The hardest part of my job is working with our outside vendors.  They don't share the same work ethic and fall short of our company's expectations."
good,"Fast paced, customer focused and driven.  Ongoing training was always readily available.  There was an opportunity for growth and advancement.  Excellent working environment with my peers."
good,I have enjoyed working for Wells Fargo.  It is a good company to work for and have been able to learn a lot about the banking industry and investments.  I would just like more of an opportunity for advancement.
good,"●	Participate in the analysis, troubleshooting, and remediation of Windows OS 802.1x supplicant configuration issues"
good,"wells fargo is a good place to work for starters. "
good,"Always a learning experience at Wachovia/Wells Fargo, a typical day consisted of fielding incoming calls from financial advisors, consultants, and other bank personnel. Assisted with procedures on redeeming IRA's, rates, and penalties. The workplace culture for the most part was good."
good,"there is no stress with the jobs, however they pay a lot low than competitive banks. I would recommend it as a good starting job but not long term to stay there."
good,"They had great pay and the work was easy.  The only problems were lack of continuity.  When there is a process that has to be performed by everyone, there should be a set guideline to ensure that everyone has all the same tools and items in that packet- there was little to no continuity from one underwriter to the next."
good,"Wells Fargo was my stepping stone into Branch banking, Business Banking and other financial services.  It gave me the opportunities to venture into business banking areas that helped me to expand my overall banking knowledge to be able to assist a vast variety of clients and their specific needs."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"No one's long-term GOAL is to be a personal banker, however it is a comfortable role if you are young, not a tremendous amount of work experience, and have no degrees. It provides a decent salary, work-life balance, and paid time off. It it not very difficult, but it is temporary. However Wells Fargo does offer opportunity for advancement."
good,"company is great. I hope to be there for years to come. management is good, the benefits are good, and the pay is extremely good. work / life is pretty good. really enjoy working at WF."
good,"Despite negative media attention, the majority of Wells Fargo employees seek to improve the financial well being of their customers. Wells Fargo is a titanic company with a variety of job descriptions to choose from."
good,A productive place to work.  Everyone is willing to help you better your skills. Pretty quiet place to work.  People can use headphone/earbuds. Cafeteria has wonderful view of the city.
good,Overall a great working environment. Management lacked a little and there was little to no direction of job duties and advancement. Working for Wells Fargo is very fast paced and keeps you on your toes.
good,"Tellers only do transactions and nothing additional.  It's a very easy job and pretty stress free. There is not a lot of room to advance, but if you don't care about that I would definitely recommend."
good,"• Assisted clients with transactions involving their accounts and any other banking needs."
good,"Just like any place, politics. I enjoyed what I did for work. showed up and worked. everyday was what you make it. Management was micromanaging at times."
good,"Aside from working on Saturdays, it is a good place to work with good benefits and great atmosphere and culture."
good,Typical 40 hour work week
good,"Wells Fargo has been an excellent place to work, with supportive management and a family-like workplace.  Career opportunities are highly competitive, but there are many opportunities in the Charlotte area.  It's difficult to get in, but once accepted, it is often a supportive environment that will help you learn and grow.  You will get from this company what you put into it; if you work hard and put your best foot forward, good things are sure to come."
good,"It was very competitive and we all thrived to make payout every quarter. We went through a few management turnovers but our section rose to the top of our district. We helped customers get the very best service and benefits we could offer, and they kept coming back for more. It was an amazing experience."
good,"Main reason for looking elsewhere - current manager a task master and, unlike the previous manager, so concerned with minutia and details sometimes forgets to treat employees in a more humane way."
good,"The following references the experience at Wachovia, prior to the acquisition by Wells Fargo:"
good,"I thought the company lacked the personal touch. The company is ok and works like a big machine. The department you are in will term if your job experience,"
good,"Basically, I was hired to work on the phone in a call center environment, educating customers about their account options and assisting with their requests.  I've had a chance to learn a lot about investing and retirement and Wells Fargo also sponsored me to take Finra licensing exams.  Management can be somewhat distant at times, but are there when you need them.  My main area of dissatisfaction is the call center environment (having to adhere to a fairly strict schedule, having conversations monitored and scored).  The best part is helping a client through a difficult time or providing them information they didn't know about their account options.  Overall, its not a bad job to gain experience and licensing, particularly if you don't mind a customer service role and a call center environment.  However, for most people it won't be a job you want to do for the rest of your life."
good,"maintained filing, data entry, maintained office equipment. it was a great place to work.  it was sometimes stressful, alot of things to get done in little time offered. i liked alot of some of the people i worked with. if they offered the same position i had i would take it."
good,I work remotely and am self-motivated.  Been in this industry for 30 years and enjoy what I do and who I do it with.  Wells embraces cultural diversity and stresses work/life balance.  They have recently made some mistakes across the commercial/consumer banking lines of business but I believe are doing the right things to improve the customers' perception of the organization.
good,Good work life balance. Entire department closure. The culture was upbeat in 2005 - 2009 before the auto and housing crash. Good condusive working environment.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Was a good job to have. Loved working there. only thing bad was the "
good,"I often think about returning to the bank.  I liked being a teller.  I would take a decrease in pay though and I can't afford that.  I didn't like the push on sales, but I think banks have had to take a step back from that in the last few years."
good,"Great place to work, work life balance and a diverse culture environment. A company where you can learn different products within the bank and expand your skill set."
good,"Although management seems to have a very political feel to it, I really enjoyed working at Wells Fargo. The only reason I am no longer there is because the department I was in centralized down to two locations. Neither of which I was able to move to. The most difficult thing about my position is that it quit being challenging. I loved my coworkers and the laid back atmosphere though."
good,It was a good job but pay was pretty low. Call center environment for most jobs. Don’t know how pay is now but has to better than 10 years ago I’m sure
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people that I worked with were very professional and courteous. I enjoyed the work, being challenge daily was enjoyable for me."
good,Most enjoyable part of job is helping individuals understand financial literacy and helping them reach their financial goals by offering the best fit products.
good,"I started working for WF through a company merger so there was a bit of culture shock in the beginning, but overall I enjoyed my time working there. The pay was respectable and the benefits were solid."
good,I have worked at Wells Fargo Securities for a little less than a year and I have had a great experience. I have learned a lot from the management team and the importance of mitigating risk in terms of operational efficiency.
good,"IT tools tended to be behind the curve, which is typical for a risk-averse bank.  Management is sometimes very good, sometimes not so good.  Such a huge company provides for a wide diversity of experiences."
good,At this point in time I believe it would be a bit unfair to wells fargo for me to review the company as I recently found out that I would be losing my job due to relocation of business
good,Solid company. No bonuses which is not a competitive feature in banking. You can definitely move up if you put in effort. Fun work environment. Call Center was very enjoyable the 5 years I worked there.
good,Place was awesome my team was Awesome and I have made some grreat friendships.  You can get promoted fast if you are meeting your goals.  Staff and management are terrific.
good,Enjoyed working with the Loan Officers and the Branch Manger made working there fun.  My LO's were outstanding.  Nice place to work. Typical day was setting up files and reviewing items provided by the LO if items were missing then calling the customer for them.  Once the file was completed it was submitting to Underwriting.
good,"Wells Fargo was a terrific place to work. It provides it's employees with great training, managerial support and constant mentoring to improve your performance as both a banker and a manger of bankers."
good,"Departments are very siloed, so sometimes its hard to be able to move into other areas. I enjoyed my work there, but did not feel compensation was enough especially when asking to have a college degree and multiple years of experience."
good,Call center environment. Open 24/7. Multiples teams the have the team managers that push you. Fun incentives when you actually reach them  There is a difficult balance between work and personal life though. you need a tough outer shell to deal with customers at time though.
good,Company prefers that employees stay in their owe lanes. No career advancement.  Pay is good.  Benefits are suitable for family.  Deductibles are high.
good,People are great. A lot of talent however I don't feel management is that great in all departments. Over all a great company to work for. They have great benefits.
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"I enjoy my customers....well most of them!"
good,"fun , fast paced workplace, with room to grow. great people to work with and love meeting new people, not being able to take time off during the week for appointments and being short staffed most of the time is trying"
good,"Seemed great for a call center but it was not my thing, Training and Management was amazing though. Fantastic people. Training was excellent in getting you prepared. Teamwork was a big focus and they were all great to work with. If you want the call center environment I would absolutely recommend Wells Fargo."
good,I worked for Wells Fargo for 2 years and loved it. I had to move 4 hours away so had to leave but worked in the ODCR department and it could be stressful at times but overall was a nice and stable work environment.
good,You learn the system but it will take a while to learn. The management can leave you frustrated when they won't complete be truthful with your question regarding future moves of the company and roles.
good,if you are putting numbers on the board you will enjoy your job... if you are not you wont be employed. Keep a positive attitude and you will succeed easily.
good,"I learned a lot and grew as an employee of Wells Fargo Advisors.  I would love to work for them again, but a position is not available where I have moved."
good,Making sure teller area was presentable. offering products that actually would benefit my customers. making sure they sit with bankers to review accounts. Teller drawers were in balance. Double counting money before giving it to the customer and counting it to the customer. And most of all handing my clients my business card and letting them know they can reach me if they have any problems.
good,Lots of customers hard to close loans quickly though but name goes far in the industry. Was too hard to get purchase business as loans in house were at capacity.
good,Fast paced working environment with customer contact daily. Stay focused and alert on the job daily. Mangement wasn't as strong as I felt it should be but they weren't extremely difficult to work with. The branch was diverse and everyone tried to always be a team player. The hardest part of the job I feel like was the sales goals assigned to each employee. The best part of the job was the sweet and amazing customers I came to know and love.
good,My position at Wells Fargo was a contract position through Insight Global.  My interaction was with tax department middle management. They were extremely professional yet  courteous and friendly.
good,Although I enjoyed my years with Wells Fargo my work schedule was becoming to hectic. Being a mother of 2 i wasn't able to be working 7 days straight at times.
good,"good place to work, great staff, good benefits...  Easy to advance in the company, will train new hires/ no experience needed. Need to be computer savvy and quick learner"
good,"""	Verification and analysis of loan requests from client companies in US."
good,"I was very sad to walk away from this job because of the rewarding nature of the position. I was able to work at a steady yet quick pace at a task I felt well trained for and without the need for constant supervision. Yet, I never felt like I couldn't ask for assistance if I found myself in an uncertain spot."
good,Very busy when it comes to the beginning and mid month. I've learned a lot about building my personal brand. Working here given me the opportunity to grow as an individual and prepare me for my next career move.
good,"Working for Wells Fargo Bank was Great, I wanted to further my carrier. Pleasant team members. I started as a Bank Teller was Promoted 3 times to Personal Banker and Business Advocate."
good,i loved my job but the your co workers are nosy. and the managers there are stuck up at least in the department i worked in. the bonus that you get are always a plus!
good,"There is a wide variety of opportunities, you have to stay very proactive to take advantage of this. Also as always will need help from upper management to make this work, if your manager don't support your development, no much can be accomplished."
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"They will teach you what you need to know before you start, even if you have no experience in the field. If they have to close a particular department they will offer you many opportunities to continue working within the company."
good,Wells Fargo has great benefits and provided me with the financial security I needed while I was raising my children. There was great opportunity to learn office and computer skills that were transferrable to other positions within the bank. With flexibility there is a good opportunity for career development.
good,Wells Doc Custody has a mostly relaxed atmosphere where people are allowed to be who they are. There is a high level of respect for individuals and diversity.
good,"Get to know clients on a personal level and based on conversations, recommend solutions that will help the client succeed financially.   Follow up with clients to make sure all solutions that were discussed in the branch are going to plan.  If a solution is out of the realm of job description then refer the client to a partner that has the capability to help the client (i.e. Home Mortgage, investments)."
good,"Had a interesting time working at wells fargo. I had started right after everything that had happened in California so everything had been stressful regarding customer service. I did not appreciate how the leaders of my branch acted at times because they acted on emotion instead of logic. One day something was ok, the next it was an issue. Going to the bathroom was always a hassle. I have stomach issues and got ridiculed by staff for having to use the restroom. I had received many false promises about full time and had to leave because I could no longer afford to live off part time hours"
good,I met my two favorite managers at what used to be World Savings NKA Wells Fargo when I started my mortgage career in 2005.  They were both supportive and allowed me the autonomy I needed to manage my day and workload.  I learned a lot as a mortgage loan processor and excelled very quickly in this role earning top tier bonuses.
good,My experience for wells fargo is not relevant at this moment because the culture and environment has changed since I left. I remember being very stressed to meet sales goals and it was a very cut throat environment. Now there are no sales goals and it is very customer focused. The pay and benefits were very satisfactory.
good,"Wells Fargo was a funny place to work. I was part of a bilingual team that handled calls from all over the US and from other countries, the job was fun but was fast paced due to the number of calls we answered on a daily basis."
good,Learned many sales and management skills.  Hardest part of my job was staffing can be challenging.  Sometimes there seem to be favoritism in our local area.
good,The most enjoyable aspect of the job was my coworkers. Being able to work with them daily made the typical work day great. My manager was very helpful with questions and clarified any confusion I encountered.
good,Worked in call center. Got very old very quick with a constant stream of the same situations. Work place and trading were great. Community type feeling.
good,"As long as you follow ALL RULES, take your time and always provide excellent customer service. This is a great job for you. I certainly enjoyed working here however I was terminated because I allowed a supervisor to work on my cash drawer which ultimately came up short. I know now that no matter what I would never do that again!"
good,Wells Fargo provided job security and movement as long as you knew the right people. The pace of work can varie from day to day depending on the traffic in the branch.  The hardest part was the rating system that you received from the customers through a survey that was emailed to them.  You received little to no feedback as to why you were rated that way.
good,A company you can truly grow with. Diverse work environments and progressive culture. The company does seem to care about their employees but there are areas of opportunity still.
good,"This was a great place to work. Great work family relationship, benefits, 401K. Pleasant atmosphere.  Linden Center is where I worked.  Nice location close to everything and easy access to I-40. Cafeteria could used an upgrade really bad, but other than that, its a great place to work."
good,Wells Fargo was rough with high sale goals. I have heard they took the high goals away. Wells fargo pays pretty good and gives you a nice amount of vacation time. Plus you can carry over 5 days
good,"The goal is to be in balance every day so it is recommended to count your cash 3 times before handing it over to the customer."
good,"Learned many things about AI in the time that i was working with the team. Very scheduled and time efficient team, team always provided great feedback."
good,Wells Fargo is a fair place to work but I feel the pay could be better based on the number of years in company and jobs. My manger is very open to questions and helping with anything you don't understand. the hardest part of my job is staying busy. the most enjoyable thing about working at Wells are my co workers
good,"Great company.  They promote within. "
good,"Not much to say; just a temp job. It was supposed to last 6 months, but the job ended a couple months early because they were outsourcing and had no work."
good,Processed auto loan applications solely and with teammates on a daily basis with analyzing credit profiles to determine loan eligibility. Great atmosphere from management and teammates with a good work/home life balance.
good,Organizing boxes with paper work from other businesses so they can be shipped to the proper departments where the paper work belongs to and they can sort
good,No major complaints.  Lots of room for growth if you can get an interview.  Your experiences will be based on the department you work for and the management in that department.  Lots of changes in progress at this time (annoying).
good,"I only worked there as a temp.  Special project.  Didn't like the manager, very rude, no respect.  Don't miss him at all.  Job was fine, other co workers were fine."
good,"Wells Fargo has gone through their change for the better. Lots has changed, including management. I'm not a fan of some of the changes, and the walking on eggshells, but I feel the CEO and the board are making wise choices."
good,I have had no issues with Wells Fargo. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement. Most departments will have great work ethic and team outings.
good,"This was a Great Job learned a lot, a great environment to work in, liked the location downtown except for there was not a lot of parking close by, other wise good place of employment."
good,"Would love to work back a wells Fargo , I learned a lot about banking my manager was a great person to work for I also enjoyed my job great advance potently"
good,The key to my success was building relationships with customers. You never know what they are experiencing and that will affect how they interact with you at your desk. I found that excellent customer service helped me make the branch more successful.
good,"It's pretty simple.  It's a good place to work, management seems to be well qualified  and they pay well. However they are known for massive layoffs so proceed with caution, always have a resume ready and never burn any bridges."
good,"Times have changed for the better in the retail line of business. The responsibilities are much more customercentric, and operational. Lending will hopefully catch up."
good,"Good work environment with 15 mns break in the am n pm n half n hour for lunch.  The work is good overall and recently they are announcing closing of 2 Irvine locations therefore, I need to find another jobs.  They are relocating the employees to Chandler, AZ"
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Wells Fargo and would work there again. I was paid well, worked with great people and learned a lot. it is a great place to make a career."
good,"A typical day of work involves dealing with customers, team members, risk, and providing and excellent level of customer service and team member experience, through growth of both the customers financial success and the team members experience at work."
good,Great stable company that cares about their employees and customers.  The people are a pleasure to work with and are talented.  I am always learning..
good,I love working for Wells Fargo but I am looking to change careers and obtain experience in my own field. The management is by the book for the most part but in a friendly and relaxed manner.
good,"great work atmosphere, and my co-workers are great. Great on the Job training , and fun workplace. Enjoyed delivering great customer service to everyone,"
good,I loved working here it had a very family like culture and there very big om advancement. The pay is okay and overall like any other call center position they provide you with paid training which Is always a plus/
good,this is a great place to work the people are friendly the pay is good and the work environment was good I would still be there if it was not for the fact I moved
