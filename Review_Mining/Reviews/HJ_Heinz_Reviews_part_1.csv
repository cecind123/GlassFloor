rating,review
bad,If you work for this company and you get hurt and it isn't your fault they will fire you and they also say that you falsify reports that you never even gotten to see or write and this company also doesn't let you see tapes from something that hits you
bad,"Here is a short breakdown of things."
bad,Manager was racist and would never approve my time off but some guys showed up after lunch everyday when we had to be there at 6 in the morning worked 70 plus hours for a 5 day week to bring home less than 400 a week worst job I’ve had.
bad,"Gerentes desqualificados, colocados para exercer funções sem estarem preparados, na maioria estagiários e treinees, e despensam profissionais qualificados por questão de idade."
bad,Factory job requiring shift work. Pay was awful and so were the hours. By far the worst job I’ve worked. Standing on a line for hours on end throughout the shift. Didn’t care how many hours you worked. Made changes to your schedule the same day you are working to make you come in a few hours after your shift ends to work another shift.
bad,"When I started there in 1990, it was the very best place in town to work.  Great pay, great benefits, great retirement.  People would ask me how I was lucky enough to get on there.  Now people laugh and pity you for working there.  Through years of terrible mismanagement, lack of spending on the facility itself, and the contempt the company has for its employees, it is now a shell of what it was.  I quit because I couldn't stomach it anymore.  I loved that place.  Very sad."
bad,"Run don't even consider, bunch of backstabbers.  Work you like a slave and only way ahead is to lie and cheat and throw others under the bus.  Worst company and they won't last long."
bad,They can not balance home and work life   It sucks there   Use and abuse you  you catch them messing with there not at fault you make a mistake your fired
bad,This was one of the worst places I ever worked at they don’t give you hours they have you work once a week and that’s it I’m not making any money like that
bad,It was the worst job I ever had they worked Me just long enough to to become full time and on the 30th day they resruckerd and got read of all the new workers and keep all the old ones the lazy ones it was ran by all Mexicans that didn't like white people the company is a joke it was in onterio Oregon  its  just a joke they are trying to close it
bad,"On recrute et on donne des postes à des gens nuls et les gens compétents on les mets dehors j ai p impression qu ils veulent casser la compagnie"
bad,they are a really bad place to work for. I would never go back there to work for them. They treat there employees like trash. If you're not in management your pay is really low
bad,"Kraft Heinz is a company where you can get top-quality training if you want it. As far is career paths and advancement there is pretty much zero room. Favoritism runs rampant, and if you're not from a certain cultural background you have absolutely no room for advancement, because you will be passed over for someone of the same cultural background as management and supervisors."
bad,"This was the nastiest job I’ve ever worked and I was an STNA and Kraft bacon plant was worse! The smell, the cold everything, nasty... not to mention when you first start they make you wear a blue hat the singles you out as a new hire and everyone calls you a blueberry and complains about having to work with you because your new.  As if being new wasn’t already hard enough they have to single you out so everyone in the whole place knows that you’re a new worker and don’t know what you’re doing. They don’t slow anything down for you, you instantly have to go in and work at the pace of people who have been there for years it’s impossible."
bad,Stay away! The gossip is rampant! The supervisors are horrible & the pay is below average for 1 of the top 5 food companies in the world! Been nothing but a revolving door since I’ve been here
bad,"it was a cold winter night and there I was spotted at day 376 without a day off waiting for the front doors to open, needless to say they opened them and work continued as planned."
bad,"Ze houden je aan de lijn met 0 uren contract "
bad,Kraft is not for everyone poor management and a lot more to say over work no help from management looking for a better job where they care about the employees
bad,The management is rude and makes up accusations about employees to get them fired we don’t have off days they make us work 20 nights overnight until we get a off day and the job is writing people up for using their personal time or vacation time.
bad,Eh it was okay. Was not the best. Could be better. 4 years of heck. Cold. There is better jobs out there that is for sure. Do not recommend. Management blows.
bad,Management are back stabbing full of drama as well as a lot of the employees on sanitation. It’s a hostile work environment and they expect certain employees to do all the work while other special treated employees are allowed to go sleep in the locker rooms
bad,If you work here only stay long enough to get factory experience and get out. You are monitored by cameras in all areas of plant while hourly employees review and selectively turn employees in for violations. Parking lot is a muddy cesspool.
bad,They make you work 12 hour shifts and say you’ll get a day off but then they force you to come in. Get there and you clean the whole shift not produce.
bad,You may get all these benefits which is a good thing. The management is poor quality and everyone working there will be nice to you at first but then once they get to know you they will turn on you
bad,Management changed over at least 3 times since i started i worked part time but worked almost 40 hrs a week with less pay then other workers there doing the same job i did. Poor management skill.
bad,"Horrible horrible management. Wouldn’t have been that bad if the supervisors weren’t jerks. It was always way too cold, and nothing was done. Went to tell one of the “Safety Techs” about my mom being injured( i got onto the same shift as my mom) amd she did not take it seriously at all, later that day my mother ended up needing to leave because of her injury."
bad,You are constantly watched and your supervisor made it manditory to give her your password or you were repremanded in front of the rest of the co-workers.  Then other were able to to get to your password and then put things on your computer and allow unwanted things to pop up on the internet.  They took them as jokes and I never wanted to be a part of it.  Middle School type atmosphere that you should avoid.
bad,"This company claims to have a labor shortage in New Ulm, but that is a total lie. The only shortage is black, Hispanic, and/or female for their ""diversified"" agenda. Temporary employees are only used as a ""retainer"" until an employees family member or buddy decides that they want a job at Kraft Heintz."
bad,"HR makes the rules based on personal relationships and not skill, lots of stolen time by office hourly, vacation days not accurately reported, VPN not used or IM system for tracking.  Discrimination is very open and obvious."
bad,I was hired on through a temporary service I worked for Kraft hienz for 32 days exactly and in that time I was not properly trained for the task I was hired to do and on the 32 nd day I received a TEXT MESSAGE from kelly services telling me my assignment had been ended because I wasn’t a good fit ! I am a single mother of three kids and my employment was cut off for no reason I had not been reprimanded for anything to cause the termination of my assignment.
bad,"Don’t waster your time. They work you into the ground for $9.50 an hour and if they’re slow you will get laid off. The bosses are mean, you are just a number there. Full time workers are rude and pushy. If they feel like you don’t know a lot they’ll take advantage of you when it comes to the hard work and breaks."
bad,The work environment was fast-paced and very cold in the extreme. The lack of communication between upper management to the lower employees was minimal. The company's failed attempt to understand and motivate the employees on their goals led to lower daily production.
bad,Kraft Heinz changed to culture for the worse. I planned to make a career here but once they were bought everything changed. Massive layoffs and complete culture change. It wasn't for me.
bad,long day n cold envoriment  fast pace the cold was bad on a person health just to cold to work in on daily i love nursing and i want to get back to it
bad,KraftHeinz cuts to the bare bone with not enough employees to do the work here. They have cut back so much and do not appreciate the employees that are still left. All of the long time employees are retiring or finding different jobs.
bad,Management was very weak and changes were not properly communicated. Working and integrating with different business units was very difficult. However since being first job after college I got to learn many different things.
bad,They don’t pay u till u leave the company I didn’t like working in the cold and then having to go back to work I don’t know what else to say but I need a job
bad,One employee at kraft does not deserve to work for kraft foods treats truckers bad ignores you wont talk to you always bad mood keeps drivers waiting for hours just to wash always has excuses why he cant wash your trailer so many people complain about this guy and he still here something needs to be done #alex horrible employee
bad,"Management was good at the beginning but, then became poor because they changed it  about three times while I was there. Mostly for the lock of communication, responsibility, and lock of knowledge in their field. I enjoyed at the beginning but, I ended doing the work of 2 people by myself. Workplace culture low."
bad,"Kraft is okay to work for, you get a lot of over time. You work with a lot of different people. You can take bids and advance quickly.  It is very cold working on lunchable lines."
bad,"Used to be a god place to work not anymore since Kraft/Heinz bought it. Would suggest not applying here. Plant probably wont be around much longer, the place is falling apart and all the employees are leaving or being pushed out by attrition."
bad,I never liked this company because there was not any opportunity to advance. environment was to boring and all they wanted was for the worker to work hard and fast.
bad,"It was a temp job. Wasn't there that long."
bad,i dont know it was good. i guess you get threaded well and you have flexibility of choosing your own hours and stuff. but they close the plant so we all lost job.
bad,"Given a daily schedule and it was never accurate. Supervisors decided what they wanted to run. Never went according to the schedule we were given. Certain people were always break relief and did nothing else. There was never support from management and concerns went unresolved much less even given attention. Management promoted from the good ol boys club, there were no female supervisors and women weren't given the opportunity to grow."
bad,"Fast pace, cut throat place to work. Its a turkey processing plant and the smell is something that you have to get acustomed to. Lack of advacement and favortism"
bad,"Since 3G has taken over all we ever see is cuts, cuts, cuts. Then for the first time in 19 years of working there they deny our bonus, but spent 5 million for a super bowl commercial. Can't wait to retire before they make my pension disappear."
bad,"As a temp worker,  the pay is not near enough for the work required,  much less the attitude you'll get from some of the full time employees, to them you are lower then dirt!!!!. I encountered a lot of attitude as well as bullying!!!!                                           Not even to my worst enemy would I recommend a job here!!!"
bad,they don't care about you they just want to push the product out the door. Some of the management would try to be on your side then turn in a heartbeat and throw you under the table.
bad,THa management is terrible they do not are about their employees.  They will work you 24/7 .  They will be buying another company soon and more layoffs will be coming.
bad,"Good place to work, managers were good, pay was good, benefits were good. People were nice, the job was stressful but not too stressful. Good opportunities to advance."
bad,"Had to work all shifts especially on the weekend, absolutely no time for a life outside of work, besides doing my own work I had to go and preform operators tasks, the work ethic there was terrible"
bad,"When you come in as a Kelly temp you will be treated like you are garbage. Kelly services will pay you 10.70 per hour while you work with folks making 18.53 and up. Kelly services rep. at the plant could care less if your taxes or pay is correct, and has a really bad attitude when asked for anything. The worst part is the sexist culture where women get easy jobs and men get stuck on physically demanding positions for the same pay, making half the wages of Kraft members. As if trashing your clothes, and being disrespected and scrapping by isn't bad enough, you have to work 1041 hours before you can even be considered for hire and then you better not have missed more than 3 days (in 6-8 months. and if you even miss 2 they extend the time for Kelly a month!) and you better be ready for a whole new interview process after working there for what usually turns out to be 6-8 months. In other words, you can come in and work the worst jobs in the plant for half the pay and after all that struggle you still wont be hired. And since Kraft did away with the pension whats the big payoff? The payoff is for Kelly services because they are making a lot of money on the backs of the people who want to work for Kraft. Never again! Just say no to temp agencies! Oh and don't forget you will work 3rd shift and it will probably be 12 hours of total brutality unless you are a woman."
bad,"A complete WASTE of TIME.  Nasty, scheming, controlling, manipulative, RUDE, VICIOUS, _____ as a trainer/traitor.  I have NEVER encountered  a more UNPROFESSIONAL company.  As an employee had stated...""we can't ever keep anybody""-that point was stated in relationship to that trainer/traitor.  To summarize...DISGUSTING.  Great location-TERRIBLE company."
bad,"There is no stability at this company. You will not be provided the resources to meet the unrealistic expectations that are set for you. It is incredibly cut throat, and the hours only worse as time progresses."
bad,"No work life balance, Senior management makes the workers cry.The ride the good people into the ground and let the slackers slack and slide. Managers don't know anything about what their people do in maintenance and engineering. High supervisor turnover."
bad,Its an ok place to work overall i enjoyed working for this company overall didnt like the rotating shifts tho. but it was a good company to work for especially for the benefits
bad,"Good company . good people always helping out. Good money a lot of over time.... Great benefits ...they work with you ., .............."
bad,"Not worth your time. Don't even work here short term. So much instability and lack of knowledge. No structure anywhere. Sink or swim, and swimming not rewarded."
bad,"Didn't really care for this job"
bad,"Very long hours when i was on the production floor, no set hours from week to week. "
bad,they figure their job each day is to read their emails and answer them- many days they don't even step out of the office.  then their only other reponsibility is to make sure the blame rolls down hill and that they cover their butt
bad,"The bad thing about working at Heinz is that the people don't speak"
bad,"lots of responsibilities, sometimes unrealistic goals, they want you to do so much with so little... lots of hours. Labor force had no skill, the turn over ratio really high. people would quit within a day of being hire, the senior personal had less than 2 years in a crew of 25. always new hires every two weeks we would get new hires, 5 10 people, non would make it to a year... it is difficult to maximize production when your labor is not qualify."
bad,This is a horrible company run by predominantly African americans.  White people or Hispanic people do not stand a chance.
bad,"12 hour days with only two 20 minute breaks.not to work for kraft management never seen.co workers were fine,everday something always wrong,nothing enjoyable about job ."
bad,"It was a pretty good place to work, before Heinz came in.  It's all about the bottom dollar for them.  Salary people had their pay cut by 10 percent, the ones that were left.  The other salary people were fired.  Some had been there for 30 plus years.  The shipping department was just told, that their jobs are being eliminated and outsourced to another company.  So they have 6 weeks to sign another job.  A couple of months ago, there were alot of negative reviews about this company, but i cannot find them now.  I wonder how long this review will stay up.  Heed my warning!!!!  DO NOT WORK FOR HEINZ!"
bad,co workers are very nice its very physical work if I was younger I would have went to school to get a degree the pays good and insurance
bad,"Hated the place, basically they wanted to draw blood from you and a member of staff pinched my £900 bike !!!! scum. "
bad,"Un trabajo activo con un personal de excelente trato los jefes gerencia muy bien los departamentos trabajaba con los proyectos de la empresa, facturación, geneneración de requisiciones, archivos, llamadas."
bad,Heartless company no morals. Not willing to hear opinions of employees. Once there mind is made up not even Governors and politicians can change their minds.
bad,it was a job where i got to see how different things were made. i worked in the dinners department where i made mac and cheese. i also got to work in other departments when they cut my hours in the department i was hired to work in.
bad,"Corporate R&D Headquarters was the most unfriendliest place I have worked. Say ""Good Morning"" or ""Hello"" to anyone walking by you in the hallways and they would 95% of the time walk by you and not say a word.  If you are a contractor you are dirt and not to be addressed or acknowledged"
bad,"Drive 1 1/2 to work for nothing to do, sat around and did nothing. There wasn't really any management, some pretend bosses to get other people to do all the rework. I didn't talk to any workers"
bad,"As a part time job never had any guaranteed hours. In order to make up to 40hrs, was not happy to travel far out of area of my residence zip code."
bad,One of Pittsburgh's great companies with a lot of history. Currently going through a lot of hard changes
bad,"the company is all about them selfs. They don't care about their employees. All they care about is money. We all work so many hours and have no life's. Any review on here saying this place is a good place to work is probably from some part of management. They get everything, even all of our bonuses at the end of the year. Benefits are good, but that's all they offer you."
bad,"- found out your schedule for the week the first day of that same week... not well planned"
bad,unsafe nothing is labeled no material is available told to do things unsafe and job threatened when refused
bad,High speed production.Keeps you busy.Made alot of great friends.Hardest part was working 13 days in a row.
bad,all you need is a bachelors degree and a pulse to be management
bad,"Expensive health insurance, no sick pay. No job security. I did learn a lot about computers and operating systems."
bad,This place is horrible and should have the human rights commission intervene in their abusive behavior. I am in the process of suing them and would warn anyone to stay far away!!
bad,"Good pay "
bad,"All the rumors you've heard are true.  Since being taken over by 3G Capital, Heinz is no longer the company with loyal employees who spend their entire careers in one place.  Work /Life balance is non-existent.  So much so that management has actually said that if you want a life outside of work, this is not the company for you.  After mass layoffs, the overworked employees that were left have been jumping ship.  Droves of hard-working, knowledgeable employees have gone.  Some have even walked out without notice.  My advice: stay away!  I could write negative after negative comment in this review but I'd be here for hours compiling the list!  Ask and former or current Heinz employee (who isn't Brazilian) and you will hear the same answers."
bad,"They say they will train you for 3 weeks, and not change anything in that 3 weeks. Then after 1 week they wont have you trained on everything and they will move you off of training and switch your shift from 1st, 2nd, or 3rd every other week. They will have you doing stuff you weren't trained to do, and they want you to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week like you don't have a life or family outside of work."
bad,"Forklift operator in dry, conditioned, and freezer environment 10-11 hr shifts with 1 38 minute lunch and no breaks."
bad,"Terrible Place to work in Maintenance Department at the Florence, SC location. There is no leadership from maintenance management, no training, and no Pm program. Mainatenance Manager and Coaches, never have anything good to say about the Technicians. Very hard people to work for."
bad,stuffed cucumbers in a jar to be sent down the line so other ingredients and vinegar can be put in jars and sealed and labeled and sent off to stores. Co-workers stayed to them selves. The hardest thing was standing there and smelling vinegar all the time.
bad,"there a joke management has no clue, thier product is to expensive and really not the good"
bad,"There are three people that work for this company that literally do all of the work. The owner and (so called general manager) however are completely inept and have absolutely no business acumen. If you would like to watch a sinking ship that has 3 people doing everything to bail water and barely keep the ship afloat, meanwhile the ""Captain"" and ""First Mate"" are drilling holes in the hull of the boat and screaming at everyone to bail harder; that would be the best description of Heinz RV. This company operates at a complete loss and the employees have to listen to complaints while the owners dump buckets of money in panic attempts to find somebody to save them. The owners are desperate and would be better off to cash in their chips and get out of doing business of any kind. I had a very hard time watching my efforts become completely negated by the bad decisions of the owners and that is why I could not stomach working for this organization. My opinion is that the owners should pay themselves to not go to work and let the people that actually know what they are doing run the company. That would be my primary advice to the owners. But unfortunately you cannot be reasonable when your are desperate, short sighted and greedy. I personally would prefer working as a volunteer for a worth cause then to accept another cent from Heinz RV."
bad,The worst underpaying horrible job ever welcome to slave labor at its finest. How does that company stay in business? It has a massive turn over rate and treats their employees like garbage. The Management is so cocky and out of touch this proves that if you have a degree in basket weaving you to can be a manager at Kraft Foods!
bad,Day starts at 3 am not over till 8 or 9 pm you work all holidays and do not do the work that you were hired to do. I stocked shelves and was not working the job I was hired to do. Being a woman in this company I was not treated as an equal.
bad,"Had to be there at 5:45am, long work day, learned to run and operate a machine, management was ok, co-workers very helpful,standing in a hour rotation of the same thing, going home"
bad,"HR was the worst I have ever seen, unprofessional, discriminating, and the rules are only for certain employees, spent years working and never got in trouble for anything, I turned a employee in for treats and I was fired"
bad,"After Heinz bought Kraft Foods, to become KraftHeinz, things have snowballed downward.  Pay more for less healthcare coverage.   Current management has ""God"" complex, treating employees like they are beneath them( even the ones who used to be hourly employees).  Set unrealistic goals and when not achieved take it out on employees by working more hours."
bad,"Useless management. The place is run like a Victorian workhouse. Some very odd individuals work here."
bad,Do your homework and research the company and employee turnover rate. Also look at companies position in stock/NASDAQ . Research the H R personnel as well.
bad,Time to be hired.  First paycheck.  Training.  But on all three shifts.  For a big company Terrible experience there all around..  some managment thinks they are better then you.  Poor attitude.
bad,"Management, VERY unprofessional. Any spare chance, the managers & employees get, they will throw you under the bus. No matter how long you worked there, thats what they do. The pay and insurance is NOT worth it."
bad,You like working long hours and not having a life it’s the place to be . Bad management bad warehouse management they don’t wanna hire enough employees I was working 12 hours a day for three years straight plus Saturdays and spend the whole summer working seven days a week I would not recommend a job to my worst enemy my suggestion is if someone from mines offers you a job turn around and run
bad,I've been employed for 30 years. When Heinz came in this job turn drastically for the worse. Super cut throat company with no compassion for it's employees.
bad,"El día a día era completo. Mucho trabajo."
bad,Mentally unhealthy place to work. Kids hired straight out of college hired as supervisors with no experience to back their poor decision making skills.
bad,Headquarters and Human Resources will sell your soul.  Promise you one thing then turn around and do the other.  You are part of the bottom line.  ZBB
bad,"Use to be a great company to work for but now management is horrible and HR is worse. Discisons made on the fly without any thought put in to it. Management changes the handbook and points system multiple times a year and if you're not one of there favorites you are not going anywhere, been stuck on the night shift for 8 years. Management doesn't care to hear any ideas or thoughts. Your working 6-7 days a week 50 to 70 hours a week and holiday's too. Extremely hard to get vacation time. Equipment keeps breaking due to lack of maintenance and no parts to fix the problems. Hard to run a company if you ask for feedback and what you can fix on why you're employees are not happy and leaving, then do nothing about the feedback."
bad,"high stress not enough time to complete the Job. Management does not care if machine is not able to run efficient, just want high numbers. They want quality, but push machines and operators pass their ability to give the quality that the customers deserve."
bad,"Kraft Heinz is, by far, the most toxic business I've ever worked for. A few examples:"
bad,Not the best person to review this company since I was part of a severance.  The views from Aon are spectacular but the culture is lacking and is becoming very cut-throat where you just throw people under the bus to save your own hide.
bad,middle level management has their head clued to their computer monitor with no clue what goes on within their facility   middle management does nothing to resolve issues  - just looks for someone to blame in order to cover there own butt
bad,Kraft/Heinz in Coshocton county lacked the proper tools to successfully motivate their employees. Their main goal was production without regard to empathy for the plight that their employees would deal with on a day-to-day basis.
bad,When 3G had taken over Heinz over 900 employees were laid-off despite being told otherwise. 3G it taking a brand which is iconic go the city of Pittsburgh and it us moving the company to Chicago.
bad,"First time do it wrong, no symphony for the staff and stopped my job. Phone to me don't come back again. No explained why? I missed the iphone cable in their company. Not approved I go back pick up it. There is a too bad company."
bad,"Kraft was a great company to work for until they were bought by Heinz. The new company does not value it's employees and it shows all around. Heinz made management cuts and are now hiring individuals who are unqualified and cold. Heinz dropped the Kraft policy of ""quality of life"" and ""family first"", demanding 6 day weeks/12hr shifts when the plant is understaffed. The production staff is belittled and run ragged, being told constantly that their job is in jeopardy. There are major HR issues and there is no end in sight. The only reason they are holding on to employees is due to the wage and affordable benefits."
bad,Safety is not first...very unethical place to work..was part of managment team and plant manager and other managers asked me to do unethical practices such as lying on paperwork and to regulatory agencies...illegal work practices exist in employee scheduling also...employees are forced to work 12 hour days and seven days a week....dont do it!!!
bad,"Horriable hours and no days off not that best job the company does not treat workers with any respect at all and do not care if there unhappy, No why of moving up you try and they just say no. i wanted to learn more and do more jobs but got told no"
bad,"I worked there for 8 yrs as a mechanic.  There were almost never proper parts to repair breakdowns.  Management had thrown out millions of dollars of parts when changed to outsourced inventory program. The Maintenance dept lost 3 managers due to voluntary quit or termination.  In the year since I left 9 out of 20 mechanics have abruptly left and no replacements are imminent. Remaining mechanics are now charged with also relieving production lines, causing more down time to all machines that are 40+ yrs old. Sometimes the remaining mechanics are forced to work 16hr/day  and/or 7 days/wk.  When medical or family matters require time off vacation days or sick call outs must be used  Sick days initiate progressive discipline  including termination and a few more mechanics are on the cusp of termination.  Some of these mechanics had over 20 years service and just walked out. On day one management get over a month of personal days, liberal sick time."
bad,Not a very good place to work up less you ready to kiss butt. they just do understand treat people like you want to be treated.
bad,"Kraft used to be one of the best places to work.  However, since Heinz/3G has taken over, there is no true leader.  The CEO lies about goals, targets, and KPI's being attained.  There is NO work life balance any longer.  Benefits slashed and large unreachable bonuses are dangled to entice, but you will never obtain them.  Children run projects who have zero experience and then wonder why they failed.  RUN don't walk - away from this disaster in the making.  I seriously cannot believe Warren Buffet actually aligned with this company."
bad,"Worst place where one can work, if you divide the compensation by number of hours worked, factor in the huge stress in the workplace, Heinz comes in as one of the worst companies to work for. Did not use to be like this before the 3G management arrived..."
bad,Great company to work. 50 hour work weeks min. Management is good co-workers are nice. days are long. pay is good. the days are long and the management is new.
bad,"This place has a huge lack of accountability. The fellow co-workers aim to please themselves and blame others for mistakes to keep themselves from getting into trouble even though it was their fault. Leadership is nowhere found in those walls. Its a ""me first"" and ""screw you"" mentality in this place. With a backwards seniority policy gives newer and up coming workers a heavy and hard entry to this plant. Training is an abomination! I have never been so under trained in my career as a worker. The lack of instruction leaves you overwhelmed and frustrated and ready to leave quickly. The hour system is screwed up. Making people come in 4 hours early is insane and making them stay 4 hours late is absurd and how it was not told upfront in my interview was a true example of their character, shady and disrespecting. I for one am sorry I worked there. In my experience there, three people walked off the site, in one week, and many by the stories I heard while there before me."
bad,"Once 3G bought the company work/life balance vanished, a new round of job cuts came every few months, and departments were left short handed."
bad,I've had this experience and more than one Kraft location. The make promises and don't stand behind their words...and then lie to set you up if you bring attention to it.
bad,"I was injured twice on the job. The nurse on duty told me that my supervisor noted in my file that, if I were to ever get hurt, that it would be a personal injury. Therefore, Kraft is not liable for injury nor doctors care. I developed tendonitis in my dominant hand, then my hours were cut. Their reasoning was that my 'personal' injury prevented me from performing basic job functions. While I was pregnant, my supervisor made me lift 25lb boxes over my head for the entire 12 hour shift, I miscarried 2 days later. The new point system is absurd. I worked at Kraft for 2 years. As the supervisors were given new duties, by upper management, their egos also inflated."
bad,"it was good at the start, but it closed in the end."
bad,"Terrible place to work,no safety,nobody was happy there.I worked a lot of days unable to even take a break. Management was inexperienced. If at all possible find another place to work."
bad,Rushed to pack days quoter.There was a mouse running round the floor and a man in charge stamped on it to kill it. PPE was secound hand.
bad,"Kraft promises one wage $17.17) then changes their mind by lowering promised wage by $4 per hour ($13.33) and they make you pay back the difference ($75 per pay period), thus working for nothing (as I currently am forced to do by law)."
bad,"The people that make the product, bake it, pack it, ship it, SELL it, and put it on the shelf are the ones that make that company."
bad,Job was not as great as I hoped. Very poor management. My boss would get into fist fights with the customers and other venders. Was glad to leave.
bad,They have taken everything away from the workers. All benefits gone. They do not care at all about their workers. Cut jobs and people. Management only cares about profits. Will not listen to workers who have experience.
bad,"Kraft has employees waiting on pay from timed worked. Employees are being told Kraft dont no when are if they will get paid Human resources has not helped employees at all in this matter, instead they make comments, "" all the money you make in a year why you worried about a few hundred dollars"".  And this is going on as we speak. 12/09/20 employees have not got all there money $500.00 plus with some for time work Thanksgiving week."
bad,"Leadership is the fundamental problem but they don't mind to scape goat the problems to the employees. Such as blaming them for the insanely high turn over."
bad,"Poorly run all about cost savings and not growing brands"
bad,This job might be ok for someone with no family or life what so ever. I was working 12 to 15 hours a day 7 days a week. The turn over rate is enormous. Some days you can't even take a break. You can make money with all the overtime. But it's just not worth it.
bad,They run machines into the ground. Very little preventive maintenance gets done when machines fail they try and make it your fault. Sometimes you work 7 days a week 12 hours a day because they are so short staffed. Management is the worst I've ever seen.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody. You are expected to work whenever they tell you to, no matter what you have going on outside of work or no daycare for kids. Just an absolutely horrible work environment with very low morale"
bad,Don't waste your time with maintenance jobs there they lie to you about how many days you will work and the new guy will always get the worst jobs during your shift
bad,Management is garbage. Care nothing about anything more then theirselves!! I was told by the plant manager his employees don't matter a body can be replaced by another body. Trash!
bad,"This place is for those that can't do any better.. . This place sucks. The management is AWFUL. The equipment is barely functional, and for the lifts that do work you have to fight for them."
bad,"I have never work for a manager that is such an arrogant backstabber in all of my working experiences. This guy is such a lazy fat guy and only starts his workday by noon every day since I have been working there. Since I can see that there is no room to grow with this company,  I finally said to myself that I am done with Kraft Heinz Primal B. Do not apply for this job he will try to get rid of you if he does not like you."
bad,"Forced overtime, 70+ hours a week. 13 hour days. Hr is the worst I’ve ever seen. They have lost a lot of people recently and I don’t blame a single one of them for leaving."
bad,Very poor management. They don’t care about anything than you come to work. The treat black people like In slave. It’s was a very bad experience. No black people in the management. Some area is reserved for black people in third shift.
bad,"No support, poor management, unstable, plant is falling apart. "
bad,"Place promotes growth and has a great work lifestyle and motto from afar, after getting to know the place and people there is humongous amounts of favouritism and drama and management wont take care of it. The company is all about money, they have the mindset to cut people and redline jobs until it effects their numbers (which are all that matter) then they hire uneducated lazy people to back fill those jobs and pay them less. Worked there for 3 years, made fantastic money, was redlined for doing my job, wont ever look back"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"There are a lot of other jobs around Massillon that actually pay a decent wage.  This place is bad.  Culture is spiteful, hateful, and neither the lousy management or my union will do anything."
bad,"Kraft/Heinz is managed SO badly, machines are not kept up, and causes downtime for hours, sometimes days, which has to be made up. After standing for 6 hours while they attempt a repair, your told you HAVE to work Sunday, or be written up, while you have already been given a mandatory Saturday.  They cancel time off, are rude and do no consider your family obligations.  They just act like you are getting a check, so you belong to them. Trust me, theis is no place for a career."
bad,"I am suprised this place is still open.  Terrible culture, nobody cares, cut throat, and no where near enough people to take care of the place."
bad,"I would only consider this job if I was a young kid wanting to move up fast and not wanting to ever have a family. This company treats their employees like trash. The management will change a schedule several times a week. A hourly employee never knows when they are working or not as they say they are running to numbers and the numbers are often change during the week,so if you think you may make the number they will add more. The company don't wanna do any maintenance on the machines, so they are always breaking down causing the employees not to reach the numbers and the management blames the hourly employees for everything so if the employees don't make their numbers they punish them by working Saturdays and Sundays notifying them on a Friday so they can never make any plans with their family.This facility has a mandatory overtime calendar that the employees are forced to sign up to work 4 12 hour days on top of working Monday through Sunday schedule 6 to 7 days a week depending on the numbers. The management took the employees sick time and their personal days putting them on a point system where the employee gets written up if they use over two days in a year firing them on every three write ups these write ups can remain on the employees record for up to three years if they last that long  forcing them to come in sick making everyone else sick. The hourly employees are running very short staff as the management treat the people like dirt and a lot of employees don't want to work there anymore. The mandatory calendar is used to cover employees for everything management can"
bad,"The pay is reasonable for the area, with lots of  overtime to be worked!  I was averaging 25 hours a week of overtime for a year, but had many weeks of over 30, and 6 days a week almost every week.  They add on additional days to the schedule the day prior to your weekend basically letting you know you will be working your weekend, sometimes with under 24 hours until your day off.  Also you never know when your shift ends as you are forced to stay until the end of production, can be a 2-4 hour window!  When production is poor they threaten to fire employees almost on the daily!  I would not recommend this job to anyone i actually care about, the stress level is insanely high and almost not worth the pay.  Its only semi worth it if you get hired on full time and are looking to get out of debt or get some extra money in the bank, although i do not recommend staying permanently under these conditions as its so stressful i would actually classify it as unhealthy!  Also the temp to hire, they will string you along for months some people for well over a year, a few will get hired on quickly but very few!  Its one of the most unprofessional work environments i have ever worked in!"
bad,Its socially the equivalent of a high school class room. The supervisors don't respect you as a person. The scheduling system does not allow you to have any social life outside of work!
bad,Poor place to work managment only covers their own butt. Managers dont care about workers or their wages as long as they get their bonuses. Benifits are good but morals are bad and pay is horrible.
bad,"Hr is the worse , they work you over with no notice at all , they rush you through your trainning , by far worse trainning methods i ever experienced,  get sick they want doctor statement if you provide it you are still fired , mechanics do production work and production do mechanical work but they make different pay , they throw every new hire on 3rd shift then force them over on weekends to clean while other shifts enjoy there weekend off . The place is a mess !!!  Hr works together to cover things up instead of fixing the problem.  The more experienced co workers are bullies on the floor instead of helping new workers ."
bad,Management is awful!   Treat you like dogs.  union jobs being eliminated management top heavy and expanding.Micro manage and don’t care if managers have felonies or anyone for that matter.
bad,Pay is excellent but expect mandatory overtime every day due to their inability to maintain consistent workforce necessary to meet goals. If you  have a life outside of work it will suffer due to the lack of communication by management and the consistent inconsistencies.
bad,Management does not know  From one day to the next what's going on they never tell us the truth it's always a guessing game. You never knew when did trust the management or if they were tell him the truth or a lie. The morale is awful they're just not a good place to work anymore
bad,"After the buyout and merger, Morale was sucked out of the company. Mass exodus of talent.  Do not apply here. It is a soul sucking experience. You will be fine in the short term, but it will eventually drain you."
bad,"Hours are long and time off is short and seldom. If you want a fast buck give it a shot but if you want an unyielding number of hours and poor management to make things worse, this is the place for you."
bad,"Company openly harasses people with disabilities to make them quit. Forced overtime which was 13 days straight on 3rd shift and 8 to 12 hour days. "
bad,"Job cuts have taken away much needed jobs positions. 12 hour shifts are a way of life, no family time here. Management is poor at best. They continue to cut jobs with little regard to safety."
bad,Very stressful environment. The company makes it's employees work harder not smarter. Poor management and decision making. Absolutely no work/family balance.
bad,"Don't do it. PE fund made the game over"
bad,"I did not like the management while i work here the worked there employees like slavers, You would start up late all the time and never know what time you would go home. They would tell you that it is mandatory over time two hours befor time to go. Given you like less then five min to find someone to watch or someone to pick up your kids. An if you was not back to the line in time you got written up. I never got to see my kids during the week and ws to tired on the weekend to have any fun cause I was to tired."
bad,After working at KraftHeinz they have made it very clear that they do not care about their employees and only care about results. They have a 44% turnover rate and are understaffed.
bad,"Many employees are Hispanic and speak little to no English. Management is constantly coming and going due to the overwhelming amount of change that needs to happen, none of which are willing to follow through on promises. Expect to work 12+ hour days 6+ days a week with no real life outside of work."
bad,"Major layoffs soon after 3G (Heinz) takeover.  Those left had to pick up the workload and were constantly being threatened to lose their jobs.  The shift from investing in employees switched to eliminating jobs without reviewing / reassigning responsibilities.  "
bad,"Horrible place to work. Not enough pay for the amount of work done. Way too much of a popularity contest, rather than respect for the amount of you put in."
bad,"Working 60 to 74 hours a week, new hires plan on working every weekend for the next 4 years, everyone is out to get each other, negative moral, company does not care about the employees, it's  going down hill fast.as anew hire your like sweet I'll work work work and make good money but after 6 months of never seeing your family and dealing with all the forced overtime and fmla and 8 hour restrictions you get beat"
bad,"they scam people & their turnover rate is constantly growing, they are unfit positions to be worked by a person causing most employees to quit or get put on light duty, they never take responsibility for the damage they cause"
bad,"Before Heinz was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, it was a great place to work. After the aforementioned investors took over, it became a miserable place to work. Work life balance was non existent (all work, no life), and cost cutting initiatives made the product worse for the customer and the experience worse for employees."
bad,"Stay away from Kraft Heinz. Cheap company, No raises, still get no benefits. Cost cutting comes first. You are only there to make the company money. Your hard work is never appreciated."
bad,"This company only cares about numbers and production. The warehouse employees  are constantly forced to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, face sudden and unexplainable schedule changes, NO notice about days off (if any), safely is ignored, worker fatigue is rampant, and inexperienced people are operating equipment in a unsafe manner. Let's see how all office and management do the work for a couple of months, and see how their family/marriage life is. With one day off, they wouldn't last, or change."
bad,"Worked in Capri maintenance for almost 3 years. From day one I was misinformed on company policies a was told of advancement opportunities but, it's a test based advancement and management doesn't send people to test to keep there bottom line low. Real quick turnaround and since 2014 they had 9 senior guys leave the company because of the stress and changes made. Mechanics are treated like dogs and don't get caught trying to cool down(no ac in shop and most of plant) or they will run you in the ground. Overtime is a daily deal and if on the off shifts the crews are made of very young college grads with no to very little experience. I saw the fall and decided I was burnt out and too stressed to stay any longer. Good starter job, lots of stuff breaking all the time. But employees are very burnt out and the environment is very hostile. No parts in house to fix things, so your job gets very stressful fast. Pay is also low starting and they don't allow progressive movement up the ladder."
bad,I have went through the worst possible time at this employer and there is no way to write it out in here but the only benefit of working here was the incredible pay of 16.75 just to do the basic jobs.
bad,"large hispanic workforce, racist against others."
bad,"Kraft after the Heinz merger is no longer a desirable company to work for. Team morale is to the lowest.  Heavy workload. Many smart and valuable people were let go because they are higher up the rank and are dispensable, left with younger folks who are less knowledgeable and involved with projects.  Kraft is not going to be the same!!"
bad,"Kraft supposedly has a great reputation, but the Finance/Accounting areas are very disorganized and have awful management. In fact, I was never more displeased with a boss in my life. The onboarding was non-existent, no one will train you, and politics rules all with rampant gossiping."
bad,"A Heinz no Brasil surgiu da compra de uma empresa familiar (Quero Alimentos), a qual tinha um trabalho focado e em grande crescimento em volume e qualidade, a Heinz continuou com o mesmo seguimento de trabalho, contudo quando o grupo 3G adquiriu a Heinz, mudanças de filosofia e trabalho que estavam em crescimento, foram totalmente alterados para um modelo não aceitável no mercado de trabalho, a chamada meritocracia, a qual é constatado a sua manipulação ao decorrer do tempo estimado para cumprimento das metas, assim nunca acontecendo em seu potencial maior."
bad,Management and hr a joke benefits suck and put morons in charge that doesn't need to be in charge
bad,"Has the old timers mentality. It's a very based company in the sense that if you don't fit in they run you out. Management and hr will tell you they will do something then pat the old guy on the back the bias on the job  is not worth the trouble.Their thought is this is the way we have always done it  and it's the good olé boys club. They can cuss you out and say what they want, but you had better not say a word back. And if you do the hang you out to dry. Just be aware they talk good going in then it's a complete opposite."
bad,Kraft Foods works their supervisors to death. They often work 3 and 4 weeks without days off. They also given then pay cuts regularly.
bad,Not recommend applying here.  Since new owners took company private it is no longer the type of environment I want to work in.  The most enjoyable part of the job left when they laid off 600 US employees.
bad,"It doesn't matter how hard or how long you have worked there, the current management team are cold and heartless. You can get fired if you try and speak the truth, they do not listen to the employees at all. It is an awful place to work!"
bad,"I was a Cadbury employee absorbed by Kraft, much like Nabisco. To this day, ex-Nabisco employees still make sure you know that they aren't Kraft - they are Nabisco. And they were bought over 11 years ago! Kraft discourages cross-functional relationships and end to end involvement in the business. Success is based on your ability to ""go with the flow"" and fit in. It is the antithesis of entrepreneurial thinking and behavior. Drones will do exceedingly well here. I have even heard from recruiters that they don't want ex-Kraft employees because they don't have a working knowledge of the whole business, overall. If you ant a government job that only offers a ""high deductible"" benefits plan, then this is the company for you. If you want to have a voice and a say in the outcome of your company, find another company."
bad,"mgt. are not very engaged in day to day activities and are a tad bit out of touch. They know the economy is tough so they try to muscle you if they can. Not bad people, but they make sure they cover their own selves even if it means throwing you under the bus."
bad,"I worked there for a year as a temporary.After being hired, I was made to work 5 and 6 12 hour days every week for 5 months and then fired for not knowing how to do my job. Terrible management and keep employees worried for loss of employment constantly. Bad environment to work in"
bad,Kraft Heinz is not a good place to work. Management is horrible and employees are not provided the resources to do the required job. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"Working at kraft was a stressful and miserable experience. I wasn’t treated fairly. I didn’t have much of a life at all working there. You worked heavy hours and didn’t even know what time you would be getting off. So for the people that have kids or families this is not the place to work, if you have to be off to do things at a certain time."
bad,Mandatory overtime; extremely poor manager/worker relationship; Corporate information to employees very poor...wondering if you would have a job the next day.
bad,"Management overrides quality holds, punishes associates who report issues to quality or voices concerns with issues that will impact the customer.  H.R is useless to the employee, They are only there to save the company money and to enforce what ever polices benefits the upper managements agenda, however unethical or illegal it may be. Member of management is ruthless and will do what ever is needed to become plant manager at any or all cost. Shameful!"
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have had to date. My supervisor retaliated because I reported them for calling me a dumba**, I had FORCED ot, after ONE week of being there. My “trainer” didn’t train me I was a glorified meat inspector. If you do decide to work there go to RAW not RTE  RTE will eat you alive. Everyone in RTE are two faced, will rat you out for literally anything even if you DONT know anything because your trainer didn’t TEACH you anything"
bad,I feel disrespected and unappreciated.  No room for advancement. Never had a stable shift. Lots of shift bouncing. The workers have very low morale and no work ethic.
bad,"Es una empresa sólo para ir hacer tu trabajo y regresar a casa. No existe el reconocimiento al esfuerzo que se realiza todos los dias. Existe mucha distinción entre el personal de producción y el personal que "" dirige"" la compañía."
bad,"Racism is a major problem at this factory.  Management treats minorities worse than trash.  Nobody washes their hands.  They have mold in their products, but they try to cover it up.  I was lied to quite often there.  They can't seem to figure out why people don't stay working there for long.  Stay away."
bad,"I’ve worked for Kraft Heinz for 3 years. Every year it continues to get worse. Your attendance is monitored by a point system resulting in a point every time you call out or use your sick time. After 5 points you can no longer bid on other jobs within the plant. Their is no communication between anyone including management. They are so short staffed that on top of them working you 6-7 days a week, you pull at least 4 12s a week. Due to being short staffed, they are denying people vacation days. If you know more than one job within the plant, they pull you anywhere last minute. Honestly Kraft is more worried about filling open spots by and I quote the plant manager, “Stealing employees from other companies” then they are keeping the ones that bust their butts day in and day out. When the weather is bad, this winter the only reason the plant didn’t run, was because to many staff called off, in which those who called out was given an occurrence. The product is more important then the lives of their employees. "
bad,"This place is as bad as the stocks.  My pay is bad but benefits are good.  Plant is dirty and run down, the good part is I don't have to work hard.  Just take trash out and look busy."
bad,"Ego, favoritism and school yard games abound here. Longterm workers had no training on equipment. Mentality was just patch it up and run. Worst place I have ever worked."
bad,Many overtime hrs. Like being in prison. Management doesn't know how to run the place. Reason for so much weekend overtime.Watch out ur next to be stabbed in the back.
bad,"Superviseur sont des nuls, il engage que leur milieu familiale, il epuise les temporaires et enfin de compte les slaquent facilement"
bad,"Lack of internal talent has forced the organization to promote unqualified and undeserving employees.  Senior level leadership team has set unattainable goals.  These goals are cascaded down throughtout the organization, all the way down to the front line supervisors. Challenges are not embraced but rather they are considered excuses.   The KraftHeinz meritocracy method is flawed and poorly executed on.  KraftHeinz lean model is not sustainable and is affecting all levels of the organization.  "
bad,A setting for the schedule daily and work with people at different level. The hardest part of the job is working with the USDA at all level and trying to get your point across to gain their trust .
bad,KraftHeinz has various challenges facing it but culture seems to be the biggest hindrance in retaining employees. Although there are many opportunities for advancement.
bad,"Very poor management / Employee relations and communication. Work days are unorganized, without decent direction. The management can not seem to keep a consistent schedule, making it difficult to live our schedules at home."
bad,You are expected to perform miracles with equipment that is older than most of the employees in the plant and the lack of proper maintenance or repair. The management staff doesn’t listen to the employees that run the equipment daily and expect you to run it faster than it was ever designed to or meant to.
bad,Il n'y a pas de mot assez fort pour décrire tout ce que l'on ressent lorsqu'on t'annonce qu'il n'y a plus de place dans l'entreprise pour toi et qu'on termine ton emploi à partir de Vendredi. Surtout après avoir donné plusieurs années de bon et loyaux services.
bad,"Poor management and communication ruins this place. I went in with high hopes after countless others quit one after another, thinking it would pay off in the end. Instead management steals your ideas, underpays and undervalues you, and the more you do for them the more they give you to do."
bad,The management was terrible. Didn’t really care about the employees as long as the product was getting ran ther were shaving the employees. Supervisors never interact
bad,Working environment when I started was awesome. Now it’s horrible. No one works together. Management is always looking for reasons to let someone go. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone. The only good thing about working for the company is the pay. Working hours are 7 days a week
bad,"Not a difficult job at all.  Good pay and benefits.  However, if you have any kind of mind of your own, or do not not belong to one of the managerial ""cliques"", you more than likely will be treated unfairly, to the point of having to get out for your own mental well being.  Management is a complete joke from the plant manager on down.  Made many friends there, but I am not a mindless follower with no opinion, hence the reason I'm getting out."
bad,"Worked in Oscar Mayer Lunchables  Maintenance with very poor HR management, production management and maintenance management. Maintenance management including maintenance  supervisors will stab you in the back and will not back you up. Management in human resources and production departments like to play witch hunt games and will  look for ways to write you up and get you fired. "
bad,"If you like working in an envirement where you have to watch your own back, work 7 days a week, and have rules change by department and daily. This job is for you."
bad,"This place has figured out that they can save money by running the business with a skeleton crew and not have to pay for benefits of employees if they were fully staffed. Management makes poor decisions, they constantly cut benefits, and the worst part of the job is the long hours employees are forced to endure from day one."
bad,You work like a dog six days a week every single week and be forced to stay a ten hour shift with very little warning. They are supposed to tell you no later than half shift if you have to stay ten hours. That's in the union contract which leads to the poor excuse for a union this company has. They let the company do whatever they want to do even if it breaks the contract.
bad,"If you never want to have a life outside of work or you don't care if you ever get to do anything, then this is the job for you.  Don't expect human resources to offer any kind if help if being harassed by an employee that they like. Also that employee can threaten to get you fired and out of no where management starts finding issues with you which gets you fired. Never ask to see policy because they will keep it from you or just ignore you until you stop asking. Your a number to them don't try and act all human because they don't care, you can be easily be replaced.  Have fun."

bad,horrible hours that you are forced to work. management that doesn't listen or know what they are doing. force you to work 7days a week with no days off for weeks at a time.
bad,I dont like the rotating shift or the people. Im not gonna be stuck here. More money to be made doing something i would like to do.
bad,"Since 3G took over you might as well write this place off for career opportunities.  Shoot, Aim, Ready is the philosophy, they talk about meritocracy but really mean mediocrity.  What a mess, stay far away, reason ranked one of worst 10 companies to work for."
bad,"as a new hire long time employees dont want to take the time to train and expect you to know how to do the job already when most of the work is on a computer and involving paper work that is very detail oriented and has the potential to cost the company thousands of dollars. almost all sick lines and call in numbers dont work and wont show that you gave notice to being gone and you will have to explain and fight for your job if out sick. overall, management needs a complete overhaul and new training programs implemented."
bad,"Before 3G was involved, KFI was a fun place to work and learn. Now, due to so little resources, everday if filled with double and triple booked meetings, financial reviews and lack of leadership. The most enjoyable part of my job is leading and working with my sales team. I enjoy getting in front of our customers and working with teh team."
bad,"Ineventory, how to operate a standup forklift, management wasn't good, co-workers was ok,dealing with non-communicating management"
bad,"Kraft started as a wonderful place to work but, after the numerous new supervisors, hr reps, and plant managers... Kraft turned into one of the most HORRIBLE places I've ever worked! Their priorities are all jacked up! This so called family company is for itself and don't care about employees or their families by forcing employee to work 13 consecutive days because the 7 day law obviously doesn't apply to them.  They have so many loopholes due to the fact everything in the policy book says at supervisor discretion and subject to change without notice. No one in management says the same thing about any one policy so you never know who's wrong or right. HR is suppose to be the middle man in employee, supervisor issues but they tend to be still for the supervisor. So, if you have an issue with a supervisor and bring it to the hr's attention they still are bias because the supervisor is normally their drinking buddy, kids godmother/father, relative, childhood friend, or something of the sort. So, that also makes it hard to advance with in the company. You could know these jobs inside and out and still  stay on the floor because you aren't apart of the ""clique."" They no longer help pay to further your education unless approved by your bum. And it is quite often you hear of someone's school being paid for that you are working with but, you've been denied numerous on occasions. Overall, you'll be paid well but, it's not worth your happiness!!!!!"
bad,"This plant cares about one thing, putting product out the door!  Quality was an after thought.  Only after USDA put Hold Tags on an area was there any consideration to cleaning or sanitation.  "
bad,They treat their employees like robots... They never want to give any chances to better yourself.
bad,"Great employer. Loy's of opportunity."
bad,"Typical day was getting machines running good; then meeting and exceeding goals while working with people that barely made it through high school and did not know how to ""think."" There really was no management, as the company had the employees going through the motions to produce the products. The hardest part of the job was trying to work with very old machinery and people that were placed in positions just for knowing/being related to or doing ""favors"" for higher ups. I did enjoy the satisfaction of being able to pinpoint problems, resolve issues, and help increase production."
bad,If someone doesn't like for whatever reason be ready to cover your butt.They well try anything to get to quit. They well yell scream at you. No one well like you because of the color of your hat.
bad,"Got hurt on the job because their Cranes are not properly inspected annually. , Skeleton Woodman jewellery Harish Jewish Handel bark bark Lebo keep I Jack"
bad,"No one in management wants to take responsibility, help others, or fix the operation. The company does not care about people and turns over employees at all levels so do not expect to learn anything or move up as the company will find a reason to move on. Company has to have a name on failures including uncontrollable failures to outside management and will find someone to blame."
bad,Since Heinz came in the place and management are awful even guys with 15 /20 years in. Don't go there for employment you will regret it latter. That's all I  can say.
bad,"The work environment is HORRIBLE, it’s a work environment that is based on a “Who you know “, “ The IN CROWD” basics. Verbal abuse, physical abuse and line techs, supervisors & even HR does nothing about it. If you try to take a stand they will make working there hard for you and try to force you away."
bad,You have no life at all. If u have kids along with a full family you will have no time for your family. You work 6 to 7 days a week. No time for yourself or family and friends.
bad,"Worst company I’ve worked for as far as family/work balance, they have a point system and hold everything against you, even the birth of your child. Very poor management and very few days off, 7 days a week for 10 plus weeks at a time then you may get one day off. You get forced to stay over a minimum of 4 hours last minute, only the incompetent seen to make management."
bad,I would not recommend for any person to apply for this company. The management is terrible. Don't know how to talk to employees. There is no room for advancement. Long hours no work/life balance. This company needs better management for there employees.
bad,no training too much nepotism do standards no consistancy very poor place to work. very cut throat atmosphere its the plant against you everyone has it out for you so much drama. save your miney because you wont last long working for kraft heinz
bad,"I was wrongfully terminated by an unethical manager who harrassed and fired me on bogus write ups she fabricated.  Vile environment and hideous managers. After nearly 24 years employment, they fired me 3 days  before Christmas and 10 days before I could retire with insurance and 5 weeks worth of vacation.  Besides making bogus write ups, they even put the wrong dates on terminating documents.  Vindictive and incompetent managers also disregarded the companies resolution processes.  Hienz was the death of Kraft, as they swiftly swirl toward the sewer of once great companies. Karma will not be kind to ALL involved...."
bad,"This place is going down! Management is a joke no one knows what they are doing ! You can get a way with a lot if you are a attractive lady ... well if you are a lady period! Everyone is sleeping with each other including line techs and supervisors ! They will make you work overtime at the last minutes , will also make you work 7 days for months straight! They take points for everything if you have a doctor excuse point if you get sick at work point if your child is sick point if you late to the line point clock in too early point 2 hours late point , 1 min late half of point , then you have to wait 60 consecutive days to get 1 or .5 a point back ! Drama Drama Drama basically a big high school ! There is no secrets at kraft so if you didn’t something EVERYONE KNOWS ! They will work you to death literally and talk to you any type of way if you let them , have absolutely no respect for employees ! Literally have a 30 mins break but really like 15 , one min late and they on your butt !Try to blame employees for EVERYTHING!"
bad,"Do not work here :"
bad,"Completely lawless no rules apply. No budget no fix anything, machines are old and outdated. Plant itself never makes money. Managers come and go. Mechanics come and go. Customer contracts come and go. Unsafe, unsanitary. Always on the brink of closing."
bad,"too many managements, can be without half of them . Need more production workers not less, medical insurance is over priced, no structure, used to be a great place to work for 5 years ago."
bad,Money good they don’t care about they workers or if u gotta sick child to get home to do u can take them to the doctor and get them checked out it’s always something with Kraft no matter wat u do to try to help
bad,"This plant was not good to work for. You never knew what hours or shift you would be working on the weekends. Production workers had to call everyday to see what shift they were working that day, it could have need 1st, 2nd, 3rd, you'd never know day to day."
bad,Bad comunicasion horrible training can get hurt at anytime they make you do work with out you knowin how to do the work or hoe to do it management do not see how hard you work 6 to 7 days a week won't thank you only see the bad not the good they don't care if you see your family.
bad,Cutthroat people and toxic work environment and bosses were hateful and rude I was walked out and fired for speaking my opinion . I don’t suggest this job for anyone
bad,I worked there for 39 years. The questions you asked are mostly irrelevant. Do we understand the definition  of retired and irrelevant? They made me leave and I was a long term company man...what does that say for rhe culture and management of Kraft Heinz. Not going to expound on this anymore.
bad,Good pay! Terrible work environment. Machines constantly broken and in need of repairs. Unrealistic production goals. Management is clueless and sit in their climate controlled offices and make demands.
bad,"I sorted out the bad potatoes, cut potatoes in half, sorted potatoes by size. I also cleaned floors and equipment. I shoveled up the messes they made on an almost daily bases."
bad,"Cultura da visão de dono que permite autonomia ao funcionário (independente do cargo / nível hierárquico) para tomar decisões importantes e desenvolver atividades/projetos com grande impacto na empresa. Os desafios e situações extremas e estressantes ajudam no desenvolvimento profissional (mas essas situações extremas de trabalho que acontecem o tempo todo acabam prejudicando sua saúde física e mental ao longo do tempo). Como a empresa está crescendo e muitos colaboradores pedem demissão por não estarem satisfeitos com a cultura da empresa, há muitas oportunidades de desenvolvimento profissional. "
bad,If you like no family life this is the company for you. It is a cold and fast paced work environment. Hard to get vacation days off. Always short on employees.
bad,the work was ok when we had parts but everything was jury rigged and barely held together and maintained. management was useless we were under staffed constantly due to poor management. we were overworked because we couldn't keep mechanics or maintenance supervisors due to a horrible management team and horrible work culture. The only reason I worked there as long as I did was because the pay was the best I could find in the area at the time.
bad,"Company had a buddy buddy system, always took care of their friends, or siblings, didnt listen or care about employees, Kraft is rated as the 2nd worst place to work in the Country!!! That's SAD!"
bad,They treat their workers very poorly and managment is not professional at all. They have many workers there that have been sexually harassed and HR does not do a thing about it but they do know about just protect them because it would make them look bad.
bad,The job opportunities for KraftHeinz in Pittsburgh is very limited.  If you are willing to relocate to Chicago you could get some very good job experiences.
bad,"I currently work there as a Temp, but i cant wait to leave it"
bad,"Management taking company down, plant manager did not trust middle management,turned the employees on the floor against middle management.He obviously should have found another line of work"
bad,here in this town there is nothing much as far as work with a decent pay. Minimum wages is about 8 and at kraft they pay 12. is that a plus. Other than that i wouldn't recommend it.
bad,The rules only apply for some people. Management knows about things that are going on that are not appropriate but does nothing. Most everyone is related so even if they should be fired it will never happen. Once you have been there 3 years you are topped out on pay so there is no drive for people to want to do better. There is nothing to strive towards. Nothing is organized or done fairly.
bad,"I would not recommend working at Kraft due to the point system and culture are not designed to care for the employee."
bad,Travail non sécuritaire. Aucune stabilité. Beaucoup de clans et très difficile à s'intégrer.
bad,The Kraft Heinz Holland factory has been driven to the ground and I believe that it is on its last leg.  The upper management believe you should work thousands of hours in order to accomplish the goals for Corporate.  The do not care about the people and this factory is not a good factory to work for.
bad,"I greatly enjoyed working for Kraft for the majority of time I was there; however, in the end, it became a volatile environment with no work life balance. Extremely poor HR team, and management is overly stressed, over worked, and in constant fear. These factors, accompanied by quarterly layoffs for the last 2 years, makes the environment extraordinarily stressful."
bad,I would never recommend this top heavy management company to any one. The General manager had already caused two other plants to close. Bad product became a mold issue they blamed the employees. They cut cut and cut hours of cleaning time.
bad,"Niet alles is slecht. De directe collega,s in produktie zijn behalve erg negatief tav hun werkgever, vriendelijk en collegiaal tov mij. Produktie management lijkt vriendelijk maar blijken onredelijk te zijn."
bad,"Not a bad place to work, but mandatory overtime and shift bouncing make the work life balance an issue.  Currently understaffed which makes it even more of an issue.  Wages are comparable to local area.  Health care premiums have been increasing with decreasing options."
bad,"There are three shifts that run  everyday and none of the shifts take responsibility for anything that happens. There is no accountability for anyone. The cleanliness of the facility in general is poor, the morale of the entire plant is extremely low because of the bad management team and all of the double standards that are present."
bad,"No strategy at all from the leadership team, no long term innovation pipeline and no career development path. High turnover resulting in lack of experienced people left in the company"
bad,Unstable Work Environment; Constantly changing; Stressful work environment.  Need to improve the infrastructure.  Changes;changes changes.  Very unstable
bad,"Drive personal vehicle from store to store merchandising product of Nabisco/Kraft, that is now Mondelez. Pay started at $12.85/hr back in August 2011, now they start at $12.00/hr. They cheated me off my mileage reimbursement so I quit. Poor communication amongst management and some employees. Fun part was everyday was different, love to travel and be out doors, time flies quickly."
bad,"Lots of work barely have enough time to use the bathroom. "
bad,coming in the workplace go to your locker put on the proper attire for you to go to work. go to your work station and get prepare for the assembley line to start up then wait for the birds to start rolling.once your bird comes to your station den you begin to perform your job.
bad,"A typical day was reading and answering emails, attending meetings."
bad,"Managed very poorly, if you like to be treated like a dog do it if not, I would not recommend it. lots of overtime, maintenance is very poor, constantly having new maintenance people, turnover rate is very high. The management team have no idea what they are doing."
bad,"They say French and English speaking is mandatory... But you will be alienated if you speak English. Agency workers make less than people who were hired by kraft.... Even if you do the same work."
bad,"This is one of the worst most stressful companies I have worked in. Management is terrible, and they cant figure out why everyone keeps leaving. Well we work 7days a week or 70hrs+. That means no home life. They dont care if you get sick because 3 attendance points is terrible when you get 8. There is nothing to look forward to because 3g got rid of seniority, so it doesn't matter if you have worked at Kraft for 10 years plus you will still be flipping shifts and working 6 or 7 days a week"
bad,"Pay is decent depending on category , never know when you’re getting off , they have displaced me twice. Not enough training and horrible supervisors ."
bad,"I would love to work at a company where I love the environment , feel comfortable with the ppl I work with, and the work that I do. I dnt like to b overwoked, drained, and exhausted when u come home from work. The hrs there are extremely long. There jobs there are stressful, hard, and repetitive"
bad,You have to switch back and forth from days and nights. It's very hard on family life The training is quick and you get moved around a lot. The pay is what keeps me there.
bad,When Heinz bought kraft it was an avalanche of garbage. They cut all 7th day overtime so the people who wanted it couldn't get it. Forced 6 days a week.
bad,"Very fast paced. Completely unorganized. No training. Terrible management. Very high turnover rate. If you go to work here, you will probably quit within two months."
bad,"I've learned that Kraft Heinz Linetechs and some of the supervisors there lack leadership, team work and respect for others. Teamwork makes the dream work."
bad,Work/life balance is extremely variable depending on team. Leadership treats the business as if money is the only valuable part of the company. Brands and teams are not shown the same care and investment as they previously were.
bad,"Focus is not on employee engagement. Kraft was a company where you could develop and grow your career.  Now it's about moving very quickly, working many, many hours and if you're lucky to have a great leader you'll be recognized and rewarded."
bad,"not good place to work. no job security, at all. Walking on pins and needles all day long, I could not see myself staying long term."
bad,Testing cheese and cheese products for regularity specifications.
bad,"This company is run by a union that still picks what and how they want to run the company instead of listening to the workers and helping them stay happy as well as being fair to each group of seniority. The environment is terrible and the way the employees treat each other is terrible. There are a lot of people that take advantage of the point system that they use and will NOT work with you if you have a doctors appointment, school obligation or anything. You are still forced to use your points and even when you're completely exhausted from working over 50 hours each week for months on end. They do not care if you live an hour away and only get FOUR hours in-between each 12 hour shift that is mandated regularly."
bad,day at work consist of drama problem starting dealing with unexperienced operator and new empolyees
bad,The general manager is in over his head which results in a lack of productivity and forced overtime and disgruntaled employees. Excellent shift supervisors who treat everyone with respect. The number of temp staff out number the full timers three to one and job security for the temps does not exist.
bad,I worked in packing in a big room that was 30 degrees.  We packed deli meats at a turkey farm. My body could not take that cold temperature so I had to let that job go.
bad,"Very tiring and stressful working conditions are hard and cold. Very fast passed and repetitive  work environment is poorly mannaged, doesn't care about employees well being  as much as they should,  put s you in unsafe situations without proper training"
bad,If you want a life don't work here... Great money and benefits... Low senority gets the short end of the stick.. 6 days a week 8 to 12 hour days..major holidays off.. Paid.
bad,Working at Kraft is not for everybody.  The line techs do not act very professional.  They help and train the employees they like and do not train the employees they do not like or actually tell them the wrong way to do something and then yell at them later.
bad,"This place is ok/horrible... you work 6 days a week and it’s a 95 percent chance you got too do 10 hrs a day but Saturday is only 8 hrs but everyone is rude and miserable and nobody cares about anyone but them selves and most are dumb as well they walk in front of forklifts and behind them and don’t care and there is no chance ever too enjoy life nor have one, 50-60 hrs a week."
bad,you can work 12 hours a day 7 days a week in many positions since there isn't enough people to do the tasks at hand.  huge management turnover.  would not recommend to anyone who isn't young and single.  you will have no life but this factory.
bad,"This company sucks the life out of you. Management doesn’t care, HR doesn’t care.. "
bad,A typical night at work consist of coming into a meeting to find out where you are for the night and completing the task. I've learned how to multitask and how to work under pressure and how to communicate. I've also learned how to stay organized while multitasking.
bad,"The management is awful! Everyone is awful! "
bad,"Meritocracy is only in Title, not compensation"
bad,"I have nothing good to say as the  management treated personnel"
bad,Company bought out by Brazilan firm and is closing factory June 27th 2014
bad,I worked the 12 hour weekend shift and it was good at that time in my life because I had a chance to go to scool during the week as well as be home with my kids to do homework and their after school activities
bad,Hard working but not appreciate for the hard work don’t take care of employees inproper training I’m a very hard working person very dedicated to learning and building inside the company
bad,"There is no training, no ""Leadership"", just Management- which most have very little people skills. They run off of fear and intimidation. I am shocked this place is rated well on Indeed. Turnover rate is the highest I have ever seen in a company, ever. I would advise to not turn away from this company, but run away. Don't even consider it."
bad,The culture is all about cost cutting and not growing the business. They have no regard to employee work life balance.  It is always a mind set to do more with less.
bad,"All this place cares about is numbers. Have to work 6 days a week so its ok if you dont have a family. Work is easy but fast paced. Pay is good but suppose to be better, kraft/heinz screwed everyone out of their union raises."
bad,Is a really stressful job. For a mom at least. The hours and mandatory OT is crazy. The cold is crazy. Some coworkers make your job so much harder. The preference is crazy. The work enviorment is no good. Sometimes the hardest jobs get paid less. I hated it.
bad,The union would pick and choose who and what to fight for. The employees were rude and talked bad about people. When Heinz took over it went downhill. Used to be a good place to work until then. They work you like a dog and don't care if you see your family. The only good thing was the insurance.
bad,High turn over rate. You only get 2 15 minute breaks for 8 hours. Management only worried about quantity not quality. Very hot environment. No drinks allowed at work station.
bad,"This company although huge, had a posting on Indeed and it was a scam. They need to take better precautions and with hiring practices. This will alleviate embarrassment and headaches later."
bad,Over-worked and over-stressed and not appreciated.  There was no personal time although there were flexible schedules.  I usually worked 6 days/week and it was expected.
bad,J ai travaillé chez kraff etant une emballeuse.avec un salaire de 11$ de l heure.
bad,"Initially I became “a member of the family” which change during my tenure to a progressive business model based on “pay for performance”.  Expectations were high but work expectations were realistic.  Towards the end, there was an “ always available nature” to the culture but work a balance could still be found between work and life.  I believe employees are all young robots."
bad,"Would'nt recommend this job to anyone.The work was ok but its all about if your a brown knoser or the color you are. I planned to make it my career but they didnt see it that way cause i was fired because of reverse discrimination. I know many people who have been treated the same I was. God bless to all the white workers that have made it. Just whatever you do, dont speak up cause you'll get fired."
bad,i worked everyday only had one day off never had breaks the management played favorites because of color the place was just terrible
bad,Poor Management and now a union committee that has no back bone. No one has any clue about whats going on as far as where indgredients are or what products to run. This place is slowly on a decline eventually leading to closing the doors. They also do not provide you with the correct equipment to properly do your job.
bad,Easy work. Be ready 7 days a week tho. No family life balance. No thanks. If you wanna be a slave for $20 an hour then this place is for you. Have fun and enjoy no days off
bad,"if you want to know what companies did in the 80´s when no one was looking, by all means, go an work there. If you intend to learn something about what working in a real company is, do not waste your time working for a management team that have made it just by staying in the company long enough (basically because no one hires you when you come from such a place)"
bad,"terrible place to work,don""t care about their employees just want you in there working and making money for them. if they treated animals the way they treat their employees would get it for abuse"
bad,The supervisors can do what they want and talk to employees any kind of way and management doesn’t do anything about it . The third shift supervisors are horrible . They need to hire new supervisors for that shift . They don’t know anything about the jobs  they make terrible decisions they play favoritism.  The make it a hostile working environment.
bad,"Provide each customer with a warm greeting at the door within 10 seconds of arrival and seat them. When waiting on a table the following is required; introduce yourself to customer, overview specials, take order, repeat order to customer, enter order, check food as it is ready to be served, serve food to table reciting what plate belonged to who, refill cups/ condiments as needed, and make sure they are taken care of to the fullest capability."
bad,I worked at Kraft from 1998-2012... that version of the company is long gone and any review I can provide will be about an extinct organization (that I found to generally lack culture and relevant brands)
bad,You build stuff and make stuff from ketchup and you take a break and you build more stuff with ketchup then you go home and build ketchup some more
bad,Long unpredictable work weeks. Not sure if you are going to be working overtime from 1 week to another. If the line breaks down you will have to stay until the orders are finished.
bad,"A typical day at work was productive but not family oriented, and works people all the time. You don't really learn anything unless you are getting trained to do a new job, but even then if the people training you don't like you, they wont train you very well. The management you have to get on the good side and for them to like you to be able to keep your job safe. The co-workers always had something to complain about or like to spread rumors. The hardest part of the job was to deal with people complaining. Ending shift at 5:30 then turn around and be at work at 3:00 in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the co-workers would help answer my questions if I had some."
bad,plant closing 14 years with the company and 12to 24 months they are closing the doors!  I have had wonderful work experiences at polly o and acheveied many production milestones and certificates on the job
bad,"A typical day working for Kraft was very demanding but manageable. I found it to be rewarding at times"
bad,Leamington will never be the same.  A lot of people`s lives will be ruined.
bad,"I was a Production Operator for 7 years, and I left this company to accept a job offer from another company, and I'm sure glad I did too, here's why: The supervisors and plant management do not care about the employees, they only care about money, by cutting jobs and increasing the speed of the production line, and making employees work through weekends, for 6 days a week and for 60+ hours a week. The work is extremely hard every day, the climate is cold and raw every day, and people are getting injured and quitting. The union is total garbage, they fight for the company and not for the employees."
bad,Kraft is not a good place to work. They are not employee friendly. They are not a work/life balance company.
bad,"If you are a hard worker that doesn't mind working 50 hours a week, week after week then you can work at this company. Work life balance does not exist here!"
bad,"I love working at The Kraft & Heinz Company I was given a great opportunity to work with machines as the cruster and learn new things that are new and interesting.I also learn to work using a lunch meat slicer i know that I would be a great asset to your team.I have worked at the kirksville,mo site"
bad,"I love working at Kraft Foods, I made great friends, and enjoyed the work I was doing. I miss all of my co-worker. I was a bacon packer and then I transferred to a different department, and my new job tittle was Breast Trimmer."
bad,"Muy buena empresa estabilidad laboral al cien buenas prestaciones y bonos "
bad,Not a place I'd recommend if you have a family or wish to have a life outside of work. Family business yes but not considerate of you having a family life if your not a boss.
bad,Always short of employees. Never enough people to accommodate production. Made employees do more than job positions. Made employees do 2 or more jobs at same time. Food safety was questionable. Safety problems were not addressed in certain areas.
bad,"I was a packager at for Ethical Bean which is owned by Kraft Heinz."
bad,Do 3 people's job 12 hours a day i would run four machines on my line one would make the box and tape   the bottom then go into a blueprint three at a time load six twelve or twenty four bags then go through a taper and up a elevator 4000 box's a shift know try to keep three lines running
bad,Management down to lead were unaware of what was needed to skill enough people and the last minute scheduling for man power was never organized
bad,"Zastraszanie przez kierownika zakładu,stosowanie mobbingu w pracy,premia w wysokośći 30zł brutto ponieważ nie zasługujemy na więcej taka teoria kierownika zakładu."
bad,"si tuviera que hacer una pequeña evaluación , diría, un día de trabajo tipo es tranquilo ya que cada uno se ocupaba de sus cosas , xq sui necesitaba algo de otro ... se te venia los problemas . "
bad,There is a reason this company has lost 70% of its market cap value over the last 3 years. The relentless cost cutting and meddling of the global team is exemplary of why this company continues to fail. A place where people struggle on a daily basis to perform even the most rudimentary of tasks.
bad,Require much physical strength. Fast passed. No supervision in area. had to meet quota's. lifting constantly 60 pounds and higher. Working in cold conditions of 40 degrees and lower.
bad,Just about the best place in town to work not bad insurance and benifits work 12 hr shifts three days a week. about six hundred fifty people work here.
bad,I worked here 6-7 days a week most week did my job plus extra and they will always ask for more and never appreciate what you do or the time you put in to it and there is no growth you will be stuck at what you are good at and what works for them I liked my job just not most people i worked with the most thing i like was i knew my job very well so i didn't have to speak with many people i worked at my own pace . the hardest part was it was very very cold all the time and dealing with other issues with in the company. Management was not very good at fixing problems on about any level
bad,"Joined Kraft during the Heinz buyout/merger. The culture instantly turned toxic, hours extended to the unreasonable, and large layoffs occured. Would not recommend to pretty anyone."
bad,"Since the KraftHeinz merger, the cutbacks began and all the maintenance supervisors were the first to go,  Then people off the floor were promoted to Lead positions and was still expected to perform there duties as a floor mechanic.  All this for just a $1.00 more an hour while production Leads were given $4.05 an hour more.  This is at the Granite City plant where this job opening is located.  If you like working with young inexperienced mechanics and like to be stabbed in the back at every turn then this job is for you.  I worked there for almost 8 years and it was a great place to work once upon a time.  But now management condones an adversarial (stab you in the back and smile in your face) atmosphere and is always looking for any reason to write a mechanic up."
bad,"It was a great place to work until Heinz bought out the company! Every since then it has been going down, People loose jobs everyday, overtime interferes with family life, and is mandatory or considered job abandonment."
bad,they don't have good representation for employees who are less than 5 years so your paying union dues but not backed by union untill something like 10 years of experience.
bad,"Not a very good company to work for!! Started working there and all management stated they hated working for the company. They  couldn't wait to leave and upper management was a oblivious to the situation.  Communication from upper management was minimal at best, expectations did not meet reality. Union runs the facility and company is hesitant to address key issues with the union and enforce federal guidelines for workers due to fear of public scrutiny."
bad,fastpaced environment where you have to think on your feet all day.
bad,"I worked as a drawhand in the newberry, sc plant. This position requires you to pull the entire abdominal cavity out of every 3 turkeys by hand on a very fast paced assembly line. My hands were so swollen until I couldn't drive. I was taken off my job but I still had to hold a water hoes with a sprinkler spout for 7 hours or longer, spraying water on all the turkeys on the assembyline. There were so many people having surgery on their hands, arms, shoulders etc,. I decided that my hands were worth more than the suffering that I was enduring. It was a terrible experience. The training was so unprofessional. Also the orientation coordinator was crsing the new hires out and selling bootleg cds/dvds in the breakroom !! The supervisor in eviseration curses at the employees and has temper tantrums. The plant has a high turnover because they have a lot of leaders in the wrong positions who talk down on new hires. Also the leaders and quality control/assurance are very unprofessional, poor trainers and they keep the drama going."
bad,"Not competitive in job market, poor management. Company has been stripped down and running on bare minimum. Hours have been cut but still expected to reach production numbers.  Forced overtime to compensate."
bad,"some employees are very disrespectful towards each other. the company gives and takes back bonus. Kraft do not appreciate the employees work ethics. Kraft did a lot of mandatory overtime, You did not have a life outside of work"
bad,"Working at kraftheinz is like many failing jobs that is falling to pieces and every employee is fighting for scraps. Management is horrible! Alot of favoritism amongst people who decide to kiss management behind to rise up the latter. Within 8 months i was rotated to 3 different jobs , constantly disbanding positions they actually need to keep things in order......there is plenty I can list that makes this place the revolving door that it is"
bad,"There are two classes of people at this plant. The agency workers are treated like slaves who do all the manual work and are under paid. Many of the full time make good money and stand around talking in groups and sleeping while agency people do most or all of the work!  There is no appreciation for Cortech workers as there are no bonuses or incentives while full time people get yearly bonuses, benefits and paid holidays. You need to keep track of your weekly hours to ensure that you are paid properly working with the agency"
bad,"It was a great place to work when it was Loius Rich... They changed to many things when Heinz came in... They went to getting paid bi-weekly and the money wasn't adding up the same... What I was making in one week was maybe $250 dollars less than what I was making in two weeks... That' wasn't adding up to me, so I left..."
bad,Very poor management that doesn't know how to communicate with the workplace. To many layoffs not enough hours. Have a union that doesn't stick up for you.
bad,The change in management has led to the downfall of this company. They keep preaching meritocracy but never follow through. Merit is based off of whether your manager likes you or not. Everything else they tell you is lies so don’t believe it. They try to have these “social” gatherings to make up for everything but it doesn’t work. Everyone is still bitter. They need to understand that a CANADIAN needs to manage the largest team in the organization and provide you with good relevant feedback during a performance review. Not a place I would want to work.
bad,Não tornaria a trabalhar neste empresa e tão pouco indico a alguem
bad,"I really don't have anything to say about the company.  However, as I stated in the header.  Do your research for the site your considering working at."
bad,you get good for what you do but the work schedule does not leave a lot of time for a personal or family life you are required to work a lot of weekends which typically cut into you family life
bad,The culture here is very fast paced and very stressful.  If you are able to handle the amount of change with the culture the there are many opportunities.
bad,The culture here is moving uncomfortably fast. If you can handle the pace with the amount of change then opportunity to advance.  Work Life balance is not considered but pay does equal the time.
bad,"Very cut throat culture. If have experience from elsewhere and start working here, it will be much more easier. Expect to work minimum of 12+ hours a day. Compensation is fair."
bad,So called union does whatever to make company happy even if it violates contract. They force people in the union to learn new jobs against their wishes.
bad,Management will continue to lie to you about any advancement. Became the one doing everybody's grunt work yet I was being paid the least and there was too much drama in the workplace to be taken seriously
bad,"It started off as a good job until you actually get settled in and see the staff for who they really are. You can have a death in your family and they wouldn't care. You can be on your death bed and they still wouldn't care. It's crazy to me how they have a no fault policy in place and expect for folks to forget their outside lives and health just so they can get numbers. If you don't care about your employees how do you expect them to love and care about the job? I guess that's why they go pay for and get all those foreigners because they know they can get away with certain things with them. It's sad that they'll get rid of good working employees but keep folks they know thats falsifying numbers for the ""better of the company"" and that has multiple harassment complaints file against them from fellow co-workers"
bad,"Worked long hours to meet project deadlines.....no work life balance. The company is changing, it used to invest in employees. I no longer see that. Job security is non existent. Too many lay offs."
bad,"When you're hired at Kraft, they claim to be a ""family company"".... Not the case at all. All they care about is getting production out on time. They constantly force people in on their days off, and then most of the time, you end up standing around doing nothing because they over-schedule. The co-workers there are all complacent, and do not want to be taught how to do anything new. They've all been there forever, and they know what they're doing. Honestly, the hardest part of the job is doing everyone else's job while you're supposed to be doing your own as well."
bad,"Excellent maintenance trademans.  Unionized workforce with good relationship with the management team.  "
bad,Upon hiring they lead you to believe with a union and contract that treatment will be across the board equal. The departments are not run the same nor is the contract adhered to.
bad,"There is little to no investment in employee training.  Aside from some new computer screens and used, worn out equipment brought over from the closed California plant, there's been no other  improvements. "
bad,"The old Kraft was very passionate about innovation and growth of their brands.  In the new world of Kraft Heinz Company, the only thing that matters is cutting costs.  I am fearful that we will loose market share and damage the brands before Wall Street realizes this way of managing only works for the first few years of cutting costs - growth is not a strong suit."
bad,"Nothing good to say."
bad,"-Plenty of freedom."
bad,"Have worked for company many years.Use to be a great company to work for,not no more.I dont know if its just the lowville facility,or kraft in general.Benefits are a joke,managemant treats you like your just a number,alot of bs politics.Management is vindictive,if things work in their favor its all good,if not or you speak your mind you obtain a target on your back.Management is allowed to harrass and badger employees with no reprocussions.Hourly positions cut to create more management positions.Average 1 employee a week walked out.Work/life balance is non existent."
bad,"This company has room for improvement to say the least. I have learned that there is no loyalty to employees who are dedicated to the organization. THe hardest part of the job is not having control over your product. Writing an order is like writing a wish list sometimes. Management pretty much sucks. They stay at home having meetings all day, while we do the grunt work."
bad,"In a typical day at work, I would work cookie deliveries and write orders for the store. I managed up to 3 persons. I learned how to sell and execute the sales plan at a high level. The hardest part of the job is the surprises that can cause your day to run longer than necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with store management and customers."
bad,"muitas cobranças ,tudo sobre biscoitos ,eles nao dao nenhuma valor aos colaboradores,umquerendo puxar o tapete do outro ,o dia todo muito barulho e muito calor ,quando chega hora de irmos embora ."
bad,long hrs tons of overtime and you are just a body no reguards to safety plays favorites management is always changing 7 days a wk 12 hrs a day money is really good but not worth my helath
bad,"Its a sinking company with everything going wrong but they do a decent job of hiding it day to day."
bad,Was very unprofessional ! Not organized at all !! Lied about the department I would be in . You have to do allot to get paid so little . They also lied about the pay range .
bad,The job is really easy.  I just didn't like the environment. Employees are being treated unfairly by management. Management has been bringing in  their friends and family members and giving them preferable treatment over employees that have been there longer.. Employees act like children. everybody is in your business and minding everybody else.
bad,"You never  know where you will be, start time can change on a daily basis.  Do not know when you are going home half the time. , Clueless people in charge of this company from top to bottom ."
bad,"the typical day is all about drama. The drama of people and management changing rules without regard to safety. Their safety meetings are a safety coordinator bringing a paper for you to sign while on the line. You do not have time to read it properly or receive a copy for your records. While benefits are good as well as salary, I do not suggest this company. They care only for the bottom line."
bad,"Work schedule not conducive to living a healthy, normal lifestyle.  Training for new employees is poor.  Recognition is poor.  Advancement is poor.  Overall, this place is on a downward spiral since Heinz and Kraft merged."
bad,"This company does not care about there employees time with there families. Dont have any parts on hand to fix the broken lines. Build a new facility and use old out of date equipment that u cant get parts for anymore, then complain when the lines don't run good."
bad,Kraft Heinz culture has really gone down since the merger.  There is no work/life balance and lots of pressure to work an extended number of hours to keep up with the workload. Raises are non-existent.  This company is no longer an employer of choice.
bad,"You got foremen walking around like they are running a drug cartel and you're just a petty worker to them."
bad,"lack of management,stressful,fast working environment, have to sign mandatory overtime calendar every week. i was on first shift sometimes i have to go in at 3 in the morning or stay over till 730 in the evening for calendar."
bad,"Management is not good, unrealistic goals, no bonus last year, does not care about people, decent work life balance if in management, ok job for entry level"
bad,You are granted national holidays off. The hardest part of this job is making upper management happy.  Rules and regulations have tendency to overrule common sense.
bad,"Management is very poor and no career advancements no clear direction for business."
bad,"Kraft Heinz does not focus on employees in regard to diversity, work/life balance, and moral.  Employees are not provided with the tools needed to successfully do their jobs and raises are non-existent and/or very rare."
bad,"This company has had major restricting since I left in 1998, I am not in a position to write a review of this company since so many things have changed."
bad,"Perfect job for someone starting into the workforce with no children or other big responsibilities. However, it is not an ideal job for school goers or individuals with families. The rotating shift deems it almost impossible to do anything with your families."
bad,"The corporate culture has changed drastically since after the merger. Employee turn over is too high. More stress on bottom line than employees or working environment."
bad,"Overall, there were some good points about working at Oscar Mayer.  It taught me how to work as part of a team.  Once I qualified for the retirement benefits, the 401k offered was a decent program.  And people will always need to eat, so the demand for our products was always there, if cyclical."
bad,Management allows seniors to do as they please. Not really helpful let alone receptive to new comers of a darker persuation. not much room for growth for younger employees.
bad,"Not bad to work, team leaders not to lead to control of the shop floor, no team work, rarher5stand and talk then help others, under manned on some lines, physically demanding, whilst others on same wage get away with murder"
bad,"The people that you work with day to day makes the day pass by and able to deal with the new culture.  Other than that it is all about saving money. Cut this, cut that, remove this group or that group and put more work on the staff that remains."
bad,Environment was filled with a high degree of uncertainty and a lack of serenity during and after Heinz & 3G merged with Kraft. Company appeared to focus on policy changes and not the employees. Received routine emails on replacing the old regimen with new company team. Over 2500 people were laid off.
bad,"Started in the mid-90's for a fantastic company, while stand alone, owned by Philip Morris, and stand alone again.  When Irene R took over as CEO, company started downhill.  Disappointing result since that time with revenue and share on a steady decline.  Split with Mondelez did not help at all and led up to the takeover by 3G/Berkshire Hathaway.  Needless to say, up until 7/6/15, it was ok, but I expect, based on previous takeovers from these companies, that revenue and share will spiral downwards.  Very cold management now only focused on cutting out the tiniest of expenses.  Watch for them to fail miserably."
bad,"Too much focus on cost cutting and not on growing the business.  Will only get worst with current merger news.  In the past it was a great place to work with great products and people, but not anymore"
bad,"I worked at a very high end hair salon, My boss was very strict and demanding without ever saying please or thank you. I made appointments for all stylist in the shop, worked over time without pay and I had to deal with people the thought they should always come first very rude general public. My boss did not like or understand life away from work, my family should have always come second to work no matter what. I learned nothing constructive from this job."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the travel and the cold. hardly had anytime to get to know the supervisors. never got off at the expected time.
bad,"Since the new owners took over, the atmosphere is bad!!! No loyalty to employees at all.  Seems to be no sense of history of the company and I feel they will lose many customers."
bad,"Never worked for a place run like this before. Lots of hours and need to be a ""yes sir"" type of person to work here."
bad,I feel that we were over worked most times being forced to work over time . Some co- workers were ok but a lot of back stabbing and lies. Management was not good. Although I did love what I did the hardest part was being forced to work the over time especially when you were sometimes told at the last minute. I most enjoyed operating the machines
bad,"Benefits and pay are pretty good, but there is no work life balance. you'll be told your working five days this week and on Friday afternoon you’ll be working the weekend, so don’t plan anything. Also there is not much room for advancement."
bad,"Due to dated historical practices and or bureaucracy/lack of leadership, what was at one point phenomenal place to work (x2) and completely ran it into the ground. "
bad,"When I first started it was amazing great management and great structure. As time past and the company was bought by Heinz we lost everything that meant the most to the people. Integrity, trust, transparency, the training and development.  Over working of employees and poor management of the business."
bad,"Pros: "
bad,I liked working for Kraft because of there benefits. They had order. Kraft also checked on there employees. You could always get as much as overtime as you please. The hours waa ok. And the days I worked was ok as well mon-thr 10 hours I liked.
bad,Company wants you to work 6-7 day weeks while the lines are running and then expects you to come in on your 1 day off to do repair work. Would recommend if looking for lots of overtime.
bad,I had between 3-5 stores a day that I had to pull-up or meet a delivery.  I filled shelves with product.  I rotated product while I was filling shelves.  Gathered out of dates and damaged product and got them ready for pick-up.  I organized and cleaned up the storage area in each store.  I would talk to managers about displays and product promotions.  I was in daily contact with my Sales Manager about what I did at each store.  I built displays and tore them down once promotions were over.
bad,The work day was typically a min of 12 hrs and many days i put up to 16 hours.  The management style was trying to say above the water not how to make things better.
bad,Pay off debt and work alot. Not a very well balanced work and home life. Great people to work with. Always over time a great pay with great benefits and everything else.
bad,No communication.  We had been the Bologna capital of the world and now we no long make Bologna at the Davenport plant..  We are going to another plant which was recently built but are not allowed bump into some of the jobs even though we have more seniority than the person holding the job.  Our union does nothing for us.
bad,Had no time for family. Work almost every week end.  Got tired of the cussing of  the people in lunch room- and breaks.  People not working together as a group
bad,"I started my career here looking for something to help me get a chance to improve my life , specially since I hav no college schooling. Which did work for me and gave me more tools to use to further my self but not their only down fall was they did not promote from with in the company to often ."
bad,"Again, expects more with less. Was a great company to work for years ago. Things looked up when purchased by Heinz. However, since the Kraft Heinz merger, just wanna find something new."
bad,"Since Heinz bought Kraft Foods supervisor and production jobs have been cut resulting in heavier work loads and increased stress. Heinz replaced all of our production supervisors with inexperienced barely out of college graduates. This has resulted in highly educated people implementing extra processes and procedures with no regard to maintenance or production employee experience. This has created a huge amount of stress and a lot of employees retiring early. Our 401K match was reduced. Short term disability payments were reduced. Pension vesting cap was reduced by three years.New hires have only a 401K, no pension. Why I left. Supervisor with five engineering degrees wouldn't listen to me."
bad,It's a long day of fast paced work with terrible management and very little pay for the work you do. Mandatory over time and very little help from co workers
bad,Working on a production line packing biscuits and placing them into boxes.Generally making boxes to place products in. Basically that was the job day in day out.
bad,Good coworkers to be around management is bad they hold you against their will will threaten your job if u don't do as say even though you know it is unsafe
bad,"Heinz used to be a great company to work for with a fantastic culture and atmosphere, Then they were restructuring and more restructuring and then they were bought by Warren Buffet (3G). They were on 3 levels and now on 1. It is now a very difficult place to work with a high turnover."
bad,"If you do not mind working 12 hours a day 12 days straight then its a job for you, but beware you are not appreciated at all, and its the only job I know of that you can be at work everyday and still point out, in which they use this to their advantage to threaten your job with forced overtime half point for every time you are unable to stay or come in early. They are so short staffed and are not hiring full timers cuts cuts cuts, They do not fix any of the machines when broken expect you to run in what I perceive as a unsafe work condition. No appreciation at all."
bad,At kraft The working environment you are treated very unfairly some days it's good some days if not the job just wasn't for me. The manger was very rude
bad,"this used to be an awesome place to work but now i wouldnt recommend my dog bark in its parking lot"
bad,Stressful. Supervisors stay looking for a write up. Always have someone over your shoulder. Canteen and vending services on-site are way overpriced...
bad,Bad Experience.Influential Rather then Supportive to their Employees. HR was given one sided opinion and no support was given to employees on any personal or professional ground.
bad,"Within my first 5 months of working, the plant manager, production manager, quality manager, a production supervisor, a quality supervisor, and a finance supervisor all left the plant. The production supervisor and quality supervisor positions were not up for replacement. There's no sense of team work. 3G has insane cost cutting methodology that takes away from any experience and is not rewarding at all."
bad,When it was just kraft It wasn't a bad place to work at. But now Heinz took over  its not a good place to work at. Putting to much work on the hourly employees.  But its a job.
bad,"Management at Cornuts site have no shame. Always looking to hurt others. Pretty terrible place to work. Floor personnel are very frendly and very helpful, but upper management has some issues."
bad,"After 5 years, I have been forced into work - under contractual obligations - sometimes 6 days a week. This has been hard on my family. Supervisors change several times a year and most seem to know less that then production workers about the factory."
bad,Desde que se compro por un grupo inversor complicaciones y despidos masivos.
bad,"The work environment is difficult.  The main issue is middle management support for projects.  There is internal resistance to change in the organization on the local level.  The structure of continuous improvement organization creates an ""ivory tower"" image.  There have been attempts to change the environment but to date they have been futile.  Persons I have met from other plants and corporate are very different than the local team.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of support for legitimate change."
bad,change schedule last minute. worked 7 days much of year. management deflects questions. never get a straight answer. worked overtime to make up for managements mistakes as they enjoy their weekend
bad,This company has great benefits but the company policy needs improvements to benefit the company and employees.
bad,had a poor management system and didn't seem to care for employees
bad,A decent place to work however things are changing and are heading downhill.  If you are looking for good benefits I suggest you look elsewhere.
bad,"Kollegial gesehen war das Arbeiten zufriedenstellend. Das Management hat das Problem alles selbst in der Hand haben zu wollen, was den täglichen Arbeitsablauf deutlich erschwert und behindert hat."
bad,"When you enter a job where you do not know if you are there for 8,12,16 hrs is outrageous. "
bad,"Operate machinery used in the production process, or assist machine operators."
bad,"Company is under staffed, resulting in long work hours for an extensive period of time with no end in sight."
bad,Too much red tape to get anything done.  Kraft has a bad reputation with their customers
bad,-TQM at workplaces- Quality monitoring- Quality definition and assurance at all level of product processing Units- Organizing quality development through the life of the company based on people’s and goods’ safety
bad,"a typical day at Kraft Foods is nothing typical at all, it's a good job for individuals looking for inconsistency, co-workers are assigned by teams which creates separation, it is a very physical job on both sides of the factory."
bad,"overall a good company except they have a tendency to go back on what they promise, and heaven forbid if you need to go to a state board for back wages, they will not hesitate to ""turn the truth to their advantage."""
bad,"They are a terrible co to work for if yo want to have any type of family life"
bad,It's not a bad company but management needs alot of work the people there do not show other people with respect. The pay is good but takes 20 years to top out so yeah
bad,union defends the indefensible. lazy uncooperative staff. no trust toward management or union. kraft is busy buying companies and down sizing and/or closing others
bad,Management had unrealistic demands of employees. Management wasn't supportive of employees.  Positive feedback was never given to good employees. Much recent downsizing of staff causing unrealistic work demands to increase.
bad,well known-many challenges daily with priorities changing often..  Public traded company that is daily in investment journals that identify many initiative
bad,"Extensive exhausting work hours, Will hire off the street and pay well plus paid time off after 90 days.  A great starting point or place to go if you need work and don't mind the hours."
bad,The company that hires out for Kraft Heinz is not worth it they overwork you underpay you and if you get sick that's a completely different ball game.
bad,"They pay was decent, but the benefits declined a bit after I started. The union there seems like its more concerned about the company than the workers it represents. The 12 hour shifts are draining, and they'll force you to work as much as they can without any regard for your personal life. They'll wait until the very last hour of the last day of your work week to put out the schedule so you cant even make plans"
bad,It is an okay place to work for if you dont want a family or dont want to spend time with your family. It is easy work if you can move fast pace. It has a lot of ups and downs to it as well though.
bad,"A great group of empoyees, many with +20-30 years service.  Helped ease their questions concerning pensions, benefits, salary issues.  Kept their confidential files updated.   Dealt with offsite purchasing departments."
bad,If you like getting forced into overtime every day then this is a job for you. As a maintenance tech I worked an average of 72 hours a week and as a production lead I stuck right around 80 a week. If you like working a lot of hours then this a job for you
bad,It can be better far as the parking there is no where to park cause it to many cars in there can be abetter communication among the superevisers in not wait to the last minute to tell us we work
bad,"Shift work creates environment of lack of quality & accountability because each shift passes blame to other shifts.  12 hour shifts consumes life, making life outside of work challenging.  Communication between shifts is minimal.  Overnight shifts lack good leadership.  Long-term employees fight changes in procedure and culture and are not willing to help train new employees., ."
bad,"Refletir muito sobre a posição e oportunidade a que esta concorrendo, e como são os pares e equipe."
bad,"Since the buy out the new owners naturally closed plants and slashed the staff numbers causing the remaining employees to be extremely stressed and worried about their jobs. "
bad,"This company will not care about you.  People are dispensable.  This company doesn't care about anything except the bottom line.  My advice, stay far far away.  Lines run 7 days a week so even if you have the weekend off you'll still be checking in or receiving calls.  Your personal time is never uninterrupted.  Work days are no less than 10 hours and can go much longer.  "
bad,work sucked because people sometimes didn't do what they were suppose to do at the end of there shift so you had to pick up what they left and management act like sometimes they were blind to curtain things and the most enjoyable thing was when l got off work.
bad,The company gave some employees the rolls of leaders. This caused a lot of bitterness among employees and released the pressure from the formen of dealing with issues.
bad,"you work long hours and forced in on overtime every week. it is very cold . the benifets are good.  you do a lot of standing, and reaching."
bad,"Hard work and fast paced. Employees are nice and respectful but there is a lack of management. Not much room for advancement."
bad,The job is productive when there is work to be done but i disagreed with a lot of the ways the management operates they don’t have enough workers to fill all positions so they sometimes forced full time machine operators to stay over 4 hrs past their shift to finish up work for the over night shift and the pay was not enough for the work they require
bad,"This job is not for everyone. They are not upfront about hours/schedule. They talk about training you in other aspects of the company, never follow through with that!"
bad,Micro managed from the top. Plant manager didn't trust anybody to do their job. very low moral with employees turned against each other. would tell on each other for anything. high turn over rate and fired a lot of people for anything. start at low wage you have to work there for 4 yrs to get rate.
bad,"Management is so out of touch with how to run a facility it's quite pathetic. Morale of workers is the worst because all KH cares about is cut labor cost, even when ahead of the curve, it's more cuts. It will never end as the company is capital driven. Union in bed with company so there is no reason to even have representation. They do not address customer reviews and concerns. Honestly wish they would sell out to a different company."
bad,"rotating shifts, time off is difficult to take, down time without pay sometimes when the area is down, opportunities to work in other areas is good though. Pay could be higher and many employees have been there for a long time, it is difficult to receive better shifts"
bad,The billing is a very old building that had it problems the lines kept breaking down the weight were always off the labels won't not sick to the packages
bad,"politique qui profite du profit des travailleurs."
bad,I worked there when they were closing the plant. They continued to consolidate jobs and it made it very hard because each person had to do more and more.
bad,"•	Effectively sold Nabisco products in major supermarkets throughout the North Florida and South Georgia marketing region.   "
bad,"Severe gap between management and hourly employees. Culture of elitism where management can do no wrong. Advancement only through personal friendships, despite the interview dog and pony show."
bad,"poor team leaders, crazy schedules, not enough pay for job duties, no direction, extremely cold, favor to certain employees, most co workers have had to have surgery after working at kraft for 3 or more years, poor training, people have loss their limbs,"
bad,"Not the same company that I started with in 2000, culturally when 3G capital took over leadership, the moral of the company, workload, and work life balance entirely fell away from previous leadership"
bad,They have nothing in order didn't like my experience there but did get to know some great people.My supervisor was never on site she worked from home only hear one side to a story.
bad,"Kraft was a great place to work until 3G Capital merged them with Heinz. Employees used to be appreciated, rewarded, and given development opportunities. Now the only focus is the ""Zero Based Budgeting"". It would be a good place for someone fresh out of school to launch a career, but don't plan on staying long."
bad,"I have worked at Kraft Heinz  for over 14 years, it was a wonderful place to work until Heinz took over. the pay was good the benifites not so hot. If you want to spend your life at work and have no family time then that is place to be. To much over time, you have to sing up for o.t. at least 4 times a week, eather go in early or stay over . My co workers were the best part of my job."
bad,"Work place was okay, nice people, but job is more for students. Not to make it a career. Learned a lot about different food brands, and kosher foods. a"
bad,A competitive environment with thankless management and too many hours. A plethora of lay-offs without opportunity to advance. Favoritism prevalent and 24-hr workday often expeted
bad,"Management is carried out in an intimidate-blame-punish manner. I've never seen such low morale, and it comes directly from the top. Communication is poor and often contradictory. No training program whatsoever. Work-life balance is terrible: weekly and even daily schedule changes are common. I haven't met one person who truly enjoys their job. Turnover rate is high, especially in maintenance."
bad,"Is lacking, isnt a good environment to work in.  Often times, management doesn't respect its employees.  It takes a lot to be recognized. Work piles up on you"
bad,"No work/life balance"
bad,"There are positives and negatives to KH as there are anywhere. As long as you work hard, you'll be fine. A lot of opportunity for advancement for performers."
bad,"My co-workers are great to work with! I get along well with them and we collaborated well in many projects. I truly enjoy the work-life balance they gave us, they allowed us to work from home most of the time."
bad,"Management looks at the employee as numbers, work six days a week and the one day off is mostly for sleep. I haven't really seen my family since I been working there."
bad,A typical day at work was very stressful.  Too many changes in processes and personnel at one time.   I learned many new things in the fast pace environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
bad,"the sad story behind Kraft, many people don't know Kraft started about 100 years ago in Allentown. Sadly it became the worst managed facility, the waste was beyond belief, while people in charge ( plant manager, HR manager and the like ) made one stupid decision after another , allowed bigotry and nepotism in running the place, while pretending to put on a good front."
bad,Required to work constantogether 12 and 16 hour shifts. You really don't have any kind of life other that kraft. Money isn't everything.
bad,Some employees are the only reason I havethe strength to stay here. Pay is ok. managment has no idea how to run a company other than into the ground.
bad,"Kraft Foods was a great place to work over the last 10 years, and I have had some great experiences. They have always treated me fair and will miss the tems we built."
bad,"The most enjoyable part about working at Kraft is the people they are very friendly and sometimes helpful."
bad,"They are about cost cutting more than about people, this changed the whole culture of the company. Many people doing more than one persons job."
bad,employees and management is very professional each job assignment is very easy and explained well. The company also give back to us as in employees and share very important information with us as employees
bad,Forklift certified. Enjoyed learning about warehouse Merchandise shipping and understanding how the whole process works. This can be a great company with great managers.
bad,"mucha gente mandando y pocos trabajando, trabajar para esta empresa es tener los nervios muy templados puesto que la presión es constante,cada dia era una aventura nunca se sabia como iba a terminar,averias constantes por el bajo o nulo mntenimiento de las líneas,aprendi mi trabajo yo solo nadie me enseño sin embargo yo si que enseñe a varias personas mi trabajo.la dirección era un desastre no se enteraban del trabajo no atendían nuestros consejos y opiniones,la parte mas difícil aguantar al encargado de turno,mis compañeros y compañeras pues buenos deje varias amistades,mi trabajo en general me gustaba todo"
bad,"I only worked there for a year but this is my feedback....if you are looking to make a difference, don't work at Kraft Foods. Tons of red tape, hard to get anything accomplished."
bad,I worked for Heinz before the buyout. Performance was not rewarded. Very Hierarchical company relationships rewarded more than performance. Lots of waste and lots of layers. Titles for the sake of titles. Things sound like they are changing for the good since I left and since the buyout. Senior Leadership totally retooled (good thing).
bad,"Merchandised product (frozen pizza mainly) for Kraft foods. Went from store to store, during non peak hours to set displays."
bad,KP is it ok you take out boxes in work in people place when that in to take a bk
bad,"It's been a good 7 years.  It's a shame the plant had to close, I really enjoyed my job.  Too bad there was a lot of poor attitudes and most weren't happy with a good paying job.  People abused the attendance policy.  It is what it is, the plant is closing june 25 and it does not surprise me with the way it was being ran."
bad,stocking and rotating merchandise shelves with food products on a daily basis.
bad,"The front line of people that work at the Portion Control plant are incredibly hard working and good people, it's just a shame the low-margin nature of the condiment industry will eventually cause more hardship at this plant.  It is inevitable that the profit-hungry owners of this company will continue to enrich themselves without thought of the people making it happen and sell this factory to a co-packer that will offer cheaper production via lower pay, less benefits, and less financial backing than Heinz did (believe it or not).  "
bad,Nice place to work. I enjoyed my time there. The diversity is wonderful.
bad,"People were great!! Management is ridiculous. You will know the meaning of ""micro management"" if you work here.The insurance was a joke."
bad,normal everyday duties . Would have to repack products.Managers was great and co workers. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. Working with the people.
bad,"The Kraft Foods Group: "
bad,A normal day at Kraft was makeing sure the machines were working safelyfrom the last shift. 
bad,"Very competitive work enviroment, deffinately have to prove yourself."
bad,"reponiendo estaba por agencia, los colegas estaban en otra ciudad"
bad,Era um dia corrido de muitas tarefas.
bad,"The pay and benefits are amazing. You most likely know more than your supervisor, but they have a so called ""college degree"". The co-workers are great. It is a horrible union, so DO NOT depend on them for much."
bad,"descontração,o basico,fraco,mais ou menos,fazer a gente acreditar q podemos crescer,as pessoas."
bad,"Employee welfare is last aspect to be addressed.  Extra work hours and days constantly thrown in at the last minute.  Uncoordinated management constantly wanting full production, and no machine downtime."
bad,prepair to work midnight shift.   They can force you in early or make you stay late. But they wont-work you more than 12 hours  Per day. Sanitizing sucks! But you  Do it at the end of every week. By then on Friday they come back and tell you that it's not done till 4:00 in the morning So what cut your weekend short every week.
bad,"Working there all you are is a number, they don’t care about there employees it’s all about the numbers get the meat out and the union sucks, they work for the company not the employees, at first I loved my job but now I’m glad I’m gone"
bad,"Continua presión para recortar costes, lo cual les hace llegar a extremos preocupantes para una multinacional de ámbito mundial. Por ejemplo la falta de inversiones, ausencia de liquidez para adquisición de cosas básicas, y los despidos de trabajadores cualificados."
bad,"The pay is pretty good, well above the minimum wage for our area, really good benefits once youre a full time employee and past your probation period. There is ample opportunity to go up in the ladder but without a degree or training, there is only so high you can go. The job bidding goes off of seniority, so if you havent been at the job long, youll get outbid on jobs. They make you work 12 to 13 hr shifts regularly, and most of the current supervisors dont seem to know what the theyre doing. There seems to be no communication between them and theyll suspend you for the smallest things. HR at that point will usually take their side and not the employees. "
bad,"This plant is in a downward spiral.  Lost the good management and now there is no direction."
bad,I had problems with management within my own department and it made my job really hard to maintain. There was too much favoritism around the plant itself and they let a lot of employees get away with stuff that is against the companies protocol. I use to like my job and could run every job within the department even tho our supervisor didn't know how to run a single job within the department.
bad,"PROS:"
bad,"This started off a great place to work, but when you sacrifice so many hours and feel not valued, it puts a bad taste in your mouth.  Recognition is low for optimal performance."
bad,As I did several different jobs there it was sometimes several meetings a day with took away from the actual work I needed to get done. Lots of management turn around and not always hiring someone in a management position that was qualified for the job.
bad,I need more hours to make money good company but I have bills to pay and can't pay them with the hours I am putting into it and I think by working in a new environment all my bills will be paid easily
bad,"All I can really say is that the Union with this company does more harm then good. Its used to be fair, but now its just lack of communication and commitment."
bad,Looking for a new and exciting career change I'm a motivated and hard working person.hoping to get some new and exciting work experience.would like a career that challenges my mind and also like to be on the move.
bad,"Constant layoffs and poor on site training is just a few of many problems inherent in this merged company. They are so obsessed with putting the shareholders first, they have neglected their core asset...employees. Benefits are being slashed to maximize profits, not to mention they recently minimized our access to tools and supplies to do our job...what gives! The new management doesn't have a glue what their doing; or maybe they do, when it comes to making money for themselves and not the general workforce they seem to be on target."
bad,Better  communication I worked there Kelly service and there was a major lack of communication our shift manager was  just threw into her position in return we were given false information  witch made my days a this company a bad  experience
bad,May not have a job tomorrow!! Management is all about cost reduction! No leadership. Poor training !! Management does not believe in corporate culture!!
bad,"This used to be a company to be proud to work for. Now they don't care about the employees at all. There is zero work/home life balance. Expect to be working 12 hour shifts 5-7 days a week. Expect constant schedule changes. Expect to rarely be working the shift you are supposed to be working on. Expect that if you have kids you will miss the majority of their major milestones and make sure you have a sitter that can accommodate whatever they tell you to work, which is anything. from working a 12 hour midnight shift the night before and coming back in less than 8 hours later for your next shift, to working nights for half the week and afternoons the rest. "
bad,Not recommended if you are looking for a active management to help with your issues. Very much Primary dominant. Minimum Growth opportunity. Acceptable work-life balance
bad,"there is no proper timing in this company. its all up to you. "
bad,Lack of Job security but content of work good. Good team but very rough culture leading to lack of direction. Good brands to manage and rich strategy work but brand equity is of less value here.
bad,Great place to learn different jobs.  Many opportunities to enhance your experience. Great place for job work/life balance. Lack of moral disappointing
bad,3G has made too many changes to quickly and have lost focus on the customer and employees.  Kraft Foods was a great organization I was proud to work for but focus from sales/customer to finance has not been a good one.
bad,You work long hours with a lot of stress and the management seems clueless at times.  The co-workers are friendly.  The medical benefits are not that good.
bad,"I would recommend this job to any who likes to work a lot of hours. If you are someone who is looking for overtime, this is the right place to be. However if you are looking for a job with a good work/life balance this place is not for you. "
bad,"A typical day at work was clearing inventory error messages on the SAP console, and reconciling inventory variances at our 3rd party warehouses."
bad,Kraft had a lot of turn over among its employees.  The  hardest part of job was lifting 50 pounds continuously.  I worked with some very nice people. The most enjoyable part of job was working independently.
bad,"This was a good job to work, people wanted to come to work at Kraft, fun process to be a part of.Moral was always great even though they layed people off alot"
bad,benefits were the only good thing management sucks and your so replaceable in that place no job security
bad,"had a co-worker get killed on my shift, due to the dangerous conditions in the ware house."
bad,"As a grade 6 supply hyster driver I am responsible to assure the "
bad,It took them six months to pay me for mileage and when they did they paid me the wrong amount. They never paid me for all of the miles I drove. There was a lack of communication.
bad,"typical day at work - very tiring"
bad,Selling within the many grocery points for Kraft Foods. Fast paced position with little or no down time. Lack of support offered even when desperately needed.
bad,"There is alot of money to be made at heinz. But with that they own you. You will work 12hr shift constantly 6-7 days a week. Flip flop shift and do turn arounds/back-to-back shifts, running on 3-4hrs of sleep. Health insurance is ok. 401k match is about a joke. Union is absolutely worthless. You work here for the money and thats it. There are plenty of oppurtunities to advance within the company if you put forth the effort."
bad,"Very long unappreciated days, Corporate provides no real assistance to factories and continue to eliminate roles and set unrealistic goals without providing resources or capital for failing infrastructure. Turnover and employee stress is at an all time high. This is quite frankly the worst position nowadays all the pressure is applied on PM's there is no fun in being bullied into committing to goals that haven't been achieved in over 5years. Unhealthy culture and practices is eroding iconic brands and lying to shareholders."
bad,"Worked at company for a few years, Poor management, long hours, again long hours.No sick days so if you are working 60-80 hours a week and every weekend for an extended period of time and you're body gets beat down and you need a day off to reboot you will be punished with a point, 9 points and your terminated,Also takes one whole year for point to come off(insane).So good pay, bad management, long hours,You decide."
bad,In all areas it feels chaotic and mismanaged. I left with little confidence they could promote their way out of the hole created when talent and years of experience all left for greener pastures after the acquisition. 3G has all but destroyed what used to be one of the best cultures and families to be a part of in the CPG industry.
bad,"Huge push to keep production going which forced people to say rude things to other departments which didn't have things ready for their department in time. The turnaround was bad, often causing the department to pick up the slack of another person that has left the company. Every few years the company re-organized the salaried workforce. The good news was that if you stuck around you could learn several positions as they became vacant."
bad,Employee relations definitely went down hill after merger.  Repeatedly claimed there would be no more layoffs even after 5 rounds (then 6th round occurred). Also Heinz changed benefits package in a non-employee way.
bad,I worked for Kelly Services at Kraft Heinz Company and it is not a fun workplace to work for. Management seem to have their favorites and it is very much overlooked by upper management. The hardest part of the job is trying to work well with the people that could not speak English and the most enjoyable part of the job is if everyone got alone.
bad,Kraft was a good job i love my job and what i was doing daily.everyday was a different day and learn different work ethic from longer working employees and management
bad,"little responsibility,little stimulation, a job that will not stress you out but will be quite boring at times.early morning shifts are a challenge and not everyone can do it."
bad,managers at upper level too worried about image and bonus to do the required work to correct problems. patronizing to hourly employees and bullying to supervisors.  HR overwhelmed  Didn't support safety as a core business value
bad,A typical day was eight hours long but could last twelve hours or more on occasion. I learned a lot about keeping machines running. Management was fairly good overall but it depended on who was in charge. Overall the workplace culture was good until the last two years. The hardest part of the job was trouble shooting. The people worked well together.
bad,I worked here for 18 years.  I do miss my job and some of the people but do not miss the misscommunication and the management. I wish I still worked there.
bad,"I started at Kraft in 2012 when it was still a place someone would want to work. Since the merger with Heinz, the company, environment, culture, and management have all gone downhill. There are small pockets of the company where you can still have a normal work/life balance and feel valued. Otherwise, be prepared to work 12+ hour days (and hours in on the weekend) with little to no guidance. You will be required to figure out most things on your own, as everyone else is typically too busy trying to not drown in their own work. Management doesn't seem to care about the working conditions or whether you succeed or not. And if you're really lucky, you'll have a manager who not only doesn't train their employees, but doesn't establish processes and procedures, talks down to you, and still expects you to perform."
bad,"everyone has issues with the way a company Operates, But when I say the stability of this location Is that major risk that is no joke. If I remember right this company spent 300 million to expand the plant, And now they can't even keep the orders that they have taken on. The ship started out on 12 hour shifts with 4 teams with about 100 people per team, They are now 8 hour shifts with 3 teams. The reason for that change they tell us is the demand for cold cut lunch meat is way down. What they neglected to tell us is that the plant itself could not meet the standard it needed too. So the orders and a large part of the  meat that is produced there is sent off to another plant to finish the work load. All of this is because they do not have good equipment and they definitely don't have the management that is needed to drive the plant in the right direction."
bad,"During my early career with Kraft, I enjoyed a company - that knew ""who"" they were and executed appropriately.  With new Ownership, things have changed."
bad,worked as an intern in manufacturing. Company culture was good until Kraft merged with Heinz. Lots of lay offs after. There was a lack of training for engineers and company was more interested in business than manufacturing.
bad,"The company is looking to expand, but lacks the experience needed to succeed based on their hiring and training process.  Middle and Upper Management are more focused on Analytics, rather than being out in the field to evaluate what truly works and what their customers need.  In their expansion plan they are looking 10 steps ahead, but are often tripping on the 3rd or 4th step, sending them back to start all over with another ill fated plan.  "
bad,"You will feel as though you live here... No work life balance. 60 hrs a,week.. never see your family loved ones.The benefits are great however.. No life ."
bad,Yearly bonus is very generous up to 20%.The MBO(Measure By Objectives) is very stringent and correlated to other areas which creates a sense of team work to meet your targets.
bad,"> In a typical day various reports were required to be made, various analysis was required to be done of sales, CMA etc."
bad,Job Security is an issue. There is constant lay offs. There is constant change in job roll and responsibilities. Moral is at an all time low in the 7 years I have been with the company.
bad,"The pay scale and raises are good with very good benefits, however the hours are long which include being forced to work 10 or 20 extra hours. Absences are not tollerated and are on a point system which is cause for high turnover rates."
bad,"Management and union are always at odds with each other so it puts employees caught in the middle."
bad,"job culture was not so good"
bad,"The hours were ok. Three days one and two day the next."
bad,We were told we couldn't work over a certain amount of hours but were still expected to work but work off the clock.
bad,"Lazy people...you would think people would put some effort into their jobs for $20+/hour. Supervisors, management, and office people are a joke! Everyone is out for themselves therefore zero teamwork!"
bad,"Una mañana agradable el trabajo era muy acogedor"
bad,"Serviced and maintained all heating and air conditioning equipment, as well as other refrigerated equipment."
bad,"Soy una persona que pongo todo mi empeño y esfuerzo en el trabajo, excelente persona para trabajar en equipo y mutuo repeto a mis colegas."
bad,"Rockford, Illinois gum plant is a nightmare. The mgmt is clueless and heartless. One side of the plant is ruled by a very unprofessional upper manager. The expectations are beyond what a human can do. Myself and others agreed that our health was deteriorating from the pressure and resulting stress."
bad,"Do not get a job in this company. You will have no future there. They work you like a dog and brainwash you with their products and how glorious they are but they cannot face the fact that they are becoming irrelevant for their market. This is already reflected in the share price, which is decreasing at an alarming rate. "
bad,"They hired me on as reserve pool.  They had poor planning and hired me on to fill a position that never became available. They are now making beg like a dog to apply for jobs within the company that I keep being marked ineligible for. Good place temporarily, highly recommend having a back up job in place."
bad,"A lot of people working here aren't taking showers here everyday. No time, after 12 hour shifts 5 days in a row. With overtime. "
bad,"You will work 60 hrs per week. Guaranteed,  money is great but you have no life!!! Supervisors are pretty decent but they aren't afraid to fire someone. Lots of advancement opportunities,  but again, you have no life outside that place,  none."
bad,Kraft is a fast pace work environment. There has been a lot of changes in the last few years with this company. That has been hard to keep up with. Some of them have been good. Some of them have been not so good.I Think once everything gets implemented. This will once again be a good company to work for
bad,"Barely get 40 hours a week, I need overtime. Seniority means nothing. I was hired for days and have been stuck on seconds. It's ok for a young person with no family"
bad,"Over the past few years I've worked at Kraft Heinz there have been many job cuts all around the plant. Many of these cut positions duties are then pawned off onto another position adding more work to what they have to do, which lead to a stressful environment. On top of that as an operator I am, semi often, mandated to work overtime. Sometimes I'll have to work 3+ 12 hour days in my 5 day week or they'll tack on a Saturday the day before. Due to the seniority system in this plant the person being here the least amount of time gets required for overtime unless another person volunteers. It can take a few years to make it anywhere in this plant due to that same seniority system where nearly all jobs are awarded to the person being here the longest. This makes it difficult to move up in the plant taking many years to secure yourself a decent job."
bad,Company going thru many changes that make the employees weary. Employees always willing to help each other. Supervisors are amazing! Safety is number one always.
bad,"Currently am working a shift that benefits my life which is the main reason I have stayed.  Unfortunately things are changing supposedly for efficiency although I would have to disagree and believe it is a change that will not last or is just another stepping stone for the closing of the plant.  Management has no communication once so ever, especially going from quality to production and the hr department is a joke.  Pay is fine but as far as advancement clearly if you know someone in management or hr most of the time you get the pick of the field.  Benefits are decent for families.  They outsource for fmla related benefits with a company called Aetna who will not work with you and may tell you one thing one day and then the next tell you their supervisors still think there is insufficient information.  Overall decent place to work although is currently on a fast decline and in my opinion barely staying open."
bad,There is no work/life balance at Heinz. Most people are working 72 hours a week with no end in sight. Pay is good and benefits are also good. Management does not really care for anyone's well being.
bad,"It was overall a great place to work to build your income and make savings. There were people that showed lack of work and you had some associates that were working hard to get to get promoted by upper management. The most enjoyable part about working for Kraft was the benefits, vacation time and learning  more about Kraft and what it has to offer."
bad,Night shift differential isn't enough and not enough maintenance to get anything done. Heinz management is no good. Management doesn't care about the well being of the employees that work on the floor.
bad,I worked at this company during the time it was owned by 3G Capital/Berkshire Hathaway. They stripped the company to its bare essentials and sold it to Kraft. It was not a good time to work there.
bad,"No longer any focus on people.  Disregard for technical experience with interest solely in shareholder profit.  For example, employees have $5 per year for any/all office supplies.  All management objectives are monetarily based with no feedback on how employees are treated."
bad,Ubiquitous brands in every grocery store in America.  They compete in over 60 categories.  Conversion from Kraft culture to Heinz/3G has been difficult.
bad,Attend to Kraft employees health check up.  Keep records of employees health and encourage employees to work out and attend aerobics classes.  Answered phone calls interact with employees.
bad,"Great training ground for general management, most of the top talent moves on quickly, unknown metrics for advancement, CYA culture"
bad,"The hourly employees are fantastic. They work together and are always willing to help. They make the plant what it is."
bad,"I was interviewed and tested for a maintenance position dedicated to a production line. Position was titled ""Line Technician"". As it turns out, a line technician is a production worker with a tool box. I am a 25 year maintenance veteran and as such, am not well suited or even qualified to be a machine / production operator. Most of the people hired into the company for this position are not doing well, myself included. "
bad,"A typical day at work was you came in you got your gear on, then you go to the floor wash hands then u get on the line and start placing rotating the person off. I learned to place, operate the line, take machines apart and put them back together, were PPE while cleaning the machines during wet wash. dry clean, making sure the tray seals were good, and making sure the line ran good so we can make the numbers for the night shift. upper management didn't really know what there doing to be honest and the lower management like the supervisors and the team leads are very hard working people and there on top of there game. The hardest part of the job was when the line went down and you had to fix it as fast as you can because you have to meet a certain number at the end of your shift. The thing ill miss most about Kraft is the pay."
bad,"Not a good place if you are not in with the people, going out drinking and smoking. I like to eat my lunch by my self they want you to eat with other people."
bad,"Corporate culture is focused on reducing Overhead.  Travel is limited and employees are required to share hotel rooms.  Work space is open concept, with employees at all levels working in one large work space."
bad,"In my time at Kraft, I have developed many excellent professional relationships and have learned a great deal about the CPG business. I have nothing but praise for the leadership of my immediate supervisors and the integrity and skill of my colleauges. It's been a place where I have been able to grow personally and enjoy excellent benefits."
bad,they dont take enough time to train you they just give u computer training and then toss you on the line
bad,"acomodar y dar limpieza en mi área laboral, hacer labor de venta  entregar y acomodar  mercancía."
bad,"Its a stressful place to work, and rather unorganized, at least when I was there. Perhaps it has changed. It is a sink or swim type of environment on the sales side. Though you may be promised training, you might get thrown under the bus, and learn by trial and error, very very stressful."
bad,Enhancers always shutdown for Xmas through the new year. Very filthy work environment not clean at all for human food  mice and bugs everywhere. Bosses don’t pay attention to anything . Forklift drivers are slow and make jobs harder for employees!
bad,"Your schedule can change by the end of the work day. You can't  ever keep any type of routine at this job. They had me work 3rd shift, 2nd shift, then first shift consecutively. They would do that sometimes with little to no time in advance."
bad,Being a production worker at Kraft has more negatives than positives. Some days you are required to work mandatory overtime that can cause for very long days. The shifts change every week especially for a new person and most importantly the job one is hired to do there is not the job that person will have after accepting the position.
bad,"Trabajo bien, jefe de sector mal trato al personal"
bad,"The work there is high paced your whole shift. There was some rude people there as well. Overall though it's pretty quiet. You have always stay focused on your task at hand, if not you will miss your marketing consistently."
bad,"I didn't feel like this company cared about their employees, i was hired part time, but worked full time hours, lots of Drama between co workers, not very encouraging"
bad,"I started my shift at 3am on the line running a forklift to bring in meat to load in the slicers. We rotated positions every hour, so from there I would stand on a catwalk and pick up stacks of ham that came down the line and put 16 of them in a big sheet with holes for the ham to fit. I would then put a big sheet on them, slide it on the next conveyor belt before it advanced, and it would go on down the line."
bad,Was an excellent place to work meet slot of awesome people and manage me to was excellent on back shift. Unfortunately for me it was time to move on to other opportunities
bad,"not a very good place to work since Heinz/3G took over. Interested in profit only, don't care about the employees, people were treated a lot better when it was Kraft Foods."
bad,"Since being taken over by Heinz/ 3G, the management is only interested in squeezing as much money out of the company as possible on the backs of its employees. The Kraft Foods Company was a very good place to work for many, many years, not any more. They keep marginal employees and the good employees have to do their own work and the work of the less productive associates."
bad,Employees are stretched quite a bit and the work environment is a stressful.  Job is not as enjoyable as it used to be.  Lots of work to go around with very little trust in employees to do the right thing.
bad,"co-workers were not bad, we were trained very poorly for the jobs we were given, the hours were inconvenient"
bad,"co workers friendly.  was interesting making lunchables. downside, not much home life. hardest part of job, mandatory overtime"
bad,area mechanic was a boring job. sitting and waiting for equipment to break isn't very fun. all shift relief mechanic was even worse.
bad,"The company dramatically changed after the take over by Heinz.  A large number of employees were severed after the take over, especially Director level and above."
bad,"Has been a steady, reliable place of employment. The food industry has plenty of room for growth and is sustainable during challenging economic times."
bad,"Great place to start your career and learn, but wouldn't want to stay forever."
bad,"i learn how to operate machine running the assembly line, my co worker are the one that helping me and I help then when the line get busy. Hardest thing is that when machine are out, and you have to deal it with. I'd enjoy working at Kraft, when there overtimes and get over pay."
bad,After the buy out in February of 2013.Heinz went from a family company to a company owned by some very greedy individuals. Many layoffs and longevity and loyalty to your job no longer mattered.
bad,a typical day is paper work making sure you got everything you learn how to make food co workers are very smart and helpful hardest part about job is the coldest the most enjoyable is the finish of the work you put in
bad,"I was not trained properly. I had no idea what chemicals were what, which one i needed, how i worked the air machine for the foamer. I was not shown how to take or put the machine apart, i taught myself how to put a few pieces on and take a few pieces off. Tools were not offered, besides huge wrenches for the big parts. Were not allowed to bring in our tools, but told to do sone anyways. Its not a good place to work."
bad,"It is a typical 3G company. They don't care about how you feel or they don't really treat you as an individual. But don't make me wrong, it is a global company that set you in a high position for future career growth."
bad,"The pay is good, the benefits are good but you get penalized for using your sick time. In the middle of the year they decided to make these changes to make it harder for you to call out of work sick or with a family emergency. They took some earned time off from every employee with no warning. There is mandatory overtime and so much of it that you feel like you have no time for anything but work. The management does not take reponsibility for their actions and blame it on someone else. Also, DO NOT GET HURT! You will get written up and it will always be your fault. Not a place to work if you want time with your family."
bad,"Working 12 hour shifts was long and dreadful. If they didn't force us to work so much overtime it would have been barrable and easy to balance a work and family life, however due to always being short staffed we worked alot of 5 or 6 day weeks."
bad,"Everything changes but it's sad to see the old culture die off the way it did.  I was proud to work for Kraft.  Then the disaster of Heinz.  I wish them all the luck in the world.  None of the old team remains which was truly unfortunate.  Those people worked so hard only to be treated so badly.  The good news is, processed food is gradually becoming extinct.  Soon the company will reduce their portfolio and maybe get back to it's roots."
bad,My opinion about Kraft Heinz is they got worse they messed up when they took 2nd shift out then things got much worse I use to work there back in 2014 it was so much better then... But now it's all bad that's why I left from down there it was putting a lot of stressed down on my body and on me.
bad,This place has no respect for parents who have children. I worked so much at this place I barely seen my children. We woyld work 14-16 hrs a day and it was mandatory.
bad,"tudo ok, final de mes, excelente comunicação,ok, mudança de tabela, vender"
bad,I really liked my job at kraft all except my team lead was not easy to get along with. Other than that I liked that I was always able to stay busy and get my work done
good,Pays stinks they work you like dogs Union stinks it takes 4 years to get full rate on your pay. If you have to have a job they'll hire you but just use it as a stepping stone until something better comes along
good,Long hours. No life. management sucks. and the moneys not worth it. The company miss-treats you and doesn't go by the union at all.  They are always making up new rules whenever they want.  Rules that make this company unfriendly and very unpleasant to work for.
good,Didn't work long not much to say.Did enjoy the hours and shift but i wish i could have worked longer.The mangers and supervisers were not trained properly.
good,Little development opportunities unless you are a trainee. If you are over 40 you may want to look elsewhere - experience is simply not valued. Heavy analytical focus often with no purpose. Sr. Management cares very little about individuals it is all about the results. Workloads are often unrealistic and unmanageable resulting in relatively poor work-life balance
good,The goal of a company is to provide a return for it's investors.  The new merger will achieve that through draconian means but the business will be hollow and dead by the end.
good,This is a great company that will let you make up your time. Everyone's experience is difference so I am bias about my experience.  Day to day work is constant. Very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is being understaffed. The most enjoyable part is getting a bonus.
good,Long hrs 16+hrs management and human resources team sucks. I wouldn't recommend working there if you have young families.work and home life hard to maintain
good,"Typical day involved my supervisor starting and spreading rumors about me because she simply didn't like me. If you want to ""climb the ladder"" you had to find ways to get other people fired or get special treatment for the management team."
good,"KHC aims to be paying their employees low unless they are in higher  level positions (directors, business unit heads, etc). The streamline process means the everyday employee is doing the job of several people. The work/life balance is very uneven. In order to keep up you need to work 60+ hours a week. If you don't keep up, you're more likely to be laid off in their annual 6 month rounds of lay-offs."
good,"Long hours, extremely High Stress environment. Onsite Leadership showed no experience to take the Company to the next level. Blame was placed on lower level positions for not reaching goals. No Life/Work balance and Family did not matter. No Compassion for Death or severe illness, you were simply a Statistics. I would not recommend this Company. New interns left or leaving the company after hired in because of this."
good,Working at Kraft Foods has given me a solid foundation as to how the Food Industry is driven. I've learned various positive skill sets that will carry me to greater heights.
good,Mixing baking machine operator
good,Dia típico de trabalho árduo e produtivo como outro qualquer
good,"don't have a work life balance. compensation is ok for the area, job security is Ok, as long as you come to work everyday. Management is ok don't really have to deal with them."
good,You get out what you put in. The job is good for the area it’s in. You do get paid vacation and the more time you work the more vacation time you’ll get.
good,Kraft wasn't the best place to work.  The pay is decent but the work environment gets stressful due to poor management forced overtime and fellow employees not pulling their weight.  the energy among employees is nothing short of toxic.  Advancement is based on who you know and not how you work and what you know.  Overall pay is decent but no personal life.
good,"The Kraft company is unreliable, work hours were unpredictable, you work one week and layoff the following week. They promise you bonuses and find an excuse to back out."
good,"Many people attribute most cons at Kraft Heinz to the management styles and organizational culture fostered by the executives, nearly all of whom are connected through 3G Capital, a Brazilian private equity.Those familiar with 3G’s culture through their other investment companies (AB InBev, RBI) will not be surprised by the cons below, but they are nonetheless important considerations for any potential new hires.Two key things to note is that KHC, much like other 3G companies, values both EXTREMELY lean operations, particularly in the form of aggressive cost cutting and Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB),and results-oriented measurements (MBOs and KPIs). While having that cultural exposure provides a leg up on how to navigate a company where literally everything needs to provide value,it creates signi􀃗cant headwinds in the following ways:"
good,"There were a lot of disagreements among co-workers which made it a difficult place to work.  We worked five days, 10 hours a day with some Saturday working required.  My long drive (90 miles) made it difficult to continue with the job."
good,Always try to do my best.  My attendance is great. I do not miss to many days.  Like to be timely . Try to help others when needed.  Work well in a team envirement. Try to have a positive attitude.  I like to keep a clean work area.
good,"Collègues agréables, travail très intéressant en équipe"
good,"to long lunch,no breaks,cannot leave building,management only concerned about money,people getting hurt daily,cannot communicate effectivly,to long of a walk to get water"
good,e uma empresa cheia de oportunidades mais porem eu trabalhava de operador de mespack um ano e nuca fui classificado por isso q resolvi sair da empresa
good,Buen ambiente en general. He aprendido como es el desarrollo del proceso de los zapatos.
good,"A typical day at work was going in at 4 AM working 12 to 13 hours a day with not much to learn about what you need to do to get the job done, very small place to work at and never have the correct PPE for you at the right time."
good,•Collaboratively develop customized programs with the consumer by leveraging Kraft’s “One Company” scale. Create synergies in the Kraft portfolio of products by increasing sales 22% and profits 14% for area.
good,"Assemble machinery for start up production, Start OEE, perform quality checks for line to run before personal jump on the open placing line,monitor placers wen they place product in trays ensure the product is flat to properly be seal and cut.Troubleshooter and clean machine if there is a jam,adjust film for proper sealing of/for the finish product.Adjust waits for raw material for use on the open line for the placers to place in trays."
good,"The entry level work itself is simple and makes the day go quickly. The pay increase for higher positions is not worth the amount of responsibility they add. The union consists of and only represents those with high seniority. The union contract removed employee benefits that people with seniority wouldn’t take advantage of, like college reimbursement and bumping new techs up to full pay. The atmosphere is much like high school with middle aged bullies."
good,"A Great company with Tons of potential that sold out and turned there back on thousands of great workers ."
good,"Everything I say is very location dependant as I worked at one of the few non-union plants. Management on the floor was okey, but higher management was awful. unrealistic workloads, excessive overtime, numerous violations of health codes on a daily basis. They began a diversity program and that backfired, the poor folks couldn't speak hardly a word of english and even they were putting their two weeks in."
good,"Kraft Heinz Newberry is a political joke. People who ""know"" the influential people get advancement. Credentials, Education & EXPERIENCE mean ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Kraft Heinz has very good benefits but the pay is ridiculous. Kraft Heinz is a BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY & employees should be better compensated. I can see joining another Kraft Heinz Manufacturing Facility in the US, BUT DEFINITELY NOT NEWBERRY, when I leave soon."
good,"not applicable to my field."
good,The only thing that matters is production quality and safety. Your personal life will not matter to them and neither will your family or well being. But they pay well enough to stay and the benefits are decent enough. Management has really been going downhill but it's not beyond salvageable
good,I was a contractor and had a terrible experience there. I was unable to work for long because the communication between the two companies was non exisistent
good,"Many people complain about the culture at KHC.  While there are some things that can be difficult (small per diem when travelling, limited number of cups provided for coffee each day, constant change), there is not one company culture.  Every group has their own culture and own ways of working, complete with their own set of acronyms and rules about working from home.  External hires are almost always new and inexperienced people, and some have the opportunity to quickly rise to the top, while other people wait for someone to quit so that they can be promoted.  Overall, if you are super flexible and don't need a lot of consistency, you'll do just fine here."
good,"I left because of health reasons of being stuck on night shift, the overall job was not a bad place to work as a maintenance tech it was a good working environment. They provided the proper tools and parts to do a good and complete repair. benefits were not great but were inline with the area. Hr was not helpful and didn't do much for the employees"
good,"Very dirty and unsafe environment. Mandatory 8 to 10 hour days, 7 days a week. Daily overtime sometimes not announced until less than one hour before normal leave time. No rotation for days off."
good,High expectations but without the tools to get them accomplished. Tried to follow a playbook but it sometimes did not fit the business model. The impression is that they don't care about the management team.
good,Start at 3am and work until done usually by 12pm daily; work ethic working independently under Kraft sales person; good culture of work environment; contact with management; early morning start time.
good,"Loved the job itself. Did not like the hostile working enviroment. They had good benefits when i first started, but they ended up going under a new contract and changed it. Had a good communicative work relationship with my supervisor."
good,"I don't really have anything good to say about them. When kraft and heinz merged they shut down our plant even though we produced more then others, made less money then other plants, etc. "
good,"Although was very happy with my responsibilities and working on projects, the culture and treatment of employees was not good. Kraft Heinz used to be a good place to work."
good,"A typical day a Kraft would include very fast paced work. You must be quick on your feet. You might have two people doing a four person job, so you have to make up for the other two missing people. The hardest part of the job is getting a hang of things in the beginning. Once you get a hang of things, everything else is fairly simple."
good,from bagger 1 month they move me to warehouse called RDU without any telling in me . so i dont have choice . my family needs this job. so i finish my contract
good,Ok company long hours good for young staff can be promoted fast no security ever changing environment and bonus totally linked to companies performance
good,I run large production machines for 12 hours. Every night I learn new things about my equipment and how to maintain my machinery. Sanitation is the best part of the work environment because I like to clean. Management is always responsive to new ideas and gives timely feedback when emailed. The hardest part of the job is troubleshooting when equipment isn't working properly.
good,"This not something that is understood.  It is mentioned frequently, but most manual labor employees are required to work at least 6 days a week.  Little to no I traction from upper management."
good,just was a horrible experience. worked 60 hours for a few weeks them got bumped down to zero. break system is very unorganized and you never know when you are going to get a break
good,"Have been working for Kraft Heinz for a little over 3 months. At first it seemed fun and exciting.  I was told I could run forklift with my experience.  A day later, management said no to that.  I am an operations technician and the work environment couldn't be more chaotic. If you hate cleaning every 12-24 hours large rooms the size of a house or warehouse,  it's not for you. Management is very condescending.  They often say one thing and do another.  Equipment is always malfunctioning and nobody including management has the knowledge to fix it.  If you're the first in the room, you're the first to get blamed.  I often get treated like a child and management would rather look for negative than encourage you with positive reinforcement.  The environment is cold and you're always standing.  If you're caught taking a breather, management gets upset.  If you're a nice person,  prepare to get stepped on.  All negativity aside, benefits are great, HR is terrific, and even though management is out to get you, your teammates will respect you and value your friendship. "
good,"if you young and full of energy and fully committed, you will get fast track promotion opportunities presented to you! Good luck!"
good,Good job to make money (a lot of hours) but no flexibility on personal time. The work force is pretty much all everyday hard working people just trying to make a living. The worst part of the company is that the HR Dept. runs the plant. they have no consideration for talent and are constantly threatening people with their job. The management are good people that seem to have their hands tied from making improvements due to corporate policies that don't work. The Union is basically none existent when it comes to representation.
good,"People who work hard will get rewarded, but tough atmosphere. The work/life balance is not prioritized at KH.  However, if you work hard, you will get promoted/bonuses."
good,Great products. Safe work environment.Good Manufacturing Practice. Opportunity for advancement if you apply yourself.
good,The people there are from mexico don't speak any english they are rude to me because I don't speak any Spanish. They also look down at me they don't bother teaching ways how the system work they CUSS u out then speak to u like person.
good,"- trabalho em equipe"
good,Very challenging on start ups in the morning.  Learning how to troubleshoot on equipment that is very old up to newer equipment.  Management is overstretched.  My co-workers can be counted on for support.  The hardest part of the job is knowing it's almost over.  And the most enjoyable part of the job is the experiences I will take with me.
good,"Work in the field, work from home office. Learn to work with store management. write instructions for next day work to merchandisers. no work/life balance. could work just about anytime."
good,"It was a hard work enviornment  but achieveable , knuckle down and worked hard, acomplished and good working relationship with manager and co-workers, organised."
good,"The job was enjoyable, i learned how to deal with people better, i learn how to muti task. my co workers were friendly and very helpful. the hardest part about the job was making sure the customer always new they were right but i learned alot from the job and learned alot about myself. now i love to work with and around alot of people."
good,"Not the right job for me, great people just not my interest. Sales Rep position would be more ideal "
good,"low pay long hours , seasonal employee long hours in the summer for green season (pickles)"
good,"This is a place that if you have a family it is very hard to work at because of all the Force overtime, I was getting time to spend with my daughter because of all the overtime and being Force to work 3rd shift from a job cutback scheme."
good,"Fast paced work environment, quality products, multi tasking, doing paperwork while running your machinery. correct paperwork as per usda requirements"
good,It has a fast turn around of employees. Scheduling is terrible. Never know what shift you will be on til the day before. Never know how many hours you are going to work. And for new hires the wages are not good. Once you get hired on through company you have to wait 3 years to get full pay.
good,"I Have Worked for Kraft for 20 years, Through these years i have experienced alot of change, both good and bad..It all come down to Management and how they treat their employees,  I don't feel we are treated as good anymore than we were before, sadly, there has not been moral in a very ling time"
good,large turn over which in turn requires employees to work longer hours and more Overtime. Advancement opportunities are lacking as the notices and job avail abilities aren't  made known to employees.
good,"work / life balance is terrible"
good,Decent company to work for. Incentives and benefits worsened after the buyout. Decent place to develop your career. Not a great work/homelife balance.
good,"fast paced, loud and very warm area to work in. Learned to operate machinery. Hardest part was covering for your co-worker jobs, Management lack some qualities."
good,When the line break down it gives you time to chill Nd talk Nd relax until the line get bck yo Nd it’s plenty ppl around to talk to  and the job have a smoke area for the ones that love to smoke
good,"I loved my job for years but with all the experienced employees leaving it's just not the same anymore ."
good,Very stressful understaffed supervisors don't care about the employees. All In all takes to long to get to max rate after you get hired to reach full pay rate.
good,Initially thought this was going to be a great place to work. Ended up getting blind sided by someone who somehow had become my manager although I was never informed.
good,This place wants to keep a person a temp for over three years. Its not much I can say about abbott nutrition. The work place was clean the breaks was fare. But softpath was the third party. You must work for them for three years with no health isurence before being considered
good,Too much overtime management really needs a blow through for the whole company and needs a change up of new management over all no time outside of work.....
good,The work can get stressful since you have a number of grocery stores to merchandise and each grocery chain is operated differently. It's very physical since you are pushing 12 foot carts full of products into the sales floor to merchandise the products. They pressure you to sell as much displays as possible. Pay is too low for the physical job you do and using your own car.
good,"Liked, Co-workers, pay, some of the work"
good,Overall Kraft was a great place to work I loved my quality technician job its just the people you work with its always something. There was a lot of picking and harassment going on and when you go to the higher ups they pretty much could care less unless its pertaining to them. I really felt like no one had my back and I felt that there was always something going on so I could never just come to work and do my job. Mostly a lot of unnecessary mess going on! Sucks because I loved my job!
good,"Scheduling was not employee friendly.  I learned how the product is produced and packaged, about quality control and workplace safety. The hardest part of the job was lifting."
good,"At one time, I enjoyed my job.  Then, Kraft Foods merged with Heinz.  Now, there is constant downsizing and more demands.  Currently, most supervisor positions have been eliminated."
good,It was never organized you come in expecting to do your job and then the supply was never ready and then finally when the supply is ready you run the machine hard and try to finish then something else goes wrong.
good,"Looking to flush experience and higher salaries with new young inexperience recruits. Not an optimal way to increase profits. No consistency with direction process or strategies, it change on a daily basis. No proper recognition. extremely poor planning with regards to project management. Change management is no existant"
good,"This company has an ill regard for its workers, it continually moves its workers from one shift to another which places undue health risks upon all"
good,"Repondre au appel d'urgence de la production."
good,"This is a seniority based factory. If you are a seasonal or new hire you will work at different shifts in a given week. Seniority does not have pull unless five plus years in."
good,Do not wish to write a review regarding previous employer. Confidential agreement prohibits me from commenting on company in any forum.
good,"Functionally off the pace but flexible. Can be dysfunctional."
good,"repetitive, management is not good, not very flexible if you want time off get forced to work weekends. good people to work with."
good,"This position was a contract position,  I was only hired to complete Vision and Hearing testing on employees.  Although my time was short there I enjoyed my position.  I learned alot from the on staff RN"
good,When I first started it was a great place to work  the benefits were great and everything but now its too much favoritism too many changing rules of the hand book but not letting the employees know.
good,"Great place to work for some, my situation was not the best. Management was not supportive"
good,the job was good when i had the oppertunity to achieve all my skills at this employment 
good,Not enough job stability when work is available its productive
good,"work was okay,ppl off doing their own things.the hardest part of the job was waking up 1:30 in the morning. and work tthru 2:30 in afternoon."
good,"This was a job I landed right out of college, so at the time the pay was fairly lucrative.  It's great having autonomy and being out in the field all day.  There are some long days with this job.  It's not unusual to work 5AM - 6PM, and 6AM - 12PM on Saturdays.  So as long as you don't mind working hard this is a decent opportunity with decent money to be made."
good,"I didn't like the hours that I was working (4pm-4am),but I did appreciate the fact that I had a job. Although, I didn't learn any thing new and innovating. I did meet some interesting people and most of the supervisor were cool. Each job had a different pay rate and it didn't matter how long you were there."
good,Management has different sightlines and often disagrees causing much confusion within teams. There are clear outlines from corporate but not always followed.  Most hourly employees work long hours often starting in the middle of the night and usually weekends as overtime leaving little work life balance.
good,Loved working there. Worked through a staffing service. Their management is kinda clueless. They work their ppl to death during business season and do not account for emergencies that occur in life.
good,"The facility which I was employed at could not staff your shifts with the required amount of employees.  Would be required to meet production demands with less thAN 60% of your required workforce.  A challenge that poor management cannot control.  Employees were selected for promotions but not allowed to move to new position because they could not replace the employees, not only for hourly but salary employees as well.  All of these conditions created a high turnover rate and the compensation was not worth the added stress."
good,"In the manufacturing life of Kraft Heinz, it's quite tough. With the zero based budgeting financial layout the company has, it's almost impossible to get things done in the manufacturing facilities. New equipment for machinery or even simple ""school supplies"" for continuous improvement activities. During my time there, my plant manager was let go, quality manager left, and numerous salaried employees left. Expected to work at least 60 hours a week with very little recognition from corporate. The plants try their best and management teams really put in the effort, but so little support from the corporate side. I also went through a union campaign that required me to be at the plant 6-7 days a week. If you can handle the grind, there is a high likely hood that you can move up the ladder."
good,"If you’re single without children or any other real responsibilities it’s likely for you, as they expect you to work all 3 shifts sometimes with no more than 8 hours off. Plus they don’t give you a definitive schedule at all. In fact you only know your weeks schedule on the Thursday beforehand..."
good,werken bij heinz was voor mij een positieve ervaring het sfeer onder personeel was goed het werk was vrij makelijk jammer genoeg zat er veel werk druk vanwege aantallen die gehaald moesten worden enige negatieve van mijn kant was 3 ploegen best wel zwaar
good,I have been there since march. I have been on mon thru thursday schedule B shift until just recently when i got moved to. d shift.. Really get along well with supervisor on Weekend shift d shift.. She really cares for the employeea and ia very encoraging..the employees on weekend shift seem less stressed and more laid back..  Expect to work 10 hour days. I will be in the union soon. Everyone goes thru orientation for two days along qith plant tour. Orientation is very informative and will prepare u for work there. U will start in a blue hat until 45 day probation period is up.. Dont screw it up u will get extended.. Show up on time do the work and be sure to dress very warm..
good,"Work/life balance was horrible. The overtime was never ending, and half the time it was forced at the last minute. The company never has money to put back into the equipment, so you are always dealing with breakdowns and down time. The head office took away all the things that were good about working there, the company picnic, retirement gifts, anniversary gifts, even turkeys or hams at Christmas."
good,If you’re tough minded and able to deal with politics in the work place by all means this place has opportunity. But the culture is one that suggest you help yourself before anyone else.
good,Good pay but you will live here. If your looking to make loads of money quickly then its the place for you. But the work balance is not here. Only 9 days to take off on your own for the year.
good,Not knowing what you will be doing that day never plan anything management don't know how to talk to you there's no work place code the hardest part of this job was knowing what time you went in but never knew your time to get off what I like most about this job was laughing with my peers
good,"Work was tedious,constant reshuffling of operation supervisors which in turn made workflow very inconsistent. Employees generally felt like they were walking in eggshells due to some of the supervisors. incentives for production attainment were also taken away."
good,"Muitas oportunidades de crescimento, mas necessita muita dedicação e um pouco de abdicação de vida social/pessoal. Não há muito respeito com relação à horários, tendo que trabalhar muito além do horário."
good,Below average review. New attendance needs to be put in place. Management needs a change in direction. New rules and guidelines need to be implicated and used
good,Positive outlook. Good place to work. The company employs many of people in the quad cities and surrounding areas. Hopefully they are around for a long time to come. A lot of families depend on them.
good,Kraft hienz is a good place to work with really good benefits but the hours wasn’t working for me anymore on count of my daughter i didn’t have decent babysitter for her .
good,Global ancak kurum kültürü geli̇şmesi̇ gereken bi̇r fi̇rma
good,"The ripple effect from the 3G directed merger between Kraft and Heinz is still negatively affecting operations.  The bonus structure claims to be a meritocracy, but performance is aggregated in such large groups that the results are meaningless."
good,"Since the merger, the company focuses on young, cheaper, hungrier talent, so it could be a great place to work for people just out of school who don't mind long hours with upward mobility.  Not a friendly place for more experienced workers."
good,I enjoy working at KraftHeinz.  Throughout the course of my time i was able to learn a lot from many good people who enjoy there jobs plenty of overtime.
good,The culture is great but the training tools to do your job are not readily available. Management is lacking in guidance and support. Good chances for advancement but that seems to be the only motivation for people to work here.
good,Very employment friendly to diverse groups inside and outside of their local community. Rural location so commute is required to the area. All shifts available.
good,"I loved my job but I lost it due to salaried job eliminations we brought in gbs and I could see that it was coming, it was fast paced, stressful I did scheduling, hr orientation,new hire on boarding, employee attendance,employee issues, recruitment, grievance resolutions, employee functions"
good,"Generally an OK place to work if you like to work in an overly mature 20th-century industry with extremely limited and often hyped up but practically meaningless product innovation. Local work culture varies vastly throughout the company of this size. The company is always in a flux, always in restructuring mode, always busy w/ merger, acquisition or divestiture mode. The basic products lack real nutrition, and are practically unhealthy and packed with artificial ingredients."
good,Order product in bulk for salt room. Set up machine for batches according to recipes and schedule. Inventory salt. Run salt that is needed for the week. Hang jumbo bags for emulsifier mixes and program system to mix batches. I learned that if management would police what was going on a a day to day basis we would not have so much stuff on hold or sent to land field. Management seem to not want to spend much time with floor employees.Every tense and seem like everyone was on edge. Not very forgiving. Was making sure all three shifts was on the same page. I have met and made many life long friends their. And out of a 8hr. work day had to work only 7hrs.
good,"If you enjoy working in a loud, cold environment (approximately mid-30 degrees constantly), this is the place for you.  High turnover rate. Expect repetitive motion injury from this job.  Met some nice people, and some not-so-nice people while there."
good,Can work on your own as long as the numbers come in.Always someone to answer a question though you might not like the answer.
good,Kraft Heinz was hard to have good family atmosphere when your time at Kraft was never defined by yourself meaning you work and if your family had a plan it would have to change to works schedule regardless how long or how much planning went it to the family plans.
good,"Was a great place to work, people are friendly and very helpful. Federalsburg plant will be closing this year."
good,it was a good job to have but some of the leader were unfair and that left me feeling unappreciated but other than that it was a ok paying job
good,"fine place to work, you can learn about production as well, but some people doesnt like that much, hard work sometimes for the pay."
good,"It was an ok company , just started making to many changes, don't care how many people lose their jobs just to make a few extra bucks."
good,I worked for this company for 18 years it was bought out in 2012. My job was eliminated in 2015. They are hiring college grads that is there goal.
good,"Different culture when the new company was formed. Politics made for a less comfortable work environment. May be typical of merging two different companies and the necessary reorganization required."
good,"The management there really don't get involved with the people like they should. Me, as a line tech, they ask if there's anything I need to make my job better, just ask. They still don't help you. To be truthful, they really don't hold the right people accountable for their actions."
good,"The culture at Kraft was family-friendly while till results oriented.  The best quality of the company was the quality of the people- the fabric of the company. Everyone pulled their weight, worked hard, contributed.  The food industry is getting more competitive every year, and the Kraft talent would step up to the plate."
good,Kraft provided many advancement opportunities over the course my my career at Kraft.  Early on in the career Kraft was focused on the people.  As time progressed this culture drastically changed.  With the merger of Kraft and Heinz this brought most employees over the end.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, baja valoración de los profesionales, no presenta un buen sistema de evaluación de desempeño, ya que depende de apreciaciones subjetivas por parte de los superiores."
good,"Ik heb gewerkt bij Heinz in een tijd dat er veel verandering plaatst vond. Veel reorganisaties en beslissingen werden vanuit Amerika genomen."
good,"Good to get started here, but culture has still yet to change as does the old management"
good,A fast paced environment going through the IL6S journey. Working with old machinery and new and experienced people to help along the way.
good,"the job was good but the atmosphere was very negative, and the management manipulative."
good,Company was good until new management came in and it went down hill eventually outsourcing my department.
good,An abundance of down time based on poor maintenance..Lackadaisacal approach to daily goals by employees based on poor supervision. Very rarely see management teams on the floor even in times of need. The hardest part of this job is handling the cold environment and endless negativity of production team.Hard work is not rewarded and individual advancement is not based on hard work but instead low seniority. You cannot advance based on knowledge.
good,Company is going through great changes and will be in business in the Champaign area for years to come.
good,Being a warehouse tech has taught me alot of things as far as knowledge of the Warehouse. I have enjoyed my time here at Heinz and we have became a second family out here. The worst part of my job is the closing of the plant. I have always liked my job here..
good,"Heinz is a very good company to work for. They valued their employess and created a great work enviroment. Since the buyout, jobs have been slashed. The new CEO's and shsarolders have one goal in mind and thats to reap as much money back from the investment at the coast of closing plants. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY UNTIL THE LAYOFF BLITZ IS OVER"
good,Heinz in Leamington to close doors. The most enjoyable were the guys I worked with.
good,Good company to work in.Management is very good and sales process is very systematic.
good,sales and servicing of frozen goods to grocery chains. I actually did not enjoy working for this company but this was due to management which was replaced after i resigned.
good,es una empresa segura pero hay ocasiones en las que los guias como les llaman son un poco inmaduros quiero creer que sea por la presion que tienen pero hay mucho consentido
good,Fast pace
good,"Can be a very challenging place to work. Management jumps around allot and is not the most innovative. Their marketing likes to copying other companies, products rather than make something great on their own. CO worker are some of the best I have worked with."
good,If you enjoy lots of overtime and a fast paced work place then this is the company for you.
good,"fijne collega,zwak management"
good,Kraft ruined Nabisco when they bought them.
good,"Between the 5,6, or possible 7 day work weeks and the lack of supervisors, to say the place is running amok is an understatement. Training was not training at all. HR is never available at all. Management or what you might refer to as management never shows up or leaves early. Mistakes are unforgivable as everyone seems to be looking over their shoulders to get fired. Gossip runs rampant and is used in disciplinary situations. The job itself is mundane, boring, and quite easy, once you get past all the hoo-ha."
good,"Being in an under populated area of BC, work was limited by budget and shops to work in. Attending the shops sent to me by the sales representative, I would start my day early and attend to the work order for each shop. This could be a whole day to complete the project or just a part of the day. What i learned was the merchandising section of Kraft is contract and doesn't receive the benefits of Kraft employees so wasn't intended to be a full time position. Relieving the sales representative showed promise but no advancement in the area I lived. My representative was positive and encouraging towards the job and the scope of the industry. the hardest part of the job was surviving on limited income. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting up displays and working with shop owners or internal management to getting a positive conclusion to the projects."
good,"Shift times SUCK. no work life balance. You could be working mon-sun 10-12 hour days for 5 months straight. If you wanna make money, this is the place to be(40k is the least amount you'll make a year, the average is about 50). I'm in my very early twenites and just couldnt see myself wasting my twenties(and up) living in a warehouse(basically). What's the point of money if you don't have time to spend it?"
good,"Kraft Heinz was a great place to gain experience. It was difficult leadership work and there was limited oversight or training. Overall not ideal, but they paid well. Very location or manager dependent."
good,Working here was a great learning experience. Employees within each field were knowledgeable and willing to teach others. The work life balance is minimal with high stress and minimal reward
good,"Their were a lot of people with relatives that worked in the plant, so it was hard to get a job their if you did not know somebody.   "
good,Was great when I first went to work there but as I spent more time there there philosophy became more about quantity instead of quality that’s when the job took a downturn
good,"Safe working environment for workers, many days spent working over time. Good pay. Decent benefits. Many opportunities for growth or change within the company."
good,"Nice people to work with, and will often do what they can to help you in your job."
good,"Only worked there for a few weeks, on 3rd shift, but you were sometimes sent home early with less than 40/hr per week. Even most veteran employees think the company is going downhill. Some jobs are a good bit for difficult than others with equal pay. Starting wage is good for an entry level job. Couldn’t see myself possibly working there long term."
good,"Their is a very, very serious language barrier the company in Holland, MI. Is 80% Hispanic and only 10% speak English it makes my job very hard! If they taught English the company would have great potential everyone is nice overall"
good,"It is a good place to work. The management is fair, the salary is competitive and no day is the same.  Positions evolve quickly and and learning is fast-paced."
good,Discovered that I love working with machines . Whether filling or packing ... Honest good day's work. Great people that I got to work with. Learned a lot about keeping the clock and machinery ticking over . Felt a level of great satisfaction when targets were met .
good,"Hardest part of the job was not knowing if someone there was trying to get you fired to try to push you out the door, also working with unmotivated people that didnt complete there work load. The most enjoyable part of my job was running and maintaining my own process."
good,c'est une entreprise familial  malgré qu'il ya 700 employers
good,"Milieu des employés de production syndiqués, la paie est rendue compliquée avec les griefs fréquents, la convention collective n'est pas toujours mise en considération par les superviseurs, ce qui rend difficile et stressant de gérer la paie"
good,Great over all company to work for just management sucks lots of favoritism hours are long great pay you can move up in your position As much over time as you would like but managment makes a very easy job stressful
good,I worked 10 hrs a day on my scheduled shift but plenty of overtime.I learned how to work in all depts.very quickly because a lack of employment.Management never had a relationships with their employees unless there were meeting.You had to be self-sufficient.Stay to yourself!!!GOSSIPING IS A CANCER!!!!!But I enjoyed the free product that we were able to eat or take home once it was cleared by management.
good,I worked for kraft during the era when Heinz was acquiring Kraft. During the that time frame it was a good and enjoyable place to work. It is also an very fast-paced environment.
good,"we hadden weinig contact met mekaar tijdens de productie "
good,I would recommend working for this company only if you are single. I never had time to enjoy the financial stability I obtained from working with this company. This company does pay competitive with other local companies in the area.
good,"Once the merger happened it all went down hill, As far as I know they are still not up to compliance."
good,"Challenging work, but little opportunity for advancement.  There are only few opportunities for training and zero on-boarding.  "
good,"Culture isn't very good, but if you keep your head down and do your job everything goes pretty well.  The jobs are easy and time goes quickly if your stay busy.  Sometimes required to work 60 hours a week."
good,"Very Productive"
good,"Nice company nice people some issues as there would be for a young company, wasn’t there long I didn’t feel it was the type of role for me due to the client being quite needy and the contract had a few issues with communication and not all the processes were in place. Hopefully the new manager will be trusted enough to get the job done."
good,"Over my years here at KraftHeinz, and I have seen many changes.  I have had the opportunity, to work in various departments and have worn many hats, some at the same time.  Columbia Foods is very much a multi-cultural company, and I have worked next to many during my time with Columbia Foods.  "
good,Kraft/heinz is an overall good company. Management is questionable. Decent work environment. Highly stressful at times. Not much room for advancement.
good,"They show favoritism. Lack of material for work orders is the norm. Low morale, poor leadership and people who work there in general are usually ill tempered."
good,As long as you agree with everything management says or does and don't point out anything that their favorite people may be doing wrong your life is easy!  Independent thinkers need not apply.
good,i work at nabisco for several years until Kraft took over it was a good company to work for got along great with my co workers the sad thing is getting laid off and had to start all over looking for a new job
good,"This was the best paycheck and benefits package I have experienced to date."
good,"Like any operations job in the US today, you can't do enough to keep your corporate masters happy. The money was good, but I worked my butt off for it, off shifts, nights, weekends and holidays. Once worked 28 days in a row from June 21 thru July 21. I started a bbq on Saturdays bc I wasn't able to do it at home. No one appreciated it but the hourly employees who were in the same boat as me. Unless you want to work all the time, go into management, not operations."
good,A great place to make money and nothing else.  You won't get to spend time with your family.  Not a good place to work if your trying to raise a family.
good,The management did the best they could to help you succeed.  Overall I would say it was a nice place to work.  I was able to succeed at the job but it was not the place for me.
good,We are required to work 10 hour shift for 6 days. High production is the main objective. My assembly line meets its daily quota. Once one line goals are meet and a team member we help the next assembly line.
good,"No work life balance thye dont care anything about safety are families ,A big joke to work for Everyones says great place to work before new owners hard to believe?"
good,"Fast paced and multi faceted. Hands on experience - learn as you go - no support from management. Most co-workers great - very supportive and respectful."
good,The union environment can make things very challenging. The people are very set in their ways. Upper management does not address issues thoroughly or in a timely manner.
good,"the wages were good, the benefits good. it is a fast paced environment. It has store where you can purchase products by Kraft and Heinz and at very reasonable prices"
good,"Work 7 days awake, good coworkers and health benefits.  Union protected.  Not family oriented.  Not much room for advancement"
good,"Working from the floor up to the office has given me valuable incite and experience that has enabled me to do my current job more efficiently and effectively, I will take that experience and knowledge with me into my next endeavour. I have been very lucky to work with a great group of people over the years and that is what I will miss the most."
good,Work life balance is excellent.  Compensation fair.  Need to improve upon the culture. Job security is non existent while meritocracy is good in theory it creates a toxic environment and inhibits team building and collaboration
good,The company as a whole is okay just a few departments with management issues.  Not a lot of opportunities for advancement especially on the corporate side.  Can't go from non-union to union.
good,"Lots of top managers and supervisors released when new 51% owners mandated a very large cost of administration cut.  Lots of excellent people released quickly.  Lots of people trying to make heads or tails of who was cut.  Turned the place upside down.  Others began to leave thinking they were next.  Lots of that work was simply absorbed by hourly leaders who make lots per hour and now get lots of OT wages, and probably don't do these tasks as well or quickly as the supervisors and managers.  One has to wonder why decisions like this are made."
good,The work was easy and the people were good to work with but the management was bad. They were to goal orientated and the employees fell to waist side.
good,"This company was my first job, I got this job before i graduated from collage."
good,I am not going to be negative but our plant could be the greatest plant OM has if we were consistent.  Kraft has a great name and I believe it is a very good company to work for.
good,"Review forecasts for inventory, create and edit stock transfer orders, build optimized trucks, answer questions from fulfillment planners, work with transportation department and warehouse as it related to coordinating orders and any order issues."
good,"great place to work if you are just coming out of school. not alot of room to move up in the company. long hours ,new management tough job culture, fels like you cn not have a job at any time"
good,"not much rocket science here, watch and make sure things dont break down and keep lines filled with supplies, decent co-workers"
good,"Decent Pay and great people who are willing to work hard. Company in transition with real growing pains. I have hope that things will improve, but there is a lot of work that needs done."
good,Meet with Managers to discuss needs and up coming events.  I have  learned to deal with many customers and their specific needs to meet sales goals.
good,I started my career with Kraft Foods and learned a great deal working with more experienced professionals.  The Plant I worked at operated well.
good,I learned how to work in a lean manufacturing environment.Management sometimes was ok but could have been better.Alot of my co workers were under trained.The hardest part of the job was a lot of repetitive movements.The most enjoyable things about the job was your fellow employees
good,Physical work that included lifting 100 pound parts to machinery and light office work that included updating paperwork for state and OSHA requirments
good,Job location was very convenient to home.  Gained a lot of different job experiences over the years.  Some of them were good others were not.
good,"typical day at Kraft was that you never knew what you were doing for the day"
good,It was very cold. The management are heartless and talks to employees like children
good,"This temporary work was to present and promote new products during Easter. The company had created a new chocolate and my job was to introduce customers to their differences, advantages and price."
good,"The jobs and pay is sufficient, but management on the raw side is horrible on second shift, lots of favoritism, underhanded deeds, and very unprofessional."
good,"Fast pace work I didn't learn much besides the that I performed, and the management and co-workers were ok. the hardest part of the job was the consent lifting for 12hrs, but the most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly enviroment."
good,"14+ years driving a forklift, loading and unloading of semi trailers and cycle counter."
good,12 hour shifts genrally four on four off responsible for the smooth operation of potato deliveries from around the UK and Europe checking paper work is all correct before the loads are processed
good,A good chance for promotions. Was job security in the beginning but that has gone away in the last couple of years.
good,"Inspection of site , learnd about safety rues and policeis dat how to use safety at work place  and related documenttation, how to co ordinate wid worjers and other people, hardest part to make inderstand workers about safety policies. Completed ma work wid 0% accident."
good,"I learned procurement procedures, master data management, inventory control"
good,"You cant beat the pay, health benefits aren't very good, management and human resources aren't very helpful at all. Co-workers are good for the most part, all there for the same reason...good pay."
good,"A workday is usually a well organized affair,working for a bakery has meant a lot of attention to G.M.Ps and the management do try to interact with employees in a reasonable manner while at the same time expecting everyone to do their part to deliver the expected results for the shareholders. At the lakeshore bakery we had a diverse community where everyone learnt to live and work with cultures from all over the globe, lasting friendships were made, relationships were born and in the end we were just like a big family."
good,I liked working there but the leadership was not good and left employees searching for answers
good,"Upper management is out of touch, uncaring and makes bad decisions. Company continually makes headcount cuts at lower level jobs who actually do the work, while maintaining bloated high level corporate jobs. They get rid of the best people who carry the load in order to save money, but keep lots of people who contribute very little. Corporate decision making is slow and mcuh time and effort is wasted on changing priorities because of constantly changing marketing personnel who barely learn the business, make bad decisions, then move into a new job."
good,"The company perks are amazing however the management was terrible. Promotions are not based on your abilities but rather your popularity. Very disappointed with how shady management was. I thought Kraft would be my forever job, but they mentally wear you down."
good,"Com o trabalho efetuado na empresa, aprendi boa parte do processo de fabricação de chocolates, desde sua mistura de matéria prima até sua embalagem."
good,I enjoyed working there because the people were very nice and the environment was great.
good,"This is a well paying job, with no job security. You can work for a week and then you are laid off for 6 months, or more."
good,"people can bounce between 3 shifts and be asked to stay after shift. You end up things multiple times. Two breaks 15 and 20 min, but most people take 30 min for both."
good,"The RTE side had 2 many ""fake"" bosses. If you train someone train them the right way. And do your job right the 1st time. Teamwork just do it & be it!"
good,Management should become more involved with what's going on on the floor instead of assuming that people will come to them with all the issues out of good faith.
good,My time at kraft heinz was enjoyable but it was limited to the opportunity for progression as the company was losing drivers due to cost saving exercise. The company needs to invest into it's property to show workers some security and stability. as starting off as agency a handful of workers would have a certain attitude towards you. Day to day would be stacking and de-stacking pallets freely no racking and keeping production lines moving.
good,"The compensation is above average for the area, but management and employee moral has gone downhill in recent years. The changes have adversely affected both employee moral, and (at times) product quality."
good,"Mixing, baking and processing bread for, Stove Top, and Shake and Bake.  That was a Typical day at Kraft Hienz. We also washed and cleaned the bakery."
good,"super fast paced in some of the sections of the work area, worked with chemicals that gave my psoriasis on my body. other than that it wasnt the worse"
good,"Was a good place for me to start with good people and many learning opportunities to take advantage of, but had its down sides of the occasional bad individual or rough day."
good,"Kraft/Heinz used to be a good place to  work before Heinz took over.  When they took over, they began taking all the benefits we had like retirement, bonuses, cost of living raises....and insurance is more expensive than ever and covers less. They really don't care for the employees.....they just want more."
good,It is a balance between managers and employees. The work is physical but not to the extreme. Most employees get along and have teamwork ethics. Very high turnover rate in management so interpretations in the guide lines very.
good,Employees and food safety are second to production poundage.  Rules and policy is changed when it suits production needs and food safety falls to the wayside.
good,"KraftHeinz is a great company, however it is not for everybody.  Expectations are very high, but if you do well, they compensate you for it.  They challenge you everyday and provide opportunities for advancement.  The work-life balance is not as good as other places to work. If you can handle the meritocracy business model for the employees, then this is the place for you.  The hardest part of the job is doing more with less.  This is something that senior management embraces at KraftHeinz."
good,"Was once a wonderful company to work for in the earlier years, prior to merge with Kraft and new ownership. Since then, too many company-wide layoffs and changes within departments."
good,Hard work.  As a loader in the BBQ dept one cannot just walk away even for the restroom.  If you walk away even for a few minutes the line will run out of bottles and you will shut down production.  You start off as a temp so no paid anything or benefits.  I was there during the holidays and full time employee's received a gift package where as temps did not get anything.
good,"Heinz was a great place to work before 3G Capital purchased it.  I hope the workplace has improved, but I suspect that it has not, and its either for you or not.  I believe they seek workers out of school so they can more easily indoctrinate them."
good,When I worked there 10 years ago the company was going through a significant amount of change and has been ever since.  mM job was outsourced and they company had lost foucus on it's #1 resource - People.
good,great people to work with lots of hours if you like to work. management is not that great lots of issues with them. production people are great and lots of help from one another.
good,Can be demanding at times. The people there are long term employees. Get along great with each other. They also work well together willing to go above and beyond what is expected of them.
good,Food industry is a very productive and challenging job to perform but with willing effort and safe practices it can be done. It is very important to stay safe and be productive on every job. The food industry is a very competitive industry to be in as it is but you always have to remember that safe practices yield great products to the customer who are #1 at the end of the process.
good,"I really didn't mind working here. The bosses were pretty fair and the job itself was not difficult. The only downside was when the job was done, you were done and you left. I rarely made 40 hours a week."
good,I think Heinz is a alright place to work. The onley thing with working there is that if u want to advance in the workplace they say it goes by sinyority but it Isnot followed.
good,"Overall I've really enjoyed my time at Kraft Heinz, they've really helped me develop professionally.  However the lack of job security (you never know when another department is going to be outsourced) and the way that bonus payouts are determined have pushed me to pursue a career with a different company."
good,"j 'ai beaucoup appris au sein de Kraft Heinz, les bonnes pratiques dans le milieu industriel, santé et sécurité au travail."
good,The work us fast.  You need to be fast worker. The ti.e goes by quickly.  It doesnt seem like 10 hours have gone by.  There are many differnt jobs to do.
good,bad management to many people with clip boards not knowing what is going on short notice on overtime added job duties daily does not follow company handbook
good,"Very driven and competitive company, you will work hard and be well compensated for it.  Hardest part of job is  trying to meet Leadership's unreal expectations."
good,The people i work with are great but the management is not the best and they keep taking benefits away from the employees but not management. the swing shift is hard but having 4 days off is nice.
good,it was alot better a couple years back the new system is terrible and i know alot of others would agree.i would personally not go back to work with them.
good,"12 hour days.  "
good,"Workplace culture is the norm for most manufacturing companies. My time there allowed me to sharpen leadership, marketing, organizational, and networking skills. Excellent place to start a career."
good,"Overall I liked my job and the people I worked with and the work we/I were doing. I have no complaints other than the plant I work at is closing."
good,I enjoyed working at Heinz.  I enjoyed working with my immediate managers and coworkers.  The hardest part of this job was having to leave because of business needs.
good,Culture is difficult to work with. At plant level just by day to day interaction but at corporate level because of the corporate mantra. The business model is unsustainable and causes negative effects throughout the company. Short term is can be done but longterm it will be hard o sustain success.
good,you work 7 days a week there's days I worked 20 days in a row before having off management was horrible bounced a lot worked a lot of 12hrs got along with other workers people were nice took over my life with working so much if your single with no kids good job the people made work easy and fast
good,Kraft was a great place to work prior to Heinz taking over.  It went down hill form there as they came in and cut a lot of jobs. Was not there long as job eliminate with Heinz takeover.
good,"A typical work day was to over see equipment operation and to repair equipment upon failure, pm equipment and start up and tear down of production equipment for sanitation cleaning procedures."
good,Nice management team but low advancement opportunities. Very fast paced work environment in a predominantly production setting with a very flexible work day
good,Fast paced environment that requires management of many different responsibilities.  This place has undergone several severe changes since the merger with Heinz.
good,"Union based jobs in production or warehouse.  Seniority based for preferred shift/role.  Tons of overtime, 16 hour shifts, and saturdays and sundays."
good,"great entry level, over worked and underpaid."
good,"Kraft Foods was a great place to work for 16 1/2 years of my 17 1/2 year tenure.      Once purchase by 3G, Kraft Foods was no longer the same company."
good,"Devido ser uma empresa comercial de porte pequeno , talvez essa seria a deficiência em melhorar cargos para o funcionário."
good,"Worked from home office so I was able to maintain a flexible schedule. Job was challenging and moved at a good pace."
good,"working at kraft was a high paced challenging job, my day consisted of meeting production goals, and managing people. best part of my job was meeting production and making money for the team and the company."
good,"As an intern I enjoyed the exposure that working at a major CPG like Kraft provided me.  I learned a lot, and had a lot of great exposure to the senior leadership.  Ultimately I decided not to go back after my summer because it just wasn't for me."
good,"Work environment changed from positive to challenging.  "
good,Kraft could be a really great place to work if you could actually bring home the money you earn. I think it's wrong for that company to force you into the 401k @ 6 % of your pay
good,"Хаинц,в принципе нормальная компания,но я работала на территории Ленты и вот там меня не устроила политика и правила их компании!!"
good,"Typical day at work was to run my machine, analyze why my machine jams, fix the machine, write down weights, count on skid, and complete orders"
good,"A typical day consist of working 9-10 hours a day, with a lot of repetitive lifting of boxes."
good,The new management team 3G has a different management style which embraces management business objectives and holds people accountable to those objectives/goals.  A typical day begins with monitoring key metrics daily across the supply chain and understanding what went wrong if metrics are missed for that particular day's business
good,"pas de sécurité d'emploi, un poste à temps partiel m'avait été promis lors de l'embauche mais due au remaniement admistratif on ma laisser partir."
good,"With the Heinz merger, morale is low at the former Kraft sites.  Lots of layoffs and cost cutting is hard to stomach for current employees but probably not a deal breaker for new employees."
good,"Change in leadership has made the environment competitive and fear based. Not right for all, but the right individuals with will flourish and have unlimited growth potential."
good,This is the place to be if someone wants to add value to the company & to learn at the same time. Offers flex hours with good benefits.
good,still learning the new company.  Heinz purchased Kraft and became KraftHeinz Company.   There are many good changes as you can imagine when a company buys another.
good,"Picking pallets with a fork truck and stacking items on to pallets to be shipped out. Learned how to drive a fork lift. Management is very rude and lazy. They will often abuse their authority and even laugh at you to your face when they force over time. Sometimes they will call you in to work with out giving you enough rest time between shifts and threaten your job if you don't come in. Co workers are very friendly, they really stick together and help each other. the hardest part is working 12 days everyday often 6 to 7 days a week. Swing shifts make it impossible to have a sleep schedule. Payed very well and you always stay busy."
good,"A typical day at work would be paying bills, clearing post audits and deduction, and mainly maintaining the responsibilities on the assigned account."
good,olha vivenciei bons momentos dentro desta empresa relacionando com colegas supervisores e gerentes um bom relacionamento profissional e pessoal nos quatro anos que la passei.
good,"Great Team to work and good manager as Mentor"
good,A typical day requires strong collaboration with coworkers. This is key due to the interdependence placed upon each team. The biggest cons of this job are the long hours and the overtime.
good,mala puntuacion para  los encargados. y por parte de la empresa revisar con el departamento de RR.HH la valoracion del cargo que desenpeñan .por que al trabajador se tiene que tratar mejor por parte de estos y no porque lleven años en el puesto se crean superiores los tiempos cambian y la empresa debe valorar desde el gerente al simple operario
good,I learned here that I did not want to pursue a career in sales. No flexibility in this division at the company.
good,Working at Kraft was a full time job in the summers between University. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently because everyone on the production line was dependent on everyone else. I picked up and packed cookies into chutes as it was coming out of an oven down a production line. Noticing quality issues with baked goods and on packaging was a big part of the job.
good,Kraft Foods provided me the insights into Food Service and CPG expanding my skills across sales and category management.  Building upon my learning at Kraft to expand my career and knowledge.
good,"Great place to start your career. Provides good process insights."
good,"Working for these guys was great. The Supervisors were excellent, and did a great job with communicating. The only thing lacking was hours and compensation"
good,"As a senior sales service representative I was responsible for taking care of the cookie and cracker isle for our customers.  I covered the territories of sales reps while they were on vacation.  As a SSR you are responsible for the ordering and merchandising of all Kraft food products.  There is a lot of travel though, expect around 75-80%."
good,"Ensure easy work flow for VP"
good,Typical day is going from supermarket to supermarket writing orders/selling displays(getting degraded by angry people who hate their jobs). Working your fingers to the bone by filling shelves and building displays. I learned that money isn't worth unhappiness. My co-workers were cool but you didn't see them often due to working independently. Hardest part of the job was going everyday. Most people that you have to deal with in this business are miserable ego maniacs. Most enjoyable part was meeting some nice people(non-management) in the supermarkets.
good,"Kraft, like other companies, has hired a 3PL to outsource non-generating revenue jobs."
good,"Maintenance manager oversaw all of maintenance activities, also parts inventory."
good,"Work days are long and tiring with short breaks. I learned how to tolerate the coldness of a work place and how to deal with more than 10 coworkers. Some of the supervisors are not what i thought they would be.  Long as they are getting paid, thats all they care about in some cases. The hardest part of the job is having to work through pain or having to wait on a line tech to come and release you off the line to take pain killers or go to First Aid. Some days, everything will run smooth. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get the time to eat something and when you are able to get in your car to go home and relax your body."
good,"I learned about Food Processing which entailed training in HACCP, and CCP points.  I learned about CFIA paperwork and the importance it carried to the overall production and accountability to the CFIA."
good,al poner en practica mis habilidades como vendedora pude obtener beneficios como estabilidad laboral
good,heinz were a good company to work for but are no longer in business
good,Productive and for the most part had good attitudes. Just wish they didn't alternate and could have the same one at all times and not get shifted around.
good,"Buen trato tanto entre los operarios y mis superiores, he aprendido el funcionamiento de varias secciones, los compañeros son muy agradables."
good,"The dimensions of the job that I most enjoyed were:"
good,"New Management causing lots of turnover, uncertainty and angst.  Tough environment to work in; lots of hours and lack of oversight."
good,"Não sei como responder, mas serei breve. A Empresa e seu benefícios são excelentes, mas a equipe coordenadora, apesar de serem experientes no assunto dep rodução, não conhecem a prática, dificultando nosso trabalho. Ao colocarem lideres novos, queriam mostrar serviço a gerência. Não tiro a razão, mas acho que deveriam de andar com os operadores e observar o porque das máquinas quebrarem e não pressionarem o funcionário. São muitas entradas de funcionário e saída. "
good,weighing out ingredients and cooking and mixing.I learned how to weigh and use measurement devices.Co-workers were ok some people would help you if you needed help.Hardest part was just working the long hours under heat conditions that were unbearable at time and wit hthe long hours no free time in your life.The menjoyable part was learning somthing new and actually having a job
good,"Meeting my distributors. Calling and reviewing the performance of front line team , gunning for targets."
good,"Aprendi muitas coisa boas durante 1 ano e 5 meses que estive lá, o trbalho é tranquilo as pessoas são amistosa em relação a trabalho, ha bastante treinamento e  asssistencia integral por pater da gerncia e supervisores,a hora mais dificil era na hora da limpeza de linha onde tinha que lavar todas as maquinas e corredores. Levava o periodo todo. A refeição era boa e farta, sempre tinha eventos."
good,a job in the big world sometimes fun sometimes not so much fun job to pay the bills
good,"Reported to warehouse manager, took attendance, reviewed equipment availability with mechanics, and reviewed the shipping schedule."
good,Good company to work for. Hard to balance work and personal life but it is doable.
good,Needs stronger commitment to change and innovation. Communication is lacking at all levels. Poor morale at all levels. Larger organizational goals tend to be short sighted.
good,"Heinz is a great company to work for. The atmosphere is laid back, and the employees get along . Management is there to listen to any issues, and they are open to new suggestions. The hardest part of the job is getting there. I love my job it's not hard and it's stimulating."
good,"Lack work life balance, even though they talk about it management does not always provide"
good,era muy buena la estabilidad y el sueldo pero el trato de jefe y empleado no era bueno eso es lo que me llevo a renunciar
good,Work hard everyday and they still not happy with your work. They do give you 3 good days of in a week.
good,Not enough work. Get laid off a lot.
good,Competitive and a great work experience.  My supervisor was very knowledgeable and I learned a lot about the Dairy industry.  It takes a very dedicated individual to work here.
good,"May be great for others, just no longer fits my career interests. I can only speak for my location as this company has global locations for employment opportunities."
good,"Good benefits, if you love to work all the time without knowing what time to get off then this the job for you.. one thing I will say is that Kraft does give back to their workers and show them a little appreciation sometimes."
good,Ok friendly workers. ...Good benefits....Meet new people from all over....Hate they let mini shift go....It was convenient for alot of people with children.
good,Good place to work and perhaps retirement. Dont like 5he point system but for the most part its a decent job. Up on time and in to work early is very necessary to a good stay at your production i follow all rules as in structed i work regular not speedy for sasafety is always f
good,"Cost of living in Chicago is very high, so you end up living far and having long commutes to work. On top of that you add several extra hours per week on an very result oriented environment."
good,"Difficult for first 3 yrs, then it gets better. Only incentive is your paycheck. This review is naking me mad...kind of like management at heinz...never enough..."
good,I was hired on as a part-time maintenance technician. I really enjoy the fast pace environment and being able to troubleshoot and figure out what is wrong as fast as possible.
good,"great place to work for during my young years of youth, i glad a great experience working for them as full time employee right after high school.i would recoomend it to anyone seeking work."
good,Conduct huddle meeting at start of shift will all staff and break out into DDS meeting. Monitor production and troubleshooting any mechanical issues and dispatch maintenance or electrical. Fills out daily pre shift safety walk thru and MSW along with detailed daily shift reports
good,"As this is my first experience in Gulf Countries under the field of Supply Chain, I have gained  a lot of new learnings and experiences that helps me to grow in this field."
good,"Depuis la fusion de Kraft et Heinz, la culture de l'entreprise n'est plus aussi bonne, uniquement basé sur les profits et les couts diminuer au maximum, pas tres bon pour une usine alimentaire."
good,"I had a data entry position.  They told me what to do and let me do my thing.  I had to wear a bump cap, ear plugs, and hair net on my way to the office, but not in the office."
good,I really have nothing to say but Kraft should appreciate their workers more then they do. Should understand that people have families jus like them and we cant always be at work...i lost my job there cuz i had 2 be a mother first but when u have no one in your corner to back you up nothing matters
good,"Productive and fun place to work everybody was very helpful in explaining the job duties."
good,A typical day is the mostly same day in and day out. I learned how to effectively communicate with production supervisors to let them know everything that was going on. The hours are long and unpredictable sometimes as it is a food industry.
good,"Responsibilities included Identifying the task definition, Stakeholders and participating department representatives. "
good,"Challenging environment with long hours, there is a lot of turnover but overall employees are treated nicely. A lot of room for growth right off the bat."
good,"Job is very easy work hours are flex , day off is different day every week. You need a lot of energy to work there. Company always have  fun event for employee"
good,Heinz was a good company until 3G Capital became owner in 2013. They want to cut costs everywhere and the practice is hurting the company ability to function.
good,"Lots of work to do just not much regular time to work on it. Short staffed in all areas and now new people coming in to work. Good pay, benefits and some of the people are good to work with."
good,I started on the line. I work my way up to maintenance and took care of the line. and cleaned the line help them run the line work overtime when i could.
good,"One of the issues i found while working at Kraft Heinz was that some of the management individuals were not genuine. In order to be great at your business you have to ensure that your employees have the same mission that you have. One of the things I found was that my immediate supervisor and plant manager had a different agenda. They were more concerned about not being fired by Bernardo than actually focusing on ensuring the plant was performing at its upmost best. I never did understood that analogy. I hated to see indviduals sit around and ponder if they were in the chopping block. Life is to short to be worried about being chopped. I think that when you are in a situation that you have to worry about that everyday, you spend more time trying to remedy that than actually focus on the improvement of your everyday business. That was my observation.. Needless to say i just couldn't stay around observing that. I started to get anxious everyday about everything. My ideas or input were never heard, well lets get real, no one's was heard. Sad but true...."
good,"KraftHeinz has been a great employer to me and given me a lot of opportunity to grow. Being alone in the field every day gives plenty of autonomy to run your portion of the business as you like. It taught me how to stay organized, be prepared and develop in person relationships that are necessary in outside sales."
good,"I started my career at Kraft so this may not be the best review.  Great managers to help me launch my career,  So happy to start with such a family friendly company.  I was 19 at the time."
good,leads go  back and fourth no one knows nothing sometimes and they hardly want you take vacation  time  or when your sick dont want to mto you want you work around food with a fever and  want yo not to go to bathroom if you have diarrhea want you to keep working and bath room is not close by its on the other side of building
good,"I was there for about 3 years and the work place was alright, steady hours till the weekend and had to work 12 hours. managment was okay some people got special treatment because they were there longer."
good,Work hard and lots of extra time put in. Work environment so so.  Pay moderate to competing companies.  Benefits are good.  Moderate turn over.  Advancement opportunities moderate.
good,It was a great job to work for. had many different challenges. but overall i would say it was a great work experince thus far.I was at the company for 4 years.
good,"Maintenance Mechanic"
good,"fast pace, good pay, management willing to help, clean place to work. hours are not bad. Family oriented, understanding. good benefits once hired on as a full time emloyee"
good,the good part was the salary. hard part was the cold inside and the night shift. I learned how to package stuff. there not free lunch there and the breaks was a little bit long. it is a good place to work.
good,I never worked for Kraft - only worked for General Foods Corporation which was purchased by Kraft.  I have no feedback about Kraft because I never worked for them.
good,"Employment was contract during a difficult transition period, when most of the departments were relocating to Illinois or being phased out due to buyout.  Culture was stressful for those that were pending elimination or relocation of their positions."
good,It was a company that was under a lot of change while I was there so it was a little disorganized.  I was there for a short period so I doubt it was like that all the time.
good,I worked at Kraft Nabisco for a while as a merchandiser and it was an pretty flexible position I enjoyed going to different stores and Merchandising your product. Sometimes got free stuff that was outdated
good,I really enjoyed my time at Kraft. A great group of people to work with.  I would still be there if I didn't relocate for personal reasons.  I highly recommend this company.
good,Much of my position is working to develop programs and then to make sure those programs are being followed by all of the employees.  You work with a variety of personalities.  No two days are the same.  Sometimes required after hours work due to special situations or projects.
good,"I did not like the way the new owners ran things, so I left.  I'd prefer not to share more than that, I don't actually want to answer these questions at all as they are not relevant."
good,"work as 3 people, all departments understaffed and too many mgmt turnover to keep what actually works for production and too many new ideas trying to prove something and making peformance of the company suffer."
good,No longer an employee moved from location for family commitment over ten years past company was acceptable. My review would be outdated if posted. Thank you

good,"Been too long to comment.  "
good,"Durante mi período en el cual trabaje en Kraft, luego Mondelez, puedo decir que es una gran companía internacional, lider en el mercado alimenticio.

good,"bon salaire , bonne équipe de travail mais discrimination"
good,"During my tenure with Heinz , I was able to work in three different divisions which gave me a lot of experience going forward in my career. "
good,It wasn't the best job. I'm not sure if it has changed but was mandated to work 72 hours a week most weeks. The production line is kept cold for sanitation reasons. Plenty of breaks were given to make up for the long shift and time on your feet.
good,"Kraft Foods was a good company to work for.  They were combined with another company - new management took over and they moved one of their corporate offices to the Chicago location, moving my position with it."
good,"repaired high-speed mechanical drives, hydraulics, and both pneumatic and electronically controlled systems. Read blueprints and maintained pumps, fans, and gearboxes."
good,Working with a great group of people to complete a task.everyone doing there part and then some however due to the uncertainty decision making  of a management / corporate staff at times lowers moral. This fourth  causing a disconnect between production staff and salaried staff.making the environment feel more like just a job and this becomes the attitudes of those that keep the company growing and profiting.
good,I was a supervisor here with good pay and great work environment ethics. It was a manufacture company and management was good the owner of the company was a man with desire and enjoyed working for the people and helping them out.
good,"Lack of professionalism and advancement. Worked here for several years and it was ok to pay the bills, but not for a long term career choice for anyone that has any serious goals"
good,"It was an ok place to work a typical day was hot and fast paced off and on, hardest part of the job was the drive to work and long weekend hours......."
good,A decent place to work and is local and involved in the community. A major drop in production in the best couple of years. Management is unorganized and don't always follow polices.
good,"Pays okay job , different shift options, lots of opportunity to advance, strict tardy policy, lay pack work environment. Females have complained about a lot of unwanted advances by coworkers and leadership"
good,"Kraft was a good place to work and I was the local sales person, calling on their #1 customer (Golub Corporation).  They were the leading brand in almost every category they competed in, and they were well received by the customers."
good,"The workplace needs better managerial people working there.Limited parking. Unreliable , unsupervised shifts. Consistent unreported accidents. Wrongful terminations."
good,This was really good campaign actually my first campaign I️ worked for@pfs. The bag coffee was great had over 150 different flavors for Gevaila. Tassimo was more of your k-cups like Keurig instead they were called t-disc.

good,"I worked there for 25 years,for the most part enjoyed it . a lot of good employees . they sent me to a lot of different classes to help advance my maintenance skills."
good,"I was let go after 13 years as Kraft and Heinz merged - reduction in sales force! Called on food service distributors, chain accounts, large independent restaurants, non- commercial acounts ( hospitals, retirement communities, assisted living)..."
good,Working there was stressful at times. Believe the compensation should have been more for the type of job that was performed. Hours and benefits were good.
good,I worked with a good group of people that knew their jobs well and had varied skill sets. Management was fair and attentive. There were numerous company outings and team building exercises. The hardest part about the job was learning the many detailed processes in a somewhat harsh environment. The most enjoyable thing was numerous good people i had the pleasure of working with.
good,oportunidad de aprender a manejar la maquinaria y equipos
good,Working on a high speed production line for a food product line. Keep the high speed line moving to keep the production going. Check the products for quality.
good,"Greenroom meetings are held fifteen minutes prior to shift change to discuss how lines were running the previous shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is how quickly time passes because you are busy throughout the entire shift.  For the most part, it's a wonderful place to work, as long as you keep to yourself."
good,"My Global IT team was a great group to work with, smart and energetic people.  Since the merger with Heinz and 3G, it was a rough company to work for with the continual downsizing."
good,"This merger in 2015 resulted in our Allentown, PA plant closure in 2016. Was not happy about that merger and the outcome. Kraft and our plant location were a great place to work for most of my time with them."
good,"The people are friendly and helpful. Jobs are fast paced and lots of lifting, bending,twisting. You are not really trained well kind of by yourself asking lots of questions and watching . Tons of forced overtime at different start times sometimes."
good,While I was at Kraft it was a good place to work. I worked on projects that advanced my career. Management was aware of my career goals and assigned me projects that supported those goals.
good,The pay was great and the job wasn't bad if you don't mind a hot factory. The only issue I had was with a few of the managers. Some of them were pretty unprofessional and rude for no reason.
good,"nao temos suporte devido dos supervisores e vendedores,atrasam toda semana o vt e vr,nao pagam recisao"
good,traveling from ridge-way to newberry was already a long drive but to drive there and get sent home because your line isn't running that is reliable at all.
good,Kraft Heinz is a cold work environment temps around 34 degrees or lower. You must dress in layers cold and wet it is a turkey process.This job pay starts at 11.20 per hour.
good,A very busy place to work. I work six days a week and the job can be very stressful. The supervisors really push you to get the most out the employee in a day. Not much time off.
good,"I believe a lot has changed since the merger but Heinz used to be a great place to work.  People were innovative, helpful, smart and the management encouraged that."
good,"lios promotores casi se la pasan de tienda en tienda y conoces promotores de otros tiemdas,"
good,productive work environment. not very clean atmosphere to work. Old machines.Employees are working hard and long shifts. Overall its needs to be clean and need some modern machines.
good,12 hr days 7 days a week during green season -si summer the company is not conserned with the well being of highered in employees. It's easy to move up on the floor because they don't keep employees long.
good,Satisfied with current compensation and benefits.  Room for improvement across the entire organization.  A typical day at work is usually busy and packed with meetings.
good,"Company Environment is good , Its more process oriented, always finding more cost effective service with in limited source i.e. good learning, workplace and environment is good , working our departmental environment is good experience during my tuner."
good,"Fast paced environment where you are given opportunities to be challenged on a daily basis to perform well in a job role above your current position.  A technician would be given an opportunity to develop into a senior technician by performing some of the senior technician's job duties in addition to their current responsibilities.  This also applies at a managerial level as well, where the lead is developed to a supervisor, who gets developed to a manager, and so forth."
good,"Unorganized and chaotic place to work. Many aspects unsafe and full of negativity and workplace gossip. Wages were good, yet they did not adhere to standards of practice."
good,Climate is changing for this company.  Its a great place to work to get some experience but not a place for longevity. Since these two companies merge in 2015 changes are happening all the time.
good,"It's a job but not a place you will be able to advance anymore.  The business structure has changed where they don't promote from within much."
good,"Pros:"

good,The management is decent. it a great experience. the hardest part is getting use to the rotating shifts. i learned that sanitation is very important. The most enjoyable part is the culture and meeting different people
good,"Very unorganized job. The people are good people but far the job, very unhelpful. Fast paced and overtime alot even on holidays."
good,"The most recent change to Kraft with the acquisition by Heinz has left a different company.  Not better, not worse, just different. Some people would say that the legacy Kraft people were resistant to change however they don't really understand the change that Kraft has gone through in the last 30 years.  The legacy Kraft family was an incredible mix of talent but without their own foibles."
good,"I deal with the admin side of things, getting involved with projects"
good,It was a good place to work great opportunities to succeed thereally was a lot of overtime if you don't mind cold environment and the people were friendly
good,"Third party logistics was the only problem I had here. After working there for  3 years ."
good,This was a part time job.  But working more hours then allowed was something you constantly had to do.  But you only got a base pay per month so nothing extra in your checks for extra work.  Holiday times were the most difficult long days and nights.

good,"It's a busy and big plant where people are always stressed, including the management. The co workers are helpful. The hardest part of the  job is get any support for your activities."
good,making the best of your day with outdated equipment in BBQ. attendance policy very elementary school. scheduling is a work in progress. production operators are scape goats for misc/varying mistakes made from purchasing to shipping. policies more important than people or production.
good,i learned how operate different types of machinery in the pizza making process and line operation.  I learned how to deal with thing in a more professional environment
good,The company was great to work for when it was family owned. I have only heard negative comments after they were brought out.
good,Ive worked there for 7 months and all i can say is that the supervisors ive had think that they know what they are doing but they come into our department with only the college degree getting them the job and they think they know the best way to do everything. The supervisors that ive come across have a inability to lead correctly.
good,Ran the blanching/roasting cooker. Worked the night shift.. 4 days on 3 days off. was responsible for thousands of pounds of peanuts produced.
good,status quo type of job. slower paced. steady job for those going to school or wanting average work. Work force is partial union and non union

good,Great co-workers to work with and love how there is good team work....great compony to work for and like how we work as a team to get the job done
good,"Kraft and the people there were very good to me.  I enjoyed the the people I worked with.  The administrative work makes it hard to have time to sell and hard to have good work life balance.  Expect to be a jack of all trades, master of none."
good,"I have worked at Kraft for 6+ years. Was amazing until 3G and austerity hit. Tons of layoffs, Bernado's face on every email, cut programs. Very demotivating."
good,"Work 50 hours a week min."

good,"I worked here for two summers during college.  It was fun, and I was able to taste test tons of food.  I like cooking in the industrial kitchens"
good,"Great company to work for however, there may be a shift in culture, that will impact most groups due to the recent merger."
good,Excellent company to work for before the merger with Heinz.  Lot of folks will be loosing their jobs becuase of this.  There are a few share holders which keep playing with Kraft and Mondelez as they want more and more returns.  This means they will sacrifice anything or anyone to achieve those results.  Other than that its a great company  to work for.
good,Kraft has been a great place to work but I am not sure what is coming.  I fear there are many cuts to come.  Work life balance is nice but the pay is a little low for the industry.
good,Could be a career job if you work hard. get lots of hours and if you work hard you might even get a bonus check for xmas. union job. Will force you 6 days aweek 10 hour days
good,My co-workers are very friendly and helpful. There usually is a lot of free food...which can be both very good and very bad.

good,"I was a sales Merchandiser"
good,"scanning and moving pallets, helping out on the production line.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management that has favorites and allows certain people to get away with certain things.

good,"Throughout my Kraft career I have demonstrated an exceptional facility for meeting organizational objectives and demands.  I feel my skills, and quick learning abilities  greatly benefit their organization in achieving their goals. I greatly enjoyed and appreciate the opportunity that  mamagement gave me to become an asset to Kraft organization.  "
good,It is a great priviledge working for this organization. I gained lots of usefull work experience.
good,"Étant cariste et manipulateur de marchandise sur les chaînes de montages, une journée typique se voyait à l'approvisionnement des lignes. Il n'y avait presque aucune opportunités de développement car c'était des emplois étudiants donc temporaires. Mon premier été fût très bien côté management, mon chef d'équipe était super ainsi que mon superviseur. Cependant l'été d'après j'ai hérité d'un superviseur nouveau en poste en quête de vouloir faire ses preuves. Cela est une situation compréhensible cependant cela a amené beaucoup de frictions et de résistance à l'intérieur de l'équipe. Ce deuxième été fût sans aucun doute moins agréable. L'aspect le plus difficile fût de s'adapter à ce nouveau superviseur tandis que le plus agréable fût certainement l'ambiance de travail et les relations interpersonnelles que j'ai pu y développer."
good,Quality is very important for the product produced. You also have to be very efficient and frugal.
good,During my time at Kraft I was given the opportunities to build the solid  foundation needed to manage businesses.  Learning the daily tasks and details that go into the over all picture provided me with an understanding of what I was asking the team to take on in my future roles.

The people who I work for and with are very good natured, however in the ever competitive world food market; changes are constant and not really handled or planned very well, ready aim fire mentality most of the time."
good,"Production workers manage the process of tending to manual or automated equipment in a production process operation. They perform functions as described by organizational instructions, operating the specified equipment or following production procedures as instructed."
good,"They is all about work work, work! The co-workers don't get a long all the time.That's on management."

good,a lot of laying off.when working plenty of work.union based job.
good,"A typical day at work I am collecting and analyzing data. Entering data into Excel, Minitab or Qeystone to obtain graphs and results of the data. I have learned various processes here, how to work with others, improve processes, document/train/aduit improvements. My co-workers are pleasant to work with for the most part. A lot of them are not opposed change. The hardest part is getting people to see change isn't bad and that we are not wasting your time. The most enjoyable part is helping others."
good,Mooi project en goede collega's waar ik veel van food processen  heb geleerd
good,Enjoyed meeting a variaty of people and being in different stores.
good,Saber atender a un cliente para no perder la clientela y se aprende a saber las nesecidades de un cliente el trato en la empresa era bueno y los compañeros que tenian mayor tiempo siempre trataron de ayudar a los demas y lo mas complicado creo q fue saber llegar a un cliente cuando no esta conforme con algun perdido o una promocion pero depende de nosotros saber darle la mayor de las comodidades.
good,I was working in offshore for Kraft Foods. So I didn't contact with many Kraft actual staff. Most of the managers are good. And they look like with not much pressure.
good,Nice and good with a handful of flaws. Most co-workers are motivating and helpful. Management is ok. Work/Life balance is horrible
good,bueno
good,just a night at work kinda boring do not like plant work but needed a job
good,"I am very glad I was only on a temporary assignment here. The work schedule for the Kraft employees was grueling and very often unpredictable. Your work hours could change for the next day and you were expected to comply with little notice. My task was relatively straightforward, but there were times when I was unable to perform my assigned task and I went in search of something else to do."
good,have to be constanly moving this is a plant that runs 24/7 so ur always doing somthing and the hours are long 12 hour shifts.
good,"Kraft Foods was one of the best, but no longer. If you are looking for Work balance do not work here."
good,"De uma forma geral, uma excelente empresa, mas minha experiência pessoal não fui muito boa; Minha saída da empresa não teve uma justificativa lógica, e me senti usado;"
good,"I enjoy the management team, although the pace at this job is sometimes slow. Would like to be a position where I am taking on more tasks and responsibilities."
good,"Start early, communicate with customers(fun part of job), talk of work life balance is not always what it should be and who you report to will make or break how well the ""team"" is involves together."
good,Good Pittsburgh company. Good people. Very nice place to work in downtown.
good,Company was too difficult to work for. They made too many changes too often. Never new where I stood or even if they valued me at all. Co-workers were great to work with. Management was less experienced than I was at managing. I did like the work/life balance and overall compensation.
good,I enjoyed the time I worked with this company. Management was great to work for.
good,Good company but not a lot of room for advancement. Management staff could have been stronger.
good,Kraft gave me the ability to learn about posting payments and the behind the scence work of a large corporation.
good,"Great place to work,  if you like the tough physical labor of a plant, it's not easy but if you stick to your wits you should be good. Most of the m were really nice too"
good,I really loved this job at first.. the hours they worked and no telleing when u was gone get off what made me  not like it anymore.the no set time had made it hard to do or plan other things. otrher than that it was ok.
good,"Lots of changes since Heinz merged. Benefits were reduced no more annual bonuses, change in the management and environment became more stressful. Plus no more pension just 401-k."
good,my job at Kraft Heinz is ok. Pay is fair. The end of year is a cut back in hours. The work is fast paced and requires you be on time. The job in cold and wet too.
good,working at Kraft is a lot of over time it could burn you out at times the work is really easy some times they make you work over without asking you too some  people have a real life out side of Kraft I don't like when they only think about numbers some times we work  six days without being off when they are trying to meet theirs number and not think  about us as workers
good,Production based atmosphere and very self manageable with little supervision unless your working on the line. Flexible shift opportunities with lots of overtime.
good,Alot of flaws with pay system an value of workers. Would be better if employees supervisor managers an other leaders would come together an actually listen to each other to make kraft a better work place
good,"I don't like working at Kraft Heinz they don't pay enough money they work us six days 12 hour shifts we don't have time for our family we are on the point system that we can't miss days if we do we lose have a job we go in at 6:30 in the morning it might be 6:30 in the morning it my be 6:30,7:30 are 8: 30 are nine before we get off and I live in Greenwood have to get home at different times and don't have a good 8 hours between our shift and we have to get up and go right back down there road so we don't have time for our life our family our kids our grandkids or no one else I think it's time for me to find a new career so I can work my last 10 and 1/2 years out somewhere where I can be comfortable and stress-free"
good,"Good place if you dont have a family life. Too much overtime and under staffed, but overall has great pay and they pay weekly .if you work in kitchen department it's very hot"
good,Not the worst company but it definitely needs to go back to the way it used to be. Lack of communication and lack of accountability is the worst part of this place. Pay is extremely good.
good,"never Got Promoted and Hired On As Promised, 6 months, Bid on Jobs, Only to Be told ""its Not in The Budget"""
good,Hardest part of working at Kraft was watching it it be torn down and apart and the culture change. It became competitive to a negative level and the growth it was experiencing became stagnant.
good,I monitored the product from the plant to the store for on time delivery. This was done by building relationships with internal and external customers.
good,was fun place to work pay was good benefits was excellent learn how to use rf scanner learn use palletterize machine good vacation time the people was great
good,"Goals drive actions, decisions and behaviors. This can be good and inspiring, until there are conflicting priorities. Then ideally management and leaders help resolve, but sometimes it leads to churn and miscommunication. "
good,Company provided training required to do your job.    Hours were flexible if you had appointments or had to take care of a sick family member.    Managers were good to work for.
good,"Lieu très propre, bien aménagé."
good,"Les tâches à accomplir étaient très variées. Certaines se passaient dans la salle de contrôle avec plusieurs ordinateurs pour contrôler les multiples paramètres de prodution, et d'autres sur le plancher pour faire du lavage manuel et des branchements pour les divers systèmes automatisés de lavage."
good,"This was the previous Heinz (Ore-Ida) many many years ago.  It has since changed management and all my friends that work there have nothing good to say about the place, management or anything.  The wages are decent but only because of a union agreement."
good,"Very cold, fast pace, hand get cold fast .  Over all good work place just the rotating ever week ,so you work 7-3  ,3-11, 11-7. So you have to be adjustable..."
good,"good place to work - fast pace, family oriented within peers. Culture was very family oriented especially within our hourly population. Union company."
good,"I enjoyed what I was doing there, enjoyed working with the strategic planning, program development and project management.  While I was there (Kraft), it was a great place to work - very family friendly and a good work/life balance.  Everything changed when Heinz came in and took over.  Even projects which were still in the concept phase were scrutinized and order of magnitude scope were expected to be the project cost.  There was no longer any contingency.  I was laid off by phone by two people - one from HR, one from Management - that I'd never met.  It was cold, impersonal, and completely lacked respect for the individuals being laid off.  Between August and October, 7000 mostly Kraft employees were laid off."
good,Good experience with the challenging with developing new structure organizational with adding the quality improvement and cleaning and sanitation scope in my responsibility.
good,"Good workplace,career and team work. Many challenging to improve food safety and quality facilities to improve high standard in our factory. Good experienced in many project and developing co-packer factory."
good,"Fast pace,quick discussions, short break and hard work without the right pay.I enjoy when I its time to go home for I can talk with a few of co workers"
good,"Ambiente lavorativo poco stimolante, con scarse novità relative al prodotto,Brand storico presente da molti decenni sul mercato ma ormai poco valorizzato con conseguente minimo investimento sulla linea."
good,"I enjoy my job but sometimes the environment can come off as a messy place to be. Many employees come to work only not to do any work and make other employees, who are actually here to work, job harder than it needs to be."
good,"On a typical day at work i will go to a area that is in need of help, i will assist the area mechanics with their day to day maintenance and help with production coverage and any other tasks that need attention"
good,The typical work day is fast past with no work life balance stressful. work is always changing for day to day. Managers don't have time to come out and work with you in the field
good,"I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers at this company and was fortunate enough to advance while there. However, it was hard to ""fit in"" with management and as a result would often worry about job security. The management team is a close knit group and enjoy doing things together such as going to lunch once a week and taking off early once a week to meet at the golf course. It was nice to see a group that enjoyed camaraderie, but not at the expense of making others feel like outcasts. There also seemed to be a lack of loyalty for long term employees resulting in a high employee turn-over rate. The company will often down-size a department or do a complete resturcture and layoff hard working employees. This results in a lack of trust by other employees and creates a not-so-fun environment to work in."
good,"If your looking for a job that pays well and nothing more. Its probably the best bet for people who want overtime and just like to make money, for the single and no children"
good,Collecting data. Management was great and very supportive. Supportive HR department and staff. Good working environment. Most enjoyable part of the job was working for this company.
good,Monday mornings we would come in and do a cold startup to get the wine ready product I learned that every job isn't easy but when we'd started up everybody was happy
good,Job security is not their best anymore. Good pay for what you do. Environment to work is very comfortable. Retirement benefit were really good but health care benefits were decreasing with the years.
good,In general liked work for the company. The biggest thing is the unknown of whether or not the plant or management staff is around today or tomorrow with all the cuts constantly going on.
good,"Worked with great, hardworking and loyal people in my many years of service here.  The people at the Madison location always made working at this location a wonderful experience and made the days and years go by quickly."
good,"I learned to communicate better with people due to fact when i first started i was shy. Now i'm more active and in control. Management will give you a 2nd chance before they give you a first chance. Its hard to move up in the company. The hardest part is making money being on second if you have small kids because you cant get your hours, but first is pretty awesome with 40hr or more at 13.00 a hr."
good,Ik had een functie waar ik met een telefoon reed en grondstoffen aanleverde bij keukens en productielijnen.
good,"After over 100 years in operation, nearly of 30 of which were under Kraft ownership, cost cutting by 3G (Heinz) eliminated my entire facility."
good,"I like working for this company, for the most part. The only downfall is the position is overnights, and that has started to take a toll on my personal and academic life."
good,They put you on different shifts and you only know what your working the next day at 1pm the day before. So u cant plan anything or really have any planned family time. Not good. The benefits and pay is good and the workers are great but management is all about numbers.
good,"I loved working here at first.  When I hired in I was told I would be working every other Friday and Saturday nights.  Theses would be 8hr shifts but some times may be 12 hr shifts.  That was something I was willing to do for a little extra income( I had another job on first shift Monday-Friday). We were mandate to work every weekend because of the short staff. Towards the end it was also 12hr Saturdays. In the 1year I work there I was only give 1 weekend off that.  Asking for time off was like pulling teeth from a tiger, you might get it you might not, and you might get your head bit off.  If the company (the human Resource department) would have been in more of a hurry to get people in it might not have gotten so bad.  I know of a few people that were hired and did everything on their part and waited 2 months for their oration. I could go on and on but the bottom line is it could be a great place to work if you want to give up every weekend and if you have another job work 7 days a week."
good,"Oversee displays built by vendor stockers."
good,I cleaned throughout the facility at the start of the night and continues by cleaning the machines and floors in different departments.
good,"If a person of management is having a bad day, they will take it out on the production workers."
good,There was not a typical day.  Given the variety of my responsibilities I never did the same thing.  It was very exciting to work with the world.
good,"Gud working environment. Overall management was nice. My boss is of very helping nature, as dint work much with Heinz due to some family problems had to leave the job."
good,"Kraft has actively embraced continuous improvement and Lean Six Sigma. The company is relatively new in this endeavor, but at the present time the company appears to be actively pursuing this. My co-workers are great people, very knowledgeable and very good to work with."
good,"Taking Bulk bins from the racking in the freezer and taking then to the production lines, taking the packed/bulk from the production lines to the freezer or loading bay."
good,We are totally engaged throughout the day in CI and the Lean Manufacturing Culture. Currently engaged in TPM and its implementation.
good,I loved meeting new people and learning new skills but I wasn't there long...
good,Like the job. the people at the stores they were all my friends. My co -workers all great guys. the hardest part of the job was leaving due to company relocation.
good,"trabalho era bom,aprendi muito la,e adquiri experiencia que eu nao tinha,as pessoa eram legais"
good,"a good day always be great there,i have learned how to work at a fast paste, the co-workers is drama fired, and there is nothing hard about kraft."
good,This job payed very well. It is a very cold place. It is not the place to work for if u dont like cold.
good,"good place to work - great learning.  dont expect work life balance or employee engagement. They focus on only work, you are a resource who is paid to work, dont expect training or coaching etc."
good,Started in natural cheese department on shredded cheese lines. Also worked in process cheese cooking cheese for kraft single slices. Worked in pasta as line operator for pasta shapes such as spongebob and other Disney movies.
good,"Customer service sucks, hard to get hired on from temp, great place to work but communication through changes suck. Also has favortism towards senior employees but doesnt pay attention to amounts of work being completed and by who!"
good,It's a good job to work at if u just need a start. But I'll move on to the next. They give people raises who came starting months after you. If they like you
good,Kraft Heinz has given me the oppurtinty to grow professionally started from the production floor to passing quality department to shipping and recieving. It was a great experince from the beginning to end and was very sadden when the plant have finally come to a close.
good,"Lots of overtime and some weekends scheduled makes it very hard to do anything besides work. The attendance policy is unforgiving and leaves little room for life outside of work. Vacation can be hard to get approved even though it’s earned due to understaffing. Overtime is given in 4 hour blocks either before or after your shift and is mostly mandatory. There are benefits including health, dental, and vision along with a 401k and life insurance."
good,"It was good."
good,Be to work on time work in a safe environment when others need help when you’re not working help out from the people to talk to stay all the overtime that you need to good benefits
good,"Little work life balance. Be prepared for how zero based budgeting will affect the culture. The company is very upfront about the fact that the culture is not for everyone. As an intern, I worked 60 hour weeks."
good,A productive workplace with good pay and it gives you a lot of opportunities. For sure hours & saftey is their biggest thing. Needa more training opportunities.
good,The people I worked with were knowledgeable and fun to work with. The day passed quickly as we were very busy on a production line. The hardest part of my job was lifting boxes high overhead to stack on a pallet.
good,"This place isn't the same since pairing with heinz,they used to care about the workers!! Management is poor at the lowville plant!! The new string cheese depot has no organization"
good,Mais le problème maintenant ses que depuis que kraft a été acheté par le groupe 3G beaucoup de perte avantage comme la gestion de la retraite beaucoup de coupures plus assez investissement pour le bon fonctionnement des machine réparation quand sa brise . On sens moin l’appartenance que j’avais aux début . Je ne peut évaluer le PDG ses encore un nouveau beaucoup de chargement de personnels depuis la vente
good,I feel the overall this is a good job but can be very very frustrating with the turnover rate and forced overtime. Also the policies that are sometimes lightly enforced for some but other times get someone fired can be very aggravating. It is almost impossible to contact HR about anything and that is also very frustrating.
good,"A typical day at Kraft consist of a cool, wet and sometimes smelly atmosphere. I had to learn how to work with many people of different ethnicity, culture and geographic backgrounds."
good,"Culture not for all. Stretch targets that are sometimes unattainable. Quick advancement opportunities for entry-level employees. Experience not as important, results driven culture of meritocracy."
good,I like getting to know new people but after working at kraft Heinz for 3 years I think its time for me to make a change. The reason I say is because I feel like I don't have any time for myself or my family working 5 to 6 days a week with long hours.
good,"various jobs for decent pay. Great benefits"
good,shifts went by fast. Ive learned in total 3 different jobs which are all unique. The workplace culture is very energetic. The hardest part f the job is the mandatory overtime on occsion; its sometimes a little too much to handle for one person.
good,"Kraft bought Polly-O just before its closing. Unfortunately management had pretty much ran the company down to the point that kraft decided to sell or close the plant. Over 300+ employees lost everything. It's a shame, the culture of the cheese plant, people working there , and environment were wonderful."
good,This was a job that was so laid back that u wouldn't want to replace but there are things that Kraft wouldn't look out for like family. I can replace the job not a family memeber
good,Good job to work for overrall they have good things to offer i had to work on a production line cutting certain parts of the bird using a machine acutting tool
good,The training was adequate for the job but the stress of the fast pace made it an environment that did not allow one to be creative.  I felt brain dead after each shift and my body ached every day.
good,"Once Kraft Foods merged with Heinz, the company no longer was a fun place to work.  Prior to the merge, Kraft Foods was a great place to work.  The leadership at Heinz does not care about the people, it cares only about the bottom line which was evident in all of the Kraft legacy folks being let go and replaced by millennials.  The Heinz leadership team is not at all respected by the employees."
good,I love working at Kraft Heinz because it a good work place. Some kind people. There benefits where outstanding. The money was good to and you also get paid vacation days and paid days for funeral.
good,Was a great place to work back when it was Kraft Canada. Lots of cross functional career progression. cross functional business partnering options. Also loved the general culture and focus on people
good,This job pays great  and the benefits are great also but the environment is hot the temperature can get up to 100' plus degrees in the factory but other then that it's ok
good,"For an IT professional, you were limited in your scope of work since there were many IT silos to be a part of. This gave the opportunity to shadow other IT functions to a limited degree."
good,Company is a good company to work for and has a great compensation package. I can speak very well about the company premerger but it would hard to rate post merger as I was not employed long post merger.
good,A typical day at work was great. Lots of downtime depending on what assignment given. It was a very difficult job since you have to run up and down the machines to make sure everything was running smoothly.
good,9-5 job working in SAP. Multi responsibilities performed on a daily basis. Good work environment with strong leadership skills
good,it was a great place to work for until some management started to abuse there workers once the merger. I was layoff just because I was in management and new to my job.
good,The Job is wonderful but the balance between life and work is not good and they do have some great people that work there and then they have other people that feel threaten by new people and if they don't like you then your on your own.
good,"Company management, not plant management, is too concerned with saving every dollar.  Company shut down 7 plants and relocated production lines with very poor planning.  Money is being cut in the wrong places.  I'm all for saving money and reallocating tasks, however it cannot affect the safety and quality of very profitable products.  Management needs to take a step back and look at the picture as a whole and put the right people in place to get the job done right the first time."
good,At this job you must meet (LMS) requirements. Very easy stable constant work. Your guaranteed overtime at this company and can move up in position with hard work.
good,"Working at Heinz is a fast paced daily operation."
good,good working environment. always busy and have something to do. the people there are great. everybody is willing to help out.
good,"A empresa dá oportunidade para que todos possam se desenvolver, dando responsabilidades maiores do que a pessoa acredita que consegue lidar, tornando-a maior do que já acreditou ser. Todos os dias me deparo com projetos e ações que vão além do meu conhecimento, mas tenho a chance de aprender da forma mais ousada possível."
good,"Headquarters was not fun and did beat you down over time. Good people in the department, but the mood was very negative. Very much a top down driven environment."
good,On a typical day at Kraft it runs smooth and we have little to no problems with our work line. I have gained a lot of skills but the management was not so great. I did have so really good co-workers  tho. The hardest part of the day for me was at times was staying awake LOL!. The best part of the day was enjoying time with all my co-workers.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"work day at heinz is never the same ,its aways different...and fun for me.great for learning how the different product are made"
good,"Some days can be stressful"
good,A typical day at worked consisted on going to stores to work with my direct reports coaching as well as helping the sales rep with any issues or concerns with the store management to secure additional displays to maximize sales
good,"•	complex systems for enterprise"
good,I was a line leader in many different sections of the plant during these dates.  I was in charge of anywhere from 6 - 10 people at a time.  Everything else is the same as on the last review except that I did not have the authority to let anyone go.
good,"Challenging equipment start-ups every morning due to food safety wash-down requirements."
good,"Productive and room for growth."
good,"Very Dynamic"
good,"sucking shelves in different retail stores in south orange county. training new employees."
good,"Like most companies, getting things done is time consuming.  But overall the company is dedicated to make things happen.  White space is not a problem as long as its justified and proper ROI calculations achieved."
good,"8 hour day shift"
good,"Recomendable, de mucho aprendizaje y practica laboral, de nivel clase mundial, muchas certificaciones, orden limpieza"
good,"Lots of email and text  "
good,There are always a lot of new projects. but more opportunities for contractors than employees
good,It was a very good time and the staff was very helpfull and comprehensive.I loved woking with Kelly Services but as a security guard licenced I could not go back to continue with them.
good,Atlantis is 50 km out of Cape Town and unfortunately all our staff have to travel far to get to work.
good,"Respond to consumers inquiries via phone, email and fax. The team is great, they make the days go by fast and we have a lot of fun."
good,"A typical day at work would be entering purchase orders and speaking with select few Kraft customers regarding Stock-Keeping Unit numbers required for delivery. Co-workers at Kraft Canada has been really helpful and was always there to help whenever the month end was hectic. The hardest part of the job was learning the Stock-Keeping Unit numbers, from which warehouse it originated. Also, when special orders needed to be entered it was hard to balance the regular customers and the internal customers. However, I very much enjoyed being with Kraft before the snack division split to become Mondelez. The management as well as the team was well knit and very helpful."
good,Typical day load n unload trucks fast pace lots of work. Learn a lot about shipping n receiving products n customer services. Management good we had a meeting before work to discuss what our jobs duties require for that day.Co-worker had been on the job for twenty years set in ways donot wants changes a little hard at first.The hardest part when my forklift fork fell off the front as I were lifting fork up.Very dangers. Kraft need a forklift over haul and a safety program thu out the plant.The most enjoyable were when every other friday we get free products and damage goods up to 2 bads full of stuff great.
good,"I am currently with Oscar Mayer, but am transitioning to the Kraft Glenview, IL office soon. My experience with Oscar Mayer is that the culture is extremely tough if you value a diverse environment (including diversity of thought, not just race/ethnicity, etc). Many of the people here (doing well) have been here for a while and aren't going anywhere. They like doing things they way they were done 20 years ago, and that's how it will stay. It allows for a very limited perspective of the market and consumer, and as a market researcher, I find that terrifying."
good,plenty of decent people there and the knowledge was plentiful
good,Kraft was ok to work for but to many long days. I learned what goes into making lunchables.
good,Worked for company for awhile no issues until I started working for 1 person. Some people can be out to get you
good,Its a good job the work is easy management is ok but sometimes hard to find the hours aren't that long the people are easy to work with. It's hard to move up in the plant
good,Vriendelijk aardig collegiaal en behulpzaam je kan iedereen om hulp vragen dat was echt goed
good,"Overall a good place to work with good benefits. The attendance system is fair, the breaks are decently distributed, overall I would definitely recommend working here."
good,"Its extemely cold,you have to wear all these clothes to stay warm which is sometimes uncomfortable. Its not the job its the people you work for. There is to much favortism from the supervisors,packaging tecs and room tecs. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!! One advantage is the excellent benefits."
good,"Checking emails, following pass downs from previous shift. Training new quality techs, assisting supervisors with tasks, working in product track to locate shipping pallets if there's an error that has occurred. Hardest part about the job is getting production employees to communicate with quality techs about issues on the production floor if we're not on the production floor at the moment. Enjoyable part about he job is when the shift runs smoothly with no errors."
good,Good company. Haven’t seen too much room for upward movement . Very flexible work schedule. Allow a work life balance. Awesome products and great technology.
good,"fast paced, basic factory work. good benefits. Has good employees working there. they are willing to train. training for the job was good. hardest part of the job the linkers which was staying in one spot and tying the hot dogs."
good,"night shift is hard to have a balanced lifestyle. Good job, nice salary, nice people, but hard work and night shifts. Learn about salubrity and you see how a factory works."
good,"I have worked there for a very long time.  Seen changes on a large scale with processes, equipment, management, employees,  pay scales, benefits, and lastly and most importantly morale.  Morale has dropped significantly even for someone as humble as me.  Then I heard through rumerville that Washington post says, kraft Heinz, is either 6th or 2nd, worst place to work in America.  So I guess it wasn't just me.  Expect long hours and a lot of training.  There is experienced operators that will help as much as they can, leaders on the floor are also informative and helpful as well.  Treat others as you would like to be treated goes a long way here.  Be open and willing if you want to stay.  Depending on your schedule, you can expect either 40-45 hours a week, and or forced overtime for the schedule.  You get what you choose to put into it."
good,"At the beginning of my shift, I would check with the previous shift to see if their were any mechanical issues that I needed to be aware of. I learned to make repairs and adjustments  proficiently. Management was average. I made many life long friends in the work place.The hardest part of my job was the third shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was the sense of accomplishment with a job well done."
good,I was a vacation route relief person - I traveled a large area. Everyone did things a different way. The hardest part was working at the Outer Banks and being away from home all week.
good,everybody was friendly hurt my back a Couple times due to heavy lifting love working in diverse place pretty smooth company  Needed to earn more pay so I left
good,Kraft Canada was a great place to work. I was part of a great team of people working towards the same goal. I learned to look at the big picture for every project and the role everyone placed in making it a success.
good,"I only worked at one plant and cannot properly access how the rest of Kraft Foods culture would have impacted my decision. But based on my experience with other employees outside of my immediate plant, everyone was very professional. Don't be miss led, there exist several pre-madonnas, but overall most are laid back and challenge each other to deliver. This is a high-performance culture which is enjoyable for certain personalities. I understand new management and the recent merger has helped change much of the culture."
good,"I have my own issues with why I left, while I was there is was a good place to work at. The other employees are nice but some management are in their ways."
good,"it's a very nice company to work for,it's values is really something to let you think how people think of food companies around the world and Heinz strives to promote those values."
good,Great work place just cold also hard to change shifts or department once you in there.....dont know if i would go back only for the right schedule or if lrs good
good,"Life time experience,The Kraft Heinz Company is led by a world class Board of Directors and proven business leaders with an unparalleled record for performance.

good,Hiyararşinin olmadığı bir çalışma ortamı sunuyor. Ve başarı çok geç geliyor
good,"Everyone was held accountable of their specific job duties. Every employee had to be on time at beginning of shift, breaks or you was written up. Moved up within the company yearly with an pay increase. Great benefits and pay scale."
good,"Responsible for operating equipment in a safe efficient manner. Always making the work you are doing is high quality, and safe."
good,"Mejor organización "
good,It's a great company to work for. Good pay. Good benefits. That is all i have to say. Like any large company there is plenty to complain about but overall it is great.
good,"in charge of the processing for the type of product that we were creating, machine technicen would handles maintenance and safety procedures for or food equipment"
good,"It has its pros and cons.it has good pay but they neerd to work on there management,would not mind working there again. Over all I think it is a alright place they just need too change a few things around but Its like that everywhere you work."
good,"Arrive at retail stores and stock shelves with Kraft merchandise."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kraft Foods, INC. Terrific position for a motivated self started. I would have quickly been able to climb the ladder if the factory in my town had not shutdown."
good,"- I am in sales with current and future customers with our product lines. My job is to sell the customer on switching to one of our brands. We have resources free of charge such as samples. marketing dollars, marketing materials, equipment, point of sale, rebates, recipes, etc."
good,i realy likeed my job at Kraft we had about 15 people in my department witch was nice we all got along pretty good the hours were a little diffrent 10 45 to 9 45 .the hardest part was lifting 10 to 25 lb pork bellies with one hand to hang on what we called a tree 90 pork bellies per tree.
good,"Worked in the field sometimes 7 days/week, 70 hours/week; learned about the DSD business; management was very educated and understood the business; co-workers were great to work with; hardest part of the job was maintaining some work life balance; most enjoyable was managing a great team of people"
good,Kraft provided a tremendous number of opportunities to learn new skills
good,22 Years at heinz good pay good people just time to move on now at panera bread.
good,"Very fast pace and very cold .  Management and  production worker are helpful, not a bad place to work. Flexible shift schedule. Machine broke down most of the time.  Waiting in the cold for hrs."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, lideres bem treinados e aptos a função"
good,"Heinz was a very family friendly company.  All of my multiple managers I had through the years were very flexible with work/life balance.  Once 3G bought Heinz, the company was not the same."
good,One of the good things about Kraft Heinz are their benefits and paid vacation. One of the biggest challenges are the amount of over time that is required.
good,The plant I work at was great till the merger then it went down hill. It seemed like after heinz took over things changed and we felt like our days where numbered.
good,"I loved my job here great benefits, steady work even though most night it was unsure when we would get off. If you like repetitive work and a less than professional work environment then this is the job for you."
good,"like every normal job you punch in and put on your apron and go to your destination line ...if your first time there working you'll be train to all lines in order to find out were your abilities are need the most...."
good,otima empresa no ramo alimenticio internacional e nacional da grandes oportunidades de crescimento

good,"Very busy"
good,"ambiente de trabajo divertido con cafés y bocadillo"
good,"I enjoyed my job at kraft...the people were  nice, the jobs were challenging but fun to learn.  The only down fall for me was the third shift."
good,"Líderes e gestores estão deixando a desejar, não aplicam a cultura da empresa de forma correta para promover  seus colaboradores. Mas explorei ao máximo em busca de aprendizado e vivência de situações inusitadas. Aproveitei os treinamentos e participei de capacitações e palestras oferecidas aos funcionários da equipe de Staff."
good,"pas tres chaleureux"
good,"Work Life balance was well balanced"
good,"A day start with having break with my team. then checking my calendar and prioritize the weekly agenda, checking inbox and set importance, attend projects progress/review meeting (steering committee), Attend meetings with key contractors and consultant,attend weekly procurement and finance team meeting, and lunch break. checking e-mails, attend conf. as part of regional projects, review and approve projects, coaching the projects team in developing projects phases, Review investment plans with board members."
good, 
good,"It was a good working place , every one was friendly hardest part was the lifting the most enjoyable part was the pay check"
good,A typical day at work include the safe packaging and handling of lunchables. i learned about quality control; including temp and product control. Management was great very helpful. There was alot of different co-workers and the turnover was alot . The hardest part was working short due to staffing. The most enjoyable part was putting out quality product.
good,"E muito bom de trabalhar la,vc se senti bem,me dei bem com todos que trabalhei na empresa,aprendi que tenho que observa mais ,e dar minha opiniao,gostaria muito de voltar este ano a trabalhar na empresa."
good,"E muito bom de trabalhar la,vc se senti bem,me dei bem com todos que trabalhei na empresa,aprendi que tenho que observa mais ,e dar minha opiniao"
good,Exel-Kraft Foods is a very advanced high paced job. Working here taught me what multi-task really means. It keeps you busy and makes the day go by faster.
good,"Came in to work at 7:00am and left by approximately 3-4:00pm. I did start working overtime on occasion with other projects coming up, and the amount of sampling was hefty. Although you were on your feet the whole time except for during data entry and getting a break. The hardest part of the position was getting all the sampling done within the allotted time with any extra calibration or other projects occurring. Mostly the work was product based sampling analysis of the fermentation or other microbial growth in the products."
good,Management was not invested in my development and didn’t provide me support. One of my colleagues had a very opposite experience with  management support she was able to grow and get the proper mentorship and career development and support needed and we both started at the same time and had consecutively exceeded sales results and I was not given the same experience.
good,I would go back to this employer if they were hiring in my area. Opportunities were available. Management cared and rewarded for good hard work. Teamwork oriented.
good,"Being positive and coming to work every day. Be aware of what to do and do it with accountability, get recognition of my good work from my supervisor."
good,Good place to work!  Management is very understanding. Excellent advancement opportunities. Lots of over time all year round. Stellar retirement package.
good,Met people from all walks of life. Enjoyed the day to day interaction with countless great people. Fun people everyday all day!
good,"Friendly atmosphere "
good,J'étais très ému de travailler dans cette entreprise car c'était la première fois que J'entre dans une usine de fabrication et d'y travailler.
good,"If u have back pain u shouldn’t work there, and if you don’t like the cold then it’s not a job for you. The money, hours, and the benefits are worth working there though."
good,"Its a alright job its a liitle stressful other than that the people are friendly. A typical day at work for me is alot of walking. My co workers are friendly, very interactive. I have learned a lot from this job far as running machines driving and riding jackes. The most enjoyable part is i have 4 days off and 3 12hr shifts if work."
good,"dia tipico era produção em alta"
good,Tive problemas com a equipe vendedor e supervisor mas com o resto foi tudo ok não tenho nada contra a empresa mas sim com a equipe.
good,This is a top tier environment to learn about the sales and marketing aspect of fortune 500 companies. Tons of sales/marketing strategies &knowledge shared and received from this exposure.
good,I enjoyed my job at Kraft and learned a lot during my time there. If I had the opportunity to work there again I would. The hardest part of my job was when I was fired and I didn't understand the legitimate reasoning behind it. I valued my job there and I enjoyed the fact that the employer offered overtime to employees who wanted it.
good,"My job was to make sure that all the production lines were running good. If not I would have to figure out what process worked so that the lines would run better.  Better start, more production."
good,Working in a very cold environment and it helps you learn how to be a team player. Everyone must do their part to make sure the job gets done. The hardest part about my job is the hour and a half drive. I do enjoy the pay and my FMLA works great because of my son's sickness.
good,Kraft has a lot of product... I learned many. I was able to meet different vendors which was great.. Was able to learn the operation of the stores I went to and the employees. The hardest part of the job was when a load would come in and had to break up over 200 boxes
good,the fun things that all jobs give you.the cold wasnt the best though
good,Es uno de los mejores trabajos que e tenido muy bien organizado con un buen ambiente de trabajo mejores prestaciones y muy estable
good,No such a great company to be employed with. The work schedule is very inconsistent and sometimes range from working 12 to 14 hour shifts a day. Advancement is very likely to take place.
good,"It was a long day sometimes when all the machines were having problems, but on the whole I worked with some good people. When you work 12 hour days it makes it more productive when you all can work together as a team to get your goals accomplished."
good,Management has been making a lot of changes and it has had a negative effect on every aspect of the company . I have been employed for 10 years and have enjoyed it for the most part until recently
good,Great benefits Rte side is very cold if u can work in food processing and can deal with the smell it's a great job.great benefits and also some wonderful employees
good,"When I worked for Heinz, the company was just acquired by 3G. The culture was out of wack and there was a lot of turnover within the short period of time I worked at Heinz. 11 Field Analysts were fired 12 Months after they were hired. Too many people working on the same assignment"
good,"they used to worked seven days a week, twelve hours a day which was sometime over doing it but they pay was great and they environment was a quick pace"
good,"Working at Kraft was a very cold environment, usually 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Not much free time on the only day you got off all you wanted to do is sleep."
good,"Working on the line is tough work."
good,"Management is in the drama as bad as anyone and the bullying is worse than any company I’ve ever worked for! Used to be an amazing company and took their mission statement very seriously until the merger, now family life is completely unimportant and it’s all about the bottom line and you never know from one day to the next if you’ll have a job when they constantly eliminate jobs."
good,"Friendly and fast pace"
good,"Long hours, poor support, poor work life balance. Excellent benefits and exceptional pay for salaried employees. A do more with less organization. Mismanaged."
good,Heinz was a very fast paced frozen food factory. It was a really good company to work with. All the managers that were there really cared about you. They worked around events with your kids so you could be there for them.
good,Horrible Management. Some managers only want the title. Overall the company has its great perks. There should only be a major changer to the management culture.
good,As a record's clerk and correctional officer dealing with inmates on a daily basis was very entertaining. I did enjoy the job because I am interested in the line of work I was doing.
good,"I was working as part of my studies as an automation technician. I was helping mostly the electricians and also I was doing some office work, like making lists of the engines of the factories. It was quite intresting and I had a good relationship with everyone."
good,Great colleagues good work environment. Love my job learn new things every day.
good,"I worked many jobs in my 23 years out at Kraft. I learn how to deal with all kinds of people, and about ergonomics issues. Most of the co-workers were great, every place has its few. I learned alot of operating machines and robots and have a good sense of the mechanical part of things. hardest thing was working 12 hour shifts for the last 5 years."
good,"I like working at Kraft as a line worker.! you get multiple break, your co-workers are helpful. The hours and rate of pay is great. I have nothing bad to say about this company."
good,"I never had an interview, I Handed in an application/resume and they just said come to orientation. That was it. The people who work there are super friendly."
good,"Day at work would start of great we get straight to work"
good,Kraft was not a bad place overall but some of the management was incompetent.  They had a lot of good ideas but no follow through.  Some of the people were very knowledgable but many were mailing it in.
good,They were great . Job was only temporary I would love to have someone work there that I know. It was a great experience. I wasn't only temp since they were moving building basically transfering
good,"Kraft is actually a really great place to work at, as long as you can get past the temp service. The temp service does suck and you only get paid a base of 11 an hour, but if you can convert your golden. Just keep your head down, because any nail that sticks out...."
good,"The things that makes the company are the brands and the people.   They have world class brands and people.   At Kraft, they train you well and work you hard."
good,The plant lacked leaders. Lots of authority figures but no one that held any respect. This lead to a lackadaisical esprit de corps and hurt the overall work environment.
good,"Very busy "
good,"Opportunities to deal with different cultures (colleagues, US-based team, suppliers) and young team."
good,"El plan de trabajo muy cambiante de semana a semana, aprendí a delegar, a administrar recursos, a definir prioridades, a presionar para cumplir con los objetivos. La dirección es buena en buena en general, excelentes colegas de trabajo. La parte más difícil fue la comunicación interna, muchísima lucha de poderes e imposiciones en muchas ocasiones. Lo que más me gustó fue vivir fuera de la ciudad, lo volvería a hacer con los ojos cerrados!"
good,Good products and great people.  Work/life balance suffered when Heinz was bought out.
good,Gestion des commandes de a a z
good,"They were decent, I would have no issues working for them again."
good,"Its not hard work just very repetitive,co workers are very helpful to each other,management was ok but could be better,hardest part of the job for me was the travel distance."
good,visioner to achive mass chocolate and confectionary market share in asia region.
good,"This is a good stable job but the time away from your family can take its toll. I learned a lot about food manufacturing quality and safety. The pay was really good "
good,Good company but you could be laid off because of mergers and buy outs that occur frequently with the main company. It's a stock driven company that can be good today but gone tomorrow
good,A good place to get exsperiance . a place to move up with time. Good opportunity to move up. Semi safe for beginner workers. Make sure to have a safe mind set and always be aware of your surroundings
good,"Working 12-13 hrs a day between 10 and 13 days straight, rotating shift take a toll on your body. I created a lot of new friends, but management was not to be desired. Workplace culture changed when Heinz purchased Kraft when from a nice place to work to a ""I don't want to be here"" place. the hardest part of my job was managing some your kids who didn't want to work. The most enjoyable part of my job was training new talent."
good,Worked through Kelly's services for Kraft/Heinz don't pay enough when you're commuting and too much over time that didn't amount to anything on your pay check
good,"I love Working with the people, and doing production work, making a great product for consumers"
good,Great place to work but many people are promoted into jobs only because they have been there longer. Otherwise a great place
good,this is a great place to meet customers but dont plan on having any family time away from work. The pay was great but dont compensate for not being home.
good,"I loved working at Heinz. I worked well with others on all lines. I take orders well and don't overreact when criticized constructively. I worked straight day's while working for Heinz and found that the time past quickly as we were continuously working."
good,"Sem muito contato com a empresa, pois trabalhava direto em um cliente (terceirizado). Contato direto por email, sempre com respostas rápidas."
good,Set a foundation for my customer service skills and IT knowledge.
good,"Long, 12-hour, continental shifts do feel like they take up most of your life but it's not a hard job and there's usually enough to do to pass the time fairly quick. Management were always very understanding and kind but the managers for Kelly Services (the temp agency I went through) weren't always coordinated. Easy but repetitive job and not nearly as bad as it first seems."
good,"Tell us about:"
good,working as a trainee... gaining experiance in the field of maintainence
good,"Empresa em fase de mudança cultural e de modelo, convivendo com  gestão ambígua e em fase de fortes mudanças culturais e de gestão."
good,"Working at Kraft was my background for target. I use to repack containers and then stack them together, then ship it away. It was a fast pace job but it showed me my strength."
good,Being required to do a review for this workplace is kind of pointless. I don't have anything to say except the place is like any other place. There are good and bad days and good and bad employees. Just like every other workplace.
good,A dog eat dog atmosphere everyone is not there to be your friend but talk about each other behind your back when it should be a team effort bla bla bla bla
good,"Worked with a lot of good people. Good benefits. Keeping focused on work at hand. Miss the great overtime that used to be available. They say family first, but, you are sometimes forced to come in."
good,Towmoter drivers have crazy hours 12 hour days sometimes 6 or 7 days a week. Management dont care about you .your just another body. Union pay with perks
good,You have been assigned route that starts with very early in the morning and it is a very fast moving job to complete all your stores but overall it's a nice place to work
good,"Pros"
good,"pas de securite du personnel temporaire, travail intersant"
good,"I have enjoyed my time at KraftHeinz, but my heart isn’t in it anymore. I like the people, but management isn’t accommodating to anyone but themselves. They need to omit the point system and treat the long term employees better than what they do"
good,"It was a great place to work as a professional and I believe the management cared for each of us.  Kraft Heinz is a business and drives employees to produce a product for consumers in order to turn a profit.  Nothing wrong with that and if you understand and work toward the company's vision and goals, it's a great place to work."
good,Pobre administración. Resistencia al cambio. Poco involucramiento de altos mandos.
good,"La empresa Heinz me encantó trabajar ahí. Lo malo que no había mucha coordinación por parte ejecutiva y administrativa, y el ambiente de trabajo era muy malo pues todos querían alcanzar un mejor puesto, y eso traía muchos problemas"
good,it is a very fast pace work. Very cold in the winter. The temperature in the factory is between 0 to -6 in the winter . the summer time is  great because it feels like you are in a air condition place with temperatures right around 32- 40.
good,Everyday could be different if your department had a lot of work or not. If it didn't you could get sent to a different on or sent home. Some people where treated better than others.
good,"loved working for Heinz but closed plant due to cutbacks. great co workers, sometime had to work lots of overtime. was able to learn a lot and moved up very quickly"
good,Kraft was able to accommodate required previous appointments as needed. Hours are long and overtime is available. However the overtime is not always optional.
good,Enjoyed selling autos. I really enjoyed working on the Nissan side. A lot of turn over in management made it difficult. Loved the people I worked with.
good,"its very busy all the time, u have to very alert, u have to maintain production and keep the machine running all the time with product"
good,"Uma empresa dinâmica e agradável, eu indicaria sim a outras pessoas."
good,"great company to work for, good benefits, pension plant, and great pay. Unfortunately they have to close the plant down."
good,"Un lugar  acogedor, trato regularmente amable. un  poco de falta de mecanismo de comunicación  entre trabajadores y administración."
good,kraft foods can be stable but it all depends who is management at the time. the will pay you miles and the benfits is good. but the rotc training I found to be countrer productive when you are trying to stock product.
good,Co-workers take a while to warm up to you but about two weeks later you can feel the tension ease.  Hardest part was not knowing what the next product was going to be because of mis-communication. So unfortunately there were delays from time to time due to schedule conflicts. Most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of a 12 hour day after standing all day.
good,Loading bottles with fork lift and operating Dumper Machine. Work in Skillets Department  loading Carton Machine and keeping Robots clean and in working order. Bag Machine and Packer Machine. QC - re works making sure all box’s have the right items in them  to be shipped out. Supply and Re-leaf Forklift Driver. Working with Shipping Department and taking supply to appropriate ares. Working with loading dock to make sure I have trailers for item to be shipped out.
good,My days started early which means my days ended before anyone elses. Management was ok and the co-workers that truely liked their jobs were a joy to work with. But then I got hurt and the company made my life very hard. Had to seek an attorney
good,"work weekends holidays and overtime, on the job learning, sent to job related classes"
good,"Overall a secure job, does not go through a temp agency and allows same sex relationship benefit plans!"
good,Work is not too stressful.  Always busy but not too busy.  Management is fair with employees.
good,Good place to work prior to the acquisition by 3G.  Was able to advance in the last 7 years.  Good lower and middle management.  Hard to judge senior management as they are very disconnected to day to day business.
good,In the beginning the plant was just starting up so everyone was excited and worked hard to get the manufacturing lines up and running.  Everyone learned a lot.  Over the years there were many different  plant managers. Some were there to help the plant become a better business.  Others were there just to put their time in.  I enjoyed getting involved in the business which they encouraged.  I started the annual blood drive and continued with them until I retired.  I volunteered to be a charter member of HACCP and train others.  I worked overtime when they needed me.  I helped move the large parts room when the plant was shut down for  repairs. I enjoyed my time there but after 20 years of the 12 hour days and nights and the work schedule of switching from days to nights every week I was ready to retire.
good,"A probabilidade de crescimento se da atras de promoção pela liderança ou por processo seletivo, so que muitas vezes o reconhecimento da boa mao de obra da empresa nao e feito e nem selecionado o mais qualificado e sim quem tem mais influencia."
good,un dia normal era llegar a tienda llenar limpiar y rotar las fechas de caducidad lo mas dificial y de cierto modo lo mas gratificante era resolver los problemas que se presentaban ya que la gente es muy complicada lo mas dificil fue aceptar la perdida del empleo sin previo aviso
good,it is a good place to work very clean it is hard being on call for 2 years its hard to have a life and since christmas it has been very quiet.
good,"Heinz is a wonderful company to work for. I worked for two different departments during my 5 years there and it's really all about working for a department that has a competent leader. My position was eliminated in 2011 and in March 2012, the whole department was disbanded. Leadership and budgets were a big factor as well as accountability and not taking responsibility for the direction that should be taken. Management in my department was embarrassing and ensured that their own actions were justified and covered regardless of the cost. Having said that, other departments have wonderful leaders and are great to work for!"
good,"Rotating shifts, and high turnover rates. Just remember you can get a good paycheck but you’ll have longer hours. If you stick it out all the way I guess it pays off."
good,It's a good place to work for if you dont really have other responsibilities. Alot of overtime is required to be worked as well as weekends which doesn't leave alot of time for work/life balance. Management doesn't seem to care about employees just numbers.
good,Its really a cool place to work nothing to stressful and good pay . Nice coworkers and managers. I worked packaging soups into boxes . It's an easy job and budget nice pay whobwouldnt like that .
good,It builds you up to work with others. Great pay. Some of the people are amazing to work with. Production experience. Ability to learn new skills and meet new people.
good,It was a fun place to work for just the management was poor and didn't schedule. I enjoyed my time as a forklift driver there I would recommend it for anyone that wants to work 72 hour weeks
good,Flexible to explore different career paths and support career development.  Fast paced working environment where constantly being challenged to deliver results.
good,"don't take everything personal do your job follow rules, regulations, policy and procedure learn your job do your job to the fullest don't get in the gossip mills"
good,I enjoy working for kraft i just need a different shift and thw way the company is set up you have to have time in to move departments. Outside of that the pay and benefits are good and the time off is good between work weeks
good,"Empresa de grande porte, uma multinacional, ambiente agradável para trabalhar, com ótimos profissionais."
good,"I went through a temp service which can be hard to level up from, but the work is decent and everyone is friendly. Overtime can be a killer but is worth it!"
good,"Flexibilidad casa, salarios y valoracion a mujeres"
good,"great people you get to work with good management by some great team leaders, mostly easy jobs. you just need to work you hardest to get though the day or night shift for twelve hours."
good,"It was an easy job with very little or no stress. I was responsible for 8 stores for merchandising, stock and building product displays. And at the end of my day I had to report back to the warehouse with updated paperwork and documentation of each store location."
good,"he Kraft Heinz Company is the third-largest food and beverage company in North America and the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, with eight $1 billion+ brands. A globally trusted producer of delicious foods, The Kraft Heinz Company provides high quality, great taste and nutrition for all eating occasions whether at home, in restaurants or on the go."
good,I really like my job there bit it's just the management that don't know how to talk to people. Management think they can talk to people any kind of way and get away with it only if you don't say nothing but all around it's a good job.
good,"Bonne compagnie, mais manque d’effectif au niveau de l’équipe de gestion"
good,beginning of your shift each day you would do multiple stretches which were very helpful throughout the day. learned how to build displays and boxes etc.
good,Es buena  el ambiente laboral muy ameno y sin presion
good,"You get paid very well. You have to work hard, which is understandable. They care more about production than their employees. Don't get hurt on the job, they don't care, you will be fired."
good,"Communication skills within the Organization are not the best for such a big Global Company. So sad to see Kraft culture go away. Very minimum opportunity for growth, development and career advancement."
good,"Too good company to work as gives the opportunity to learn the system and process, on the other hand, also gives the opportunity for the employees to show talent under various development programmes."
good,"Fun place to work, but it was only a year.  Had to relocate because of a health issue.  Hard working employees.  Great teamwork and very fond memories."
good,I enjoyed my time at Kraft as a machine operator and have taken my skills to my new pace of work. It gave me confidence to work my way up the career ladder and helped me continue my work within the manufacturing world.
good,"Great place to work, a lot of benefits. Everything is clear and you have enough space to be yourself and propose new things. The culture is amazing. Heavy workload and hard due dates, but you have support."
good,Muy Buena Compañia ideal para crecimiento profecional
good,I loved my position there but I will have to say the company lost a lot of good people due to management having a don't care attitude. Many of the team leaders as well needed better work ethics and personal skills working with employees.
good,"Company provides opportunity to learn while at work.  Good balance of work and play.  Benefits standard, pay lower than average, large work teams and cross functional collaboration."
good,"El ambiente laboral es muy bueno, los horarios son los requeridos para desarrollar las actividades, solo considero que el sueldo es bajo."
good,"I enjoyed working for Kraft however things changed when Heinz bought Kraft. Morale went down, cost of benefits went up, and they stopped contributing to the pension."
good,"GReat place to work. I have a good opinion about typical day of work, what is learnt, management, workplace culture,hardest part of job and the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,This company cares about its employees and is great with work/life benefits. Pays employees well and provides great benefits.  Customer service is a priority
good,Good place to work early in your career.  Very demanding and need to have complete knowledge of your customer. The company is always looking to move on.
good,I like the job description an I'm dedicated to my work place.but I didn't like the lack of supervision or training at my job because there's no Unity amongst the employees an supervisor
good,"Sold to Mondelez International, fun, fast paced selling environment with base pay and competitive commission. Teamwork involved at all levels, room for growth."
good,it's a great job and would tell anyone who has no relationship or family to go there. it's a laid back future but overall a great environment  and it's a place where u can make a living thru
good,"Very productive, some of the work was hard but I learned how to used machines like the labeler and packer. I don't think the work wouldn't of been so challenging if the co-workers showed more support and the training was better, but other than that I think it was a great place to work great benefits."
good,This company was okay but very unorganized. Also ran like a frat. If you weren't in with the cool kids you got the shaft. People get laid off every other month and the emplopyee morale around the office isnt where it needs to be
good,Main focus on cost cutting - growing work load per employee. Preferential treatment and Fast track career advancements for Brazilians. Good integration of business processes. Steep learning curve.
good,"Great products, wonderful people, and significant accomplishments.  A fun place to work and enjoy life.  Good work life balance with plenty of opportunities."
good,Offered work life balance and many work opportunities for work and growth.  Iconic brands with a very talented work force.  A little too cost conscious.
good,Kraft food is a hundred million pounds of turkey bacon weekly  the company starts you out with a rate about 10$ hourly and the pay increases the job can be nasty and some job are ok. hardest part breast line or ready to eat side is super cold.  enjoyable is the bonus you can earn from the job if you put in the hours and they have a good year.
good,It's a nice place to work very diverse. Working there I've learned a lot about machines repairing them. I've improved my communication skills .and there is great
good,working at the Heinz india plant is Quite good.one should try working here if he is trying to gain work experience in an FMCG production plant.i have experience of about 4.5 years in this plant
good,"many opportunities are available if you are open to a fast paced environment. there are many job cuts often, but if you are a hard working employee you will do fine there."
good,"Used to be a fantastic place before it was sold to 3G. Quality of life has gone down a fair amount, but it is by all means still an above average company"
good,"I started with Kraft right out of college, and they have been very good to me.  The iconic brands make the job that much easier, and the training and develpment that you receive help you grow as an employee.  They always provided a great healthcare plan, and were always looking for ways to increase their 401K offerings.  Over the years, the career ladder has become a little clouded, and the opportunities to move up within the organization has been more difficult."
good,Stay focused on what the next objectives that needs to be handled as a first priority. There are a lot of moving parts and you need to react fast and with efficiency.
good,I like my job and I have meet a lot of people there. I love the hours and my second shift co workers. I would love to retire there after my twenty years are up
good,"I enjoyed working with the people, the job wasn't bad. Hours were decent, engagement okay, physical job, Retiring due to company closing the plant in Madison Wi"
good,"You never knew what to expect working at Kraft. Some times it would be smooth sailing, and the next it would it be doing everything possible to keep the plant running."

good,"Avaliação com base no tempo efetivo."
good,"I think that kraft is a great [place to work with the new plant and no seniority  unfortunately I will be unemployed, they have very good benefits and I enjoy the worlk"
good,I worked night shift so I would start work at 11PM-7AM work over time sometimes. Over all it was busy most nights running machinery because I was a operator and had to pay attention to multiple things at once.
good,Amazing and outgoing coworkers.  Management was good.  Full time job opportunities.  They work with you if you have any problems.  Smiling faces.
good,"I really liked working for this company.You have to take a vacation day to rest. I was there more than I was at home.I'll miss my yearly raise,and bonus.I really miss my co-workers."
good,Most employees are looking for ways to get you fired instead of doing their job. This was 4 years ago. The turn over rate is extremely high. no job security. But great benefits.
good,I enjoy working for Kraft Heinz Company.  I have had many opportunities for advancement over the years and have always been supported by upper management.
good,"I love my job at Kraft Heinz. What I do is very easy it's just my coworkers that's the problem. When I first got hired my department was also. As months went by, everything started revealing out."
good,"Au quotidien je travail a différent département avec des chefs d'équipe nommé capitain qui t'assigne la tache à effectuer pour le shift. Le management est très bien assuré et les collaborateurs sont très courtois."
good,Great experience. Payment was received on the spot. Things needed for sampling is fully provided.I would like to work with this company again due to their high efficiency on payment to workers.
good,"MBOs and management support allows for progressive advancement opportunities within 12 months.  24/7 production 7 days a week is a con, but the company is built around providing job security to those who applies/engages oneself."
good,The hours take a lot of getting used too.  It's cold but bearable.  Supervision is easy to get along with as long as you do your job and do what is expected of you.  A lot of changes have happened since the merger of Kraft to Kraft Heinz but it's good money for what you are required of you.
good,"I was busy from start to finish with colleagues requiring timesheets manually entered into database and product ordering. I liaised with suppliers and customers on a daily basis. I had the best co-workers surrounding me, we got on well with each other and established a close working relationship to allow the jobs required to be completed effectively."
good,"I had a great experience working for Kraft Foods. Lot of change when 3G private equity firm bought out the company. Some of it was for the good, but I was impacted by my position being outsourced to a third party company. I learned a lot while working there for almost seventeen years."
good,5 years with Heinz provided me with valuable experience in a wide range of marketing responsibilities. It was and still is a highly respected corporation.
good,Good company to work for - provided ample opportunities to learn and grow within the organization.  Management staff supported every opportunity that came my way.
good,"provided sufficient opportunities to grow within the organization - fair pay and family oriented.  Work life balanced, Management fair in their  decision making regarding merit increases, etc."
good,"Heinz has exceptional food safety and quality programs.  The company fosters a safe work environment, and cares about their employees."
good,Company allows you to cover every aspect of the business with progressive systems and great brands to support.  Allowed to be creative and think outside the box with new business development plans.
good,The employees here are excellent to work with. Lots of overtime for everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job supervisor supply the tools that we need to get the job done.
good,"das 18:30 as 6h da manhã com intervalo de refeição de 1 hora"
good,Good place to work for upwardly mobile professionals. Great work/life balance with good compensation and benefits. I enjoyed my experience with the company and wish them well as they move forward.
good,"Learned to work as a team member. Also worked in a very noisy and dangerous environment with chemicals, cleaners, and moving machinery."
good,At Heinz I would enter data from the previous day's production. I would order materials for every day production. Make spread sheets and present them in a daily meeting on how efficient production was the previous day. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with the other workers and helping them if they needed any supplies for the production floor.
good,Excellent Quality Lead worker that works as a team player. Very sharp working with different cultures' and always positive in the working environment. Improving GMP regulations and getting internship for Graphic Design to improve development with the company and to start career in Graphic Design field.
good,"Before the Kraft-Heinz merger this was an excellent company to work for. However, that is no longer the case. Job security is no longer stable, and our benefits have been diminishing."
good,I enjoyed my summer Internships with Kraft Foods Inc. The plants that I worked at were very friendly and well led. They offered great opportunities for personal learning and improvement.
good,I held numerous positions in the 22 years I spent with Kraft/ Nabisco. All the positions had different challenges. All were rewarding though. I would highly recommend Kraft for someone looking to have a carreer in Foodservice.
good,Its a fun place to work at everyone is really nice.  it gets pretty cold their so I would bring a sweatshirt with you. management is really easy to talk to if you are having any issues
good,"A typical day at work involves entering quote information provided by a vendor and project information provided by my manager.  I enter goods receipts for invoices so that the accounts payable department can pay our vendors."
good,"Kraft Foods is a wonderful company to land at."
good,"A changing company since the acquisition, with many changes to business processes, cost visibility, management thinking as well as employee potential for advancement."
good,"Poste et environnement stimulant grâce aux processus, aux indicateurs et aux projets à développer en parallèle du poste. Ce poste permet d'avoir une bonne connaissance des contraintes usines et de la planification de production."
good,I don't understand why this place makes you review the same company multiple times in order to proceed.  This is a really annoying site.
good,This company promised me a lot and did not deliver when i took the position as a supervisor. The people are ok but the work life balance really sucks.
good,"Empresa multinacional do ramo alimentício, que atua na fabricação de doces achocolatados, bebidas e sobremesas em pó e laticínios. Atuação como engenheiro de segurança do trabalho, responsável pela promoção de ações na prevenção da segurança dos funcionários, dentro das premissas legais."
good,"This was a great job to have while in college"
good,Very well run plant that was organized but shut down due to plant being moved to another country to cut down employee cost. it was a good job but seemed to lay off quite a bit to not allow the worker to receive full pay and health care benefits.

good,The first day we was training it was very hands on and they really took the time to show you how everything is done. great people and company to work for
good,I worked second shift and worked well the other guys. I would help the processors bring in and take out ingredients. The people I worked with were all nice people.
good,I like the team of people I had the chance to work with.  Good energy and very talented.  Collaborative environment.  I left because I had a baby born with developmental delays and she required full-time care.  Didn't want her to be with a hired sitter and had no family in the area to help out.
good,"Kraft is a large corporation, which may intimidate many but has much to offer.  From great movement potential to many continuing education opportunities, it is a place that I am proud to work at."
good,"It was very fast paced and stressful.  I learned how to deal well with any arising issues, problem solving, and how to work well with other employees.  I worked directly under the Team Lead and Supervisor.  It was a very physical job that focused around a good routine and following OSHA specifications.  I enjoyed when we had a successful night with minimal problems.  I enjoyed working with my fellow employees and their positive attitudes."
good,"Co-workers are great. Management is new, but working on getting the bugs out of the process."

good,"Great Company, Driven by innovation and value creation, sharing best practise , benefit & reward"

good,"It was great working for the company, I learned a lot of things while I was there. Everybody was supportive throughout, from Top Management to Shop floor employees. I really enjoyed every moment."

good,"Agitado, pois trabalhava na segurança do trabalho. Aprendi a mexer em planilhas do excel, organizar a sala, atender o publico, receber documentação, ajudava na integração de terceiros da Kraft. Colegas de trabalhos divertidos mas ao mesmo tempo cansativo."
good,"with just a handful of employees, cross training was necessary and fun, not everyday was the same. They treated you like family, even did a lunch for the company on each birthday."
good,"A typical day at work was like a walk at a park. picking orders,loading trucks. great co-workers so there never was a hard part of the day."
good,A typical day at work starts at  5.45 in the a.m 12hrs shift with me setting up the slicer that cuts turkey meat into buddles according to work detail for that day some numbers vary depending on what needs to get produced for that day i spray it with a water hose making sure any meat thats left on the previous shift is off its a two man job where we take turns running the slicer where one person weights the meat and keeps the slicer clean much as possible we rotate through out the day its pretty much a quite work area.the hardest part is setting the slicer because the cords on the line will jam and cause meat to fall out of the slicer..the most fun part is meating new people and earning great pay with beneifits
good,This was a typical merchandising job.  The hardest part was getting new reps. 
good,"Busy busy every second of the day, every day I learn a better way to manage my work, I work well in teams and independantly. "
good,Very relaxed but hard working enviroment. Would urge anyone to apply if looking for a job.

good,"Se llega alas 6.20 Am se carga el producto y se checa que este completo,se checa la unidad,se carga material de publicida y exhibidores,se junta todo el grupo con nuestro supervisor,se fija una cuota de venta diaria y la meta,se analiza cada ruta y se intercambian maneras y estrategias de ventas,retroalimentandonos unos a otros,se perfilan todos a ruta y se lleva a cabo lo mencionado en mi curriculum vitae.La parte mas dificil es cuando bajan las ventas por vacaciones de escuelas,pero tienes que hacer magia para lograr ventas.La ubicasion de mi empresa es ecatepec de morelos, edo de mex."
good,Over all I've met alot of people and made alot of friendships learned diffferent things and enjoy my job
good,"get order times and direction for the day. start your day according to the best sense. start different stores fill, build write orders. the faster you get everything done correctly, the quicker your day is finished"
good,"- A typical day at work would be going in the back warehouse and finding the things we needed to have on the floor, put the product on carts and filling the shelves. I was also responsible for giving out samples."
good,"Trabalhava no abstecimento de Calhas.È uma empresa muito boa pra se trabalhar,dinâmica, e agradavel,participação dos funcionarios no serviço."
good,"constantly busy-always something to do, friendly people, safe, free parking"
good,Kraft Foods Company enables employees to take advantage of being up-to-date about current company initiatives and events through its corporate intranet site .
good,It was a good place to work until about 6 months ago. Enjoyed the coworkers were enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was trying to get new safety procedures passed by the union.
good,Great environment where the managers all have ginuine interest in seeing you perform well. They encourage all their employees and help them achieve whatever their goals within the company are.
good,had alot of place to learn new skills and grow in the company a very nice place to advance your skills and leran new ones.
good,"As the human resources intern for two summers, I was given the opportunity to oversee and take part in some events and work-related activities regarding the human resources department. When not doing activities directly related to HR, I was assisting co-workers in tasks they needed help with such as calling employees for scheduling, filing papers, mail, etc."
good,A typical day at Kraft Foods I would have to say would be interesting. With a wide range of diversity in the facility you never really know what to expect but I have had the opportunity to work with some great individuals. I have learned how to operate some very high-tech and dangerous equipment but while following safety guidelines to insure no accidents will occure. The management staff are a group of professional individuals who takes the time to get to know the employees that they are working with. The hardest part of my job has yet to come do to the training that I have recieved which makes my job alot easier and using the correct methods helps for a much smoother production run. I enjoy the people that I work with the most and enjoy knowing when the target goal for the day is met.
good,"Good starter job for sales experience, Sometimes you have long days of driving your car around from store to store."
good,The work is very physical but I love the challenge every day to progress.
good,Days go by pretty quickly if u keep busy and work fast.
good,I work for Kraft Foods for 18+ years. I was satisfied with my employment there. I worked hard met lots of different people and enjoyed my work.
good,Needed to be self-motivated in order to get the job done due to the fact you work alone and I excelled in this aspect of the position
good,This company gives you the opportunity to grow if you showed you passion in your job by prioritizing the workload and doing it in a timely manner. My manager and supervisors has been very supportive on my inputs and ideas on what is good for the company/facility.
good,"I love the company.  Let me say that.  I can see great things for this company with better leadership.  It's definitely a budget conscious company these days with the whopping budget of 7.00 a month for office supplies.  Communication from the top down is  sketchy at best.  There are no service level agreements internally to keep processes moving along in a timely manner.  Much time is spent running down information repeatedly.  Meritocracy is a pinnacle point for this company.  The unfortunate part of that is that they allow people with little experience and/or emotional maturity in management positions without management training.  Bullying does exist and was not effectively addressed by upper management.  Favoritism was witnessed.  Cost of living increases do not happen.  When hired in, be prepared to live at that salary rate for years so negotiate accordingly.  Budgetary constraints are felt from the top down.  They have some incredible products, but understand there is a huge umbrella of brands.  They are good about taking care of the customer when there are challenges brought about on Corporates part.  There is a good work/life balance."
good,I enjoyed the people that I worked with but the job could get stressful at times based on the way some of the people would act based on what was expected of them.
good,"I honestly enjoyed working at Kraft, but I left because they would not do anything about constantly shortening my check every 2 weeks. Loved the hours and staff"
good,"Kraft Heinz was a great place to work if you love to learn."
good,"Good place to work, fast paced.Pay was good and paid vacations was a plus, I enjoyed the time that I worked there and would still be working there had the plant not closed."
good,"Kraft Heinz sets strong yearly goals/targets, focused on cost reduction, process improvement, lean manufacturing. Many meetings throughout each week, hourly individuals are very open to calling corporate to complain. Plant management teams were talented and good at their jobs."
good,Factory job in cold environment.  Get very close to co workers due to long days and having to work as a team. The company itself is a very good company to work for.
good,"a moderate balance between work and life is maintained in the organization compared to some other big MNCs. "
good,It was a great place to work. You get exposure to so many departments and learn new things everyday. Although it did seem like the work always increased but the pay raises stalled.
good,"Salario baixo, mas compõe um plano ótimo de benefícios e facilidades para os colaboradores adquirem os produtos da mesma a preço de custo."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho,e honra com os seu compromissos."
good,"Empresa  Multinacional com muitas oportunidades de crescimento, cultura extraordinária."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my employees."
good,to arrive at job site before scheduled hour to clock in and suit up for going into the freezer area. Then receive our instruction on the product that we will be working with and also what they're expecting from our shift. the manager where nice to work with .The workplace was very mixed -culture which sometime there were problem of favor certain workers. the hardest was the cold and just standing in one place while working. I had a chance to meet some new people the I enjoy conversating with and at time sharing lunch with.
good,"Biggest downfall is having to cover call off schedule as well as planned schedule, which in turn makes for a large amount of overtime. Unpredictable work weeks either 5 days or 7 days.  Coworkers are mostly pleasant and good to deal with.  It is fairly easy to advance into another position in a short amount of time."
good,Working for kraft was a great experience learning a lot. Job security was low due to lay offs and selling the company. Was poorly managed but overall a great place to work with tons of different types of jobs and experiences.
good,Ik heb er met plezier gewerkt maar door automatisering ging het niet meer . Doordat de Heinz is overgenomen door een Amerikaan zijn ze gaan Automatiseren en zijn er vele ontslagen waaronder ik .
good,The work is a little boring and there isn't any room for advancement but the people you work with are pretty fun and management for the most part is very understanding/supportive (this is on a plant wide basis NOT company wide - I have heard horror stories from other plants and upper upper management)
good,Established a successful and productive career during my 17 years with the company. Once the buyout with 3G took place everything started to change concluded with my eventual layoff offer in 2013. But the skills and go-to-market strategies I obtained during my time at Heinz have proved invaluable and plan to use them in all my future endeavors that will hopefully be in foodservice sales management.
good,Buen empleo pero no tienen transporte y el salario es algo bajo
good,"Great place to work, attendance is a huge part of job.  quality checks every 30 minutes. management is ok, but hear its getting worse. Most people that can are retiring."
good,Fun work environment but mostly overworked and quality work was hard to keep. Hot and steamy environment which made the work very hard during summer months.
good,"Personally, I feel the company and its leadership needs to do more to promote people based on merits and not some cacophony of factors. A person should be promoted solely based on merit! Floor and mid level managers are abusing the promotion and hiring process."
good,I also helped out in other areas when needed. I had a hard time with the rotating shifts. One week day shift and the next was night shift. I enjoyed working with the people
good,"There where times when they did not communicate well with the union or employees.They would not allow certain problems to be taken care of in a timely manner,"
good,"you get in put your apron on "
good,"Work force good people, Pay OK, on time. In my 16 years  10 years of my stay became hard knowing that the plant would become idle, It did. This was a union facility, most of KRAFT HEINZ are not."
good,"Work 12 hr shifts and rotate nights to days but you get a lot of time off the shifts are on 5 off 5 on 2 off 2, a lot of people have came to work here strictly because of the schedule."
good,While working for Kraft I learned that it is a very fast-paced environment with constantly changing work shifts.  While this works well for some it doesn't necessarily work for all.
good,"I really enjoyed the strategic analysis, program development, and project management work that I performed at Kraft.  It was fulfilling and fascinating."
good,Kraft is a cold warehouse with lots of cold products bot stop moving no break but 20 min I feel like we could of got more pay for the work we do but other then that it's was okay
good,"Its hard to maintain a relationship outside of work unless you are both working the same shift. The money is great and the benefits are better, you will love to work for Kraft. The work is easy and very easy to learn."
good,"Job was enjoyable, however direct management is not always very professional. Mileage reimbursement was a complete joke, especially when they had entered the wrong address in the system, impossible to get a correction and reimbursement owed."
good,Good steady pace job running the slicer and the kurwood line. Always have the machine running and making sure product is on the line. Making sure the machine running properly.
good,"Took pride in everything that was done there. Knowing that what was done in that building could be seen in your nearest grocery store. It may have been a lot, but with the right organization, the job was usually fairly easy."
good,"Kraft and Heinz merged but their processes for doing business did not. It is unorganized in that Kraft and Heinz employees often work on two different platforms of enter data and such intro different programs because they have not been aligned with one another yet. No one takes initiative to change this, nor does anyone take ownership of onboarding, educating or informing anyone of to do anything."
good,Enjoyed the job and the environment. I could see myself there for many years. They care a great deal for their employees. Overall I would refer others
good,"Responsible for managing, motivating, planning, training and creating merchandise improvements that delivered superior results to the Spartan CBT.  "
good,Kraft  is a great place to work then will pay you very well great benefits but not too much to do when it comes to have an outside life. Very easy job but training is not the best
good,"This Job was fun, I loved the work environment,  everyone was nice. This job was fast pace. The benefits were amazing. I left this job to pursue a medical career."
good,"The work and Maintenance Management was great. The work was challenging at times but all the information to do the work was there for use and easy to find."
good,"Good pay and good benefits for yourself in family, but extreme pressure to have all computer data plus production perfect. So much as loss of employment with 1 mistake."
good,"people are friendly, but everyone worry that they might not have Job tomorrow due to Heinz constant cutting the jobs. but overall, they pay check is reasonable"
good,"A decent company to work for. Good people and managers."
good,I enjoy working in the company. I really am not bothered by the refrigerator temps of about 32-40*. the work is overall easy and easy to learn. only bad thing is you do work a lot of hours and days depending on your shift it doesn't give you much of an outside life... it pays well and has good benefits 401k plan vision and dental.
good,"felt appreciated working for this company, didn't make loads of money, but was happy working for them.  management was there to support the sales reps when needed.  Most people that work there were hard working, individuals."
good,"This place is good to work for, but the scheduling is horrible.  They will have you work every shift regardless of your preference or personal life balance.  Management is terrible, rude, inconsistent, and disorganized.  Besides scheduling and management, the people that work there are awesome, you will make friends quickly, and the people that work there have been there for years."
good,"Empresa jovem, com liderança e cultura organizacional forte."
good,"A tipical day of work would involve multi-tasking in order to meet production goals."
good,I love working at kraft foods i enjoyed my co workers and my jobs i learned alot i have learned many jobs but i had a sick son which i had to b out with pretty much 8 long yrs but i enjoyed my job at kraft foods
good,"I was responsible for maintaining inventory and stock room with 10,000 plus individual parts."
good,"there are a lot of options within the company, its great for people new  to the work force and those seeking a job.  Everyone works together and strives to do there best, its defiantly a company you wont mind working for."
good,Fast paced environment with opportunities for advancement in certain fields.For the most part an enjoyable place to work.
good,"Kraft Foods was a very good company to be associated with.  After a number of mergers and changes in technology to ""improve productivity"", the company and culture changed."
good,Ambiente di lavoro molto amichevole nel quale ogni persona può crescere in modo positivo dando il proprio contributo.
good,I believe the current direction is wrong. I think they will find that revenues and production will pay a price for the recent changes.
good,"A typical day would start off fast and stay at that pace until after lunch."
good,"Als operator moest je twee tot soms drie machines te gelijk bedienen. (Minimaal twee)"
good,The work environment is really positive and motivating. People are very willing to help you learn the systems and daily routines.
good,"lots of fun, always busy. friendly co workers and customer oriented."
good,"rotatividade grande de funcionários,ambiente com ar carregado e empoeirado,ocupações para todos os momentos,alguns colegas deixam seus postos sobrecarregando os demais."
good,"Orden y disciplina, Es una empresa seria."
good,"Learnt Working under pressure"
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work, with each day presenting new and different challenges.  I have spent my entire career to date, 15 years, working from my home office.  I am self-motivated, not requiring immediate supervision and the home office is the perfect situation for me to be productive.  Overall the people I work with enjoy the challenges of the jobs making it a pleasant environment."
good,"Great company, great brands, travelled to many different countries and made a lot of good contacts and friends"
good,Good place to work; nice benefits and team oriented events makes the days fun
good,Plant closing Work going to Mexico. At one time plant was a very nice place to work with a mutual respect between management and employees but that philosophy got lost.
good,"•	Support sales teams"
good,"At Kraft, one can expect to build foundational branding experiences -- including: marketing strategies, promotional effectiveness, analytical skills development, and high caliber project management."
good,Main responsibilities included preparing the factory for production start-up and shut-down each week.  Ran chemicals and steam through pipes and filling rooms to sterilize.
good,"Mastered Kraft Foods portfolio, systems, and procedures, through training with various sales representatives."
good,"Cleaning the production equipment and machines. While I was at ISS I gained my COSHH and Confided Space in house training."
good,Learn how to work with others in the stock room as well as in the packing department.
good,"la e bom de trabalhar os colegas ,sao solidarios ,temos relevancias"
good,Demand changes would require schedule changes and an eye for detail to ensure compliance.
good,"overall good experience, good corporate culture with strong values and achievable objetives"
good,This was a very fast pace.
good,"Fast paced, ever changing multinational orgainisation. The people that work within an organisation are what makes it great ! It is a demanding and focused environment where I have learnt to work without supervision and willing to assume additional responsibility. I'm learnt to be a committed team player, committed to developing myself at all times. I have gained a considerable skill set from working in different sections of the complany and in a wide variety of roles."
good,This is a physically demanding job. No day is the same. Set your own schedule based off of deliveries. Manage your own territory. Nice independence.
good,"As a third generation Kraft employee, I have had many great experiences with the company. It is the ultimate team environment. It can be everything from laid back and easy going to mentally and physically draining. At the end of every day, we all come together to celebrate another accomplishment or figure out what we need to do to improve upon a sub-par night. Ups and downs go with the territory of any job, but overall, I have enjoyed my time as a Kraft employee."
good,"Typical day for the most part was A 10 hr day. Monitoring equipment , repairing brake downs, doing preventitive maint. learned alot about people and how to work better in group. management was ok. co-workers were great always had Agood time. hardest part of the job was dealing with the know it all formens. Most enjoyable part was working with the nice people and having fun while we worked."
good,"The most enjoyable part about this job are the smart people that I encounter, the great brands and the current culture of re investing in these brands."
good,"My postition is titled as one thing, but in return its actually a Glorified Shelf Stocker. The company overall is a great company, just sells a dream in the interview that you will be doing one thing however your doing another. You work very hard and encounter many conflicts with the clients. The retail side of this company is not what you want."
good,everything was ok until they sold the plant........... if was a good job and you was working everyday with ovt.
good,very fast paced
good,"I start my days by setting up the blending machines, gathering spices and meats, loading the machine with meats and spices to blend together. When finished, I unload the machines and placing them in the coolers."
good,Overall Kraft was a very good company to work for. The constant and consistent down sizing is costing the company significantly.
good,"Good Pay, but not enough hours, and good time of day when working. You make your own days in a way."
good,Only leaving because of downsizing. Management has some oppertunities. But over all a good company to work for.
good,I did enjoy Kraft I just moved away to find better. The only thing I would improved Kraft is there communication in the management department we never knew what was going on till the last minute.
good,This job was everything to me at the time I was making good money it kept me out of trouble I loved my job and the people I worked with I learned to be a people person
good,"It is a good company but if you become a temp you will get bounced around between departments and your hours will vary , I’ve been told 3 times I would get full time , still nothing and I’ve been there almost 9 months and my 90 days was up in June, if your a temp you don’t get benefits or holiday pay which at this time of the year makes it hard to pay bills"
good,"Management team can be inconsistent, but overall the workplace pays well and offers advancement opportunity. Hours can be harsh, 12hr shifts. But the 4 on 4 off schedule is ideal"
good,"Job was good,I liked the people I worked with. I had recent health problems where I had to call off work and didnt qualify for FMLA yet . High turnover for employees."
good,Actual Kraft Heinz is a great company. The new company stinks. Management needs to communicate better with each other's departments. Great workers and benefits
good,The work is easy and the pay is good. The benefits are great. They even have a company store that all employees can buy from at a discounted price. The store is such a convenience.
good,Very fast paced.  Continuously rotating. If it wasn't for being a union job. Alot of people would be out of work. They like to fire alot for stupid reasons.
good,"Great place to work, but in the midst of a lot of change and pressure. Markets haven't been kind to Kraft Heinz and the company is still trying to maintain relevancy. A lot of executive and senior management changes have taken place and so there's some job and structure movement. Fast-paced, competitive. People there are smart."
good,Just keep to yourself is the best thing to do easy work the people there are also nice. Very good benefits. Just the management is not so good had 4 supervisors within 3 months
good,I love working at my job... However we are uo for sale. Ive been with my company 28yrs.. Ineed a job i can depend on like they depend on me im eorried tge plant eill close and im not retirement age
good,"It is a good, steady job with equitable pay. Lots of room for advancement if you work hard.  Company store where you can get Kraft Heinz products cheap once a month. Hard to get on first shift. Lower seniority usually gets laid off for a month or so in the slow winter season. Some jobs are very fast pace."
good,"Fast paced, new building used for start up. Contract buy done by DHL Supply Chain. Management had a high turn over rate compared to hourly teammates. Incentive program kept teammates motivated."
good,"every day went into a huddle and meet with the line tech to see what was going on for the day and then went to our assigned area and went to work. "
good,"Ambiente Internazionale, con management giovane e competente, l'azienda avrebbe bisogno di un ammodernamento a livello di macchinari."
good,Muy buena empresa me ayudo mucho a crecer en mi experiencia laboral como en muchas cosas mas pero el sistema implementado aun no esta completo y es un caos en almacén por encontrar algún material
good,I worked for Kraft before it was acquired by Heinz (2010 - 2013).  During the time frame I worked there it was a good place to work - very fast past environment.
good,I have always been treated fairly and with respect while working for this company. The pay is above average for the area. Working conditions are above average also. The plant is safety driven and cares for the employees.
good,Quick paced and plenty of opportunity for extra hours. There are many different types of jobs available so it is easy to find the one that is right for you.
good,"I would not have left this job, But it was changed from  a full time job to a part time and I could not afford taking the cut. The job was flexible and fun."
good,Get to work clock in typically you could be in a different job day to day and you work with your team that your with that day to operate the area your designated to.
good,It's a place to work depending on your job title it could be stressful are yu could enjoy your time there. For me I enjoyed it I mean the work was hard but I'm a hard worker if I could go back Nd change how things was I would go back Nd be there today
good,"Prior to Kraft being destroyed by Heinz, it was a good place to work.  There was always plenty of work, managers were pretty engaged with their employees and they seemed to care.  Overall good place to work."
good,A great start job right out of  school. I was rewarded with advancement. I left because of federal wage  controls that were put in place. Cut off room to grow.
good,I am a general laborer and do a variety of jobs. This is a very challenging atmosphere. Everything is based off of seniority so it's very hard to get anywhere when you first start working here but if you are patient and work hard you will eventually get a bid job. The pay is great and co workers are awesome but management is clueless.  Lots of room for advancement if you are patient.  I like that there are 8 hour shifts or 12 hour shifts if you prefer. It's a very fast paced place to work and very challenging at times but pays very well.
good,"Plant located at 2494 south orange.  We make Capri Sun, kool- burst and pouches. Plant consist of 3 eight hour shifts Monday-Friday. Vary fast pace environment with minimal down time. Presently my job is robot operator."
good,"Culture is based on a meritocracy so if you put up results you'll go far quickly, no need to put in the years to reach director, manager, etc... This does have a downside as turnover is high and hours are long."
good,Exelente empresa yo trabaje 12 años muy agusto la recomiendo amplimente
good,"Great company culture with fantastic people working there which made working there fun and enjoyable. Personally, I cannot say anything bad about the company while I worked there."
good,I worked at Kraft 23 years before I quit to return to school. Good paying job but very fast paced and not for everyone. Lots of lazy people and unwilling to help out.
good,"It’s a good place to work, but it’s just a cold environment to work in. They could  have better maintenance workers while running hours are in progress."
good,"Food manufacturing"
good,I really liked that everyone came in withthe same pay grade and you can move up after 6 months. the insurance i thought was pretty good. If you can take the smell of raw meat and the cold.
good,Les horaires n'était pas stable et un schift de travail et très long
good,"Excelente personas, ambiente ambicioso y con posibilidades ilimitadas de crecimiento por meritocracia."
good,I worked at Kraft for about one year. I met a lot of great people and learned a lot. Once Heinz merged with Kraft it didn't turn out to be that great and different management took over.
good,Empresa grande y reconocida a nivel mundial.  Excelente marca.
good,Ter uma melhor comunicação e mais conhecimento....
good,Typical day at kraft involves clocking in grabbing the nets you need and going to your line. It was pretty cold in the factory temperature wise. The people were nice
good,"was a great place to work until Heinz Merged with Kraft. the the company is out for profit only and does not care about the history of the company it took over. The Oscar Mayer factory was in Madison,Wi for 98 years and had a strong support of the community. Many familys had grandparents, parents, themselves and there children work at this plant but the new KraftHeinz didn't care about that so they closed it. they could of worked with us to make improvements but instead they just said we are closing your plant."
good,"onafhankelijk werken is geapprecieerd;"

The day starts at 6 am and ends at 2:30 pm. The day starts with getting the list of things to be completed for the day and then complete each task until the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is working along side my co-workers that I have built friendships with and occasionally see outside of work. Management appears to have good overall knowledge of how the individual processes work and aren't afraid to ask questions if they don't know something. The one thing about management that gets on peoples nerves is the lack of communication regarding issues that affect the plant and the workers."
good,Good place to work management could be more understanding to real life situations but the work is fine and you can advance
good,"I do thoroughly enjoy working at Kraft-Heinz I have found the company challenging and this company will pay you out excessively if you meet your goals. I'm not a fan of the business practice. The company is run more like an investment firm buying and selling stocks as opposed to driving home a vision supported by initiatives. I do believe in a future here, but, I'd like to see senior leadership start valuing their people more so than the numbers that occur on spreadsheets."

I have learned how to properly load trucks by weight , size of the trailer and how many pallets are on the particular load, ie . 53 foot trailer equals 28 spots on the floor , or 30 when product is loaded wide ways side by side, keep it light on the nose and light on the rear axles for proper weight distribusion."

A typical day at work was fun seeing the product from start to finish. I learned a lot about hygiene that I did not now and about food allergens. The co workers for the most part was fun to be around. We took the job serious and tried to make it one of the best in Florence. The management did there best to keep the plant running at proficient level, and still pay us a decent salary. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we had a chance to eat our product. I admit they were pretty good. The hardest part was to be honest the temperature inside was pretty cold."

good,Even though Kraft foods is a fun workplace and employees get excellent work environment. It is unfortunate that employees get limited opportunities of progressing in their career.
good,This workplace was decent in the paying sense and being overnight. The 12 hour shift was tiresome and doing the same thing over and over was repetitive. The co-workers were fun and helped make the workplace a fun experience but there are a few who are unhappy and make everyone around them unhappy. The breaks are decent and there is no food in the cafeteria at night.
good,"Great place to develop new skills and apply your learnings. Excellent benefits package, good remuneration and plant location has a pretty good conmute."

good,"Though I only worked 20 days through a temp ageny, I found the supervisors, managers, and employees were/are very friendly. An enjoyable place in my opinion."
good,I would condition stores upon arrival work orders if present and work through back stock. Keep in touch with store and company management to allow for the best possible service of the store and repeat at as many stops instructed on the given day. I never really saw any of my coworkers outside of meetings but any time I did interact with other merchandisers it was always pleasant and preferred. Management however was unorganized and detached. The hardest part of working there was unreasonable demands given time constraints and unstable hours. I might work 30 one week and less then 15 the next. Also exact scheduling times and places would be left in the air until the evening before.
good,"Hard work long hours fast pace to work.I learned how gum was made.Management they are hardworking people. I like working at kraft foods people were nice,keptvery busy."

good,"Great company, but this factory doesn’t consider the mental/physical health of the thousands of employees which it hires. Also, working as a temp, getting hired by the actual Kraft company is very difficult."
good,your work day depends on the department you work in and the shift. to many managers and not enough staff to do all the work needed to get done. certian shifts do all the meaningless tasks while other shift get cudos for doing there work.
good,"Very Ethical company with leaders with highest level of integrity."
good,"Good place, good pay, good benefits, plenty of ot, good co-workers, decent management. My boss is a very good one. Like the 12 hr. Shifts and the work schedule."
good,"The most interesting part of this job is that there is no ‘typical’ day. One day I would be busy scheduling meetings and the other day I would be supervising my employees. Maybe the next day I would be busy making presentations for the higher-ups or tutoring the trainees on how to speak efficiently in front of a crowd. If the job is unpredictable and calls for efficiency, I try my best to reach that level."
good,"I loved this job too bad,  I was terminated. I wish the line techs had the workers back like they coverup for eachother.  Other than that,  I loved my job."
good,It went very well. I was pleased. The questions were straight forward and very honest. I felt no games were being played. It was the perfect format as far as a review goes.
good,this was a good job. I was responsible for routing myself and seeing at least 7 accounts a day. I liked that each day I was in a different part of the city. I learned how to manage my time and developed good customer service skills. I was looking after clients coffee and beverage equipment doing general preventative maintenance. The hardest part of the job was all the driving using my own car. I was given mileage money but it didn't really cover the cost. The most enjoyable thing was not being in an office. I was moving all day and got to interact with some great people. I had several accounts that I would always look forward to seeing. I would have stayed at this job forever but they eliminated the position after seven and a half years.
good,"I was in a sales position and the moved to a distributor role.  I handled many price negotiations and worked with the purchasing agents.  I was then in a culinary role,"

good,Kraft in Champaign is a food production and distribution company which offers both full time and part time employment.  It is a fast paced industry with supportive colleagues and family friendly benefits.
good,"A challenging place to work with good opportunities to learn and grow.  I find the politics and bureaucracy still overwhelming here to where it can turn people off.  It is common in large organizations and Kraft Heinz is no different."

good,What a great place to work at. The pay was great in all jobs at the plant. Regular annual raises. Earned time off 6-8-12-20 hours per month depending on how long you were employed. The plant was not union but had all the benefits except for stewards to fight for your job if you mess up. But if you didn’t do drugs they never fired anybody for damages and messing things up. So stay clean and you got a job forever.
good,Productive and fun place to work at.  I got to meet and work with many people and enjoyed it.  Good place where you can grow and move around to different departments.
good,Kraft provides its employees an excellent opportunity to grow in their field and learn the skills necessary to be successful in their career.  These opportunities can come at the expense of balance.

good,"good place to work for someone that likes a lot of overtime, good benefits and wages also they have various jobs that allow people an opportunity to do different jobs, so days aren't always the same"
good,Kraft is a good place to work. There are some things that need to be done and fixed in the mangement dept. Some people get treated unfair. Some really just there for the money. Some are there cause they cant find anything else.

good,"It's was a nice place to work, every body knows each other."
good,"I have been with the Kraft company for 6 1/2 years, overall this isn't a bad place to work. I have had many encounters with various managers, and several of them were poorly skilled in management! I do believe the company could offer a bit more in a raise, because there's a lot of production effort from employees to put out quality product! There's barely a job/home or work-life balance! The people here would make the work environment a better one if everyone would play their position and roles! The most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of a work-family, and the hardest part of the job is dealing with managers that have no people skills!"
good,"Family oriented place to work that pays well with a wonderful work schedule, but stressful on many levels due to usda regulations and the meat availability is very hard to plan by."

good,Kraft offered many jobs to many different people. Kraft also offered decent pay along with benefits. Mannagment had issues with communication with the employees.
good,"At times it wasn't the easiest to work there but I am sure that most places are run the same way.  I only meant that quite often materials and/or ingredients would run short of a typical product run.  We would have to ""brite pack"" the product into other boxes until the proper boxes were delivered.   The same thing would happen when we would run short of ingredients to run a certain product so that run would either be postponed until all ingredients were accounted for or the run would have to be cut short until proper supplies were available.  All in all the atmosphere there was upbeat.  I did enjoy my job as a machine operator.  My co-workers were friendly and easy to talk to and get along with.  Management was very friendly, courteous, easy to talk to and  they listened to our concerns and when they could they tried to make things easier for us."

Worked on several teams while employed with Kraft including managing OM hotdog business and handling overstock waste reduction attempts while working with other supply chain managers to build efficiencies.  As a CPG company, Kraft relied on CSCs to ensure adherence by the customer to related efficiency programs to manage pricing based on volume ordered."

good,Kraft Foods is a great place to work just because the pay and benefits. It makes up for so much! The hours are long 12 or more and the hours suck. It takes 10 or more years within the company to move up to 1st shift.
good,Kraft Heinz was truly a great company but I miss the days when it was a private company that felt like a family owned business. There is so much opportunity for growth if you are able to relocate.
good,I like to work with the people . The breaks were fair. The supervisors were sometimes fair. I had work as a grader and packer.A packer job was calm and the meat was easy to pack.
good,I have had a great career opportunity while working for Kraft Heinz. ISP is the way to go for flexible work benefit. I enjoy making my own schedule an handle 17 stores in my territory.
good,I recommend this company for a career. Tough job but good compensation. Meeting many people throughout the day.  Earlier to start the day accomplishes much more.
good,People are the ones who make the company amazing.  Challenging environment - pay for play model is beneficial for some. Long days but rewarding.  Work life balance no existent
good,Boa gestão e bom ambiente de trabalho. Bons benefícios.
good,"I loved working at kraft, one of the best jobs ive ever had. wouldn't mind going back if it wasn't for the long drive I had to take every day. great benefits as well!"
good,Working for Kraft was my job experience outside of the military.  It was there that I first was introduced into manufacturing working as one of their production supervisors.
good,"A typical day is planning for safety 1st, sanitation/housekeeping needs, production and labor planning."
good,"Outgoing, hardworking folks will enjoy working for this company. Down to earth managers with the ability to work your way up throughout the company! They also have unbelievable benefits!"
good,"Kraft is a great place to work, a lot of the negativity surrounding the employees here stems from the people that have been here for 15+ years and don't adapt to change. New owners (3G capital) means there will be changes. Some jobs are the most chill jobs ever, you can work your 12 hour shift sitting in an air conditioned room with out having any management up your butt as long as your process is running. Schedule is great, 12 hour rotating shifts, and only work half the days in the month, never force overtime, but there's plenty of it available if you want it. Vacation starts out at 80 hours, and goes up from there. The worst thing about working here is that most of the management do not know the processes of the plant, but try to make changes as though they are experts in the occupation."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed the coworkers and the job is pretty laid back and simple, wish I never left but I was only able to get hired onto third shift and was pregnant so I had to leave. If I was on second or first shift I would probably still be there. HR needs improvement though"
good,Decent job. faced with upcoming layoffs. I would not recommend working there. A new plant has been built that only accommodates a few people. Seniority will take these spots.
good,It was a great place to work alot of nice people and great management team. Also it was fun to work at kraft and there is always overtime when wanted.
good,a typical day was 8 to 10 hours i learned to get alone with everyone i came in contact with management was easy to get alone withthe hardest part was the long hours the easiest pare was getting alone with everybody
good,"Great place to work with.  Great corporate team. Lot of opportunities and freedom in  a fast phased environment. "

good,"Kraft was a good company. Very productive, focused, and room for advancement. It eventually spun off to Mondelez International which was a sister company of Kraft but much different."
good,Great place to work.  Hours are typically long with a lot of OT.  Promotions available.  Management is good.  Benefits are outstanding.  The hardest part of the job is the excessive OT.
good,"- good hourly wages"
good,"Enjoyed my time with Kraft Heinz, very innovative in sales strategies. Fairly paid and compensated for the work I had to accomplish.  Not a great working culture, as management was not well informed."
good,Buen clima laboral y oportunidades de crecimiento. Buen equipo de trabajo.
good,"It was a good environment to work in, good people to work around, fast paced, and constantly moving.It was a factory, where you had to do cleaning in place, sanitizing, setup, and run different products on certain lines."
good,"y good [this job was sad to leave, it was a very good job and very good paid I really like to perform this job, but unfortunately I got to leave it because of the distance I leave 45 minutes away from it and I work fro 3pm to 3am and even tho I ask for a schedule change I never got it so unfortunately I have to leave it..."
good,Company is good about promoting within and offering training. Spent 20 years there and made it through several mergers. Enjoyed the work I did and the people and clients I worked with. Best job I had and was disappointed that I was let go.
good,"room for growth, my manager was very understanding and willing to work with you."
good,"Great company to work for, fast paced and plenty of growth opportunities. perfect place for those who are self motivated and love taking on new projects and challenges. the only downside for me was the location but overall great company to work for."
good,"It's a really fun place to work at. They offer many great advantages such as work conditions, discounted products and safe work environment. But above all else. Everyone is treated fairly here."
good,I was laid off from this company. the pay was well as I worked at their establishment and the benefits were good too. getting laid off made this job unreliable to me since I needed to provide income at all times.
good,"I have been extremely dedicated, motivated, and enthusiastic in securing successful distribution and supply to various companies; and now wish to extend this success to your company."
good,"Really nice place to work - very warm and helpful colleagues, especially as one is learning the layout of this large complex, and this enormous company."
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em grupo, ouvir a pessoas e aceitar  mudanças, ser responsável e grandes perspectivas de inovação."
good,"Provides great growth opportunities "
good,I I joy working with the different cultures of people and I like my job working the condensed is nice over time is being reduced down this time of year not a real good thing

good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, nuevas metas diarias, sabiduria"
good,Great family community. Can be dysfunctional and stressful at times. Human resources department very competent and helpful. Sometimes overtime could be outrageous.
good,"Must be a people person to be a vendor. Lots of driving, walking bending and kneeling. Must be able to lift a heavy load pack your own truck. You primarily work by yourself."
good,Kraft was a nice place to work and they paid well.  It was fast paced but a good working environment.  The only problem was that it was very seasonable and I never worked there without a layoff.
good,Bonne entreprise et dynamique. Bonne esprit d'équipe axé sur la performance
good,The organization and culture as a whole is good.  The facilities are old; which requires a lot of attention and TLC.  The people are skilled at their job tasks and are willing to work with you
good,"Trabalhei como temporario e fui efetivado , e uma empresa boa , mas que algumas pessoas nao pensam em equipe , a cultura de algumas pessoas me influenciaram a saida . hj a atual mondelez se modernizou nos processos e talvez na cultura de seus funcionarios."
good,kraft Foods was overall a very good company to work for.  Lots of room for growth if you like to relocate.  I enjoyed my time with Kraft tremendously.
good,"A lot of intelligence went into the design of the plant, & the way it runs. Everything is time sensitive. One problem can bring major consequences to the streamline process, so it is critical to be able to solve these problems quickly, but safely."
good,"fi you worked hard, you were rewarded with better jobs. they made sure you could do the job. If you could not do it they put you on a different job. the equipment was suburb."
good,"i estimate 80% of the pre-merger HQ employees have either quit or been fired, so a lot of knowledge lost and many things are in a state of chaos. Also, they constantly talk about meritocracy, but the majority of all senior positions are filled by Brazilian men and many middle management jobs filled by people with little experience. Seems like it's more of promotion based on perceived potential than past merit."
good,"""Geld moet rollen"", dat merkte je wel op de afdeling debiteuren. Met een gegeven deadline en duidelijke richtlijnen wist ieder wat zijn of haar taken waren. Ook al was ik maar een tijdelijke medewerker, maar ik ging altijd mee in de wekelijkse meetings om de gang van zaken te bespreken. Zo voelde ik mij altijd betrokken en leerde ik ieders verantwoordelijkheden. Dit gaf mij sterke motivaties om het werk gedaan te krijgen. Daarnaast kon ik altijd terecht voor vragen en moeilijkheden bij collega's. Het meest uitdagende in mijn werk waren mijn taken om Engelse B2B klanten te benaderen. Aangezien ik het vakjargon van de debiteuren nog niet onder de knie had, was het goed om te weten dat ik altijd terecht kon bij collega's om uitleg te vragen. Het ging erom dat wij dezelfde doelen moesten bereiken, dus elkaar helpen was erg belangrijk. De werksfeer was goed, open en gezellig. De omgang met collega's maakte mijn werk erg plezierig."
good,Forklift certification and worked with management on a daily basis.  Being a team player makes the job enjoyable and easier.  Worked with others and supervising.

good,"I grew up with Kraft Foods.  They fostered an environment of learning and success, and looking back the culture was second to none.  The people, the workplace, the innovation, our leaders.. it all led to a successful and winning environment."
good,Kaft Heinz is A very good MNC Company. There is a scope for growth. I enjoyed a lot in this company. I learned about basic parameters. Hardest part is distributor searching.
good,Great place to work with good professional management and team leaders. A place that encourages development and any level. Safety is a lifestyle and encouraged with every aspect of production.
good,"Worked on machinery in production areas."
good,"Great place to work for the pay and benefits with a chance to upgrade everyday to higher paying positions that you may qualify for. Working at kraft for seven years was sometimes challenging depending on who you work after and whatever position you have that particular day because somedays I would be in a whole different department which was sometimes stressful but manageable. I learned so much at kraft, from the forklift driving all the way to being a machine operator and being responsible for training new recruits on a weekly basis."
good,"Days are 12 hours long"
good,"great place to work if you are willing to work hard, lots of room for advancement especially if you are willing to relocate"
good,Management had common sense at least in the production floor. employee moral was not too bad. I don't think they turned a profit to support the operation.
good,"In this organization, we have a good work-life balance. Management is good and very much approachable. Work culture is very good in this organization."
good,kraft heinz is a food company which places are safe. all the times seminars and new update information concern that company; TEAMWORK MAKES THE VISION WORKS

good,"it was a very good company to work for , they had great insurance and excellent retirement benefits the management was very good ,a great company to work for."
good,I miss Heinz in Pocatello.....nine years of a daily battle to meet and exceed expectations.  But in the long run seeing them go has been  extremely  hard on my family.  In other words  if you're  lucky to work  for them appreciate  what they give back. Hard work is rewarding... I felt with them.  I have had to work two jobs just to match what they payed me in Pocatello  Idaho....

Management were really nice. I enjoyed being around my coworkers they were really friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was how to fix the fast machinery but I was willing to learn. The most enjoyable part the job being at work."

good,"My job was eliminated due to merger with Heinz. The old Kraft culture was great. I would say it is now extinct. Overall, I have nothing bad to say about the Kraft Foods I knew. Kraft Heinz is an entirely different culture. I was let go before I could fully appreciate their way of doing business."
good,"It was my first internship that i had received, it was my first real work experience where i was in charge of two projects that were challenging and beneficial for me and the company. overall it was a great success and thankful for letting me participate in their company."

The goals are set at the beginning of the year and can be modified as business direction changes. There is a great deal interactions between employees as some goals are shared and some responsibilities overlap. Leadership, commitment, perseverance, good communication, result oriented are expected from all employees. Employees learn a lot from each other since workforce consist of many different skill sets. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in an environment where professionalism rules and one can feel good about his/her accomplishments."

I was able to develop skills in various fields such as warehousing, procurement, production planning, inventory management, among others. Also, I was a member of the Venezuelan board of directors that managed the company. What I enjoyed most about working at Heinz, was that most decisions involved solid teamwork and input from everyone. There was also a lot of training provided for new employees, which facilitated working with newly hired workers. However, the hardest part about this job was negotiating with the government on obtaining any kind of permit."

good,"Kraft - Mondelez is a family setting and a place that I would look forward to going. It was a home away from home. Supervision respected and listened to ideas, problems or just everyday life problems. I learned the importance of being a team player and problem solving. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get product out because of something out of my control and the most enjoyable part is seeing outstanding numbers going out the plant."

The stores usually ran a weekly ad to profit on the products purchased so I would communicate with the grocery department about product location, visability and most importantly profitability.  I develped a sense of the needs of the customers and the consumers through vast research and development opportunites.  As a Sales Rep we worked in a field of stores based off of geograhical analysis so we didnt get to work or interact with other employees until the sales meetings.  This job wasnt particularly hard it just required unique people skills to be able to deal with the ever changing sales enviroment.

good,"Constant movement requiring self-motivation, speed and strength. I became friends with all co-workers and we all worked great together. my favorite part of this employment was learning how to operate the machinery and all of the knowledge learned in whole.

I see my co-workers as a part of my family. The management team are there to listen to our ideas and concerns. They try hard to give us all the essential tools and support to accomplish our goals. The hardest part of my job is the 12 hour shifts. The job is very physical, and can be a challenge sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be my co-workers.

For a particular shift, there is only one electrician responsible for the whole electrical problems for that shift. It is challenging but it boosts my work-rate and my ability to handle pressure"
good,A typical day was spent doing many things but not always the same thing. I learned the rigors of working in a large corporate environment with many departments to coordinate with. Upper management seemed for the most part to strive for accountability and transparence. I liked working with my co-workers in the pursuit of solutions and productivity. The hardest part of the job seemed to be that there was never enough hours in the day to do all that I felt I needed to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new responsibilities and completing certain tasks which were rewarding in and of themselves.

good,"There really was no typical day except for the fact that I would start everyday at around 6:30 am, but the day would last as long as the work would take me. Which some days I would say is one of the hardest things about the job. I would go into different stores and restock and rotate inventory as well as talk to management to try to sell them on feature products. The management was supportive and very helpful if I had any questions or needed anything at all. As it is a very independant job I didn't come into contact with co-workers. I really liked the fact that the job was very independant and my managers trusted me to go out and perform a job by myself without them constantly looking over my shoulder."

The hardest part of the job was the 12hr. shift you worked of which a lot of time was spent observing computer screens. the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the finished article and smelling the aroma coming from the roasted beans and also the satisfaction of training my fellow workers on how to operate a roaster."

good,Es el lugar perfecto para crecer profesionalmente.
good,"Though place to work, but if you make it, there isn't a better place. If you expect an environment where there will be hand holding and beautiful camaraderie, you are going to be disappointed.

I was responsible for all ordering of parts and equipment for the 24 hour a day operation of the plant. I also ordered chemicals and polymers for the treatment of the Kraft Physical Plants water to my Waste treatment Plant. It took great planning to schedule plant ops. with the 24 hour operation with people schedules, vacations,and every other event that affected the operation. There was then the scheduling of cranes to lift large equipment from tank tops and from the activated sludge lagoons in all weather conditions imaginable. this was the collective challenge of my job and the responsibility of this was very rewarding. What I miss most is the intense contact with all the people I had relationships with along with the intense challenge of creating a clean effluent. This ,in turn allowed the Largest food plant in North America to make millions of tons of food products for America. I really loved my job!"

good,Loved working at Heinz. My only problem was that I was hired through a temp. service and they would say they were going to hire me full time (Heinz) but then a new plant manger started and he decided to give the full time package to someone else in another part of the plant and not to hire a full time nurse for mid-nights.

good,a typical day at kraft Foods was a long day we worked 10hr. days and we had to stay warm. Management was bad also they didn't care about your work area as long as the work got done. such as safety for the workers. And I think the hardest part of the job was staying warm.
good,"A typical day at work would very for me. I might start off cleaning a system then end with calibrating the themometers. I learned to be flexible and to change from one job to another with ease.

good,pipefitting/pipewelder all kinds of pipe using different kinds of alloys.
good,"Very fasted paced, 40 hrs+  Swing shift, I learned several thing while working at Kraft it is a love hate relationship.  You love job and learn to hate the duties however you overcome the duties take the job and learn how to enjoy what you do.  When working in a production area there are times you work with or without others so you have to become both team players and self efficient.  If you don't you will never make it in the real world.  Management does not like complainers they want workers, Co-workers some are team players and some are not some can be friends but at the end of the day there just there to get paid, The hardest part of my job was the swing shifts and adjustment in my home schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I could make friends with my co-workers and I did enjoy my job.  Kraft would show appreciation to there employees for the hard work and dedication."

good,"Since the economy has taken such a spiral downward, management there has tried to overcompensate at times. Days could be really great as long as the warehouse personnel were able to get your truck with the correct orders, and on carts or other items needed to do your job correctly. Being in the Bay Area, I think was the toughest part of the job. Traffic conditions and road construction was never taken into account by the computer that was used to set up store deliveries and times. I, myself, just loved my job. Being a truck driver, and being the best driver I could be."
good,"Watching 5 industrial coffee lines, quality checking the out come of the product."
good,"Boa Empresa para se trabalhar,trabalho em equipe"
good,A typical day is work varies from day to day. Nothing is ever the same for me ever on any given day. I work in a very fast pace environment that gives daily updates on production changes. Management is very involved by giving daily email updates and information on what is going on in a given day. Co-workers are very good team members and always communicate what is going on. The hardest part of my job is when communication is not properly given from top to bottom. You have to be a true leader and have a sense of being on your own to do the job I do. The most enjoyable part of my job is the ability to work on my own and able to attack everything I need to do. I have all the tools I need to do my job on a daily basis. It is very peaceful and relaxed going to work once the work gets started.

good,It's a great place to work and the people there was nice and it was a experience for us to get alone in office and in the work area time went at the great paste
good,Working for this company has its up and downs but overall it’s worth it  The staffing could you some work somethings are not fair  like 25 minute breaks for a 12 hour shift’s we should be able to get longer not everybody works as a team everybody works against each other instead of with each other everybody’s worried about quality and quantity before safety and safety should come first not quality and quantity  not everybody treats everybody as an equal  and we’re all equal

I was taught many things over the years at Kraft foods. The mechanical knowledge that was there to learn from was excellent. I was taught electrical basics, Hydraulics systems, Air systems, HVAC, and many other trades of the industrial maintenance field. The culture at the Madison plant was one of get the job done, teamwork, the hardest part of the job was that there was allot of overtime and sometimes this would be a bad thing on your family life. and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I got to work with everyday a great group of people."
good,"Um local agradável de trabalhar. Aprendi a trabalhar com várias coisas, como carga e descarga o que não sabia.A gerência era muito responsável e os funcionárias eram tratados todos iguais. Dava certo com todos os colegas de trabalho. Não tinha nenhuma parte difícil no trabalho, pois não tinha dificuldade com nada.A parte mas agradável do trabalho era local de trabalho bem apropriado."
good,"I was provided the opportunity to learn and grow in a new career field. Being new to production/manufacturing I had many reservations. The co-workers and management got me through - end result being a great work experience. From the initial training to the end the work culture was to get the job done. I enjoyed the idea of no 2 days would be the same - that definitely was the case. "
good,"Prior to the merge, Kraft Foods was a great place to work. They had a family feel and had a great family work life balance. Benefits were awesome and if my position was not eliminated, I would still be there!"

I set the code date  to specific standards depending on the product that was run on that day. loaded litho into machine.  set my machine to run the correct size of litho.  I ran a metal check every 30 minutes to ensure it was working to prevent product from any metal being sent to customers. Checked litho that was delivered according to recipe.
good,"I called on 4-5 stores in a typical day at Kraft Foods.  Talked to managers in several departments with in the store.  Giving ideas to tie in all Kraft products and help the store sell products and give their customer ideas on new ways to use products in the grocery store.  The hardest part of the job was hearing ""no"" over and over.  You can't take it personally and give up.  You have to ask why and discover new ways to curb the customer's objections.  That required a lot of creativity. "

Learned how to work successfully within cross-functional teams and how to mentor and encourage others to be successful.  Management actively participate in employee development and provided feedback on a consistent basis.  Great companies hire great people and that's who I was fortunate enough to be able to work with.  Some difficult moments were always occurring with scope change of a project and continually readjusting priorities.  The easiest part was rallying the team and facing challenges together.  Planning and executing celebrations for reaching and successfully completing milestones was the most fun."

La parte mas difícil fue cuando ingrese pues yo no tenia experiencia como promotora, el que los encargados me aceptaran con el tiempo y el ir viendo mi manera de trabajar fue difícil un reo pues es una zona difícil y pesada sobretodo con el crecimiento que obtuve, lo que mas me gusto fue ver como creci en todas las tiendas que yo traía y que cuando les avise que me habían dado mi cambio me pedían que no me fuera y como me seguían llamando para darme quejas de los promotores que se quedaron en mi lugar pues no les gustaba la manera de trabajar, ahora en la ruta de san Nicolas también e logrado objetivos.

good,"Kraft Foods was an amazing place to work with a great culture.  That changed when they were bought by 3G and Berkshire Hathaway in July, 2015.  I worked at Kraft for 23 years and had tremendous managers along the way.  I was challenged, rewarded and recognized for my efforts.  I was able to grow and develop in positions that I held in sales, marketing and logistics.  This company supported cross functional assignments at the director level which allowed me to gain exposure outside of sales.  What I loved most about Kraft was the people and the friendships I made there.  I spent the last 10 years working out of my home office so it was a little more challenging to connect with my peers, however it gave me the flexibility I needed to balance work and family."
good,"I love this job you work independently and you get to meet new people. This job was very flexible, management and co-works are team players."
good,"They are downsizing since they merged with Heinz"

good,"A typical day at Heinz for me was checking my machine for debris and any objects on the floor or under my machine that may cause an   accident. Starting my machine up for production and doing my pre-startup inspection. Working at Heinz was a great learning experience for me. I was at Heinz before there was any product being produced. My co-workers and I was trained by the supervisors and the production manager on how to properly set-up each machine. The maintenance mechanics trained employees on clearing out the jams and getting the machines back running. The employees at Heinz was  the hardest working people and productive group of people that I have ever worked with. Management was very helpful and concern with everything that was happening everyday. The management team was helping with production by giving employees breaks and lunch-breaks. I enjoyed working at Heinz because of the people I was working with and the new equipment I was operating, but the hardest part of the job was the adjustment of the schedule every week."
good,Hired as a mixer and was trained I love the it was one of my dreams to work in a place like kraft but my dream was about tastycake but kraft filled the dream but very unionized job and being union there was not any unity meaning throughout the union but over all it was what i dream of working in that kind of environment.

good,called on HQ accounts
good,"Working with Kraft no two days were the same. My main objective was to build relationships with the decision makers in order to get our products on display on the store level. I learned about the selling process, how to manage a business and how different markets effected the business. I worked on my own so we rarely had much interaction with other co-workers. Hardest part of my job was having to travel to different territories from week to week and not being able to keep that relationship you have built or seeing the results of the sales you made the week before. Problem solving was always the best part, because you never knew what the days challenges would be."
good,Empresa empenhada com as opiniões de seus funcionarios e sempre disposta a inovar

We all had a full workload and we all worked very well together. The culture was great and the people were great! I hope I can find another company that invests in its people like Kraft."
good,Working on the RAW side is an all day thing. You don't know when you're getting off because you have to finish all the turkeys. You do make good money on that side. Working on the RTE side is good because you have a set time to get off. The only bad thing is you may have to work 7 days straight every blue moon.
good,"Muito excelente empresa, não tive o que reclamar, Muito aconchegante ."

good,"The typical day of work started around 7am and ran until around 5 or 530 because of the account I had. My manager was great.  I learned a great deal about moving Kraft Foods all over this country and how difficult it can be logistically to ensure case fill rate is properly upheld from production and delivered soundly at the customer warehouse. CPG culture and busy days were prevalent and made the job difficult at times, but the most enjoyable parts of the job were my co-workers."

good,"To be fair, I had a position that required me to work the parking lots, so I only worked for big events.  That being said, they paid very handsomely and even paid us to eat, relax and watch the game while we ate lunch during the dead hours.  It was little tough standing out there for so long, but working one day was the equivalent of receiving a weekly part time pay check."

Since working my job I've learn to be patient and never rush because you may make a mistake. I learned to work safe and keep my machine clean at all time so that it functions better. Management lets you know that you are doing a good job and my co-workers always willing to help out if needed. the hardest part of my job is doing changeovers where you change the parts out for different bottle size. the most enjoyable part of my job is coming to work everday and just smiling knowing that I love my job and interacting with my co-workers.

Por otra parte, desde mi punto de vista pienso que no hubo nada difícil porque sencillamente trataba de hacerlo fácil siendo muy atento y aclarando dudas al momento de las instrucciones de como realizar la actividad.

Management was tight on speed and performance when it came to pulling and stacking which was the hardest. Me and my co-workers had each others back which was best of all. I learned a lot from everyone but had my own way which payed off due to my productivity and days on call. Knowing that the driver got the wright product and no damages on time to customers from my performance on my part sure made it all worth it all. Another thing to sum up with, is that if you were careful and watchful on work and safety, no one got hurt and everyone got their bonuses."

Everyone goes to a meeting with your line and theyll explain what your meat would be like, EVERYONE that I worked with was very curtious, and polite.
