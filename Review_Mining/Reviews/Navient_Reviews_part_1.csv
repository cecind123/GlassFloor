bad,This job is so stressful and most of the supervisors won’t even pay mind to what you do. Speaking for My supervisor who would not engage with her team. She would walk up your aisle and if you would ask for help sometimes she will help others she would say “im not here and walk away”. Other supervisor do care about their team but most just sit at there desk and don’t do anything at all.
bad,"the Milwaukee ,WI has horrible management and set me up for failure. Just another company treating their employees like numbers . Horrible horrible horrible"
bad,They don’t value you. They treat you like a robot not a human being. They give you and employee ID number and that is what you become to them . Just a number. The policy is backwards. The people I worked with at the company was great just not the company itself.
bad,"Compared to the stress of the job, and impossible work expectations, the pay is misserably low. Employees are boxed in super tight. They beg for work from home employee s but then try to say it is a privilege despite work numbers being the same between work from home and office. Toxic place."
bad,Management is terrible the expectation on how fast to get through the calls was ridiculous. If you spoke up asking about getting paid more because they had us doing more work you get fired.
bad,"This company has a horrrible reputation with their clients.  They do student loan, IRS, and state collections and a VERY aggressive.  I felt like I worked for the devil working here, they are not the least bit caring about anyone."
bad,It was not the same once we were bought out by Navient. We went from being a family oriented organization to strictly business. Having gatherings each month to encourage employee participation to only doing the bare minimum. To being free to empower employees to make good judgement decisions to micromanaging employees.
bad,Management is horrible. They dont trian properly and treat you like its your fault. If you need emergency surgery you better not go for it because they threaten your job. You don't work as a team everyone fight against each other . don't make the same mistake I did .... You'll thank me later!
bad,Too much micro managing going on. I was started there when pregnant and had to ask to use bathroom which was ridiculous. I have a Masters degree. Sad!
bad,THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!! Nobody knows what’s every going on. They make you.  Harass  Borrowers. Everyone in management tells  you something different they only care about money and if you don’t make your goal they will fire you. They pay nice yes but go somewhere else and get your nice work ethic appreciated.
bad,No work/life balance unless you can dedicate over 80 working hours in ONE week!! They give you PTO but it is earned with how many hours you work and if you do not work at LEAST 60 hours a week you will never meet your numbers.
bad,"This is regarding the Milwaukee branch located in NAVIENT/ duncan solutions on Wisconsin avenue."
bad,"it's not fun. "
bad,I would rather go through the gas chamber at basic training again before I would work that job.  They make it where you have an 8 million dollar goal and your working current accounts you do not get credit for.  When hired they tell you about all these.top collectors but from what I seen it was the highest turnober rate I have ever seen. I would rather work at McDonald's. They ruin people's lives.especially borrowers
bad,This could be a good job but mgmt stresses and then stresses employees. Dirty environment so you're often sick because people come to work sick. Benefits are poor.
bad,"calls while working can go no longer then 4 minutes or it deducts from work monthly bonus also agent can not go to the bathroom or have any real emergency type event or bonus will be deducted and time is also taken away from break if you leave your desk for ANY reason."
bad,"Navient is not a place for someone that has a Family, because the pay is not good and they pay less than the minimum wage and also the hours that they provide are never enough"
bad,"This place is run by incredibly slimy MF liars. They are constantly hiding illegal behavior behind bad policy. They are settling lawsuits constantly. Nobody in leadership has any idea what they are doing. No job security, and no dignity in working here."
bad,"When I first started training i thought I was really going to love it! But after 5 months of system issues daily, multiple billing issues (THAT THEY WOULD NOT ADMIT TO CUSTOMERS) and having been told for over a month they would be changing our schedule it never happened and they only would give a 2 week notice. If you have kids or take the bus then your screwed out of the job. The corporation its self, AKA Riverlink is a money hungry electronic toll bridge that tricks travelers into thinking its a toll bridge with a booth to pay when there is not one. then they supposedly send a bill to the registered owner of the car, in a perfect world it doesn't sound so bad, but the fact that all my callers were calling in because they had $68 bill that was there first notice and as an agents you can only remove some of the false fees (see the moral problem) and to top of the cake I was trying to leave the company professionally, with a two week notice. After I preformed one week of my last two weeks they fired me...This company is NOT WORTH ANYONE'S TIME! I mean what should i have expected when I was in a training class with my new sup!!"
bad,"Ridiculous work procedures.  No cell phones, constant monitoring by supervisors.  Abusive customers and unrealistic sales goals.  Very unhappy co-workers who were allowed to date."
bad,"Terrible management, competitive teams, company only cares about numbers now their employees or families, bonuses suck, it's like being in high school."
bad,They pay their employees low wages and then make the ability to get a bonus difficult. They pinch pennies and the employees have to pay.
bad,"a very tough place to work. fast paced environment, managers were not very nice. human resources is very good. not a good place for people over 30 years of age to work."
bad,"It is just awful, I lasted a month outside of training. One girl forgot she had her phone on in the training room and turned it off, she got a final written warning for this, in a TRAINING ROOM with no sensitive material whatsoever insight. She never came back. They are continually hiring. I was micromanaged. The managers don't care, all it is about is money and not helping anyone. They watch your every move, you can't even just get up and go to the bathroom without asking. Everything must be clocked in, one minute after is considered late and an infraction. RUN AWAY FROM THIS JOB."
bad,There is no growth for your career and the company is not growing.  I manage over 21 people in the collections department.
bad,"I understand for security reason some measure has to be taken to protect the public information, but it would be nice to know before you are hired that on your first day you are assigned lockers, employees are not able to keep any kind of personal belongings including pocket book next to you, also its terrible for us with small children since we are not allowed to use our cell phones no where in the building not in the lunch are or even restrooms, if there is an emergency we have to wait for the supervisor to listen to there message to be told, salary is very low for the amount of work they ask for"
bad,"The hardest part of my job was trying to break through to the next level and build a career."
bad,was ok I did not like the management there at all. it seemed like they always had false management and were always firing managers.
bad,"•		"
bad,there no professionalism at all the staff worker they fight its the worst place I've ever work
bad,Most people don't make 90 days.the goals and quality expectations are too high. Mandatory overtime does not leave a good work-life balance. Management is not vetted correctly.
bad,I hated the job I hated I hate it the queue they kept putting me in they set goals for you that you can never meet and then won a write you up for not meeting them just so you couldn't bonus and they couldn't and didn't have to pay you more money
bad,"This is one of the worst places I have EVER worked! Management is NOT on the same page as each other. Everyone tells you to do something different. If you can find a job else where, I would HIGHLY recommend it! I have never worked in such a disrespectful, dirty and unorganized place! I hated it!!!!"
bad,"Started off ok, but quickly realized it's an environment that fosters unhealthy competition and fuels interdepartmental feuds between co-workers. Management is there but not present. Shows favoritism. You're just a butt in a seat there. They let go anyone and everyone. For example a friend was just laid off after almost 7 years, because they did away with her position. With as high a turnover as this place and this industry (call center COLLECTIONS) has, you'd have thought they would have wanted to keep a top performing employee, who was dedicated, there for a really long time in industry standards and who was promoted twice in their tenure. But no. Horrible."
bad,"Worked in collections. 5 weeks, then you talk to people who didn't pay their student loans and try to get the money."
bad,"Navient branched out to start Xtend Health in Irving Tx, the doors opened late April 2019, from April to July we sat at a 3x3 Ft cubicle, in a loud noisy call center. They hired a Supervisor and Manager who knew nothing about running a start up Revenue Cycle Dept. Day to day we sat there with NO work from April to July. No training offered whatsoever. By the time everyone was able to log on to the clients portal all we did was make improper adjustments for there client in California (lol) they absolutely had NO clue how to properly teach or set in place policies and or procedures to properly work acts! They had no idea, we needed a fax machine, way to print claims, look up claims and so on! That place is like a train waiting to derail! They took On California’s medi-cal accts which are completely different from any other Medicaid program. It was so horrible to watch management in a so called training class to teach us medi-cal and they didn’t even know u had to have certain access to speak to an insurance rep. They fumbled the entire time! Not knowing how to properly run a CBO they lost good people! And still more are leaving. These two managers wouldn’t know how to bend over and tie there shoe! They have zero start up experience. When the client finds out all they’re doing is adjusting balances to this day, that contract will be lost! Word of advice, ditch those two incompetent leaders within the Irving office and hire Adequate leadership who can guide!"
bad,"You are monitored on every call, they have cameras on you. Employees are even followed into the break room so if you take a bathroom break and you want a water from the break room your wrote up for signing out for a bathroom break when you should have signed out for regular break. Hours are bad because there are no 8 to 5 jobs at Navient  you work 3 day shifts and 2 night shifts with mandatory Saturdays every month. Don't use leave time if your sick or else all that you worked for to advance is gone. You start back at the beginning with the other rookies and the bonuses are smaller in the beginning. Bad over all experience unless maybe your just out of high school."
bad,"Started as a customer service representative up until higher management forced us to blend in both customer service and collections. Ever since that time, it has been a horrible place to work for. Management is not organized but they expect you to know what you are doing. If you are not bonusing (which is by the way, they made it nearly impossible since the training),  they basically shove everything down your throat (via micromanaging from supervisors, TL’s  and managers),  until you do what they “expect you to do”. Prior to the training, I was bonusing every month up until this forced training. There was also a time in which I was able to balance between work and my family until this training took place. The reason for all this is to keep employees around so they could appear as though it is a busy and thriving call center so it could keep the company afloat. I definitely would not recommend this company unless you are willing to be cold and indifferent to customers."
bad,The management for this place is terrible. There is no room for advancement and the few promotions they do give are based off of favoritism. Supervisors are very unprofessional and if your not apart of a “click” you won’t last very long. Very high turnover rate which is why they’re advertising for the position frequently.
bad,"I worked this job for 3 months and I was miserable. The training wasn't to bad but it does not prepare you for what you have to deal with on the phone or call center floor. There are a ton of things regarding this job being horrible that I could say. But to make a long story short, If you dont have an outside life (kids or family) and if you enjoy being miserable every day of the week, 8 hrs of your day. This is the job for you. The management have no idea what they're doing. The whole system is not realistic. It's just a horrible place to work. Only thing I enjoyed were my weekends away from this place."
bad,"Terrible management.  Mass layoffs, then advertise that they are hiring, only to bring in kids right out of college to replace older, more experienced employees.   No advancement opportunity."
bad,"The goal for each CRS as far as call time and other stats are unrealistic. Most people call in are upset or frustrated,because they are unable to pay their payment, website issues or help with paper work"
bad,Worked here for 7.5 years. My last 2 years were the worst. Poor  management caused majority of their to people to leave or be forced out. They don't care about your life or family issues. Being that that are a student loan company that so called helps students. They weren't flexible with employees that wanted to reattend  school. The supervisor's are like pimps when you hit goal they get a check. They don't do any work to help you be more successful. The managers and reps are sleeping with each other. Not to mention the fraudulent activity that is being done on borrowers accounts.. And again this was my experience from the last two years. Don't work here!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"It was a horrible experience. I felt like a prisoner inside a cell. The company tracked every mouse click and every word you sad on the phone. And to top it all off the managers and higher ups had to know where you were every second of the day. You had to put yourself in personal status for a bathroom break,break status for you 15 minute breaks and lunch for your lunch. Also, the higher ups would only allow you 30 minutes of personal time a week. I would not recommend to anyone. It was good pay but not worth the stress and aggravation. I had  a mental breakdown workthing at that place. I felt suffocated and like I couldn't breathe being stuck in a cubicle all day long."
bad,"A work week consists of working three days in the morning (8-5pm) and two days in the afternoon (12-9pm). You get two 15 minute breaks which are timed, you get an hour for lunch which is also timed. Basically everything is monitored and micro managed to the fullest. Low pay, long hours, only positive thing is the benefits. Poor management, they have no idea what they are doing. They reap all the benefits of your hard work. Very little if any opportunity for advancement unless you can make it there for at least a year but most likely 2-3 years. Also you can expect to work at least one Saturday a month. You have no life outside of work because they always want you to work extra hours. The job itself is not hard, its whether or not you can take being micro managed all day every day. Only thing I enjoyed were the people I worked with and the benefits. If you need a temp job for awhile I would recommend it but if you are actually looking for a career opportunity, this is the farthest thing from it."
bad,Very minimal training which results in mistakes because of the lack of training and you are held accountable for the lack of support then you get let go for job performance. Terrible company.
bad,"Serious micro-managing/younhave to meet every goal if you want to keep your job/ there's no such thing as positive reinforcemwnt at this place! Every move you make is under a microscope! You not only have to clock in and out but you have to sign in and out everyday on paper! When you go to the bathroom you have to notify your supervisor! You only get PTO ,no floating holidays or sick days! so if you need to go to the dr. you better have the pto or you won't be going! The customers are half way slow! Example: I need help with this umemployment deferment but idk what to put for my unemployment date? Then you have sneaky supervisors always tattling on you for the silliest things and trying to get you fired for nthg! They dnt help you with none of questions because too busy on smoke breaks or with headsets on pretending that they are monitoring calls but really they don't want to be bothered!  Everytime you look up they hiring a new class and only 2 last for about 2 months! This company is horrible! I really wish i would have thought twice about working here! They will work you to death and treat you like you dpn't even matter! There is no loyalty here! I ome in early everyday and it is a shame that if I have to tale my children to school because they miss they bus I get a point for it! I can go on and on!"
bad,This company does not have your back. That’s why they are hiring new employees constantly. Employees Are disposable to this company and management thinks they are better than you.
bad,"Upper management is shady to the max, everything is who you know rather than your actual performance, everyone is very cut throat, regulatory issues as well as lawsuits and mandatory OT are a constant."
bad,"I worked with Navient as a customer service rep in their call center, helping borrowers with their student loan accounts. This was the most stressful, emotionally traumatic job I've ever had. Many callers were upset, depressed, stressed out, rude and verbally abusive. Calls are regularly monitored by various levels of management, and in my opinion company policies regarding what causes an infraction while on a call are way too strict, nit picky even. But those infractions can cause reps to be written up, terminated or to lose monthly bonuses. Calls are back to back on most days so be prepared to talk almost constantly for 8 hours per day. And employees are under a lot of pressure to take as many calls as possible, while trying to remember to ""stick to the script"" to avoid infractions. Mandatory shift changes cause employees to be periodically moved from day shift to night shift or afternoon shift, etc. Monthly bonuses help a lot but can be easily reduced or lost. And hefty taxes are taken out of them. In my opinion management at all levels only care about themselves and other managers, and consider employees working under them as easily expendable and replaceable. I felt that we were being purposely reminde3333d of that every day. I resigned when everything became too much to tolerate. My advice would be not to work for Navient."
bad,"I really wanted to like the job because the money was decent. My entire class was told things in interviews that turned out to not be true, like that the shift differential would pay higher. That is only true if four out of your five shifts per week are the later shifts."
bad,"No room for advancement due to longtime mgt and employees who do not like like intelligent, enthusiastic people who can think outside the box and feel that going the extra mile in whatever you do is a waste of time."
bad,"There is absilutely no consistency between supervisors and team leaders. Attendance policy is pathetic and draconian-- penalized for leaving sick even if you make up the hours."
bad,Day in and day out you are micromanaged by uneducated managers with zero professionalism.  You call people all day to collect money.  The bonus structure is a joke.  Stay away unless you are extremely desperate.
bad,"I'm sure this place isn't too bad if you want to simply take phone calls. But if you are applying in order to advance your career I would advise against applying. This company has a 1980s way of going about their business. Company first mentality is a must. And you will be expected to sacrifice everything in order to have a chance to advance. "
bad,management was terrible. you don't get paid enough for the mental abuse you go through from the customers you speak to.  Overall a very stressful work enviorment.
bad,Only the popular advance. If you are good at sucking up you will fit right in. The bonus incentive structure keeps going down pretty soon everyone will make 13 per hour and have no bonus at all.
bad,Horrible experience. Horrible management. It was the worst job I’ve ever had in my life.They were unfair. They were very racist. They showed favoritism. I don’t recommend them.
bad,"A lot of what you are told in training are complete lies.  When they tell you that you have job security when you underperform, it's a lie.  You can get fired for underperforming.  When they tell you that you are apart of a positive team environment, they are lying.  it's cutthroat and everyone is out for themselves and could care less about you individually.  What you learn from training and take to the floor, management tells you to throw what you learned out the window and learn from what they tell you.  It kinda makes training a waste of time and energy!  That is how bad the disconnect between training and management are!  "
bad,"No one knows what's going on. You'll hear different things from each member of management as it pertains to a single job function. Nothing is explicit. They now have shift bids so if you have a rough month due to family emergencies or birth of a child you'll automatically be placed on the 2:30p-11p or 12:30p-9p shifts Monday through Friday. So, you get no work/life balance. And their metrics for their bonus are inversely related. If you succeed in 1 it's going to hurt another.  They'll flash the $1500 monthly bonus but it's nearly impossible to hit. And throw most of the training out the window because it will change.   Also, the borrowers you typically speak to aren't that bad."
bad,"This job is for people who basically have no soul. Its completely mentally draining and frustrating. The monthly, weekly and daily goals are unrealistic. I'm prior military and this job was more stressful. Team leads are no where to be found 90% of the time you need help and managers will rarely help you and get agitated when asked a question."
bad,maintaining great customer service the company is a good company although they failed to give proper training. during the time at the job it was a challenge but i enjoyed it
bad,Surrounded by incompetency. The management team is not only clueless but uncaring about their employees. People are promoted for not wjhat they know but because of what they don't know so they can be lead around like blind mice.
bad,Culture is stressful. No one stays longer than the initial 90 days. Older workers are phased out. Mandatory overtime and high pressure production and quality goals.
bad,This company sucks. Its call after call after can after call getting yelled at over and over and over and 9over again a 100 times a day while you're being micromanaged
bad,Training for this job DOES NOT prepare you for the floor. What they teach you in the class is nothing like what you will actually be doing. Almost two months in I still didn’t know what I was doing.
bad,It was a good place to work with excellent benefits. Management was friendly and helpful when needed. It was a competitive environment but in a friendly way.
bad,Typical Car work. You do the same work as a standard call center. Answer incoming calls and place outgoing calls to customers. Try to resolve accounts.
bad,This place is a joke you might to start kissing up right now. The managers downstairs play favorites. The head manager is a joke to be nice. If you pass gas to loud they will fire you for it.
bad,"typical day working was data entry and processing student loan applications. "
bad,"I was pregnant and lost the baby , the company didn't care. They don't accept excuses, so if somebody dies depending on who it is, you have to bring in a funeral sheet to show you went to the funeral. The managers get to use their phones but you can't be on your phone at all unless you are on another floor. They are unorganized, policies change, turnover rate high nobody in there."
bad,Made it seem not like a call center during interview. WRONG! Couldn't be any closer to other call centers I worked at. Horrible mentality from others who worked there for years. Supervisors didn't seem to give a hoot about their job either.... I won't ever go back there to work!
bad,Some managers are great some are not the company not so much the policies are ridiculous the systems are a mess they set ridiculous goals the job is great for some and sucks for others
bad,"stressful job at least at the one in Newark Delaware, if your money driven then it might work for you. If you cant sit at a desk all day then don't even apply"
bad,"don't work here unless you have no alternative. They get paid.contracts renewed based on the number of calls they can take. They don't need people, just robots."
bad,Trainging was a short 2 weeks ...was supposed to be 4 weeks...tgey was hiring and starting classes every other week. After training your on the floor alpine taking calls with very little help ...
bad,They promise you the world in the beginning. Management do not care about you or your complaints and issues. I’ve had very inappropriate incidents with my supervisor. I have been held against my will in meeting rooms to having been screamed at for standing up for myself and my performance. The management doesn’t care to help you if you don’t follow their ways. They just cover things up.
bad,"I love working at Navient, but I do not think they fairly compensate their management staff. I am looking for additional income to purchase a new vehicle with paying off some debt."
bad,"This job was very high stress and made me feel very overwhelmed.  "
bad,It was just a high school job to make money while still attending school. Unprofessional environment. Poor management.
bad,"Management only focuses on numbers (clearing delinquency on each account) they want you to get on and off the phone with each customer which I feel takes away from us helping the customer get the best options, you work long and hard to hit goal while supervisors do nothing all day."
bad,"Good place to work if you are on the correct team. You do not have the option to stay on a team, if they decide to move you, you have to move."
bad,I worked for GRC for 4 months. They didnt honor the schedule they claimed they would give me when i interviewed and initially got the job. You have a monthly goal you have to meet in order to keep your job. The managers suck and the enployees act like high school students.
bad,Not bad if you are into working long hours with impossible demands. Call center enviornment with the potential for grwoth through other departments
bad,The constant amount of overtime makes it hard to have a nice work to home balance. The lack of management and training make it hard to improve your job performance even if you ask for help.
bad,The position required more work than allowed for the required 50 hours of a week. The standards set by the regulatory agencies and the company standards did not allow the advocate to work for the customer.
bad,I would tell anyone not to their full time job to take this job. Navient has unreasonable goals with strict performance reviews. If unable to obtain your employment will last less than a year. Management plays favorites. I felt I was not working for the consumer but working for the company.
bad,"mangers played favorites, if you were not liked you were not helped, training does not cover everything you will need when you go live, feed back is poor. unwilling to take the time to assist in weaknesses. has un-achievable work expectations that cause the hiring to be a revolving door."
bad,"Call center customer service is extremely, extremely stressful at Navient. Reps speak with angry customers and get surveyed by them. Work schedules are involuntarily changed periodically. Calls are monitored by management and reps are scored poorly for things such as asking the caller to repeat something they said, or for not talking for more than 30 seconds while trying to take care of the customer's account. The money and benefits are great but still not worth the daily hassles and stressful environment created by management."
bad,"Management at navient does not care about employees at all. Management thinks if they waive enough money in your face you’ll forget about having peace of mind. They can barely get anyone to stay, even with the extra monthly incentives they offer if that tells you something! You’re expected to take the phone calls back to back with less than 30 seconds in between calls. Customers are verbally abusive and we’re told to just take it! Only get a certain amount of time off the phones and if you’re sick or need to use the restroom more than twice a day, too bad because they will just write you up. This company expects you to put the business needs before your own, so if you have a life or other things to worry about, wouldn’t recommend! Put in my two weeks and the next day they were watching my every move and harassing me, so I ended up quitting. Also had a run in with the director of the call center because I didn’t not want to work overtime and was told that I was selfish and did not care about anyone but myself. Happy to be out of the stressful and toxic environment."
bad,"No morales by most of management and a lot of agents are only there to hit bonus however they can bring the borrower current right then. Management pushes talk time to be low, even if the customer is trying to ask valid questions,etc.   Not doing what is best for customer. Everyone is dating everyone. Married or not!  Affairs ...one after another, promotions are not based off doing a great job; but I have seen more than once based off who up the chain a person dated. My biggest issue is not doing what’s best for the customer. It’s all about getting the account current that minute to go towards your monthly goal.   I was no longer able to work under such conditions. Working at Navient went against everything I stood for, believed in, etc. it was not this way until 2 or 3 years ago.  My first 5 years were great!  Agents come to work under the influence of marijuana or alcohol and senior management looks the other way!!!!!  Would not recommend Navient to anyone, unless you have no morales, no work ethic, no integrity,etc. they sucked the life out of me, but I left before they could take away who I really am and what I stand for!"
bad,"My supervisor and others in management were very understanding of employee circumstances. However, most of the management could not care less about their employees. The environment of the workplace was poor due to the type of individuals being hired. I am all for diversity but I am not okay with having individuals who sagged their pants past their knees sitting next to me at my JOB. "
bad,I would not recommend this employer due to their lack of care for you yourself and your family. I have been involved for just over 1 year and It is almost impossible to move up in this company. I have had so many promises made and none of them have ever been executed. I was hired and told after training I would be switched to first shift and I am currently still not able to switch shifts. I am not the only one they promised this to.
bad,The competitive nature of grading employees creates a degraded atmosphere for many of the employees. There is little appreciation for tenured staff who are laid off when it suites the companies budget needs.
bad,Communications from Senior Management is not very good. Middle managers are not informed or empowered to handle bad employees correctly. Too many bad apples have been there for a long time.
bad,"Answer over 1200 calls a month. Stressful environment, untrained supervisors. Some incentives, limited promotion and very long hours. Met some new people,"
bad,"This is a typical call center."
bad,The pay here is good and definitely livable but it’s not worth the verbal and mental abuse you undergo on a daily basis. The managers I had were great. I ended up having a mental breakdown after I was fired simply because there was no work life balance at all and the verbal abuse of customers on the phone was outrageous. It just breaks you down after a while. I was terminated because I didn’t meet the monthly goal three months in a row due to the fact that they were constantly changing the systems we used to call people and the goal was totally outrageous.
bad,"There is a strong emphasis on production with little assistance. Tenure is not important to the company. Additionally, raises are minimal. Work is repetitive and not fulfilling."
bad,"Since the job is Customer Service Representative, you would think customer service would be a priority. It’s not. Your bonus is based on metrics and the 2 metrics with the highest weight are handle time and resolves. In English, they want you to get the customer to pay and get them off the phone. Period. Staying on the phone and actually helping a customer is discouraged. Customer service reps are treated like cattle. With little notice you’re asked to gather your things and move to a new desk and a new manager. I worked there for 1 year and 9 months and I did this 6 times. Very stressful, very competitive and constant change. Taking this job was a mistake."
bad,"My time at Navient was filled with both excitement and dread.  While the vision of the company is clearly stated, it appeared that the downline management had a difficult task following it."
bad,"Culture is terrible. Sit all day and do data entry, same day over and over. Must do specific tasks in timely manner, have to hit a quota in a certain time period."
bad,"Call center is unmanned; little to no resources. Management doesn't like for employees to go above and beyond.  Must accrue time prior to taking time off.  Pay is far lower than most call centers.  This call center will cause you to feel aniexity, and not motovated to do anything but show up."
bad,this is a place to work and earn a pay check. They expect you to show up to work on time. The expect you to do your work. The give you a pay check for the work you do.
bad,I would not recommend working here if you are family oriented or of you have any health issues that prevent you from sitting at a desk for hours at a time.
bad,"This job is extremely stressful. I worked on both the servicing side and the collection side. In servicing you're taking anywhere from 80-100 calls a day, and you only get a 30 min lunch. Its pretty hard to obtain bonus. "
bad,Company ok bonuses are based on how fast you van get them off the phones and survey take rate. Once you leave company you can never come back at the managers discretion.  Worked there for 7 months and had to leave the state for family emergency so I resigned  I reapplied a month later they started the process again and before my interview they called to tell me I could never come back but with no explanation why from HR.
bad,"It’s not for everyone! This job is for a well-trainer, strong-minded person. It has great benefits and rewards, however, not everyone it able to commit to a job such as this."
bad,Has job force reductions too often. Does not promote training. More concerned about upper management and does not consider the person on the lower totem pole.
bad,"At first, this would seem like your dream job but as time passes you realize they only care about themselves; Managers & Supervisors. They only care about their numbers being up. At first, I cared a lot about this job but then I gave up and started worrying about me instead of being their slave. I mostly stayed for a year so I can build experience and would not look so bad on my resume. I was doing loan specialist and EACH TEAM had different answers for every scenario regarding IDR applications and 90% of them do things incorrectly and for the team lead or supervisor in that role it's ""okay"". Thank God, my team lead was amazing."
bad,"The managers aren’t helpful at all, I was in a mentoring position to help people on our team, and the type of people they hire are unteachable.  Overall it wasn’t horrible but I’d never go back."
bad,"Started out in customer service managers were great and the call volume was good. Was always a top performer. This year the combines collections with customer service, and we had no choice in the matter. Either you did both or you quit. We lost about 3/5  of the floor because of it. The colletion mangers didn't know anything about servicing and always gave out wrong info. After the combining of the roles it send like the customer service role went right out the window. the bonuses where geared more toward collections and the way we had to handle calls were now more geared to collection even when there was no need for it."
bad,The pay is not what the company makes it out to be. Workers were sold lies about the expected income. The managers are NOT at all supportive. It's a competition with everything. It was like being in high school all over again.
bad,"Training is ok but too much to learn in a very short amount of time. Managers are nice until your on the floor after training and ask for help. (which you never get) Lots of micro-managing with no help when you need it. They expect you to know everything as soon as your out of training then they act like your a bother, talk down to you, and make you feel like an idiot for even asking for help. System applications they use are old and make you go through a million steps just to do one simple thing. I guess its ok if you've never worked with more advanced/modern system applications before."
bad,The only thing Navient cares about is Numbers. How many calls you can closeout no matter if you resolve the callers issue. You are only given 5 minuets to resolve complex issues involving student loans that would truly take a min of 15 minuets to solve. Management enforces that best solution for Navient not for the borrower.
bad,"Worked there for about 2 years, after getting out of training and going to the floor to take calls you might actually not mind it for a few months. Where I was at you were contracted to work on accounts that were owned by the company but also owned by Department of Education. Later on you will be taught to handle also private loans that are practically credit based loans. It is a standard call center regarding metrics so expect being told to get your metrics down 24/7. You'll take payments, you're lower payments, explain how stuff works in the student loan world, send out information and the works. "
bad,"If you have any type of stress or anxiety issues this is not the job for you. "
bad,"nice work environment, but management is very much clique orientated.....they will tell you in training that 40 to 50 hours a week you will hit bonus but the reality is its more like 60 to 70 hrs and then maybe, just depends on which department you get in....if you just work 8 hrs a day be ready for your supervisor to question you as to why you wont/cant work more hours, their bonus is based on yours...now they do have drawings and stuff, on saturdays they will give ya donuts and juice.....its not too bad but the pressure is very very very high to hit your numbers"
bad,"Working at Navient was a great experience. The money is great. But the managers are pretty bias, females will thrive in that environment more than males. A lot of ego issues at Navient. Supervisors and Managers tend to abuse their authority a lot. They tend to forget the ""team' aspect of the job and place more work on the regular employees so they can walk and talk most of the day, instead of actually working just as hard as the employees they manage/supervise. Lastly, if you're an opinionated, confident snd morally based individual. That could be your down fall at this company. They want doers , not thinkers. Robots instead of creators."
bad,"If you do not work in collections you don’t matter. Heavy workloads with little time to get thinks done . Pay is really bad for the amount of work you do. Highest raise I’ve received has been 40 measly cent. In this company it is not what you know it’s who you know. If you are not related to anyone or friends with someone with a higher position  in the company you will never be promoted or recognized. They love to sweep things under the rug.  You never know when you will be fired, here you not actually fired for things like work performance and attendance they will fire you if you complain and if they don’t have a liking for you. Company is filled with old bitter gossiping women they all gossip about each other and management nearly does any work BEWARE!!!!!"
bad,"I loved my job! I worked with excellent people. The worst about Navient is Senior Management. I believe I lost my job because SM made bad decisions, very sad! Not just myself but many others as well. I had not been in my new position a year at the time the lay offs occurred. I was just getting to the point where I knew what I was doing. No job security. I had a great rapport with direct managers. Senior management barely had rapport with those in the trenches, never really saw or spoke with them. Kind of invisible. Overall, for me it was a good place to work not withstanding the layoffs. I am a 24 year veteran and they still let me go. As a matter of fact, the month prior to my layoff, they honored the veterans with breakfast and a keepsake coin which I would like to mail back to the CEO and let him know what he can do with his coin."
bad,"Was there for over a year, always bonused did very well , horrible abusive supervisor was only down fall and favoritism is a huge role for MSB court/debt department, high stress , always change, enjoyed the job , of course there is always pros and cons, negatives I have is was released so fast I was practically shoved out the door like I had a disease, second negative was did not get my June 2018 bonus."
bad,The prior supervisor was a bit of a micro manager and  like to keep up with every move that was made and questioned everything.  She was not very trusting of her employees.
bad,Typical Corp run company. All about the bottom line. Push production factor. Not a people oriented atmosphere. Your a number.. only thing I liked about it was my hours of work.
bad,"answering phones all day"
bad,"Kellie possesses a strong work ethic. She demonstrates respect and is committed to providing a positive"
bad,"The work and life balance is the best benefit here. The paid time off they give is very beneficial, as well as the additional paid holidays. They are flexible if you need a day off for any reason, as long as ample notice is given."
bad,I would of Recommended if it wasn’t taken over by Navient. When the Company was Msb/ Gila it was organized . Unfortunately it is all over the place now. No one is together. And Honestly it isn’t the customers. It is the management. If you want Good hours & Holidays off this is the place to be. But if you also want to be stressed out everyday worry if you will have a job in the am while being  mirco Managed and not treated like your not an human being that’s your choice.
bad,"Good wages and benefits. days are long and boring spend all day on the phone repeating yourself to customer after customer. supervisors will always push for your numbers to be better, but that's just so they can get their bonuses. employee bonuses sound great until you get your first one and realize they take more than the average taxes out of it. ""gift tax"", and they also do this with any other prizes and bonuses you get as well."
bad,"Very good job, polite supervisors and easy money to be made some rude customers can get on the phone but you have to learn how to corporate with them and learn how to talk to to people"
bad,"Job just wasn't for me, to far of a drive, they have a point system and no lead way on being late you cant be a min late or it's half a point. if you don't make bonus 3 months in a row they will fire you"
bad,Very fast pace work environment.  Must keep to your schedule the best you can.  On the phones all day servicing customers who have student loans.
good,"The upper management is making some very corporate-america decisions. Meaning that the decisions they make show how little they care about people. Decisions are far too focused on the money, which causes them to lose out on more money over time."
good,This job is slow pace for the most part. You sit in a chair on the phone all day trying to help people find solutions for student loans to not default.
good,Not very flexible. No room for advancement. Work load was more than one employee could handle. No salary increases. Decent benefit options. Decent paid time off.
good,"sign in to computer and programs. log in to phone and wait for calls to come in, start looking up debtors and their family make calls to try and reach debtors and take in coming calls as they came in and transfer calls to right customer service repetitive."
good,Your average corporate job. Some promotions based on favortism versus work ethic. More about who you know/like and less about hard work and dependability.
good,"Navient is a great company to get your foot in the door to the banking industry, however they are one of the lower paying banks in De. Don't expect to be able to have a healthy home/work balance as you will live at navient to be able to support yourself"
good,"My typical day at Navient in my position would be working continuously from 830 AM to normally 7 PM Monday through Friday.  The job was so stressful and fast paced I was not afforded the opportunity to have a lunch or personal break often.  Taking a break would just put you further behind and make you work later."
good,I've been with the company for 6 years. Good company. I can't complain about the company. Its the people that works there that can damage
good,"I did not agree with the automated queue calling people before/ after the hours states have put into law.  It was not changed by management until clients complained."
good,"honest it was a very stressful job. numbers of people were being let go every month due to performance because they did not reach the goal that they had set for the team members to reach."
good,"Working at Navient has helped employees to achieve their short term goals. For a call center, it does pay average to a little more than average, depending on your benefit selection. For the most part, the people you work with here are great. Everyone has a ""Let's suffer together"" attitude. If you're in the call center, you're dealing with student loans 9 times out of 10. You're dealing with people who have taken them out, but don't read what they sign for. People only call in if there is hardship. Fridays are payment days, but hardship still exists. It's a call center. People cannot see the face they are talking to. This means that they will hang up on you, curse you out, threaten you, threaten themselves, call in with 3rd parties, cry, be upset, etc. If you work here, you have to live by helping people that want the help. As a person, you cannot help someone who does not want help. They have a cafe on site that serves breakfast and lunch for a price. Vending machines are on site as well. Break rooms with free coffee and creamer/sugar in all of them when available. A typical Shift is 8 hours. 2 fifteen minute breaks that are paid, and one 30 minute lunch that is not paid. A PTO bank is not given at the start of employment. You have to accrue PTO over the course of working at Navient. Dental and Vision benefits are good. Medical is Average. Company does a 5% 401k match contribution through Fidelity Investments. Discounted Stock Purchase Plan is available. Call center is rows and rows of desks. You will not have your own cubicle as a regular customer care specialist. Training"
good,It used to be a really exciting and growing environment but now things seem to be going downhill (and has been for the past couple years). Merging some departments and outsourcing others makes employees concerned about their future with the company.
good,"Collection is very stressful pay is good but not worth the stress. I think its a great job for younger people but not as you start to age and have kids its takes too much out of you ,family should always come first and I do not feel that companies take that into consideration."
good,"Decent place to work if you don't get laid off, management is fair, annual pay increases, pay was decent for the work performed. They're moving to job to a less expensive COL area.  Discouraging when you're a single parent and the only source of income for the family."
good,"Lots of good benefits, high pay (if performance is good) and lots of perks but not worth dealing with the unorganized management and terrible hours. Suggested for a close friend to work there and immediately apologized because it's really not worth the overwhelming stress. The company itself is terrible and they know it. Borrowers hated me for working there, not worth being berated on the phone."
good,A typicical day at work you  are responsible to answer all emails within 6 hours of receiving them.  Answer all Client inquiries received by phone same day if possible.
good,"The base pay is very low for the amount of work you are doing. The management makes it seem like this job will make you so much money every month which is a lie. I met monthly goals, and bonus checks were even too low. They tax bonus checks insanely too much. Even the best collectors sometimes don't even get bonus checks. This job is all about luck not skill. The environment is fun, management is ok. I would not recommend this company solely because they under pay."
good,"Answer phone calls, counsel borrowers on delinquent student loan accounts.  Advise customers of options, finding the best solution for the customer.  Handle both inbound and outbound phone calls."
good,"The work was just repetitive and it left me unfulfilled. I didn't come to work feeling like I was making a difference and it was just something I had to do to take care of my responsibilities outside of work. I went to work, made calls, got cursed out and yelled at by the customers from time to time, and had to hear about what I was or wasn't doing compared to my peers. I learned that when you know what you're talking about you have to sound like it. "
good,"Every day was very typical. Repeat what you did the previous days. The hours were very long when there were no accounts to resolve. The stress behind that was we had a goal to meet at the end of every month. Unfortunately, we did not control how many accounts we resolved. Meeting our goal was more so based on how many hours you were there waiting for the accounts to come in. That was the hardest part. Not being able to do anything about whether you accomplished your days goal. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people. I met some great friends at Navient. They became family. Overall, I thank Navient for the learning experience."
good,"Navient is a good company to work for starting out. For one, it taught me a lot about the student loan industry and how to take care of my own loans out of college. It also has taught me to be a goal oriented person, as each month you are given a goal that is attainable if you put in the hours and overtime. "
good,This job is very stressful and demanding. Pays well but little chance of advancement any many departments. Often work 15 and 12-hour shifts. ICP is very strict and can be quite challenging. They have a very high turnover rate.
good,"If you’re looking to get cussed out over the phone everyday with okay pay then this job is perfect for you. Almost all of the management don’t know what they are doing and they are learning everyday like you do. If you work here, you’ll find that some coworkers are more informed than managers. The job is just okay. You could do better but you could do worse."
good,"It is at the same time both quick paced and slow paced. It is boring as all get out but you're also taking a decent number of calls. It pays really well but at the same time everyone feels like they're about to be fired. One small misstep and that it, you're gone. I dont think I know anyone who actually enjoys it. I personally hate it and I'm dreading going to work tomorrow, which is why I'm on Indeed tonight, because before I get too invested in this job I'm getting OUT."
good,The pay is fantastic but the quantity of time spent to get that exceeds what any person should need to work to hit the goals required. They expect you to live in the office to meet their goals without helping to advance you to a more beneficial role.
good,good ppl but nothing else but a pay check. company will do anything to hit their numbers including harassing employees to get numbers that are only possible in perfect situations
good,The company cut staff at the end of 2017 leaving a lot of people out of work. The company's future is uncertain leaving employees in doubt if they will still have a job in the near future.
good,Talking to customer offering options on payment arrangements on student on loans. Utilizing tools and programs and delivering excellent  services care
good,Navient could be a good place to work if they would concentrate on getting everyone auto pay and also they want you to get payments if you don't you will be on that bad side and they would treat you like you're nothing
good,"There were many opportunities for self leaning (on the job), when workload allowed. There were no professional level training courses available. I do not recommend working at the Wilkes-Barre site if you're not a ""local."" The culture there is terrible, as is for the entire Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area. It wasn't about what you knew, but who you knew."
good,It’s ok job to work for if you in need of job. Definitely a good job for young people who are fresh from high school or college. Hours are ok if you want to do late shifts
good,"Starting out it was fine the dept I was in didnt put much emphasis on the monthly goal, but if you reached it you would get a bonus. about a year of being there this changed and if we didnt meet our goal, which most of the dept didn't, we were written up. after 4 of these write ups you will be fired"
good,Have to be teachable and patient. Also be skilled in conflict resolution. You deal with mostly angry customers. Attendance is another big part of the position.
good,My management trusted me to get work done and was not overbearing. He was very helpful and cared to help out. The call center we supported did not have the customer or staff's best interest in mind and made it difficult to feel positive about the work we were doing.
good,They is pay is great but the job is mentally draining and stressful with a lot of micro managing and unrealistic goals. It's worth it if you can manage the stress.
good,Very challenging and fast-paced environment.  Often far too many meetings during a typical day to meet important project deadlines. Executive management adheres to corporate values.
good,They have great benefits and flexibility for those not working on the phones. There is not a career path or mentor training. Non phone department can be fun to work in but will have large work load.
good,"Fast paced and yet boring "
good,"At first it was a good job,  then management became hard to deal with, they were not flexible or family oriented. I was denied days off for doctor visits, i would get write ups for having family emergencies and missing schedule days. i would not work for this company again."
good,"The benefits at this company are actually pretty awesome. You get 3 weeks of paid vacation your first year, they have phenomenal health insurance and the dress code a pretty relaxed. There's so much coverage, you can pretty much take off whenever you want without much notice."
good,The most part of this job that I loved was my team. The people here really look out for each other. Only thing I don't like is collecting money from people.
good,It is a great job to start with and learn communication skills and to try to help many people on the phones. You learn many different systems to help in your job to run all at once for multitasking and talking with many people over the phones. It is a wonderful environment to work in and all of your coworkers will help if there is any issue you have.
good,tough environment. very competitive.  you do not get bonuses all the time. pay is okay. you are on the phones all day. you must learn  state and debt collecting laws. they do provide fun work activities. they do  accommodate you with family issues and health issues!
good,"Bottom line high turnover,stressful..Disabled employee .At times treated like second class cititzen…..Very clickish.Management never on  point ...Would say the hardest part is showing"
good,"Some employees could get to make up time over an absence. Others could not and were termnated.  They do promote from within. But they fail to administer the rules, and the law, equitably."
good,I worked there for a little under a year. I always hit my bonuses each month. Pay was great. The only problem I ever had was management (or lack there of). Human resources tries to avoid human interaction. Supervisors do not want to take escalations. Employees are guilty until proven innocent. HR attempted to fire me based on misinformation provided by their supervisor. They also attempted to fire me the day I came back from a leave of absence approver through HR. I had to prove to them I was given wrong information by a supervisor they terminated a day before. It was very uncomfortable and unprofessional. At that point I discovered I was pregnant and decided I didn't need the added stress so I resigned my position. Now a couple years later and I am unable to return to work there and the only reason they can give is my skill set doesn't match the requirements for the position I've already had. The last supervisor I had didn't like that I always covered myself no matter how bad it made him look. Unfortunately they put him in charge of my interviews.
good,Navient after going through a company split is still trying to find its way in the corporate world. Their revenue is declining and having trouble finding new sources of revenue. In these times they are struggling and have now had two waves of layoffs in the last 4 months. With that said they are now struggling with limited staff and looking to do more with less. I was happy to be laid off and look for a better opportunity in my next phase.
good,"Benefits have gradually diminished over the years. No job advancement opportunities. steady income for entry level or IT related jobs, but if you do not work in those fields then the opportunities are limited and limited advancement"
good,"Not going to make this long. Worked in the call center for a few years. Did well, got promoted to Servicing Agent 2. Decided to move to another depart off the phone. I gave it my best show and it wasnt working out. I requested to return to the call center and was repeatedly denied. They rather fire you then let you go back to a job you did very well at."
good,"The pay is low for an entry level job, about $12 starting out. I have been here over a year with no raise. Great benefits though. There should be Student loan relief programs for employees, especially if it's with Navient."
good,Navient is an OK job to work for. pay is VERY slow but i's hard to get your food in the door. Great atmosphere. I would not recommend this job to a friend.
good,A typical day at work is in your seat.Management is great.work / Home life balance isn't very great. Co workers are fun and helpful.
good,This is a great job if only they provide daycare for single mothers. Being rude to the customers is not something that I like doing.
good,"My experience with navient was okay I just think it is imperative to have a good relationship with your manager. The MENTORS and team leader are negative majority of the time if you are NOT strong over the material for this position. You learn something new every week and they will find something  (weather it has to do with stats or your call flow)  to pick on you about. It felt like high school all over again. They made me feel bad for being myself instead of trying to understand I had social anxiety. Regardless of my anxiety, I was dedicated to learning the material and they still looked at me side ways because I wasn't pefect. YOU NEED HAVE SOME KIND OF EXPERIENCE WITH STUDENT LOANS. I wouldn't reccomend this job for anybody that doesn't have the experience"
good,"Disabled employee.Treated unfairly at times.However,was terminated duere to unprofessionalism on my part Miss the people not the company. Culture was untrustworthy .Management was never on point High turnover."
good,I really liked my job.  Very time consuming but very easy once you get the hang of everything. Some supervisors are laid back if you do your job correctly and a fast pace.
good,"Navient is a great starting job, but it's tough. They tell you it's an ever changing environment, but they make it sound normal. Its extremely difficult to work different lines of business and different types of business from month to month with no additional training. The bonus structure is very tough to hit. On a team of 15 you will be lucky to see 4 people hit there goal on the client side of the building. The job is extremely stressful. You can work so hard one month and not hit goal and the next you could slack off and hit goal. If you do hit goal your bonuses are usually very beneficial. But its certainly not as easy as it's made out to be. I have been very lucky to have a manager who has stuck by me and tried to keep me motivated through rough times. I have talked to so many managers there and around 70 percent of them have been on a final warning for performance before. That's concerning in regards to the structure."
good,"toys r us has filed bankruptcy so they have closed down, however 150 characters are required so i will keep filling this out until the minimum is met..."
good,"I don't want to rate this company just to post my resume.  I wish you would change this to an option in a future update.  Till then, here's my 150...."
good,"Fast paced environment and quick turnaround demand due to the business."
good,A typical day wasn't bad. On average there was 1 meeting per day and the environment wasn't bad to work in unless you prefer a quiet environment. However management made too many promises they couldn't deliver with unreasonable workload expectations. When you're on-call you can almost expect to be woken up multiple times a week (or whatever your on-call rotation is) due to constant issues so work-life balance is a little rough. The hardest part of the job was being expected to do the work of 3 people without having full administrative powers into everything you need to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers. Most people were nice and understood the stress of each group.
good,The position as a collector/account manager was very hard and stressful. Every day you are to call up customers and ask for their payment for the loan that they had taken out for school. It was very hard for the customers to make their payments and it was very hard to listen to the customers stories on why they are weren't able to make payments.
good,"Management was professional and just wanted you to succeed for the most part. Hardest part of the job is sitting there taking calls all day with not a whole lot of time for breaks. Youll have to drink a lot of coffee to make it through the day. Overall, it was a good experience and I met several fun people."
good,If you are young and have a lot of time off and want to make some money with very good benefits this is your place. It is a very competitive environment and no too much confidence
good,"job is very stressful and demanding. have to crunch numbers. be on top of your calls, everything is timed and recorded. always racing against your co workers"
good,"While working at Navient, I learned a great deal about how to treat customers, but was sadly disappointed in the way that the company treated its own employees."
good,Ok job could be better good pay and benefits. Different ways to win prizes and monthly games and activity’s to take part in.  Management definitely needs some work.
good,You have to be patient when on the phone with customers. You need to be willing to sit down for long hours during the day. Your work overall impacts your team.
good,"If you enjoy cold calling people wanting them to pay you for their bills they owe for education, good luck.  Training and coaches are excellent on the floor, but tools are not as updated as needed."
good,"The job was stressful and not enough pay, management openly has favorites some supervisors are unprofessional."
good,"Depending on which part of the company you work for, some places have a great career path to excel. There is great diversity and healthy competition among the collection floors. Other departments are a bit more difficult to get into with a degree or knowing someone but can be a great environment to get into if you are fortunate enough."
good,The company was an ok place to work for. The time off was good and the pay was not too bad. The only thing was the numbers that you had to make every month. It was very hard to keep them in good standing.
good,"good place to work if your only looking for temporary work if your looking for advancement i dont recommend  it at all, i've been there for almost 2 years and and seen no advancement its gets discouraging after a while."
good,"non stop phone calls. limited breaks. overtime is needed to hit goal"
good,Not a bad company to work for if your a hard worker. collections is hard when you first start out but it get easier has the months pass. good people to work with.
good,"Overall it's a good job, but not worth the stress for what you get paid. If you have a short fuse this clearly isn't the job for you because customers are very rude and don't care about government regulations regarding student loans even though that is OUT OF your control... But patience is key working here and you make good friends, and management is nice."
good,I don't wish to review this company at this time  there are always pros and cons to every company.  this company needs is a large corporation with a large work force that processes a high volume of student loans
good,You have to be able to focus on your tasks. Good supervisors that are willing to help if you are willing to work. Time management is huge as a case worker.
good,"Ok place to work lots of benefits, holidays always off, management is good, because a lot of management is from within, they are understanding, Which is refreshing"
good,A typical day at work is coming logging on to the system getting on the phone with customer  tell customer about their account and going home .It a good job to start off with but I don't believe the company has a lot of growth and the pay is not so good and they don't have
good,not a bad company to stand behind if you have and skill set in a professional setting. A degree is a plus and after the 9 month waiting period you can apply for jobs not related to a call center. Call center is where most all employees start at an entry level position.
good,"Great benefits, helps people navigate through the student loan process. I have worked for the company on 3 different occasions for a total of 12 years. I have learned so much about so many different areas. I have been able to pursue several different opportunities and gained skills in so many areas."
good,"Working for this company has been challenging. A great experience for persons not familiar with Revenue Cycles, Patient Account Representatives, and Patients. Grateful for the opportunity to work there and learn a great deal about this area of business."
good,Its a corporate work place. Split from Sallie Mae. There were many cuts made after its first year. Many upper level Vp's and Directors were let go. My experience has been a very stale work environment. It also very dependent on your department.
good,"I must say it a good place to work if you don't mind call centers, great way to make a lot of money with no experience needed."
good,it's a decent place to work very friendly other than that id look for something else. i have nothing more to say but it wont let me skip
good,"The company has been evolving considerably over the past several years and faces considerable political and regulatory pressure, which it has struggled to meet.  As a result, it has been going through downsizing over the past year which is likely to continue.  The people are great to work with and very competent.  Comp & benefits are competitive and work-life balance in most areas is pretty good."
good,"it's a unprofessional company, they hire every 5 weeks and you never know when you will be terminated, from the job i learned how to become a collector/customer service specialist"
good,"Great benefits and PTO given, management is decent, nowhere to progress in the department, not a healthy work environment in my department, very high school"
good,good company if just getting out of school into the work force i like discounts on Compensation/Benefits.cos lack of knowledge of their resposiblities
good,"the location is convenient, the working environment is good. pay is little low, need to clocking the hours. no sick days only PTO。"
good,Navient is a good place to work however your hours must be flexible for most positions. Benefits are decent but could be better but overall the staff is friendly and mostly hard working.
good,Overall it's a good company to work at there's always something new happening. Working weekends will be required benefits are good hour lunches except weekends
good,Navient has a lot of unexpected changes if you like the call center life this is a good place to work. Be prepared to work until 9 pm for atleast 2-3 times a week and some Saturdays for 4 hours. Managers are generally cool.
good,"I worked with a fantastic group of people.  As the department manager it my goal to ensure every member of my team obtained success.  I learned a great deal about mail center activities, document imaging and payment application during my tenure."
good,Very competitive not too much interaction with colleagues. Very stressful position not for an older person. Management  very much on you for meeting quotas.
good,"The company is poorly managed, very little communication between different levels of management. At times can be very disorganized and chaotic. Overall, good people to work with and get to know."
good,The benefits package was great with 401K match you get weekends and holidays off. However the job is extremely stressful and there is no room for error. Management is great individually however you don't get a lot of  support and mainly because their hands are tied. Like all jobs there is good and bad. It just depends on what you consider good or bad.
good,"Navient has alot to offer as long as you're ok with the ups and downs they go through. When things are looking up, everything is great. When they are looking bad,everyone feels it."
good,It was a good job but it was a new department and was very unstable and unorganized. They were very flexible and open to hear anything you had to say about the job.
good,"This job is very stressful- There is zero room for life outside of Navient. The environment itself is stressful, but the work/life balance does not exist."
good,Working with friendly co-working. Management skills need to be establish for a healthy work environment. Compensation is great with great incentives. Advancement is excellent.
good,I like the job and the benefits we get!!! The do pay good but its hard to move up in the company if you haven't worked the long enough. I do think its good job to have when you are young.
good,"In order to maintain the position there, the work done needed to be perfected in a short amount of training time.  I was unfamiliar with the background of student loans so learning came a little more difficult than the rest of my class."
good,"Good company to work for, lots of help when needed. great compensation and opportunity for financial gain. Good work environment, co workers are nice."
good,Work/Life balance can be a little rough for IT.  Some teams work 40-50 hours in a standard week while other 70-80.  Fun coworkers and some cool management but staff is lean and a lot of people like to keep the status quo rather than new improvements.
good,"Working with Navient was at times a struggle. Although the company offers great benefits, the pay is not enough for the amount of work I did. Everyone is set a monthly goal to reach and if not met than your job is on the line. Working with customers was not the problem; it is trying to get them to pay their back taxes they owe that is. It is not a secure job and I would not recommend this company to anyone. The management is unfair and caddy and it is all about popularity instead of your knowledge and experience. There is no room for growth working for this company. It is very rare that people get raises."
good,Great goal orientated working environment  with professionals focused on navigating customers on their way to financial success. Managers and employees have an open-line of communication to voice their opinions.
good,"Expected to assist and take payment for customer as quickly as possible and notate accounts within 2-3 minutes before taking next call. Expected to take minimum 12 calls/ per hour. Calls can be lengthy when wanting to speak to supervisor, customers to be place on call back tracker to be contacted within allotted time 24-48 hours."
good,"My department, Mainframe Tech Support, was outstanding.  Immediate management allowed good work/life balance."
good,"Typical Call Center job. You will sit down and answer calls from people who are having issues with their loans. You do this for 8 hours and then go home, with 2 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch break. So you end up being at work for about 9 hours, but are paid for 8 of them."
good,Pretty good place to work in corporate office. HR very responsive and good work life balance for my particular position. Management was very flexible and responsive to things that were concerning to me and made changes so I could do my job more efficient.
good,"fast paced, huge turn over rate,not a bad place , its just not for me, the people are friendly, incentives are good. benefits are good"
good,"It's comfortable Job, Great Benefits, Job Advancement, safe environment to work, co-workers are friendly and helpful, hardest part of job not being able to offer more options."
good,"It is a fun workplace, and the management is very good at guiding you to become a better employee.  By doing this job, you definitely become really knowledgeable about the business of student loans."
good,"Plenty of overtime. Great co workers but management is lack luster at best. To them you're just a number. Extremely low rate per hour, you'll be lucky if you get a .20 cent raise usually its .10 across the board every year."
good,You do a lot of sitting but if you do well at the job its completely worth it. the bonuses are amazing if you can earn them. its very easy to get fired though so you have to watch out for that
good,The pay is decent with the bonuses. Mostly just talking to customers on a phone all day and dealing with annoying catty office women. Decent benefits.
good,"Great place to work & easy money. Advancement is available. Depending on performance bonuses  can be up to $14,000 extra a month. Unlimited overtime.."
good,This is a very fast paced company. Lots going on all the time. Can be hard to focus at times. Have to be able to work and multi-task.
good,"The company overall is not bad at all. The pay is not that great, but there are a lot of opportunities to make extra money there. There are huge bonuses paid out each month, and contests to win extra money every week. In order to get that extra money it can be very challenging."
good,"9 Hours On The Phone. Short Breaks. Other Than That, A Lot Of Incentives."
good,"The pay isn't what it needs to be for the cost of living in this town. "
good,Good job right out of college. Not a great place if you are starting a future with a family. The managers are great and the people you work with become family. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to work with some really great people.
good,It’s a good place to work. Supervisors are friendly and willing to work with you about your stats once you’re on the floor. It’s a friendly workplace.
good,"This job was an adventure as it was constantly changing. This job required you to call and collect on delinquent student loan accounts. Every conversation is different, and you learn how to handle certain situations, whether it be confrontational, or even calm."
good,"Navient is a great place to work if you don't mind the fast paced phone calls. Granted, there are a lot of angry citizens that call in, but its a great way to learn patience and understanding, and also a great way to learn to be stern and direct."
good,"It started off a little rough for me because I was so use to my old job, I love what I did at my old job and the money I made that I didn't notice how good I was at my job at navient that I try to leave so many times and every time I would get another job offer something pulled me back. With that being said I've been employed 6 months and now enjoy it, I love the ppl I work with sometimes management can do a little more team work but other then that you can make good money if you stay focus. The company has good benefits ,your peers treat you like family as soon as you hit  the floor. Every word that's in the description is nothing but the truth no catch, make that money !!!!"
good,Pay was decent had some great coworkers but everyone seemed to be a little depressed in my department. Management in my department hardly was around to help.
good,"Always be prepared for something different."
good,"Very diverse employer that is always looking to put employees interest first. A newly created ""Rec room"" was created that has a Ping Pong table for employees."
good,"poor management not enough employees "
good,Great way to be introduced to corporate america.......a lot of opportunity for advancement. Learn valuable skills and worldly knowledge that is applicable later in life.
good,"Overall, Navient was a decent place to work. However, there's not much room for growth. It's frowned upon to make lateral moves and express interest in different departments."
good,"The pay was good but, very stressful job. Being at that desk for hours having customers yell out at you can be a little inhumane at times. They do compensate very well with bonus."
good,Tough place to work with all changes in collection laws and senior management was out of touch with the company. Unprofessional in some situations to say the least.
good,Call center agents have a very tight Schedule to keep. Very very uptight will only let you go to the bathroom on your breaks and lunches. Back office is more laid back. Bonus potential is unlimited if you do well at your job and meet the units per hour you will gain extra moment every month. When I was an hourly employee I made $200-400 extra a month in bonuses. Management can work on communication within and outside their departments. Opportunity for growth is endless. After 6 months you are eligible for a promotion and pay raise. They have yearly pay raises. Starting salary is 11.13 an hour and after3 years at the company I have gone up to over $18 an hour with hard work. The call center is very tough and has a high turn over rate. If you see jobs posted for the company other than call center apply for them!!
good,The Management needs more work and better communication skills. Communication is kept at a Director level and is no disseminated down to the real workers.
good,"I loved my job and enjoyed making bonus. I had to do call center work, so loved the fact  of helping other people figure the best solution for their student loans. Also giving people more knowledge about their student loans. Letting them know there is help available"
good,"pay starts extremely low on scale, and it wont get much better. They nickle and dime raises and rarely promote. They are under constant budget cuts and lay offs."
good,Good job with good benefit. The company is innovative and will always keep you learning new things. The managers tend to be very supportive and flexible.
good,They will tell you that goals are attainable without overtime... they are DEFINITELY not. There is no work-life balance. And there's very little room for growth unless you're good at brown nosing.
good,A typical training manager job.  The company primarily hires lower skilled employees in high frequency with little regard for the quality of hire.
good,Navient is a good company. My main complaint was I worked in Collections and sometimes it was difficult to get Borrowers to give you the time of day. It seemed like the only way to meet quota was to work a ridiculous amount of overtime which took time away from my daughter.
good,"At navient, you will have a base/ hourly pay. additionally, there is a bonus compensation dependent upon how you perform against your peers each month. The more money you satisfy,  the higher your bonus will be. This makes the job very competitive!"
good,"I Love Navient. The managers are cool and its a nice place to work, however I've hear many people say it lacks ability of advancement. Also its a very fast paced job which can be a little stressful. Plus its hard to feel secure within the company."
good,Good place to learn about Financial Services and to get a footing into the financial and banking world. Company provides educational training through Penn state.
good,Navient was a fun place to work and to obtain customer services skills. This is a great place for a college graduate to start their career. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentive.
good,"I enjoyed the position I held but once I worked my way up after many years, I got let go. No job security. Overall benefits good but pricey for someone just starting there at entry level salary."
good,Overseeing a team to ensure that we hit our monthly goals as a whole. Also did interviewing for the company to hire new employees. Did trainings to ensure that team was in compliance with the new laws and changing rules.
good,I worked student loan collections for over 10 years.  Navient is a great company to work for.  Good benefits and compensation for driven employees.  Not a lot of advancement potential.
good,Great challenging company to work for. On a daily basis i was challenged to think outside of the box. Helped build me as a professional and as a person.
good,"A typical day consists of receiving calls from loan borrowers and/or customers. Most calls are pretty simple whether it is taking a payment over the phone, resetting someone's online account, assisting someone to find a lower repayment plan, etc. You'll get some people who are upset and angry occasionally due to bad experiences they had. The hardest part of the job is making sure to meet all of the performance requirements on a daily basis while maintaining a positive attitude on every call you take. On an average day, you can depend on having 45-55 calls."
good,"Navient is a great company to work for, as it offers solid pay, consistent schedules, and great benefits. I would highly recommend that any job seeker take a look at this company."
good,Call center environment. Constant outbound and inbound calls with servicing. Very repetitive. Learned about college loans and laws. The hardest part of the job are the rude customers. The most enjoyable part are my coworkers.
good,"The collections department of Navient pushes employees to work at a very quick pace, which isn't conducive to accurate work. The staff puts on contests that are made to motivate employees to perform and hit monthly goals. If goals are hit, you earn a commission based on performance."
good,"Work is consistent, many different facets, interesting, can be stressful but usually not. Learning new operating systems was a part of the job which sometimes caused stress as changes usually do."
good,Good place to work. Wish there has been more opportunities to advance. I learned how to be more social in business setting. Enjoyed traveling to different sites.
good,The company has a lot of good people. The work environment is decent. The pay is the big downfall. If you are hourly you can make good money but you will have a lot of work to do. Once you are salary the pace slows down a bit but the pay slows down as well. Supervisors can make less money than their agents because the supervisor is salary and their agents are hourly.
good,"I have learned what is expected of me as an employee and as an individual. I value each stepping stone as a lesson learned in my life. "
good,"Working in a call center is not for everybody. The job itself as well as Navient the company are both fair for the most part. As for their system, there are constantly dialer or system issues which makes it very difficult to get the job done."
good,Fun to work but lots of hours with very high expectations. Lunch room in facility and workout area very nice. Lots of turnover but flexible with hours.
good,Great place to work. Fun environment and great employees. Bonus potential is unlimited and they offer a flexible schedule to meet everyone's needs. Highly recommend.
good,My position was abolished due to company downsize. I enjoyed working there. Excellent benefits package. Flexible work schedules. Four 10 hour days. Company 401k match. HSA company contribution. Pay raises decreased over past few years.
good,"its a decent place to work, great benefits, great work environment"
good,Overall a good place to work.  They are working to make improvements by conducting annual employee surveys.  I enjoyed performing project coordination activities and working with assigned external clients on problem resolution and contract support.
good,"Navient tries hard as a company to be inclusive and welcoming, and has a nice array of benefits and bonus opportunities based on monthly performance, but also tries to trade on the areas in which it is more progressive than required to make up for a base pay (starting hourly rate under $15) that in no way equals the value of the knowledge and skills that even an entry level employee has to master in order to successfully perform their job duties. While employees that perform well can rely on a certain amount of security in their position (and if their position is terminated, the company does make an effort to relocate some to another department), opportunities for advancement are notably stagnant, leaving high performers with greater responsibilities but equally stagnant earning capability  despite the value they provide."
good,"A great work culture .  People are helpful and also a great place to learn things. They always give chance to expand your knowledge. "
good,Able to work independently 
good,Good place to work besides when needing time off for sick children. Good when needing scheduled days off if pto is available. Easy to hit goal and bonuses are very fair.
good,"It is a good place if you're looking for more money than you would normally get from a similar role and don't mind working at a fast pace. However, not the best place I've ever worked."
good,You learn a lot about yourself and teamwork and trying to stay positive in sometimes negative situations. Management was good to you and cared.  They took time out to acknowledge your accomplishments to the company and as a person.
good,Balancing work and Life is a challenge but is necessary since you are working and listening to peoples life stories 8-10 hours daily. There are daily goals and incentives to motivate and challenge you.
good,"As an Education Specialist, a typical day consist of training new agents and preparing them for the collections for.  Training consist of a 5 week direct and hands on experience to get new employees an opportunity to get acclimated to our systems, policies and procedures before releasing to the operations floor."
good,"I have met and worked alongside some great colleagues. Most days it was a pleasure to come into work, it felt like a family atmosphere. In the end it is just business and everyone is expendable."
good,Navient is a good place to work the management team are very supportive of the staff and are easy to work with. Also the training staff there is great they make sure you have all the tools necessary to be able to preform you job functions with little or no issues.
good,its a real fun place to work. majority of the staff really treat there employees like they are family. Stressful from time to time but thatss the nature of the job.
good,"Flexible schedules, time went fast, busy place to work. Hardest part of the job, learning too much laws and policies. Management had preferences with co-workers. The best of the job, it was great to reach my monthly goal. Bonus were good."
good,Navient is a great place to work for those who are just getting started in the work field. The job requires multi-tasking skills and patience.
good,"Felt all my goals was meet , flexable hours they offered VTO . Great work space had own desk. On lunch break they have lunch bars with all different types of food."
good,"A typical day at work was transcribing medical reports"
good,"i do not want to take the time and write about my time at Navient.  I would like to find something more fulfilling that what I currently do,  you should provide a way to opt out."
good,This employer operates on an incentive based scale. While I was employed unlimited overtime was permitted so you made what you were willing to put into the job.
good,This is a good relaxed office enviornment. There is a LOT of work though. You have to be thorough and good at memorizing things (mostly for training). Time management is key as a caseworker. You need to have thick skin to deal with taxpayers yelling at you from time to time. You will have good months and bad ones. Just keep the grind going. Keep everything up to date and breathe!
good,Good benefits and good work schedule.  Have enjoyed working here for last 23 years.  Vacation time and life balance very important.  Good work environment and has cafeteria and gym on site.
good,"Overall I have had a great experience at Navient.  I work diligently at all of the task that I am given and I do receive recognition in some ways. The only issue I have is the amount of my salary, and the opportunities I have not been given with little to no explanation."
good,"repetitive days, poor management and feedback and training is nothing comparedto when you get on an actual team, very strict and cut-throat on attendance but lenient in every other aspect for some reason. An obvious outrageous turnover rate"
good,"A good company for students just starting in the work force. The company is very good in their constant rreview and understanding of their products. The location is very convient to reach from any where in the New Castle area with secure and off street parking.   "
good,I enjoy the people I work with and that there is a good balance between family and work. The Management team is friendly and treats everyone like family.
good,At first it felt like a dream job where all you have to do is answer the phone and meet your monthly goal and the upper management care about you becoming better ate your job. But after a few years of working there you become aware very quickly that this job is all about your numbers. They don't care about you personally becoming better at your job or making more money. They only care about making themselves more money because your success means a bigger paycheck for them. I was also a bilingual agent and they give you a $1 raise for this but I don't think that it is worth it because you then are required to handle the calls and translations of other departments which you get minimal to no training on but are expected to just help with.
good,"I worked at Sallie Mae in both Upper management and on the front lines as a unit manager. I had the opportunity to develop and learn much of what I know from the people I worked with the the experiences I encountered at Sallie Mae."
good,"I worked as a CRS agent for years in various stages.  It was our goal to resolve delinquent accounts with regards to student loans and find the best solution available to the customer. "
good,"inbound outbound call center"
good,"Over the phones so that could be stressful with deadlines and very angry and irritable clients. Its a collections job, so I would call in to collect payment for their student loan. Irate clients and hard work but great pay and loads of overtime. Good benefits and steady work."
good,"On the phone constantly, helping customers with their loans and finding a solution to their problems."
good,"401k is the best I have seen...as far as employer matching being instant vs at the end of the year. Overtime is unlimited. It is a typical call center environment so you sit all day...and if you do overtime....you sit even longer. But you get paid very well good for all of that sitting...mainly from the overtime. There are games, monthly potlucks/cookouts, and semi-fun things....but if you do not like sitting for 8-15 hrs a week...this is not the job for you."
good,"I would like to say I love the people I work with, but I'm on back-to-back calls all day long, so I wouldn't know. There are a lot of great benefits like tuition reimbursement and adoption assistance. However, the work is exhausting and tireless. You become embittered by people and don't want anything to do with society after working in a call center. There are minimal advancement opportunities and it's a huge disappointment with a college degree. The CEO is the highlight of the company, as a smart and sincere man trying to make a difference. It is comfortable, and they try to encourage us a lot, but we're understaffed, and everyone hates back-to-back calls. That's what causes high turnover and employee dissatisfaction. Being a robot who becomes numb to what everyone says, but fakes it anyways, is the recipe to success."
good,"Well Navient has different departments throughout it's company. My position requires me to service federal student loans for the Department of Education. As we all know this can be stressful at times because no ones wants to fully acknowledge the amount of debt they have, especially student loan debt. So working in a call center environment can be overwhelming when you deal with some irate customers, but you also have those customers that are friendly and allow you to help them. The work environment isn't too bad, it's an open floor facility, so no cubicles but you're right next to someone and you can hear everything they say when they're on the phone. For the most part this isn't a bad job. They do allow you to advance rather quickly if you are determined to move up in the company and you qualify. The staff are inviting and helpful and they are flexible and understanding of your work hours and availability. This isn't a bad starter job if you're looking to make decent money."
good,gives you ability to pick how much to you home with unlimited overtimes. works with you and encourages good relationships. easy to work at but you need to be ok with the public
good,"Navient was my first full time job and I ended up spending over five years there. I only recently quit to become a stay at home mom. "
good,"If you want to continue to move up, get a degree. While you may be able to land a decent entry to mid-level career job (outside of collections), you will likely be let go if the company goes through a restructuring. This happens every 6 to 12 months usually."
good,"Favortism. Low pay "
good,"The management is super laid back and depending on the department, the job can be either a walk in the park or a nightmare. Departments have lunchins incentives momthly"
good,"Productive, always learned something new, had refresher classes on computer yearly for hr.  Our department mgr bought monthly birthday pizza for our group until it was stopped in March 2018.  We had pitch ins occasionally.  Management was pretty fair most of the time."
good,Over all good place to work for. Could benefit from better training and SOP writing. Yearly employee appreciation party and year round social actives for employees.
good,"I learned a lot while working here and am still learning everyday, if you like fast pace and multitasking this is a good job for you. You will enjoy all the benefits it offers as well."
good,This place is very goal driven. You have to have a manager that wants to work for you  because if they are lazy they  will not help work on big accounts that sometimes a manager needs to talk to the customer.
good,"My typical day at work, I first review the work load for the day and determined what needs my immediate attention first. I work well with others and adapt well to change. My manager depends on me and gives me special assignments to fulfill.   I always make time to organized a food day at least once a month and that gives everyone a change to feel comfortable to talk to each other its a great team building tool."
good,"Fast paced culture, must be able to multitask while dealing with sometimes very agitated customers. You must know what is the best option for customers and be able to  convey to the customers why it's the best program for them. The things I don't care for is the drive"
good,Navient was a great place to work. I do think they could use more days training and slow the pace down some they throw a lot of information at you and it is quick and very stressful. Would I work for them again? Yes!
good,"working at navient is easy in the beginning, as you begin moving up in ""buckets"" it gets more difficult and time consuming. even great collectors have trouble hitting goal in mid to late stage. as a part timer my monthly resolve goal is usually around 1.8 million dollars."
good,"Working at Navient can be somewhat stressful as you are on the phone all day talking to customers about their delinquent student loan.  Student loan customers happen to be some of the most unhappy customers so it can be a challenge dealing with them because they are going through a lot of stress.  It is also stressful to have to achieve your goal every month knowing that you have to start off strong in the beginning of the month as it begins to slow near the end.  It is interesting to navigate the systems that they use and fun to solve an issue for someone that is really willing to pay their delinquency.  When you encounter a customer that wants to make a big payment or even a payoff it is very rewarding.  The managers I had were always fun and interesting.  There was a very interesting workplace culture.  We would have a free lunch around the holiday times, a day in which we went somewhere else to participate in activities, we even got a free turkey for thanksgiving.  The hardest part of the job is just making sure you reach your goal for the month.  The most enjoyable parts are the fellow coworkers, the hour lunch break, and the compensation plan in which you can make more money."
good,"Navient is a wonderful place to work for entry-level job seekers. It's one of the highest paying entry level jobs in the area. It's fast paced, and incredibly intuitive work. If you don't like solving complex problems for customers, it's not the work for you. But if you're someone that derives pleasure from both excelling at helping your customer, and working through difficult challenges, you might consider this a good option. "
good,"I worked at navient for 2 years, a typical day at work was that you showed up to work and left with your daily goal that you were supposed to collect that day to reach your monthly goal. I learned a lot about loan servicing and customer service. Management on the other hand could need a little bit of fine tuning, some managers there didn't know what they were doing sometimes or didn't want to handle certain situations so they would make another supervisor from another department or team handle the issue. my co-workers were very helpful especially the veteran employees' they could answer some questions' that supervisors couldn't even answer."
good,Great place to grow. will to give anyone wanting to work a real chance and treats everyone fairly regardless if you have worked for the company for a week or 10 years
good,I worked with customers to help get their student loans set up where they would be able to afford the payments. Management was very helpful if you needed them. The hardest part of the job was to tell a customer there was no way to lower their payments. The most enjoyable was to be able to assist a customer and get their payments to fit into their budget.
good,"Great job, Great pay,  Not a place to work if you are use to an active environment seeing as you sit around all day on phones."
good,The training department is really good. Excellent management and well-written curriculum. Quality is fair and colleagues are able to learn from one another.
good,"Great pay. This is a job for someone with great work ethic, one who doesn't mind strategizing to reach the goal. You will get paid for the work you put in. The training is very thorough and management makes sure you get continuous training in any areas you struggle with."
good,Navient is a fast paced environment that prides itself on statistics and employee production. Work / Life balance has always been an ongoing struggle for it's employees but they do make an effort to try and fix that. They offer large monthly incentives and a pretty decent Paid Time Off policy but the company goals of production can be aggressive and taxing on the overall work ethic of employees. Some of the metrics measured can be very arbitrary at times but the base level requirements can often easily be met. Policies change frequently and can lead to general confusion but the training programs are usually very informative.
good,I loved my job as well as my co workers.  I had to move after some medical problems and was not able to continue with the company.     I would go back in a heartbeat. Great atmosphere.
good,"All call centers are fast-paced, which is expected but having to deal with rude and stressed out customers makes it worst. On the bright side, the work environment is great and the morale was even better there. They really make their employees feel like they are apart of a workplace family, I would defintely recommend working here if you can handle the stress of the customers."
good,Navient is a great company to work for and the employees are very helpful and work together. Impressed with their involvement in the community and how we are allowed to volunteer on company time.
good,"Best part was the money. I was not a fan of the team lead, and he made it difficult to ask questions. He would also sit there and do nothing all day, but would sometimes listen to me while I was taking a call, and would make comments when I was done. One of the biggest things that bothered me was, the team leads held a higher position and got paid more, but sat there and did nothing all day."
good,Navient is a good company to work. The work culture and environment is friendly. I was always encouraged to try new ideas and process improvements. I had a great time working for Navient.
good,I truly enjoyed working at Navient in Reston. The company culture is outstanding. Management is open to new ideas. Tuition reimbursement was easy to apply for.
good,Co workers are nice and helpful.  A nice place to work with other perks like half day every other Saturday during summer.  There are some other fun times with everyone.  Free lunches every Friday after a quarter closing.
good,The best training I received going into a new job.  I had no past experience with Student Loans and they make sure that you know what you are doing. It was a little different after it was changed to Navient.
good,"The job comes with affordable health/vision/dental insurance, 401k match up to 5 percent, most holidays are time off and paid for. You can accrue 15-20 days off per year within the first year. Overtime is available during peak seasons where call flow is increased, which is only a few months out of the year. There is an incentive plan based on performance that can lead to plentiful bonuses."
good,The place I work provided a fun enviorment . Sometime it can become very stressfull. Learned allot of new techiques out to help students out. Hard part is finding solution Best part is making the customer happy
good,Navient is a very competitive and fast paced work environment that allows those with drive to succeed. The management in my opinion at the floor level was great and care about their respective teams.

good,"I deal with NJ tax payers personal information on a daily bases. The NJ tax payers are usually very demanding when it comes to how much and when are they getting their money. Since the tax payers are so demanding and eager about their property tax relief reimbursements we have to be able to review their accounts, make any adjustments all while meeting the phone time at or under 7 minutes with minor errors."
good,"Taking calls on a daily basis, helping people navigate through their student loans. Management is great in helping you with the tools and tricks to help you along your journey. There is a standard training period, but hard to grasp everything until you are actually out taking calls; and of course w/ the ever changing nature of student loans, there's is always something new to learn everyday. Benefits are good and as well as Paid Time Off and Leave without Pay options to find a good balance between home and work. There is an incentive program, but sometimes difficult to achieve monthly goals for bonuses."

Often times I had a caller who was quite upset when they called in, and I was able to calm them down and find the best solution. I was also able to focus on time management, and schedule discipline. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the relief in peoples voices when I found them a solution to their situation"

good,The only downside of this job is that overtime is mandatory and hours a set on swing shift. Employees are expected to dedicate their life to their job.
good,it was a good place to work - it could get stressful on days when the phone calls wouldn't stop (back to back)  on times that they offer overtime you have a chance to win prizes including money in addition to your check

good,Navient is a good place to work. It does get hard dealing with customer and the work. but once you get your foot in the door it is a very good job with good benefits.
good,"Navient treats you like an actual person as opposed to an expendable, but the work in grueling.  Be prepared to deal with angry customers, and sad stories."
good,"I loved my career with Gila and Navient.  The people were amazing, hard working, smart, and dedicated.  You could create your own destiny by working hard while upholding the companies mission, vision and values."

good,"This job required long hours and dedication but the pay-off is worth it. Typically, you come in and negotiate payments from account holders.

good,"I learned how to resolve accounts, how to transfer calls,navient is a great company hardest part of the job is trying to hit goal in proper timely manner"
good,"Honestly if you remain organized in this position, it's not as overwhelming. But if you easily lose things and are forgetful, this will prove to be challenging. There are 101 expectations that I don't believe are fully compensated even with the bonus, but its a fun atmosphere. It's nice having work that's only yours. Its nice keeping track of mini goals. However the workload does add up quick and keeps you on your toes. As far as $$ goals, don't sweat it. Its all luck. If they pay they pay. If they don't they don't. There's no yelling or amount of calls you could make that will change if a person can pay their taxes. So all in all, I know they heavily stress the goal, but you can only do so much in that aspect. I just recommend YOU STAY ON YOUR GAME with everything else if you aren't collecting."
good,The job is fun it's my first full time job it pays me based on my production and pays fair. Management interacts with the representatives as well as schedule carry ins to end the month I love the environment.
good,I enjoy this job even though it is a change of pace. I’m normally used to a warehouse setting and this is my first desk job. Not a big fan of the cold calling and getting hung up on but that’s what being a debt collector is so can’t complain.
good,"Great company to start your professional career. It has been fun 2 years. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team I work with, and the flexibility provided to my department employees."
good,"I had wonderful managers and co-workers. The best part of working here was the bonuses and prizes. The worst part of working here had to be dealing with customers. As a collector, it can be hard to learn how to overcome objections. The teams are very supportive, though."
good,its a nice place to work. I would recommend to a family member or a friend. The place is laid back and friendly. Also you can receive gifts if you hit your goal for the month.
good,"parking lot is big, get your own desk. They make you work closing shift after training.computer system issues happens alot only thing that i dislike. get lots of help"
good,"Great place to work. Training set up for employees to succeed and management is really nice. Most of the people I know or have talked to there are very easy to get along with. However, this may not be the job for those who like face to face conversation and working with co-workers hands on. You must stay at your desk at all times unless at break or lunch and can be repetitive sometimes. But there is a lot of opportunity to get promoted as the company is a quickly growing."
good,"Great job for anyone willing to work hard. Little advancement based on talent. Continued merit raises for consistent, improved performance.Decent entry level wage."
good,I consider some of my previous co workers as family. A lot of the people ive met have come from all different backgrounds and was one of the most non judgmental working environments ive ever worked in. My supervisor was almost like a mother figure to me because the only thing she cared about was seeing me do better at my job and she went out of her way on so many occasions to make sure that happened.
good,"Many benefits with this company, a good place to work, flexible scheduling when needed, many ways to move up in the company and change departments with openings."

good,"Managed call center Citrix environment of 700 agents and knowledge workers."
good,The day is full of processing ticket requests depending on the security access required.  The hardest part of the job is making sure to meet the desired SLA agreements in a timely manner.  Management is great.  The best part of the day is when we take time to just step away from the work for a minute to act silly and enjoy the moment before getting back to work.
good,A typical day at work would include fast pace handling of loan borrowers and their current student loans. The worst part of the job is angry student borrowers and the best part would be the monthly bonuses.
good,This job was a good jobi always looked forward to going to work
good,"call center environment, collected on delinquent accounts for the board of education. Exceptional customer service. This job is for the goal orientated individual who loves to accelerate in their career."
good,Navient was a good company to work for. The client I was under changed over the coarse of almost two years. In some ways to make the job easier and in some ways to make the job harder. Would still recommend to work for.
good,Once you get the groove down it’s sooo easy. They change the training since I started so it’s actually a lot easier to get a handle on things and once you do that you got it all! Bonuses are extremely easy to achieve and worth any extra OT that you wanna put it too. Only reason I left was to follow my husbands dreams in support who unfortunately didn’t have a great job like me :)
good,"For most part, the company was pretty appropriate & fair with promotions & did things to show appreciation for staff. Patient to nurse ratio was not always ideal...as is nearly everywhere. Most management staff where stand-up adminstration staff members, however, there's always the ones that (intentionallay or unintentionally) can cause the great love for where you are & what you do to quickly fade or cause necessary decision to be made to preserve character."
good,"I really loved my job being a debt collector and then they just switched me to dialer team and brought in a new manager from New York.  Now I just sit on a dialer all day with a manager who won't even let me go to the bathroom. It's so boring people on the dialer just fall asleep! "
good,I enjoyed working at the company.  I was able to do work I was passionate about with professional people.  Senior Leadership was receptive to new ideas.  Disappointed that the company has not found it's niche.
good,"Position was eliminated, I would love to find re-employment within the company. I saw excellent room for growth. Excellent co-workers and team environment."
good,"Navient was a great place to work as a contractor, I was able to contribute to many projects. They were very flexible with hours and working from home"
good,"Not a bad place to work. I work on the dept of Ed side so I do have a set hourly schedule for my day. I work 12-9 and don’t have to work weekends and I am happy with the pay. I can’t complain about the benefits either! "
good,"a fun place to work with great bonus structure"
good,overall a great place to work with a lot of very good people employed with the company the room for advancement in the company isn't the best but I am happy for the opportunity that I have had there
good,Debt collections with opportunity of growth. It is in a office setting in the comfort of competitive bonuses and incentives. Provides internal and external customer service to customers.
good,I worked in several depts. over the years at Navient and always had a great boss and was well supported. They expect a lot out of you but will help you rise to the occasion.
good,When working at Navient you are sitting at a desk most of your shift. you have to make sure that during your breaks or lunches that you are getting some type of exercise. Also hardest part of the about the job is having patients for the borrowers that you are speaking with.
good,Wonderful place to work and learn.  I am only sad because I messed up although it wasn't really entirely my fault.  If I had it to do over again I would but I would have behaved.
good,The workplace culture is very good and I enjoyed my job here and I don't feel pressure most of the times. Everyone here are so friendly and there is a lot of scope for learning new things.
good,"Obviously being a debt collector isn't a great time, but the management was really great about starting fun games and competitions to really get you to try your best and be rewarded."
good,Everyday there is a new challenge. Always learning something new on a daily basis and able to support the collection floor to make the company successful. Management is encouraging to make you better and is helpful when you need help. Have a great group of coworkers that encourages each other.
good,"Huge cafeteria, tons of advancement opportunities, cash rewards, bonus programs, volunteer opportunities, you can wear jeans with a jeans pass ($5 per person donated to other organizations) you have to be a certain type of person to do it. Don’t expect easy work. They give you all of the tools to succeed."
good,"If you like a fast pace environment where you get paid based off of your performance, Navient is the place to be!"
good,I loved working at Sno Mountain. There was nothing better than being to have 2 of my greatest passions together in an hour day.
good,Clear expectations of what my recruiting goals were and support from my team to meet those goals. Very autonomous HR work environment requiring a lot of self drive to meet expectations.
good,"This is a fast paced, performance driven environment.  If you do well under pressure and can multitask this job is for you.  If you are someone who doesn't really like or want a desk job you will get tired quick."
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of taking phone calls that usually involve problem solving and processing. Managing a positive attitude to calm fear of student loan debt. The workplace is an enjoyable environment that you conform to as you grow in the job. The hardest part of my job is handling difficult situations in a personal manner. You really want to make a difference in someone's life, and help them out as much as possible. Showing strong empathy and compassion with people from every day real life situations. The most enjoyable part of the day is realizing that you've made an impact on the people that you helped that day. The job is not all about business, but also making sure you are making the customer happy at the end of that call."
good,Navient is a fabulous company to work for. My experience has been very positive and I would recommend the company to anyone. -------------------------
good,"I enjoyed my time at Navient and would still be there if I did not have to move.

This was a wonderful experience and I would love to get back into the field of collections."
good,"Great Company with awesome atmosphere, flexible to work from home or office, amazing employees working as a team with great managers. The hardest part of my job was to ask questions to make myself better and the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new technology from peers and the company itself."

good,"I loved my job, I only left cuz I moved across country. I got bonuses every month on top of a biweekly pay check. I would recommend this job to anyone."

good,"I am willing to work again with my team, loved everybody ,environment and flexibility etc . lot of memories in fishers indiana navient .thanks to navient"
good,This is a really good job that can turn into a career. There are wonderful benefits and chances of monthly bonuses. I learned more customer service skills than from previous employers and many new computer skills.

The most enjoyable part of the job is that your body isn't worn out from standing or walking all day and the benefits of courses.

good,"I throughly enjoying working at Navient. It really throws away the whole ""call center/collections"" reputation out the door. I only have a handful (at the most) if difficult borrowers on the phone each day. Everyone is extremely helpful and encouraging. Overtime is optional and I've never needed to work extra to hit my monthly goal. As long as you are focused then goal should not be a problem to meet. I have also never feeled pressured to hit my goal by anyone. It's very rewarding changing people's life's by helping them financially. I am genuinely confused by the few reviews saying they most work overtime and that management is tough on them about hitting goal, I've luckily never experienced any of this. Overall it's a fun environment with different neat rewarding contests to make the job fun and everyone is super encouraging."
good,"Hard working, challenging growth-oriented. Great place to work. Solid management."
good,"I have been working at Navient full-time for more than a year now. Navient has been the greatest job I have ever had. If you like to work and make money this is a great job for you. Between bonuses and overtime I have made almost 70k this year. The management at my location is amazing and always willing to help when problems do come up. This job has been literally life changing. You are only going to have a problem here if you are lazy, but if you have a strong drive to work you will do very well like myself."
good,"Working at Navient was good. There was adequate pay and benefits, support from staff. Opportunity to earn more based on personal experience. Tuition reimbursement."

good,I love the job. If you go to work you will make money. Family work environment. Training team is awsome. You are giving alot of materials to perpare you for the floor.
good,Navient is a great place to work and offers great insurance. Flexible hours and offer great bonuses and referral bonuses as well. Would recommend to anyone.
good,a typical day at work is usually busy on phones however it is laid back. I learned some information on private student loans. The management is great and they are willing to work with you. The workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is that you deal with customers on the phone all day at work and it can be hard when you get a difficult customer on the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get off the phone with a customer and they thank you for being able to help them.
good,"love this company because of the great people that i worked with also they have an open door policy which is good for any reason."

good,This is an excellent company to work for. The supervisors are nice and the company really appreciate your help. They make you feel like you are family.
good,Very nice ppl who genuinely care about you and your struggles if u have any. They are helpful in almost every way. They make arrangements that help you out if there is ever any emergencies. The pay rate is nice.
good,"Great hours which are flexible"
good,"I wish I didn't have to leave, but due to my family moving away the hour commute is becoming to much! I have been employed here for 2 years now, my success within the company is due to my dedication and hard work. YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PAY CHECK! Don't walk in here expecting easy money, you have to work for it- although some find it difficult overall it is fairly easy. The culture is very adaptive and most are friendly, you often find yourself relating to others aside of just being co-workers. Not much negative I would have to say about this company; If I have the opportunity to come back I definitely would :)"
good,"Great job, love atmosphere. learned how to manage different programs. The management team was very helpful, very direct in what to do. Hardest part about the job was nothing was hard about, pretty easy job."
good,"As a Navient collections rep it was my job to get in contact with our borrowers by using previous info that we had on them or skip trace them to get ahold of them. Once in contact with them it was my job to get the borrower out of a default status by payment. If they couldn’t afford to make payments it was my job to get them in a payment plan or program that would better fit their needs. It was a goal based job so we had to talk to certain amount of people a per month, if not there was penalties."
good,This job is very fulfilling work but it requires dedication and it can be hard to take a day off. This is truly a work of love but the structure to become successful is strong. STICK IT OUT!!!!
