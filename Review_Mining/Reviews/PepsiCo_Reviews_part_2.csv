I had the pleasure of working there for many years and cannot say enough good things about the people that I met over that time frame.  It has a wonderful cooperative culture, and I am thankful for my experiences and the wealth of knowledge I gained during my time.  The only opportunity I encountered was that not every manager is a people developer, but overall it is an incredible place to work!"
good,"Every morning i would drive to the facility where my truck would already be loaded. I would stop and put gas in the truck and then start my day. A typical work day would start at about 4 am and end at 4 pm. I would deliver to about 15 stores per day. At each store I would unload merchandise for that store off of the truck and then bring it all in where I would wait for the store manager to count it all. After counting the merchandise I would stock the shelves and the coolers where ever it needed to be filled. I would do the same routine for every store. I learned how to drive a large truck at pepsi, This job at the very least would test your physical strength and endurance. I took pride in working for a major bottling company. But I think the hardest part was working on the road and driving through traffic in the large side loader. I feel like I would be a better fit for the warehouse."

good,Although I worked 12 hour shifts 5 days a week and 6 on holidays people would ask me how I liked my Job. I would tell them I loved every day of it. Even the bad days were good. It  was great knowing if I started getting behind the a phone call and 15 minutes later help would be there. Teamwork was everything.
good,"Pepsi Cola was a great place to work ,however the corporation was sold and parent company was now located in Queens .That would not have allowed me to continue with my employment for Pepsi Cola Corporation ."
good,"Esta empresa es una excelente oportunidad de trabajo ya que te da la oportunidad de ganar dinero y crecer en lo personal así como la oportunidad de estudiar, definitivamente excelente empresa."
good,If you're new to delivery and driving; training is available until you're comfortable on your own. Co-workers are friendly and very helpful good overall morale. Management's door was always open and available. Very physically demanding position to start as seniority usually determines how many cases to be lumped falling to the last guy on the list (keeps you in good shape!). Some merchandising is involved during the week to keep you working to get your hours. Highly recommend :)
good,es un ambiente de trabajo agradable trnaquilo y estable
good,"Pepsico é uma otima empresa."
good,"Es una organización muy completa y responsable tanto a nivel laboral como medioambiental, comprometida con la sustentabilidad medioambiental y la seguridad laboral ante cualquier otra variable"
good,"Great careers at Pepsi "
good,Awesome company to work for.  Offering work from home opportunities as well as flexible schedules.  Maintains 1 on 1 statistic updates every period to keep you up to date on your performance.
good,"Excelente empresa ,uma das melhores que já trabalhei,comecei como auxiliar administrativo,promotor merchandising,coordenador,vendedor trainee,vendedor b"
good,"Great work life balance"
good,I loved working here. Loved my job. Loved my supervisor. It’s agreat place to work and he’s a great boss. The job was pretty easy & laid back. I had fun while working here. Wish I wouldn’t have had to leave!
good,"As Long As You Know What To Do When Assigned Your Designated Posted Then You Should Be Good, It’s Not a Hard Job But Then Again It’s Not Too Easy, There’s Some Important Procedures and Roles You Need To Know Just In Case If Something Does Happen, You Know What To Do"
good,Pepsi is a steady fast pace. You really don't have time to talk because product has to be out the door. Its hot in the summers and your active most of the time. We are given drinks to stay hydrated work long hours and its great pay. The most enjoyable part of the work shift is driving the fork lifts and finishing work on time. The hardest would be when you make a mistake bu building your pallets and the end up turning over if you don't build them the right way or even if you make a mistake by putting the wrong order on the wrong pallet.
good,"the work day varied from slow days in the shop to multiple road calls that would last most of the day."
good,Working at Pepsi is very rewarding.  I have learned a lot about scheduling fountain equipment.  Management is great.  They always listen when you have something to say.  Workplace culture is very diversified.
good,"Empresa socialmente responsable que se preocupa por brindarle al cliente alimentos de excelente calidad y de darle a sus trabajadores estabilidad laboral con oportunidad de crecimiento a corto y largo plazo, siempre preocupada por la seguridad de los colaboradores y publico en general,"
good,I’ve worked for PepsiCo for three years now after quitting Coca-Cola after working for them for almost twenty years. Compared to Coca-Cola this has been a dream job! PepsiCo offers a great salary and is very competitive compared to other consumer product goods companies. PepsiCo offers a lot of career advancement and they are also very good at recognizing their people for the good things they do. Unlike Coca-Cola where they focused on the negatives and brow beating their employees PepsiCo on the other hand lifts up and recognizes their employees thru monetary and thru many other ways. I would recommend PepsiCo to anyone looking for a great career company!
good,The best part of working for this company was that the day went by fast and each was different. The best jobs are non repetitive in my opinion. Management was pleasant as long as you can work independently with minimal supervision and still accomplish your job daily you would like to work for this company. The hardest part of this job is covering your assigned area in a work day and still do a accurate and efficient job. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to form new acquaintances and meet new people. I learned that becoming a Professional Sales Account Manager is a enjoyable career as long as you have the energy to keep up the tasks daily. A typical day at work stared with all managers meeting for breakfast before the star of our daily assigned routes. Discussing new ways to get through the work load for the day. We all had many ideas and solutions to make our days go smoother and have less problems to answer for with our supervisor meetings. You are working completely independently but your performance is constantly being evaluated by the company.
good,"I wasn't employed there very long, but in the time I was there is was a great experience. The staff I believe treated everyone fairly and always had the employees interest first. Great customer service. I was treated like one of the team as soon as I started"
good,"Empresa de nivel mundial, asi tambien su organizacion en general, proporcione mi experiencia y recibi aprendizaje ."
good,"I very much enjoyed working at PepsiCo.  I would not have left the company, but I was part of a 1% workforce reduction in the United States.  Otherwise, I would still be there."
good,"Excelente aprendizaje, ya que los procesos son manuales aprende uno a gestionar e interactuar con las demás áreas."
good,Uma empresa que se preocupa com o empregado e busca sempre o bem estar dos seus funcionários
good,"es una empresa desafiante y muy profesional donde debes dar todo de vos para formar parte de un equipo que hace lo mismo a diario (dar lo mejor) "
good,"I think it is important when reviewing PepsiCo to call out the group that you are working in, as they are very different from each other. I have good things to review on NAB (North American Beverages) Supply Chain, Transport, Finance, and other groups that I collaborated with. The Control group is where I worked full time. The group is completely overstaffed and the people do not realize it because it they have never worked outside of Pepsi Control (it's just a matter of time before corporate realizes it). A lot of complaining, a lot of politics, lack of management support, no leadership vision, no career mobility, and no real complex challenging work. If you are coming from a tier 1 company with a good culture, and good people, you will find the transition very difficult. I was in role for 2+ years and there were literally zero learning opportunities presented, no live training, no real development plans for people, it's a mess and I was shocked. People are nice, but there are too many employees that have been in role for 20+ years with no movement, stuck in the same inefficient processes day after day, with no motivation to change, and simply waiting to retire. Reminded me of a parking lot for retired airplanes in the middle of no where. The groups culture is awful and very low performing. If you are a high performer and looking for a high performing environment, control is a career delayer like no other."
good,Happening place. Lot of achievements and well organised set up. Professional people and friendly. Fun place with achievement and learning. Thorough team game.
good,This was one of my favorite jobs but due to poor management and a Cutthroat type of supervisor who pushed sales instead of safety and customer service
good,"Great work environment awesome co-workers that makes your job easier and  less stressful. I came into Pepsi as a full time worker trained on multiple machines until I was fully aware of these machines, where I then trained a crew of 15-20 new hires in the matter of 14 months. Plenty opportunity to learn and move up if willing to put forth the effort."
good,"Only for dedicated employees. As long as you have the desire to be someone, show your worth, and make good money then this is the job for you. Always room for growth as long as you chase it you will succeed."
good,"Possuo vivencias no Relacionamento com cliente; Na controladoria e Finanças e fluxo de caixa; Gestão de marketing; Gestão de documentos. Responsável por projetos pontuais de RH que tinham como objetivo ajudar nos desdobramentos das metas atuando com motivação dos funcionários, trabalho em equipe, dinâmicas e orientação pra resultados. Onde me dediquei integralmente ao trabalho, com responsabilidade, eficiência e competência, visando o cumprimento das obrigações e alcance dos objetivos. "
good,It's a great environment. It's a family owned and operated warehouse. Lots of great management with lots of experience. Tons of opportunity for growth.
good,"I enjoyed my year at Pepsi. My manager was amazing and very knowledgeable. She was patient, yet pushed us to be the best. All my coworkers and management was friendly and professional. I enjoyed working with all my coworkers as well as all my clients."

good,Beautiful place to work. People are very nice.  When things are difficult there are people there to help.  Great learning experience to help move to the next step.
good,Best place for employees who believes in your self. Great work culture with diversity. Company treats employees very well by providing all motivational factors.
good,Its a very active work environment. Employees constantly entering and leaving the work place. The management is very friendly and active on the floor.
good,While working at Pepsi Co. I quickly learned valuable skills with time management and scheduling. Work consisted of physical labor along with working 14 plus hours every day throwing over 2000 cases per day.
good,"I negotiated space contacts with convenience store accounts. I was also responsible for hiring & supervising a seasonal team of merchandisers. This was a very enjoyable job, with a lot of responsibilities. It was my decision to decide if account stayed in compliance with agreement & pay them accordingly."
good,"I love working here it's fast paced and pays really well. The only downfalls are you have to start at 5am, work weekends/holidays and drive your own car."
good,Ambiente de trabajo ameno buen compañerismo y trabajo en equipo
good,"PepsiCo is a good place to work. It offers a lot of opportunities to grow. It has reasonably good work life balance."
good,"Orientada a la excelencia, genera desarrollo personal y profesional, promueve el trabajo en equipo y la empatía, en la que sus integrantes son interdependientes.  Trabajar en Pepsi Cola ha sido mi mejor experiencia."
good,Empresa multinacional com boa política empresarial.
good,"Consist of making syrup for daily line operations. Had to test/sample before runs. Management was supportive, understanding and easy to work with/for. Had a very family oriented, close knit group, always working together to achieve daily operation. It was sometimes, high paced, with time restrictions, but made for a fun, quick day. The people I worked with made it enjoyable and I really looked forward to coming to work."
good,"Drive the truck to the customer and deliver the produce. Amazing Management, at first the hardest part is to find the customers if you are not in the area all the time. otherwise the work is an amazing job if you like hand on type job."
good,"Un día típico es tener full trabajo, aprendí muchas cosas, a valorar lo poco que tienes madure como persona conoces de todo entre lo bueno y lo malo y hay que ganarse la vida trabajando con esfuerzo. Venezuela caracas estado miranda los cortijos de lourdes. La parte mas difícil del trabajo es el turno de la noche ya que se trabaja los tres turno. Me gusto a ver ganado muchos premios en mi trabajo en los 14 años que tengo trabajando."
good,Ótima empresa com respeito a qualidade e segurança e com planos de carreira ótimo
good,"Drivers would turn in money to me and I would count it out to make sure they were all balanced. Make the deposit for the following morning. Run reports for the Supervisors. "

good,"I operated and monitored production line while achieving the goal of maintaining accuracy and meeting production goals each day. I always maintained a clean work area and kept machines clean and working properly as well, also I preformed line inspections to make sure all machines were operating safely and efficiently. I was employee of the month for November (2013) and held perfect attendance the entire time I was there."
good,"Pepsico was a fun learning experience for me. I learned alot how the Pepsi machines were refurbished and how the coin machines work. Even though I worked through a Temp Service they made me feel like I was an Pepsi employee also. To being invited to their Pepsi picnic, Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner. I would recommend anyone to apply for Pepsico."
good,Great marketplace and many opportunities to move up. Management helped in training and the workplace was very supportive and encouraging when taking on new tasks.
good,"Mi dia Cotidiano era ver los planes de produccion que estaban establecido por la gerencia para luego ejecutarlo  en proceso de produccion, aprendi los sistema de produccion como  lipieza  de los equipos de produccion ,saneamiento , preparacion de materia prima para elaboracion de gaseosas , lo que mas me gusto de todo esto fue el aprendizaje que me dejo  de trabajar en equipo ,capacidad de resolver cualquier  situacion que se presentara  ,la buena relacion de equipo de companeros de trabajo y la gerencia"
good,en lo ke estube trabajando ai como chofer de reparto se me iso muy buen ambiente y compañerismo me apoyaban mucho asi como mi supervisora
good,muy buenos los turnos y las oportunidades q dan en la empresa
good,"Great place to work, Pepsico is my second family. Could get paid more. 401k it's not matched because in my role we are union and have a pension plan. Not a good enough excuse for a billion's of dollars company. Pepsico definitely is a place of opportunity for people of all walks of life. They hire a lot of college kids with no experience which is good for young people. Pepsico is my first good paying job thanks a million for the opportunity and experience. There's plenty of job advancement opportunity."
good,Is a fast paced environment that allows interactions which a large range of people from the general public to store managers.  It is labor intensive and great for people who are self-motivated

good,"You come in for a shift meeting everday and get what or running expectations are for the night or day."
good,PepsiCo is an iconic company that manages to turn in growing profits quarter after quarter. They advertise their new products by distributing them free to employee desks. Working remotely is accepted as a legitimate way to contribute.
good,"empresa que visa a graduaçao de funcionarios em cargos,"
good,"todo excelente dentro de las actividades y responsabilidades, aprendí mucho sobre seguridad patrimonial, industrial etc."

good,Excelente empresa con mucho crecimiento organizacional
good,"Absolute great place to work, just a shame its shutting down the Peterlee plant."
good,Good company much expected  I made good money both as a driver and merchandiser. But worked long hard stressful hours. It is the only job I ever worked where I felt like you could be let go at any minute if you failed to do your job up to their high standards. Good management and there is good opportunity to move up within the company.

good,Love the company and atmosphere.  Your shift can range in between 10 to 13 hours.  You get paid every Friday and can make in between 50k to 60k a year.  It's hard on your body and vehicle but the quotas and sales are unrealistic at times because the soda industry is declining.  It comes down to how good of a sales rep you are.
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho era acordar logo cedo carregar o caminhão, sair para as entregas e fazer tudo em tempo sem hora extra."
good,Great business great money and benefits but time consuming long days early mornings typically a great job for older individuals but young individuals can handle the work load

good,I worked hard and i was appreciated for it. TJ was a great boss. I had a great time with the other seasonals. We would all hang out in the lunch room before shift started. Once the shift started we had a healthy competition for fastest picker. Some full timers need to work harder. They don't realize people are doing the same work for way less money at other places. Others are great people and workers.
good,"PepsiCo was my first organisational experience and I loved every bit of it. It was good fun and I had a lot of work to do. I was kept busy and hence, was always occupied with work-which I thought was very good. The office is cool and calm and lots of free food up for grabs."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo; primero la puntualidad y formalidad en el manejo de la agenda, para distribuir las actividades en horarios."
good,Check the number and communicate with previous shift to find out what problems they had all day. Ive learned to run the entire line on my own and what to look out for that can cause big problems. Management work well to keep things flowing well. When someone mixes the preforms and enter the wrong item in the system. Lots of opportunity for growth. Working with big machines
good,PepsiCo is a fun place to work. The only disappointing issues were there was no pay increases. That made it where there were no incentives to progress further.
good,Great company to work for.Great pay and benefits. Enjoyed working for the company. Clean and safe environment  to work in.
good,I would go back to work for this company in a split second if i was physically able to.The management was very easy to talk to and really went out of their way to accomidate their employees needs and requests.The job itself was routine and sometimes boring but that can be a good thing to.

good,"Hard work for the money, but its a stable job. They work with you if you have any personal things outside of work. Its a great atmosphere to work in. The hardest part of the job is the physical part and getting used to how everything works. The most enjoyable part is getting to see the guys you know in the morning and goof off a little before the hard work begins. its a lot harder job than it looks from an outside view."
good,"advancement wasn't really clear in this company as I was very eager to move up after my 1 yr contact, overall great people however management wasn't the greatest in supporting my career. Great benefits."

good,"A typical day at work is getting in early and ...jumping right into "
good,"Nothing was routine. Everyday could be a new adventure or something new to learn.  Depending on the group/function, colleagues became lifetime friends. The opportunity to work with cross-functional colleagues made for great segues into other parts of the companies.  Moving across (even if lateral) divisions/functions was previously slow going but I hear it is more prevalent now."
good,Pepsi seems to have a good idea about work/life balance. Compensation is fair and in some cases more than fair. The facility i worked at seemed like family. Good way for a entry level employee to start and learn the business.
good,"I worked for PepsiCo from November 2013 to December 2015, as a contractor through a temporary agency, in 3 different assignments.  I learned the internal company programs, allowing me the opportunity to move around the company in administrative and coordinator roles.  It was a great learning experience and I would like to become a full-time employee at one of the world's largest consumer products company."

good,"Durante los dos años que labore con Pepsi siempre me senti comoda tanto en mis actividades laborales del dia, hasta en la convivencia con mis jefes y compañeros."
good,A typical day at Pepsi Cola is clocking in at 8:30 and getting started with your assigned morning detail. Afterwards I stacked drinks of all sizes until all morning orders completed. Once back from lunch I cleaned up my designated area and the occasional cut-up with fellow workers until we started with filling and loading the evening route trucks. Most days were like this unless for upcoming holidays.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. A little bit segmented, but this is to be expected in a company of this size. A typical day at work would be a steady stream of meeting management and ad hoc reporting."

good,"A typical day started with checking the production schedule to calculate how much space would be needed to accomodate new product while unloading the production lines, shipping and receiving and moving older product to create space for new product. this process continued thru 3 shifts. when problems arose management was very helpful! co-workers were helpful when someone spilled a pallet, they would chip in to clean up the mess! I learned to operate a type of forklift I had never seen or heard of before that is capable of carrying two pallets side by side! the hardest part of the job was keeping up with the production line while making space for new product! the most enjoyable part of the job was easy days when the product was loaded directly from the line into a series of railroad containers!"

good,I've learned a great amount of skills at this position.  I became fond of meeting new people at job locations and became friendly with the customers in my area of service.  Management at this location was very good to me.  They were very understanding of my needs as an employee and I was able to create good friendships.  My co-workers were great.  They were always willing to help in a time of need and we were a very tight-nit group. I enjoyed the every day interaction with customers as well as exploring new territory.
good,"My day could be different every day.  The one job done everyday was cashiering.  Payments made to drivers by customers were counted and applied to customer accounts.  I created the daily deposit and ran reports."

good,"es una muy buena empresa,nunca dejas de aprender cosas nuevas,lo mejor ahi una confianza unica hacia tus superiores,muy gratos colegas,y la parte mas dificil es cumplir con los objetivos mes a mes pero no imposibles porque el que tiene gara siempre cumplira con sus metas,y lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo es que un vendedor nunca tiene que conformarce siempre tiene que querer mas y mas."
good,"a typical day at work will always start at what your Supervisor will ask to you upon arriving at the office,nonetheless,you'l start your day    what things you knew you haven't done yet and must fulfill within the day. Other things,you ended up from helping co-workers when help is highly needed(New comers/New co-workers undeniably are the most who needed it the most).Being the man who has a litle knowledge in the field of Math,It is the hardest part of you to learn 'forcely"" to convince them that your capable on the given job and it is a great pleasure for me to learn and received knowledge about it because I know it is a part of growing.The most enjoyable part from the job given to me was to learn to love it the way it is."
good,A typical day at Pepesi America was always on the go very fast paced and extremely physical demanding job. what I learned was that delivering pop beverages is very challenging and takes a special type of person to do the job. And the hardest part of the job is meeting delivery schedules. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiling faces on the customers.
good,Recibes turno recibes orden de trbajo preparas igualas en laboratorio haces pruebas y corres en linea
good,Typically on a daily basis my job is to make sure that I have dispatched the best and most efficient route to deliver our product to our customers. I have learned how to identify opportunities in saving the company money on the way we dispatch routes for daily delivery. Management has helped in getting the locations on board with SDO Dispatch. My co-workers are very talented in optimizing dispatch and very hard workers in trying to identify on how to save money for PepsiCo. The hardest part of our job will have to be when we are not able to deliver to our customers due to inclement weather so we have to try and make that up to the customers. The most enjoyable part is saving money for PepsiCo while making sure that we deliver to all of our customers.

good,"Easy work once you get use to it didn't have a set time off tho so my schedule was 4pm till finish. Could be 12:30am 8 hours or the latest I got out was 8:30am just depending on the work load & how many people picking in that day. Also you gotta account if anybody called off or leave work early that adds more work time I know it sounds like a lot but if you about making money this is the job. My first year I made $60,000 no lie a lot of overtime to get that but it was worth it I rather make money then sit at home doing nothing. Your job title is Forklift Operator but you start off as a picker which is hard at first cause you don't know where everything is in the warehouse. You riding on a walkie rider which can be scary at first if you never rode one. You have to pick a certain amount of cases per hour, which is easy for some but the job not for everyone.  The employees I work with was the best worked with all guys in the nightloading department we was like brothers, we all went out together bars, clubs, and the strip club. Worked out every night after work, took turns driving out for lunch. Thats the type of guys you wanna work with. But its not gonna be a lot of family time like that so if you married or have a girlfriend get use to her not believing you always at work. But since you at work all the time you won't have time to spend money like that so you will have money in the bank thats the bright side but bids come up all the time so you won't have to be in the nightloading position long."
good,"Me gusta el trato comercial con el cliente."

Una de las situaciones mas difíciles son las colas  de la región capital ya que con un vehículo tan grande es difícil de manipular en caracas. La estabilidad laboral, el sueldo y el adiestramiento que da esta empresa son estupendos."

good,"•	Implemented all sales activities to satisfy customer request. "
good,"Very physical job. Not a job for a woman but I do a very good job.  The people are awesome.  Good people.  I learned a great deal from lots of people in this job.  First, communication is important.  It is also lacking in the field.  Second, the big dogs in their cool offices think they know everything.  Makes it rough on the little dogs like me.  Lastly, numbers is all bosses want.  When they achieve their numbers they are in good moods. They don't achieve their numbers bad moods and someone is to blame on the bottom.  All in all you see this in every company so it is no big deal to anyone.  I would refer someone to this company.  Love working with this group."
good,The day would start off with a safety meeting to discuss any incidents that occurred on our last shift and anything that has happened since. Then we would stretch together to warm up our muscles and also as a team builder between the shift and management. After we stretch we sign in to the voice pick system to receive our assignments while we work. I learned a lot about teamwork everything that I was assigned effected someone else's tasks. For instance if it was my job to build the palate once I indicate that I was done the system would have someone else to come pick it up. To me the hardest part of the job was dealing with a system failure because it caused us to lose production.
good,Great place to work or at least it was when I was there. Family atmosphere. Hard work but worth while.

I also encouraged my drivers and merchandisers to become better employees through hard work and by taking ""ownership"" of their Route and or position. We worked as a unit to benefit the customers and this also allowed us to become more efficient at our positions. We relied on each other to get our jobs done. ""Communication ""was stressed within the company, or at least with my managers and my team."

good,"Pepsi is great place to work, like all jobs it has some cons but overall it is one of the best jobs I have had. In the summer expect to work long hours 50-60 a week, slows down towards the fall but still guaranteed 40 hours. As a merchandiser your basically out on your own with no supervision, don't have to worry about somebody looking over your shoulder 24/7, physical job , can cause wear and tear on the body"

After completing the pallet, I would shrink wrap the pallet and print out a sticker to stick on the pallet. I would then either load on the truck or stage in a location depending on where we were at on a current load sheet. I maintained over 200 cases per hour as for quota, had to keep isles ways clean and cut plastic on all pallets for saftey. End of night I would get a specific isle to clean( removing empty pallets, putting plastic in a baler, and make all pallets with product on them as even as possible)"

good,"Trabajo muy dinamico, tranquilo, trabajo en equipo"
good,"I got hired at Pepsi as my first trucking job. At first it was very challenging both physically and mentally. But once I got used to it I had a lot of fun.

good,"If your looking for a behind the wheel driver job this is not it. You typically start your day at 430-500 am, pre trip your truck, then you start a pre plan route that consists of 12 or more stops averaging about 600 plus cases divided into those stops. Not only do you have to deliver the product but you also have to merchandise each item ie put on shelf’s and coolers and rotate them. Each stop is timed according to what Pepsi thinks it should take you to deliver but it’s never enough. Your typically looking at 12 to 14 hour days on average. If your in shape this is a great starting cdl local position. I enjoyed my time at Pepsi cola but the work ran my body down. If you land a promotion you move directly into sales and it’s pretty much smooth sailing from there. Medical and dental are the in the market and the pay was around 48 to 49 thousand a year. Time off was every weekend but no holidays. Would I go back? If my body could still handle it yes I would. It’s a young mans job, but if you hang in there promotions come quick."
good,"Focus on the company and your individual experience while employed there"
good,"Great place to work, great pay , great benefits but there could be a better balance of work and home life. Working for PepsiCo can be quite demanding."
good,Working at PepsiCo was an amazing experience but sucked cause hours were never really set on a new machine they were trying out and the hiring manager was really snotty

good,"I worked 3 times in 5 years as a Contacted Temp and each time loved my jobs there...but alas each one ended before my contract was due to end with the Agency I worked for due to Budget Cuts...so have been trying to land a permanent job there...but so far to no avail.

good,Great place to start in career. Flexible working hours depending on your manager. Lots of resources to learn from and employees of differing experiences.
good,"I have worked for many companies in my lifetime and PepsiCo seems to be one of the best I have ever worked for. The workplace offers good benefits, a pension plan and it is unionized to help the workers get yearly raises and make sure their pay meets with inflation. It is what you would expect from a manufacturer, they have typical manufacturing shifts. Which you are allowed to bid on every year to try to get what suits you best based off of your seniority.  The job is fairly easy if you make sure you keep yourself ahead. Some days it can be stressful but finding a workplace with zero stress is unrealistic. The factory is older so in the summer it can get pretty hot. The highest I have seen is in the mid to high 40’s. But when it reaches higher temperatures heat breaks and free Gatorade is supplied a lot. As well there is water coolers everywhere. A lot of the staff are super friendly and it is like a big family. I truly love my job with the company and hope to see them grow and succeed."
good,"Mis logros: Manejo de herramientas corporativas Software de alto nivel que por razones ética no evidencio, excel, interacción contac-center, manejo de montacargas, inventarios cíclicos, seguimiento y respuesta de correos corporativos, en fin, dan la oportunidad de crecimiento personal para el que deseé aportar a ambas partes."
good,"I loved my job here. Management was always great as long as you did your job, and the pay was something way above and beyond what other warehouses pay. Very fast paced environment and everyone worked together as a team to achieve our goals. Unfortunately an unintentional mistake on my part caused my employment here to be terminated. Other than that, this was a job I could've seen myself making a career out of."

good,muy buen grupo de trabajo con excelentes oportunidades de desarrollo y crecimiento a plazo corto
good,"Performance with purpose is the best phrase I have ever heard. Working at PepsiCo Venezuela is a challenge. Venezuela is a country very dynamic. Laws encourage to develop new strategies to face the unions and to work together looking for the best strategies to reach the company goals."
good,"Overall, the company is pretty good to work for. One the day of orientation, you'll have insurance which is a huge plus! The starting pay was $16.10 when I started, but we received a raise which bumped us up to $16.60/hr. Overtime during the summer is pretty good. But, when the season ends, the hours will decrease. I'd advise you to be persistent when asking for hours. Learn about all of the machines so they can put you anywhere when needed.  The work shifts are 12 hours, which can be a lot at first, but you'll get use to it. You'll be on your feet most of the day. Lastly, management communicates pretty well and they're honest."
good,"PepsiCo is an amazing company all around. Great environment, work life balance and salary. The only downside is there is a lot of restructures of the company."
good,Es una empresa que constantemente esta retando tu capacidad y te ayuda a descubrir fortalezas que no sabias que contaras con ellas.

good,Everyone was very welcoming and helpful even though I was only there for a short period of time. Always given extra to do if asked which made the work day a lot easier. Enjoyed my time here.
good,"I enjoyed working at pepsi, very relaxed, non stressful job. I enjoyed working with everyone there. Everybody was always in a great mood, there was no tension between other departments, and the benefits were good."
good,"Pepsi constantly keeps you on your toes.  The work environment is very quick paced, and you are constantly making big and small decisions.  Business is always changing so you have to learn to change with it."
good,"Gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa, porém o que me deixou a desejar foi a terceirizada para fazer as contratações. A Manpower Staffing é horrível, tem um péssimo atendimento, não me informou o endereço da empresa (tive que me virar nos 30 e procurar no Google Mapas), o cartão vale ""refeição"" que por alguma ironia não funciona em restaurantes (só em padaria, posto de gasolina, mercados. tirando isso, não funciona em mais lugar nenhum e já passei por muitos inconvenientes e constrangimentos por causa da mancada dessa ManPower Staffing), os atendentes não sabem orientar os funcionários e encerraram os contratos antes do tempo."
good,I enjoyed my time there . Unfortunately living in Philly we had a soda tax in effect. Company had no choice to start cutting wages and letting people go. I survived the cut and eventually moved to a different state . Only negative thing I can say about the company was they didn’t do a great job on my transfer .

You get a good view of each part of the sales team, and then work on a personal project for the duration of your internship."
good,"Before I experienced a horrific off the job accident, I enjoyed my 2-year tenure at Pepsi-Co. At first, the idea of handling and/or performing heavy duty tasks had me trembling. There was a lot of heavy lifting and machinery involved. Luckily, I started off making boxes and assisting the tech center workers with packaging beverages. Sometimes I would empty the trash and clean the preparatory room. A few months later, I performed heavier duties such as helping the warehouse workers lift packages that weighed at least sixty pounds. Another task I was assigned to in the warehouse was to help organize heavy pallets and assist the recycling department. Soon, I learned how to operate machinery in the recycling area. It was nice to learn how to perform these overwhelming tasks with fluency within a year.  "

If you do Route Sales you're making at least 50 grand a year.  Drivers make a flat rate of 200/day, my typical day as a driver - I started at 3AM to load my truck, normally finished around 11AM.  Some days were 10 hours (which they base your pay on.  4 days a week working, 10/hours a day flat rate).  I had maybe 3 11/12 hour days because of long wait times for other trucks to deliver and get out of the bay.  I had about 5 days where I was done my delivers and back in shop heading back home and I only worked a total of 5-6 hours (still getting that full days pay feels great!)."

good,"Uma ótima empresa,ambiente de trabalho,os colegas,sem comentário,foi ótimo trabalha nessa Empresa."
good,"It would be wrong to say that a day you spend in PepsiCo is identical to the next one. At least once a month we have education sessions in order to learn how to use a new tool or a new system. Till now I've learned how to use a planogram tool to use it in Category Management for optimization. I'm extremely happy of my co-workers and how both teams (I work with two different teams for two different projects.) connect with each other. The hardest part of the job is actually working with two different teams. When a task is given by both groups it is hard to prioritize one over another. On the other hand, because this makes the job more challenging it also makes it more enjoyable. Once I complete both tasks before the expected, desired due date and send it to my managers the feedbacks I receive and the satisfaction I feel are priceless."

good,I loved this job and the responsibility that was involved with the loading/unloading of product and the inventory aspect. Great company to work for and would still be there if this location hadn't closed to downsize.Only negative is the 2nd shift which was not a big problem due to that's the only time available to load trucks for daytime delivery.
good,"Habría el Cedis  alas 6:00 am. recibía a los vendedores con una tolerancia de 5 min. ya que ellos entraban 6:30 y daba salida a alas Rutas yo trabajaba con la Ruta con mayor oportunidad la cual planeaba el día sábado y fijaba los indicadores a mejorar el cual entregaba un reporte semanal a mi jefe directo Gerente Divisional en la cual  capturábamos clientes nuevos revisaba la frescura de nuestro producto y como estaba la competencia siempre buscando la mejora continua "

Tomo inventario físico de maíz, de papa y aceite,  y lo comparo con el inventario del sistema SAP. Sigo recibiendo maíz, papa y aceite y sigo capturando la información en el sistema. Proporciono la información que se me solicita desde mi jefe inmediato.

good,"it was a great place to work i enjoyed it. i learned hard work management was good,the hardest part about the job for me was waking up at 6 in the morning"
good,"My experience at PepsiCo was the ideal internship experience. I got to truly experience what it was like as a full time packaging engineer by traveling to almost 20 locations around the country, participating in actual qualification trials, performing testing in a laboratory setting, and assist other engineers with their projects and testing. I learned more than I ever did during school from having real-world experience. My coworkers were all extremely helpful when I had questions or needed help but they were also really fun to be around. The hardest part of this job was that sometimes communication among a few team members was lacking, but I feel that can happen anywhere. The pay for an internship was better than what some full time engineers at other companies will offer, so it's incredibly competitive. They didn't assist much with relocation besides having a housing allowance. As an intern who will be there for a temporary period of time and who can't really visit the area beforehand, a few options and some help would have been really beneficial. Overall, they are pretty relaxed about the time you come to work and leave as long as you get your work done, and they never nickel-and-dime you on business trip expenses."

good,"Un día normal no con tantos contratiempos no se trabaja bajo presión , aprendo muchas cosas buenas ya que constantemente estamos en  cursos y charlas , buenos compañeros de trabajo."
good,"So I am currently a weekend merchandise, I only work on the weekends. The order comes to large format stores, such as Wal-Mart, giant eagle, and shop and save, I then proceed to put the product on the shelf(merchandise). It is also my responsibility to keep the designated back stock area neat and clean, then I condense the product the best I can, that means trying to pack all the back stock on as few pallets as possible. I originally thought that this would be a easy job, however it is a physically challenging job, at a large Wal-Mart you could easily get 20 pallets of product, allot of which would be cubes or twelve packs. That would be just one stop, you could have two more stops with orders of their own, at my plant my bosses are good at balancing out the stops so it's not terrible. You have to drive your own vehicle, that's worth a mention because people don't seem to understand what I do. I have seen people crash and burn with this job, I found that it's hard to get your groove going, and you can't make a mountain out of a mole hill. You are responsible for doing your job, and you have to do a good job, I find my self saying in my head ""labels out marino"", and when you front up a shelf always go two deep. Basically if you don't mind hard work and develop a good work ethic you will be ok. You can make a career out of Pepsi, just have to work your way up, this is a long review because I don't think people understand what you will be doing. All in all I would tell people to try it out."

Corporate is much better than an independent bottler(have worked for both) as they pay better, offer more hours, and much better benefits. Of course you must live/work in a corporate plant operated area to get on with Pepsi America..."
good,One of my favorite careers.  It was unfortunate that they closed down all the production facilities in my area which left me without a future with this company.

Very good company to work for with growth opportunity and lots of over time. Typical plant environment with major focus on cleanliness, and safety over all. Great benefits and a very reliable company awesome management work is easy, I learned to operate all the machines in about one year, the hardest thing about the job is the weather elements if its summer its very hot in the building and very cold in the winter time so dress accordingly. The most enjoyable about the job was decent pay and overtime opportunity and vacation."
good,The most fun i had at pepsi was when we had free barbecue and soda. what i normally did was put product on the shelves and made sure the product was rotated.
good,"We worked many long hours in the summer but I loved my job!!  I always had good supervisors that worked with you and your family life and needs.  I wish I could go back!!

Its hard to not make life long friends with many coworkers because there are so many great people.  One of the hardest parts of the job is the amount of multi tasking you do but also one of the best parts of the job.  Your shift flies by because of the amount of work there is always to be done.

Some days you would have to build displays (Big Displays) and if the store manager thought it was off by even an inch they would make you redo the whole display all over again. Like i said all days were different, although it was a lot of work i appreciated that i was by my self representing the company in the different accounts."

good,"Every day I have a route to complete with a previously loaded trailer. Over the years at Pepsi I learned how to safely load a hand truck to do the deliveries and how to load the 2-wheelers safely if the product goes up and or downstairs. Management and dispatch are phenomenal, you will feel confident talking to them for any reason good or bad news. Co-workers and dispatch are very helpful, if somebody is falling behind on their route they will help from taking stops from each other to make a route smaller and you can call anyone for directions if you are not familiar with an area. I think the hardest part of Pepsi is bumping the hand trucks up and or down narrow staircases that are spiral. The best part of Pepsi I feel is management and co-workers, I felt very comfortable calling anyone at any time and if somebody did not have an answer they would find somebody who does in a timely manner."
