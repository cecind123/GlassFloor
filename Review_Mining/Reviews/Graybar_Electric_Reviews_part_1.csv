bad,"Don't even give yourself the opportunity to put yourself through the stress of this place. Managers that ask employees how to do their job. It's one of those jobs that they will tell you what you want to hear to keep you and keep you working hard but everything stays the same. Horrible shifts, poor management, low pay.....need I say more?"
bad,"It doesnt matter if your right.  It will be your fault. There is no accountability.  Nothing you do will improve the culture here. It's best to find something else. During the interview just lie, because the person interving you is lying to you for sure.  I hope this place burns to the ground."
bad,The people and management sucked the men that worked there were mean. Too much favortetism. No warehouse help left by yourself with a lot of work. Getting written up for dumb reasons.
bad,"A typical day began with a demeaning and childish meeting for employees to be scolded for doing things that management refused to actually deal with. "
bad,Great company to work for.  You are working with data or electrical contractors for the most part who are on time restraints in order to complete the job.
bad,Management sucks! No training what so ever! You are excepted to know your job after 1 day and if you don’t you get in trouble. Management just sits on their butts all day not trying to help you learn. Do NOT work for this place!!!!
bad,Don’t do it all they care about is the numbers and production of you take off everybody knows your business management is poor manager is very lazy doesn’t help at all if team is short you work in multiple departments everyday can’t leave until work is finish no set time to get off
bad,"This company is not a good place to work at. By month three I was already looking for other jobs. The pay is not good enough for the amount of work they will have you doing. Every other day, something is breaking down whether it;s the A/C or machines. The summer times are brutal working here because the warehouse has poor A/C systems. Everyone including the managers and supervisors are rude, ghetto, and unprofessional. You will receive negative energy from coworkers, especially the elders who've been there 20 plus years, and from supervisors who barely know how to do their job. If you have an issue with someone, don't even think to report them to the manager of the warehouse or HR because nothing will be done. The supervisors also have ""favorites"", meaning they don't treat everyone fairly. This company is a hole in a wall place for people who can't find a job that's better. Only the supervisors and managers receive bonuses. Benefits don't apply unless you stay here for a year. You only receive stock if you stay with the company for three years.Everyday you will be mentally and physically drained to the point where you may consider taking medications just to be able to make it through the day. It's not a good place to work."

bad,"I worked at the Carteret location in NJ for 9 months and this has to be one of the most poorly managed warehouses I’ve ever had the displeasure of calling my work place. Upper management doesn’t know how to speak to people like adults and makes the floor workers pick up the slack for their poor decisions throughout the day. If you enjoy being talked down to after breaking your back for 10+ hours 5 days a week please by all means work the floor at Graybar Electric. "
bad,"I was employed through a temp agency and it was not a pleasant environment."
bad,"Bad branch manager, not qualified for this position. Office moral is terrible. The worst place to work. The manager at this location writes everyone up for small mistakes"
bad,"Managers are in it for themselves. It's the ""Good Ole Boys"" club. You are either in the club or not, that simple. No room for advancement in this area."
bad,"There wasn't much fun at this place as the warehouse manager, assistant warehouse manager would sneak around the warehouse spying on what your doing and on how long it should've taken to do it. They didn't care how hard you where working for them it wasn't good enough for them."
bad,"Insecure leadership. ""GOOD OLD BOYS"" network.  Extremely rigid, employees are secondary (treated like slaves), no work/life balance, no flexible work schedule,  Only Managers can work from home"
bad,"Do not work for this place!!!  Management is terrible and can be borderline harassing when it comes to tasks. "
bad,"don't become a ""lifer""..... pumped to look good....but once you are there its total opposite. Don't waste your skills and time"
bad,Pretty good place to work but very old fashioned management. Not willing to change. People are pretty nice just wish it was more diverse.
bad,"Managed invoices, switchboard, BOL, ordering supplies.  Poorly managed."
bad,"People who have given poor reviews are pretty much right on the money, and they're not even in the same State as I. Not everyone is treated the same. A lot of BS, and no discipline action is tooken...ever! Warehouse mgr. favors certain people and departments. The pay sucks! No structure to work flow. I can go on and on, but will save them the embarrassment of it all! I should say that under the material handler position that was/is posted on this website...under Experience it says ""No experience needed"". Need I say more?"
bad,Graybar has worthless management with controlling raciest views in running the Accounts Payable Department. 
bad,was unhappy at this company management was very rude made the day extremely long and unbearable
bad,"I never have bad feelings about a job. But I have never worked somewhere feeling so low I am unappreciated. I worked so hard there, and only got a .23 raise after three years. No one ever advanced. Two supervisors and seven employees quit while I was working there.  You are treated very unfairly. I hate to give a bad review. But I have never been treated like this in my life .  I stuck it out because it was a hard time in my life and I did what I could to support my fam"
bad,"was a good place and now its a sales nightmare, you have to work 10-15 hrs a day to make budget and then you are undermined by your boss since he wants to move up and use you as a stepping stone."
bad,Not the best place to work.  No training and low pay.  I was bored.  Promises were made and not kept.  The benifits are great.  I would not recommend working here at all.
bad,"This has been by far the absolute worst job I have ever had in my entire work history.  Currently, they are laying off and firing people left and right.  Even the human resources person was let go!  The pay is a joke at 12 dollars per hour as a packer.  The workload outweigh the pay by a ton.  The plant manager walks around all day looking at people while they work.  The rules and company policy apply to those they choose.  The morale is completely gone from all of the layoffs and firings.  They're clearly downsizing but won't admit it.  This place is a complete joke do not waste your time!"
bad,I learned nothing. For the use of SAP I was given no training. I was told to ask someone then write it down. In a 20yr sales career I have never been set up for failure like with Graybar. Graybar could have been set up with hundreds of millions and/or more with my extensive black book of professional and personal contacts.  Due to small mindedness and inability to grasp the scope of things they never will.  Management has no idea how to manage.  Cursing throughout theboffice. Dip spitting at employees desk and by far the most disgustingly filthy office I have EVER seen. That part aline constitutes a health hazard.
bad,This place is terrible. Management is the worst. If you see a job opening run away as fast as you can. They are a company that plays not to lose instead of playing to win. There inside sales and support people are arrogant and lazy. Management is the same way.
bad,"My experience in Graybar was terrible , the Lady Supervisor has the control so she does that she wants."
bad,"terrible management."
bad,I was only temporary at this job.   Worked with some good people>  Management were professional and good job training.  No other specifics that come to mind.
bad,Hamster wheel of a job with very little job security. Used to be when you were hired there if you hit your sales goals you wouldn't receive a negative review from management. That has changed.
bad,"They do not have HR representation on local level."
bad,"Impossible to advance unless you're a favorite, no matter how hard you work and how many extra projects you take on. Raises are next to nothing, even while taking on job duties of a higher level. No yearly bonuses unless you're in sales. You're required to do everything you're told, no matter how unethical...if you question it, you're retaliated against. Horrible company, horrible uneducated management that don't care about their employees, would never recommend to anyone."
bad,They only get promoted to management on seniority not by the work you do.  When your managers is always asking you for help because they don’t know what they are doing is very discouraging.  I knew I would never get promoted because people where there for a long time and since they don’t care about how well you perform and how much you know I would never get promoted
bad,"Started in the Dublin Branch. My original manager said I would be promoted in 3-4 months. So I started going out to businesses and making sales under my boss name. He quite before my 3 months and did not inform the new manager about the promotion or the sales I made. Didn't matter anyways because I was then brought over to a whole new division of new sales trainees. So after a month of going over the basics again with my new division, I asked my manager when I was going to get promoted and what about my sales I processed, because up till this point I was making sales and not receiving any credit. He said he had know idea... He didn't even know i was working with customers. So it turns out all my sales went to the company....... about 30k in profit.... It has been about 8 months now with the company and still have no idea what my role is or if I'll be promoted to an outside rep. I've been doing the work of an inside and outside rep and getting paid as a trainee. I was lied to before I was even hired. I will say that I have meet other employees in the company who absolutely love it. I possibly just had a bad original manager who was trained badly? But the manager I have now is pretty worthless when and if he ever shows up to the office. My advice, try this place if you like SAP and have knowledge of the industry. And if you do get hired on make sure you get everything promised to you in writing with a signature from your manager."
bad,The Graybar in San Antonio is the most hostile place I've ever worked for . Nobody is happy working there. If they are there they have 1 foot out the door and are looking for another place to land. Management is the worst . As a Company they are a good company . They are just a bad company in San Antonio.
bad,Your boss will most likely take all of your credit then give you someone else's job to do as well without any raises. You will be fired when you are not needed anymore. Enjoy!
bad,"I worked there for about a year and a half. All I can say if you are looking for a solid job, this is not the company you would like to work for. There are so much favoritism and racism going on. And no matter how hard you try, the more you have to pick up other peoples work load."
bad,graybar may be good company but taunton zone is very poorly managed warehouse
bad,Completely disposable.  You are just the next person in line.  It is not a career it's a temporary job.  This is a hostile working environment by design.
bad,"No training"
bad,"This is a billion dollar company put yet they cant afford shop fan in the warehouse. Cold cold in the warehouse. Dusty no one there cleans as they work no training."
bad,"Graybar upper management is numbers driven. So when things are good its a easy going atmosphere but when there’s trouble the blame trickles down. Communication is terrible. I was trained by a temp, whom I was replacing. I was thrown at my job with minimal training but expected by upper management to know everything. You never really know your doing something wrong until they pull you into there office for a scolding. Work flow is terrible. There is a ton of down time just standing around or pushing a broom. Employees are constantly complaining and unless you’ve been there for 20 years, you won’t fit in. Pay and benefits are decent, it’s what keeps me around. Be weary of Graybar, it can be a very frustrating place to work."
bad,Very high in demand job alot of responsibility.  Manager was not a good person and the other co-worker was extremely lazy
bad,"This place is terrible. There is almost no advancement opportunity. I have seen great workers that have been with the company for years get passed up on promotions for people that are going to go nowhere in the company. There is no recognition for being a great worker. The second something unexpected pops up, everyone notices you and has no problem telling you how bad you are doing. Stay away from this company if you have a college degree, they are completely useless and won't help you advance whatsoever. It is extremely discouraging for those that are trying to get somewhere in life."
bad,Great culture if you are in St Louis or any place that has no competition. The sales ideas are good but you need to make sure you are on the right team for good support. Branches that have competition are never 1st or 2nd in the marketplace....8th or 9th is more like it
bad,Seems like the harder you work at Graybar electric the less you will go somewhere within the company. They like to promote people that don't do anything so don't bother busting your butt for them. If you are a butt kisser this is a perfect job for you. The management is mediocre to say the least they don't know what they're doing half the time or how to deal with their employees. I wouldn't  suggest this company to anybody.
bad,The customer service job is a data entry position.  Little to no human interaction on a day to day basis.  The management and co workers are very “clicky” and two faced.  They said “it wasn’t a good fit” after only weeks of working there.  Well then why did you offer me the job?  Become a better interviewer and present the job more accurately in the beginning and then you will find better “fits”
bad,"First, this company will lie to you, so get everything in writing.  (bonus structure, pay amount negotiated vacation, etc).  Second, anyone with anything good to say about Graybar is either drinking the kool-aid and has been for quite some time, or they have been at Graybar for 20+ years, and have earned a mediocre living at best.  I am sorry, I never bash previous employers, but my experience with Graybar leave's me with zero faith in the electrical distribution job market.  If you know someone higher up at Graybar, by all means go work there.  If you work hard, put in you're time, and enjoy working as a team and bring solid energy and work ethic to your job, this isn't the place for you."
bad,Sales job with lots of paperwork. Poor management great co-workers. Job involved lots of paperwork and travel. All the perks were very nice.
bad,"I swore I'd retire from Graybar but it didn't work out. I created a lot of friends and family because no one ever leaves Graybar which says something about the company. I do believe it's headed in a different direction now. It's not about the employees, it's about keeping the business alive."
bad,"Management lets you work at your own pace, doesn't hold most accountable. There are alot of talented employees that work for the company, but the management doesn't care, so in turn the employees doesn't care."
bad,The company has great benefits but is far from a professional organization. Perhaps that is what comes from an employee owned company. I was hired on to work as a supervisor for a new and upcoming branch. I was told I would be provided with the training and tools I would need to accomplish my job. But on my first day they had no idea what to do with me. They sat me down and just had me read policy documents all day long. No onboarding procedures to follow what so ever! No training plan was set in place. They just had me work in the warehouse to keep me busy. When I was finally given a training plan no timeframes were set. The trrainer went about his business and didn't pay much attention to training me. Management is very unorganized. I was told that the Branch in my area would open soon then they kept on pushing out the date further and further. No action on the part of management. Not to mention the hiring process is long. From my first interview to my start date was about 3 months. No sense of motivation to bring new employees on board.
bad,"I knew within two weeks after starting at Graybar that it was not the right job environment for me.  After promising myself to stay twelve months, I barely made it to eleven."
bad,"Hired part time, 24 hours a week.  My hours changed after I was hired from 24 hours to 20 hours.  I was given no sense of direction for on the job training. I felt like I was being led around by my nose. The job was super easy, as doing a count on batch files, I was constantly interrupted by Trainer, her asking me how I was doing, several times (How hard is it to count, unless your are interrupted), which created me to start over on my count. Direct supervisor creates a cold atmosphere and no personality.  My desk sat out in the open, terrible music played from the intercom above my desk, which is a big distraction in trying concentrate."
bad,"Typical day at work is sitting at your desk and shuffling papers. Older organization to help the ""New"" guy. Co-workers were always eager to help. Hardest part of the job was trying to find old documentation."
bad,"If you're looking for a warehouse position, do not even consider the Toledo Ohio location. The warehouse is over filled with material to the point that it is difficult to drive a forklift through. You have to move five things to get to one and more just kept coming everyday. It is unsafe. "
bad,"What a joke. I’ve noticed now they are not even giving people the false hope of having a decent long term job to progress but offering a one year contract. When you come in you will be expected to have post secondary education, warehouse experience and electrical knowledge. This is for the “entry level job” once your hired you will be doing the work of three people for and working for peanuts"
bad,"While trying to complete your job, there are way to many up level manager and not of workers on the floor to complete your job. Also second guessed by them, but never given the tools to complete your job properly."
bad,"Management had their favorites, couldn't talk at all, had set break and lunch schedule, had to fight to get ahead.  Did not look forward to going to work at all."
bad,"Training is very minimal, they just throw you out there after 30 days of sitting at a computer.Management is awful and play favorites. Terrible culture, archaic office, HORRIBLE PAY. Don't listen to any employee ideas. Held to unrealistic goals while not being able to socialize with Co workers. Awful management in the sales center!!!"
bad,"If you like to do alot of drugs, apply here, that is mostly what they like to hire, mostly just dope smokers, and coke heads. Go to your nearest nutrition store, buy your fake urine, and you will be fine. Also, the Delivery Drivers, and warehouse workers Do Not receive profit sharing, like all other locations, greedy greedy company. you have to sit on your butt in front of a computer in the air conditioning, not breaking a sweat to get those extra perks."
bad,"I worked in the corporate offices in Clayton, MO. The entire time I worked there, Human Resources could not sort out my insurance benefits. It was impossible to get my doctor visits and prescriptions covered as outlined in the employee handbook. It wasn't complicated. My manager had a drinking problem, and was impossible to work with. He could not have a professional conversation, and was very ballistic. I worked under a person with less experience and training, and from the initial start date, I was excluded from meetings and information pertinent to my duties."
bad,"I worked for this company for several years and saw how people such as one coworker with over 30 years experience was laid off with nothing more than a rude letter and treated like a felon when someone stood over them while they cleaned out their desk. Micro managed by staff from the long island city office who had no idea what was going on in the Albany branch and frankly didn't care, petty little wars between idioticsalemen and administrative types with no clue how to treat customers and coworkers! I liked a lot of my coworkers but overall the place sucked to work at, no advance, no raises, lots of promises and nothing to show for it but a niceletter saying sorry, we cut your position..."
bad,"South Bend location spent tons of money on new facilities but zero on people!"
bad,"I regret taking the job at Graybar but like most I went for the money after being out of work for many months, probably the 4th best Electrical Distributor in Houston. Corporate does not invest money into the working environment of the building, it looks like a old 1970's office setting i.e. old carpet, 70's desk and chairs, no cubicles, open floor concept. On the Commercial side the Branch Manager is lacking in management and Social skills. You are not given the tools to be successful, nor are you given the time to establish new accounts, there is major pressure to produce immediately. Even though most Sales Reps on the Commercial side sign a 2 year guarantee you are NOT given that time, most get 6 months and then you are let go if you are not meeting monthly sales goals. There are some young talented people that work there but soon leave after they realize there is better options in the industry. Graybar is a good step in stone to entering the Electrical Industry but I recommend looking for a more solid opportunity else where!"
bad,Supervisor need to be evaluated and held responsible for their unprofessional actions. This branch should take care of their employees. Their track record shows the turnover of employees for a reason.
bad,"The hours were different "
bad,"I have been working since 1998 and I never have experience like this one , bad experience."
bad,"Working at graybar in Hayward, Ca was terrible. There was actually an employee that was written up 4 times in one year, had 2 no call/no shows, came to work drunk and stoned, and didn't do any work. He actually got a raise! When there were at least 10 people who deserved it more, and got absolutly no raise. An employee actually called HR about the drug and alchohal abuse. Our manager called the guy before work and informed him he had been reported to HR, and told him to come to work sober and be on his best behavior. This was an on going theme at this company. Managers also share employees personal information with other employees. So if you like finishing someones work because their too intoxicated to do it themselves, Graybar is for you."
bad,Frankly and honestly this was one the worst job experiences Ive had here right here in the Charlotte NC area. Poor set up and standard operating procedures not to mention guidance/support from management.
bad,There are a few good normal Managers at the Portland Graybar. Unfortunatley there are also a couple of the worst managers I have ever had the displeasure of working with. Socially  awkward weird rude sneaky and irritating . The training is from the 80's and does not teach you what you need to know .
bad,The sales manager there never went over any sales goals with me.  They have good people working  that are willing to help you. The sales manager is no help at all!  I did get some training but never got to use it.
bad,"This is a large company with various locations all over the world. The internal communications between management and workers is horrendous. The work load is unbalance between associates forcing other employees to take extra work load. Although company provides for transfers to other locations, there was no communication provided when requesting to transfer. Personal experience rates this company very poor."
bad,Management VERY SLOW to act on immediate needs creating a poor and stressful workplace environment. Would NOT recommend working there.
bad,Honestly it was like high school working here. I worked at the warehouse in Richmond VA and it was terrible. The warehouse manager was very rude to all of the employees. He went as far as asking one of the guys I worked with if he was blind or just dumb. We had human resources in the warehouse every other month because of something the manager said or did. Employees would come to work drunk and would sleep on a desk and others would just not do their job at all. I was fired for using sick days and vacation time when my family was going through a rough time. This is a company that I will never work for again and I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. I have no bad feelings towards this place I just want to give everyone a heads up.
bad,As a truck driver I would go and Perform my duties to the best of my ability.learn to appreciate customers and their business.doing the right job and stand by it was wend of day joy.poor performance and not taking charge and be a leader example was hard through the day.
bad,"Neurotic supervisors, low pay, ZERO overtime allowed, supervisor sends massive amounts of emails wanting explanations for why you did something the way you did, as if they analyze every sales order. Basically, conform to their ways or you’re gone. Lots of very outdated policies. Sales staff not given all the tools to do their job. Operating system is NOT user friendly for sales, way too complicated, making the job twice as hard."
bad,"Started in the Dublin Branch. My original manager said I would be promoted in 3-4 months. So I started going out to businesses and making sales under my boss name. He quite before my 3 months and did not inform the new manager about the promotion or the sales I made.

And if you do get hired on make sure you get everything promised to you in writing with a signature from your manager."
bad,"Job is easy but the work environment is poor. Good entry level position but the environment became too toxic. Many people constantly complained about the changes happening in the workplace. There is high turnover for employees in this position. Employees there for a long time were never promoted from within."
bad,"Nice co-workers. Office is old with terrible light. Management is what have you done for me lately approach. It's all about the numbers. Company cars are awful and uncomfortable. Being employee owned there are quite a few perks as far as profit sharing and some other benefits. Things you don't see anywhere else. Nationwide Company, but doesn't act like it. Staff underpaid on average. Stress level can be very high in certain positions."
bad,"very demanding and challenging to meet sale revenue from management.  I am very busy at work with a lot of request for quotation on new projects and customers.  However, the result of RFQ didn't turn out into PO.  Therefore, they decided to eliminate my position."
bad,"The company does not allow warehouse personal to participate in the profit sharing,or stock options, even though, they do all the heavy lifting and work in the heat, or other inclement weather conditions. Alot of drug activity goes on with employees, in the office and warehouse, with easy ways to pass drug test these days, the company has no clue."
bad,Nice place to work.  Good working environment.  Working hours and location was good.  Left for more money.  Enjoyed working there.                                                                    .
bad,"Excessive micromanagement, low pay, generally unhappy place to work. Very unrewarding compared to similar types of operations."
bad,"worked in areas where an armed guard should have worked, it put my safety on the line. work schedual was not set , sometimes i wouls work at night then the next day i was working during the day, and the hours werent always the same."
bad,"El Paso Graybar, is all about production, management does not care about the needs of employees and they do not support Veterans."
bad,"Not as busy as I was told I would be during the interview. Most everyone outside of my department seems to be very nice, but there is not much interaction. Immediate coworkers are mostly very young, so there is still a lot to learn professionally and personally."
bad,"Graybar is currently in the process of outsourcing all of IT Infrastructure and Support. Once all IT functions are in the cloud, one can wonder what department is next to get outsourced."
bad,"Benefits are great. Profit sharing,stock in the company ,insurance,401k. Like most places some employees you get along well with other looking out for there own interest."
bad,"A seriously understaffed business. A typical day consists of showing up to work and running around trying to do the work of 3 people and constantly being behind. After five hours with no breaks you finally get to take your one hour unpaid lunch. You miss out on those lunches when the company has a supplier bbq. You are expected to work for 9 hours straight those days and also have to help set up the bbq because they are to cheap to hire outside for those days."
bad,"My typical day as an intern was spent sitting at my desk working on  my own laptop. The company did not provide me with one for 5 weeks, and i inherited a desk of an employee that left. "
bad,"I think the company has a long way to go to improve the work life in the office. There is a lot of gossip between supervisors regarding their supervisees. There is often an unprofessional and stressful work environment with no recognition of a good job, and no empathy for employees."
bad,"Graybar has a reputation that it is riding on from the past.  No longer is it a family oriented, loyal place to work.  It has become cut throat with little regard to its employees benefit.  Management is slow and the organizational structure is ineffective."
bad,"They hide 15-20% GPM on the actual sales orders meaning any discounts you give come off your sales goal. At the end of the year the corp.  receives a dividend check from the manufacturers leaving that rebate money to all of the upper management."
bad,"Graybar pays decent but they want you to work more than 40 hour weeks without paying overtime. They provide what they call ""comp"" time which is when you have accomulated a set amount of hours over your 40 hours they choose which day or half day they want you to take off those hours or days with straight pay even if it happens to be several weeks out. All in all it is a ok place to work if you are ok with ""your lucky to have a job with us"" attitude and are willing to play the game with the hours."
bad,All they cared was exceptions that were never going to Possible to meet
bad,"When I first started working for Graybar Electric in Hayward, CA I was extremely satisfied with the company, I found it exciting, stimulating and a very proactive company. Then I was transferred to Portland, OR and it was a whole new ballgame. The management were not helpful, I found them to be demeaning totally unfair in a lot of situations just simply unfulfilling and unsatisfactory. It is amazing how the same company can be so different by just a few hundred miles."
bad,"Only work here if you have no other choice."
bad,Business is very slow there. People do not like buying products there because they don't have what they want on hand. Communication with management is terrible.
bad,"Graybar bought out Splane Electric, once all contracts were completed the employees that worked for Splane were laid off to make room for Graybars own employees.."
bad,the management should really stick to what they say when they promise to teach the part time workers everything about the warehouse.
bad,Poor management only take care off the people they bring in they don't take care of the people who have been working there awhile. Paying guys more money to get them in the  door .
bad,"High turnover, not customer friendly. Don't listen to feedback from customer base. Learn step to other distributors. Lack of locations makes loss business along weak counters that do not have daily materials. Customers could go to Home Depot and Lowes, get better pricing and have inventory. Products were good but not costs. Training program was alright. Lose out on manufacturers and vendors sending employees for training. Base wages were weak . No fuel card. Many customers had incentive programs to buy from them. Can golf on company time."
bad,The work was very easy.  The managers were ok but only promoted there friend and not the person that works the best.  Very easy typical warehouse job.
bad,I would never recommend this company to anyone. Pay and benefits are poor. Raises were very rarely given. The employees were treated like animals. Management very rarely supported employees and blamed them for everything.  Terrible place to work.
bad,"Pick orders,safety,cut wire, inventory control,customer pick up,machine maintenance. I learned electrical stock, management could have been better. Co-workers not bad, the hardest part about the job getting a leader who would help with any problems. The most enjoyable part operating the machines."
good,I feel as Graybar does not have a good work- life balance.  I feel as if you have a family or have an actual life you cannot get anything done........
good,"I hired in at low pay to maintain a huge contract. I did so successfully, winning contract renewal after a year of working for very low wages. When the contract renewed I expected a pay raise. Nope. I made millions of dollars for the company only to be paid barely better than minimum wage. I left to go to a big box retailer who paid nearly twice as much for starting wages with fewer hours and no Suit."
good,Worked for graybar for 19 years. Closed my location and I was a great employee. Management did not even offer to locate myself to another location.
good,ok for someone who has been in the Graybar system and worked their way into sales.  Very slow paced environment.
good,This is a good company when you're first starting in the work world. Graybar has old values pertaining to the employees. Most of the employees have been there for over 20 years
good,Cool place to work if you like to work alot of overtime with bad bosses. The people that work there are cool untill they throw you under the bus for a mistake they made
good,"This is  fast pace work.  Good work life balance.. "
good,"Great Company. Was recruited by an inspirational , entrapenuar who later was promoted and moved to a different state .  Because Managers have the atonomy to run the branches as they see fit , there is not a cohesive business philosophy that is consistent throughout the organization . "
good,They tell you that you will have three years to develop a territory.  Then one year into the development of said territory you will get an ultimatum make your quota or be fired.
good,"When I started there was promotion from within, stock options, and a pension. Most all of this went away and they started hiring from outside the company which left no room for advancement and a low salary with no future."
good,"Average company to work for   Benefits good 401k, pension stock options  opportunity for advancement based on performance. Lots of variety of positions. Can learn as go"
good,hard workers and team players free lunches dealing with management bipolar best part of my job is lunch when I get to relax...constantly pulling material
good,"This is a large company with various locations all over the world.  The internal communications between management and workers is horrendous.  The work load is unbalance between associates forcing other employees to take extra work load.  Although company provides for transfers to other locations, there was no communication provided when requesting to transfer.  Personal experience rates this company very poor."
good,"I worked as a commercial fisherman for various companies in my twenties. If you are young and strong and don't mind being away from your family for months at a time, this is the job for you. It pays very well after you have a few years under your belt or if you get on the right boat."
good,We come in at 11am and we don't clock out until all orders have been selected. The hardest part of the job are the hours and not being able to see my kids throughout the work week.
good,Very busy warehouse with limited amount of room for all the supplies fast pace environment but growing business for stable work opportunities.
good,"Managed employees,  filled in when employees were out, management above me were lacking in personnel skills.  Huge turnover in the state of North Dakota due to upper management.  I loved my job as a manager.  I was not given the tools needed to accomplish what was needed for the branch.  Even with limited capabilities I was making 1.5 million a month for the branch and the company overall.  Hardest part was limited staff and capable staff."
good,"At the warehouse I worked at, there was 3 people and I came along.  I received orders, stocked away product, picked orders, will called items, worked the telephone for customer purchases and other communication reasons.  My time there I did really enjoy it."
good,"I had worked in the electrical field as an Administrative Asst. prior to this job, and with the position of inside sales/CSR gave me much experience in the electrical field.  I learned a lot by working with customers taking orders, researching and assisting with electrical information also took many classes online with Square D electrical product, which I was very successful in scoring high on those tests.  Unfortunately, I was laid off along with over 30 people from every area in the company in 2008."
good,The job was a little extreme but it was a normal office job. The people were great but i think that the work load was a little excessive and the evaluations were flawed. I do know that since i left the company has improved on both of those complaints.
good,"Enjoyed b2b sales -traveling-competition-goals"
good,New manager came in 2016. No support for warehouse operations. Immature manager that spent more time watching Andy Griffin episodes with sales counter employer than he did managing office workers and dealing with internal employee issues and poor performers.
good,"- Good place  to start your career if you do not have a degree"
good,"When asked if I could mover around to learn new stations was basically told no, but was constantly asked to step up to the plate in other stations. poor supervisor, warehouse personnel treated poorly."
good,"if you want to work for a company that is outdated in many ways, over priced compared to other companies and pays its employees less then fair wage. then sure its great. but otherwise go to there competitors for better wages."
good,A typical day at work was sitting in front of a computer all day. I didn't learn much. Management only treated the people they liked right. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at the end of the day.
good,"No room for me in this role. The previous candidate in this position moved into management but still runs all the accounts in the outside role and leaves no room for a new candidate to assume the responsibility of the role and develop a relationship with key stakeholders. At some point, this is a necessary move to accommodate the success of either candidate in their new roles."
good,"Great National company with good vision and planning.   Local Branch office very dis-functional and individual oriented.   Company sets plans and procedures, but frequently changes direction, losing some employees in the process."
good,overall just an ok experience working as a sales representative at the New Castle DE location. Poor management was in place when I started and it caused a lot of unneeded stress for everyone.
good,The job itself is pretty easy.  You have be willing to motivate yourself and be willing to go the extra mile without much help.  Management needs training on how to be management.  Lots of closed door meetings to discuss location needs but nothing is ever told to all other employees making us feel unimportant.
good,Very supportive to the employees especially in the event of a death in the family. They transferred me to be near enough to my mother to spend time with her before her passing
good,"I always felted like everyone was waiting for you to say the wrong thing are make a mistake. No one was willing to do anything outside of their job description. Was not a very friendly work environment, to many little groups that was on their own."
good,"Not a place I would recommend, however it often requires overtime so the pay is better. The hours are long and the work can be stressful, but he staff is pretty fair."
good,went to work  for gb in Va. which was slow paced and fun to go to work had a good manger. Moved to Fl. and transferred job changed  and not for the good. Had to drive an hour to work worked my eight hour shift and had to stay and finish packing orders would work up to four hours after shift work and drive became to much on family. ha dto quite and find something closer to home
good,"Pros: "
good,"Very old school culture. "
good,Graybar was a good place to work. Competitive wage and vacation packages. Dealing with contractors was challenging. You could make a career in a company like Graybar.
good,A lot of good people there. Seemed to be a lot of manpower in Sales & Purchasing.
good,First Job out of college. Worked until I found something better suited for me
good,"Busy, focused"
good,"Daily Routine:"
good,"Graybar is not a bad place to work, however the management makes it hard."
good,"taught me many things in warehousing atmospheres. shipping process, picking, loading and unloading procedure."
good,"delivery of electrical parts to customers. traveling back and forth to Waynesboro, VA daily."
good,"Managers need to be better at managing.  We were always talked to about boosting morale and bugeting, but yet when the numbers were not there, managers always had money to take ""customers "" on a long weekend to the northwoods. Most of the ""customers"" were close friends if not family members going on these trips."
good,Great company to work for if you don't mind the lack of supervision or direction. No clear direction as to job title and continues back-biting is a constant.
good,"Decent work environment where was able to further my knowledge in various automation and scripting technologies, along with firewall and email security technologies."
good,The direction of company is hazy at best. Graybar continues to be overly conservative in its culture and lacks upper management accountability.  It's inability to maintain younger talent may be its demise.
good,Typical day is responding to emails and phone calls regarding orders.  Creating quotes and ensuring we meet the needs of the customer in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job was training being limited to side by sides. What I enjoyed most were the co-workers and weekends off.
good,No comment not good environment not  good place of employment no stock had to wait for  stock to get from another location that wait  was one or more days
good,the workers in the warehouse have been reduced and its difficult to get everything done even though monthly the company tells us we are not meeting their goals for sales
good,"Extremely long days as i would work 84 hours a week for up to 4 months at a time. good pay, but not very much time off. they would pay per diem and and lunch once a month"
good,The pay for anyone less than management is well below the industry average.  You can easily see that just by clicking on the insights button.  The managers are mostly unwilling to own up to their own mistakes and the company will not get out of its own way and let itself succeed.   If they would act like they realize that the people at the bottom are just as important as the people at the top it would be the perfect place for a career.  In the end they are not really worth working for unless you can get into mid-level management.
good,"Overall, this is a decent company to work for to get started in the working world. Salary is low along with the compensation plan. There is little chance of advancement and high rate of turnover due to people leaving. Management can definitely be stronger overall in getting people to want to stay instead of leave the company."
good,"was introduced to the electrical industry and project coordination role"
good,Great first job out of college. Pay is a little weak but the benefits out weigh any other companies. Company needs to get with the times. Programs are outdated and need updating.
good,"The day starts and ends with non stop fast paced work, which I don't mind, but it was unorganized. It is always unknown of what is coming or going from the warehouse operations. I enjoy some of the people I work with. Some of them, we are able to work well together to get the job(s) done. I like the fact that no 2 days are the same."
good,"Enjoy working with the customers and reps.  Enjoy working with a few of the employees here."
good,"Small office setting, open office space.  Departments are not grouped for optimal efficiency.  Departments do not work together effectively.  Communication between departments is inefficient."
good,Good company to work for if you dont mind making a small salary and working until retirement. Very Old fashion way of running a company. Should reconsider management.
good,Good benefit package and competitive wages.  Extremely clique-ish fueled by the monolithic egos of several arrogant and disappointingly unprofessional managers.  Tense environment.
good,"Extremely driven atmosphere to increase sales."
good,"This company was once run as a thoughtful, trying to be forward thinking organization.  Now it (GBE) simply responds to various metrics delivered by a old form of SAP that is cumbersome and hard to use.  Sales and Sales Management have been discarded for reports and reactive activities around delivery metrics and operational activities."
good,"Excellent company for top line benefits. There was always an opportunity to learn with their multiple on-line class offerings to help grow the employee's intellectual grasp on the business. Fellow employees were business smart and good at their assigned tasks, but short staffing diminished ones ability to be through."
good,Worked there for nearly 17 years. Laid off when less skilled and employees with less senority were kept on.
good,This is a great place to work with ever-changing customers and develop new accounts while helping build your bottom line.  Sales reps are always challenged and pushed to perform while the culture is focused on long-term growth and sustainability.  Profit sharing and employee benefits are good here.
good,"I do not have a real reason to fill this out. I feel the company overall is a great place to work not the right culture for me, but overall an awesome company."
good,"Good business to work for, just moved this positions to Indianapolis and did not like the new position.  Plus filled in at other positions as needed, not that many employees."
good,Its an fast paced job that takes up most of your day with the hours. It can be stressful and leave you feeling overworked and under credited but it has very good benefits and a nice retirement plan
good,"Good place to work. There is autonomy to plan your day and you have weekends off and it is employee owned "
good,Graybar Electric is really a great company to work for provided that you are fortunate enough to have the right local management in place.  That was no longer the case when I left and I am told that it continues to not be the case.
good,We start out the day with a shift meeting. During the meeting the managers will give us a review of the day before. Any mistakes made the previous day is talked about and how to correct it. Any safety hazards or concerns you may have are shared. Then the managers or leads will give a preview of what the work day will be like. After the morning meeting I would print out my Job sheet for the next few hours. Get all accessories i will need for the job at hand. Get the necessary equipment needed to get the job done.  And get Started.
good,"A good company to work for at a lower level position but as you work your way up the corporate structure makes things quite a bit more difficult, although structure is needed they need to understand branch needs more."
good,"Starting my career, Graybar gave me the opportunity to build on my financial knowledge and introduce me to the business world out of college. I would recommend this company."
good,There are a lot of people that work at Graybar that do very little work and management makes takes no action to discipline employees that steal company time
good,"- Good place to start your career if you do not have a degree"
good,Position requires you to play many roles with little to no assistance. Also the pay does not equal the amount of work the require from you. Not much room for growth.
good,"according to state and federal regulations Graybar complied. "
good,Corporate culture differs depending on which location you are at. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customer and learning as you go.
good,great people working there   great working conditions hours are ok benefits are awesome managment is ok great people to be around and to work with  great times
good,"Pay seemed competitive, great benefits, room for advancement, plenty of staff to make sure you get the time off that is needed.  Limited support for training."
good,"Graybar is a national electrical distributor headquartered in St Louis."
good,"Graybar is a stable company and are well known in their Market.  They have a great benefit package."
good,Was a nice transition to continue sales a reputable electrical distribution company.  I enjoyed seeing a large company like that operate on such a big scale.
good,It's challenging. Although they sell themselves as an employee owner company. They at times don't live by what they say.
good,Learned how to meet daily monthly goals problem solving and act decisively in a fast paced while maintaning a team player.
good,It was an ok place to work. You are just a number. They only careed about the company and not you. the management didn't have any people skills.
good,Great benefits. Called on end users and contractors to attempt to generate sales
good,"If you work hard you can advance within the company,  however account base needed to grow extremely fast to keep up with zone warehousing concepts."
good,"good training clean,nice workplace.Good benefits and stock options"
good,"Worked in purchasing, rules are extremely strict and the atmosphere is uncomfortably open. Micromanagement is the most prevalent trait, but management is extremely competent. If you can get past that, the company offers a decent benefits package. The pay is low for this type of work, but profit sharing helps. Most everyone says that the grass is greener outside the department, so I would keep an open mind."
good,Inside team drives success with a great technical knowledge in product and systems. Bringing in younger bodies is challenging because many people have their knowledge from years of experience and that is not transferrable without sharing that ex[erience.
good,High turnover due to pay and no growth opportunities unless you move cities. Due to high turnover everyone else is forced to do more for little in return. Employee ownership but corporate America values.
good,"It's a union shop, that being said it's trash, the company still does what they want push people around, all the material handlers talk about eachother and then act like a friend to your face, there is no union brotherhood between them, manager in the back can't do his job or pawns it off, they do work with your time off, room to grow if you want it, late tickets, poorly trained, it would be great place to work if people just do there job, and just get alone,"
good,It's a great place to work if you are looking to venture into Comm. data and electrical sales field. They promote life-work balance policy. Moved to a new location and going through a transition at the moment.
good,"Being the middle guy is tough. You sell it and other red tape within the company makes it hard to keep people happy. "
good,"Electrical distribution is a very stable industry. That brings job security. Your salary is not very high, benefits and health insurance are top-notch."
good,"Graybar is a good company, with a great work environment. Unless you are top 10% in sales, you have no chance of a career. The larger the market you live in, the better chance you have of making a career with Graybar."
good,"Good Benefits"
good,Slow paced and blue collar all the way.   Early hours and unfriendly co-workers.  Not a job for and energetic individual.  Looking to get up and do something I love.
good,"Good company with good benefits. however, The longer you work there the worse they treat you.  New people are treated better than the employees with dedicated service"
good,"great benefit package, could not ask for a better one. A very young boss who did not know how to be a manger or talk to people. Treated you like your expendable.  The original boss was a excellent guy, loved working for him. Loved the job and work environment."
good,Good benefits but pay is lacking. Opportunities to advance in the company exist if you know the right person and your willing to relocate. Hard work doesn't get you very far here.
good,"Graybar is a strong company, but it is a very rigid structure in your day. As an inside sales rep, you are locked into a desk for 8 full hours, expected to make unrealistic sales budgets while not getting properly compensated on your commissions."
good,"Not much variety, little help."
good,"ok place to work if you want to work like a mule, management was up an down everyday, they never cared about your family life....everything has to do with graybar its there way or the highway"
good,"it's a great job to start off with if you are looking to move up, 401k, employee stock ownership, advancement opportunities. typical day as material handler you come in and get on a machine to stock or pull material off shelves, at the end of the night help wrap things up. The other employees / Management team are pretty easy to work with. hardest part is having to stand on a machine all day. The most enjoyable is that it can be a fun job, it is what you make of it and as long as you are good at what you do and have fun while being safe, your time there will be an enjoyable experience"
good,"Graybar Electric is a good company overall.  They strive to be progressive.  However, there is plenty of old-guard sprinkled throughout the company to thwart real change.  You can always tell when a high-placed manager reads a new business book and uses the company as a controlled experiment.  "
good,Manage job accounts for medium to large electrical contractors. In charge of 2 and a half branches in regards to all aspects of credit extension.
good,"Graybar was a great company to work for, They are the ones who brought me into the Electrical Industry and gave me the work experience to be where I am at today. Their hours are not very flexible, but the company itself is very stable."
good,"I really enjoyed learning about the electrical side of this business. It is very challenging because you don’t just focus on one area of specialty . So it can be very overwhelming at times . Out of date work environment. The energy is like a morgue. People have been here for so long and super miserable.  Graybar is awesome if you can get promoted or been there when they had pensions. If you get stuck in one position, you’ll be very poor. The pay is really terrible and the commission structure is bogus. Sales reps never get raises. They will tell you to sell more. It’s a great place to get into this business and then go somewhere else."
good,"I loved working at Graybar and wished I still do.  Layoffs how do they pick and choose.  Loved my MSC and Senior Branch Asst  but not Branch MGR.  I think outside sales people were failing but the inside sales did most off the work and they and I were let go. I have heard from customers who say they can't get to anyone, they have to call reps and just get a voicemail."
good,"Good place to build a career if you're willing to stick it out 30 years.. stock options and good health benefits keeps people around. Environment lacks culture and competitiveness, especially for being a sales organization. Day to day processes are not clear which makes it tough on new hires. Some managers are good, others are not, depends on the vertical."
good,"Warehouse manager would pick and choose who he would give work too. Assistant manager would destroy work place if it was not clean. No teamwork, poor management in general."
good,okay place to work. Seems at time to be like high school. Mgrs do play favorites. Benefits are good along with profit sharing
good,"Management needs new structure. Each branch is manageged differently, the branch I worked at needed a new outlook."
good,"A typical day for me would start out with depositing checks from our Will Call counter, answering  and screening about 200 incoming phone calls per day and routing them to appropriate individuals, greeting visitors, calling customers to obtain an updated tax exemption certificate to keep on file, maintained front desk procedures, kept track of the conference room meetings, made copies, faxes and distributed mail to office personnel."
good,Management provided a very successful training program that resulted in advancement. Opportunity to travel and meeting new people was a memorable experience.
good,"I worked with a great sales man, and helped him grow his client bases."
good,"moving people to the work, doing employee reviews, inventory control.hardest part of my job is balancing the work flow and dealing with stringent deadlines and pull times. At a point where im ready to move on to bigger and better things. ive learned valuable leadership and problem solving skills"
good,Graybar was a wonderful place to work for. I learned so many different techniques in computer applications that helped me advance in my career. My supervisor's managing techniques and my entire team alone kept me moving forward on continuous education-helping me to establish self-improvement on many business computer applications.-
good,"responsible for all invoicing on large projects, entering large orders and tracking shipments of materials. "
good,"I loved working at Graybar electric in Columbus Ohio.  My biggest issue was not the job or my co-workers.  It was the branch manager.  He was extremely under qualified, and was only given the position because he was friends with the district manager.  The branch manager has extremely unrealistic expectations and is constantly threatening the jobs of everyone that works under him.   "
good,"Graybar has good benefits. After a year and half one can transfer from one Graybar to another. When doing this make sure you have it in writing from the next place. If not, you may find yourself on indeed.com looking for a job instead of retiring."
good,Graybar is a great organization that moves material nationwide in order to meet customer requirements.  It is fast paced and often has critical impact.
good,I really admire many of Graybar's policies and principles however I was not content to do less than I was capable of doing. Advancement was available but in areas I was never interested in going.
good,Is a very good company to work for since it is owned by it's employee also they offer profit sharing among other great benefits and there is a lot of room to grow in the company work is hard but it pays off the company always strives to keep a safety environment to work the only thing is when it gets busy must expect to stay over time without hesitation otherwise expect rejection from co workers.
good,"I did enjoy working for Graybar, the job was quite physical, but that did not surprise me, I just wish they compensated their employees better. The working environment was a positive one."
good,Why I just want a job I dint want to tall about my old company can't wet just do this so that a guy can look for a job without being asked questions.....
good,"I would come in the morning to help with the UPS and Fedex delivery, once that was done I had to pick orders, shipping and receiving. As need I would drive small box trucks and vans to make deliveries to customers. Count inventory and expect products."
good,"Graybar is a good company to work for, as long as you're not in IT. The company is full of employees ten, twenty and thirty years of tenure at Graybar. The stability is good, of course, but it leads to a great deal of complacency with the current state of things."
good,I loved working for Graybar. I feel that the problem was is that I wasn't all that good at selling. The Graybar knows how to treat their people and have fun while working..
good,My co-workers are phenomenal. I truly enjoy consulting and asking/answering questions whenever needed.
good,"Generally, a very good place to work.  However, an employee's role, department and manager can have a significant impact upon on overall job satisfaction."
good,Good place to work.Advancement seemed to go to those related to other employees.
good,"Good place to work. Depending on location, management can be reliable, in certain cases when new management is brought in they go a little crazy with their new found ""power"" and responsibilities."
good,"A good growing company. Nationwide, lots of opportunities to move in certain fields. Promotion from within, been around a very long time. Not the highest paid, but the benefits are good and stock ownership is a strong aspect of working for Graybar."
good,Gray bar was a good place to work. Advancement was based on who you know not what you know. Being a good employee was not a part of advancement decisions.
good,"Managed multiple lighting projects."
good,This company is interesting in that it is owned and managed by its employees. A unique situation and one where the benefits to employees are obvious and manifest in operations and morale.
good,"Everyone is friendly and all seem to work well together.  Many activities to bring employees together, outside of work hours, as well as during the work day. "
good,Graybar is a awesome place to work. The benefits are fantastic. However they use those benefits as a reason to pay a lower wage. They are definitely way under the median average on pay for every position across the board except well you guessed it the top positions. They also don't like to invest in materials and equipment to help with daily operations nor there employees. Overall it is a good company to work for just don't expect to make a dignified wage.
good,"Terrible culture, great benefits with stock options and profit sharing. There is a lot of talk about change, but nothing actually changes. It's like stepping into a time capsule from the late 80's."
good,Good place for new people to learn the industry.  Compensation is below industry average unless you are in sales.  Advancement opportunities are not very good unless you are willing to relocate.
good,laid back yet fast paced environment. No complaints however I left for a better opportunity in an industry that I felt was best for me. Typical warehouse environment and operations.
good,Amazing employee owned company.  On the Forbes 500 list and also listed as one of the best companies to work for.  They really take care of their employees and promote from within.
good,This is a fast paced job that is very time mannered and detailed.  Seniority has its advantages here.  They offer training on the job for specific areas and you are able to advance within the company.
good,"load and unload trucks, fork lift driver, and put away stock. Could be freezing in the winter do to working outside in the early morning, but once past that mind set great learning experience."
good,Learning the company's operational functions and observing how each department collaboratively keeps the business afloat and proficient.
good,nice place to work . I learned a lot. It's hard to advanced because turnover is so low.Management can be helpful sometimes.
good,Good company with great benefits. I dont want to tell you anything else about this job. I am here to apply for jobs not rate previous companies I worked for!!
good,"Graybar was a nice place to work.  I had a lot of responsibilities."
good,"That warehouse was a local warehouse that operated as a regional hub for over a year.  It was stocked to about 150% of the expected capacity.  Everyone worked hard, and made sure that the customers were always taken care of."
good,"At Graybar, I was given the opportunity to learn SAP in a fast paced setting.  I also handled inbound/outbound customer telephone calls and emails in a timely and efficient manner.  I sourced materials and requested quotes from vendors via email, websites, and by phone, and expedited orders. I also provided quotes; checked inventory for availability of material; created sales and purchase orders; processed returns; made billing adjustments/credits; tracked orders from entry through delivery to customer all on SAP.  I acted as liaison between the customers and Graybar/Graybar vendors, and provided PODs (proof of deliveries) and invoices as necessary to meet customer requirements.  As a side project, I was asked to set up filing for CSR’s and provided filing support for export department."
good,Really was a good school to learn how easy could be learn new rolls in work.
good,"The work hours were very unforgiving,  however the pay rate seemed to make it with it, i personally had a hard time managing a social life as well as maintain my position there"
good,the branch sales were down and so the branch manager decided to consolidate jobs and reduce associates to save operating costs and i was one of those cut
good,Was on a construction site for the duration of my employment. Took orders and delivered necessary materials to different super intendants throughout the project.
good,"As sales rep in commercial space my role has been exciting in the beginning of my tenure with GB,  but management changed its direction with the Program I was hired to do. this made it difficult to cover an emerging market with old way of doing things."
good,A good work environment and starting place for warehouse work. Good group of people to work with and good benefits. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Graybar is a great employee owned company that does great with a younger employee that can grow into management roles if they want"
good,Some good and bad but mostly good. They take care of their employees and look out for your improvement. They are very competitive in the distribution side of the market.
good,"Great company to work for. However, there is a lot of politics going on. "
good,"Typical day at work consists of calling out to customers and trying to win their business. Handling and maturing accounts that buy regularly from us. Talk to vendors and negotiate pricing deals for future business. Speak to manager and presidents of companies daily and set up job accounts for large projects. Hardest part is actually the main focus of the job and that's selling, as much as we try to reach out and meet customers. Put vendors in front of their faces, it doesn't change the fact that if your customer is smaller, the bigger guys are going to buy them out. We have set accounts and a lot of the time they are either smaller businesses or contractors working on smaller jobs. I enjoy the atmosphere and the friendliness of the other employees and management. Health benefits are well and the compensation is quite is low for the work we do."
good,I'm a hard-working person I try to do the best I can to deal with other people I respect people and I do whatever it took to get the job done I love my work I just need a better job
good,"Fast pace every day and made the day go fast."
good,"fast paced environment, team oriented, very safety organize. and lots of benefits etc. managers were involved with day day operations and also worked with employees."
good,"hardest part is being stuck in traffic"
good,"Graybar is a great company.  Their quality and service to the customer was excellent.  Local management lacked appreciation for the efforts of their employees."
good,"Always busy, there is no time to stand around. Learned how a warehouse operates and how to make it more efficient. Management were a little bipolar and thee co-workers were great. Dealing with management was difficult but in the end it wasn't too bad."
good,"Demanding job depending on your position/dept. I learned to work in a very demanding, challenging, ever changing climate. Tight deadlines, demanding customers and challenging circumstances, ie: deliveries guidelines for NYC, unsupportive vendors/alliances."

good,Besides the management and hours Graybar was a great company. I got to learn a lot while I was there and I met a lot of cool people. The work was easy and quick to learn
good,"Nice, steady employment opportunity offering advancement into inside sales and management. There was lots of opportunity for overtime, as well as family day gathering on weekends."
good,I started as a delivery driver . Loaded and delivered the products to the customers. Then i was moved to an inside counter sales representative. built a good report with the customers.
good,OK culture and steady most of the time but time very unorganized with no defined expectation from leadership and no succession.  Was chastised for applying for an advance position without notifying my branch manager.
good,"lack of advancement broken promises, people are friendly, work 8hr days, lots of self learning, lunch and learn about new product,"
good,"First warehouse job so my review might not be the most relevant.  However, after speaking with many of my coworkers throughout my time at Graybar who have had other warehouse positions/experiences, most of them told me that this is a better place to work compared to previous jobs.  Graybar at Charlotte is a relatively small warehouse compared to major companies such as UPS or Walmart.  It is fast-paced and you have to be hardworking and efficient or you will be let go."
good,"cutting wire. it wasnt a very hard job but it was based on production."
good,"First thing I do in the morning is check the batteries for the fork lifts, I do the maintenance on the batteries also. I start unloading trucks, then we start braking down product to receive and to put inventory away. I have to get the priorities done first and then move to normal stock. I get along well with management and co-workers. I think the hardest part of my job is the braking down of product, some of those reels of wire weigh over 100 pounds. In order to be hired at Graybar you have to be able to lift 70 lbs. I do feel good about the accomplishment of getting every thing done on time."
good,"Good company. Great benefits. The work is difficult sometimes, but my coworkers and boss are wonderful. The salary is average."

good,"Graybar is a great company to work for! Great benefits like profit share, stock purchase. Great work home balance. Work hour 8 to 5 with a  hour lunch."
good,Productive and fun work place. Getting work done at required time frame. Employee shows and shares good relationship with each other. Secured environment to work at.
good,Was responsible for all/any deep technical knowledge about various partners products to be sold. Was told in beginning would primarily perform technical only. Was developing more into having to know great deal of sales systems routines that salesmen should have primarily been doing.
good,Graybar was a great company to work for. It was a fast-paced environment where employees where tasked to work together and combine ideas as a team to achieve productivity and great sales. Graybar had great benefits and made their employees feel valued and appreciated.

good,"Graybar is a great company for the fast paced, highly motivated, self starter. Great compensation for the highly productive individual with great training curriculum setting you up to succeed. Direct access to management allows intelligent risk taking that can be lucrative and rewarding."
good,"Managers found the Michigan market difficult to manage.   The automotive market drove down gross margins pitting similar companies against one another.   On an average a manager would leave or be replaced in 18 months.  Graybar has great benefits and is employee owned.   Stocks, profit sharing and a pension."
good,Graybar is a good  company to work for. However management seems a little behind the times. It is fast paced and time sensitive with deadlines and accuracy a must.
good,"I started in 2007, enjoyed working there despite the 1 hour travel time. I was hoping to retire from Graybar, but due to a lack of sales in our branch, cuts needed to be made, and I was one of 2 employees released from the branch."
good,"Management fun and relaxed for the most part. GRAYBAR build right after oil boom though the business was not built to concentrate on oil products that was the main client base when I worked there. Business was slow."
good,"I would come in at 7 start loading my truck oversee what material was for my route look up sales order related information on our SAP system whether looking up material or contact information for whom the material belonged to, upon completion of my deliveries for the day would come back select out material, that has been ordered confirm material was correct At times would assist at our counter for either will calls or walk-in customers that would order material, at the end of our work shift ensure that all locations within the warehouse and our yard was secure and locked"
good,Regular office environment with typical office duties. Employees are nice and the work environment in not stressful. Employed own which is nice and makes you much more vested.
good,good job good pay for area. good benefits with profit sharing take 1 year to get invested with the company. benefits are very good and competitive salary for the area I lived in.

good,"Typical work days were very busy. If we didn't work together as a team it was nearly impossible to complete the daily tasks."
good,"A typical day for selecting was to select 40 or above lines a hour, receiving was 200 to 900 line of product a day. What I have learned here was how to drive a bendi machine a forklift for narrow isles that bends to allow product to be put into or taken out of locations all other aspects of the job I had done before. The management team was great they would help in any way they could to help get the job done this included them doing the same things I had to do they would answer all questions you may have and guide you in the right direction for you to accomplish your goals. Co-workers with all help each other team work was great here. The hardest part of the job was  to do mandatory overtime after a ten hour day but we did it for the customers satisfaction. The best part of the job was the people and the fast pace you where always busy and the days would go by fast."
good,"A company to retire at, not fast moving or for millennials"
good,Happy to be a Driver that delivers electrical supplies to Graybar customers( mostly electrical contractors) throughout the tri- state. Steady work.
good,"A typical day at work is overwhelming because we are working more than one person's positions.  It's like a smorgasbord of jobs and only be able to do them decently b/c everything needs to be done yesterday."
good,"This is s great company. It's very family oriented and the people are wonderful. It's a typical 8-5 workday, the environment can be very stressful at times and you really need a thick skin to work in this industry. The teamwork and core values are second to none."
good,"As an outside sales rep my day started at 8am calling on customers to ensure their needs were met for the day.  Then I would proceed to the office to take care of any work that I was responsible for, Quotes or special project I was working on with the customer. I would make my calls to the suppliers to negotiate any special pricing I would need to be competitive in the market. "
good,"12 hour day, very busy. I was the Outbound Manager for 10 Years, A good day was getting all order shipped out the door everyday."

good,A really good company with excellent salary and benefits. Plenty of opportunity for growth and advancement as long as you are willing to put forth the effort.
good,I enjoyed my tenure at Graybar.  The health and profit sharing benefits were great.  They have since changed the profit sharing to a 401k plan for new hires.  I worked with an outstanding team of colleagues supporting the sales effort.
good,Graybar thought me about hardwork from the ages of 24- 26. This experience thought me how to meet your deadlines on time and how to handle different occurences thrown at you daily.
good,This is a sales organization that gives you all the tools to succeed.  Management is always helpful and the office is a huge source of knowledge for an industry that has been around forever.
good,"Still a great place to work, but losing the employee owned culture. Upper management has lost touch with the electrical portion of the business and has structured everything around the communications world. "
good,"One of the best companies I ever worked for.  Great people, great managers, great job(s) and AWESOME training program for employees.  Unfortunately, they had layoffs and that was it for my job."
good,"A lot of work needed to be done which made the days and week go by fairly quickly which was a plus, because I like being busy instead of sitting around.with"
good,As an employee owned company we had a great stock plan and profit sharing. Also many employees hired prior to 2015 including myself were grandfathered into a great pension plan.
good,"I enjoyed working at graybar, it was just bad managing. My supervisor would throw paperclips and scream and yell, he didn't reflect on the company well, other than that I learned well there."
good,The company has some of the best benefits out there.  If you are in it for the long haul you can have a nice nest egg at retirement and make some money along the way.
good,had a great manager there.  the culture from all of Graybar's employees are good. good stable company.  lots of inventory to choose from for your clients
good,Well established company with great benefits. Learned a lot about telecommunication industry. Poor HR department. I worked in several departments over the years. Workers are dedicated and turn over is extremely low.
good,"Enjoyable workplace, good hours and decent compensation. However management lacked guidance severely and our location suffered because of it."
good,"The Branch Administrator was responsible for solving all problems and errors for the customers, manufacturers, co-workers, freight companies, other branches.  The company uses the SAP computer system, which is not user-friendly but hosts to approximately 300 branches around the country and enables all branches to work together."
good,Main function of position was to build comm/data sales through an assigned territory. Average day was heavy phone calls both in office and on cell phone. More time was always needed to spend with customers out in the field on job walks or site visits. I learned a great deal about relying on others to help close sales from beginning to end. Truly enjoyed working a project for a specified amount of time and closing the deal. Was frustrated when parts of the in-house team broke down and caused loss of sales.
good,Graybar is a great place to work. Every branch has a different culture to it. I have worked at two different locations and it can be like night and day. Some are great and the co-workers feel more like friends while others no one talks and everyone keeps their heards down.
good,Manage lighting projects & have learned how each customer operates differently. Manangement is very helpful when needed & I enjoy working with my co-workers & customers. Hardest part of my job would be not having all the information up front when job is released. Most enjoyable part of my job is good relationship with everyone!

good,"Good company to work"

good,"very people oriented, fast paced office always busy and learning new things, there was nothing hard about the job, enjoyed going to work everyday was always busy and willing to assist with other projects of the job"
good,Graybar offers a fair opportunity for advancement and financial security.  Graybar has both advantages and disadvantages when competing against its competitors.  The individual sales support persons and local team are key as to whether Graybar is a desirable choice for a contractors business or not.

I have held different position in my ten years tenure at Graybar. I have learn to work with different employees and having to work in a fast pace environment.

good,respectful co-workers i enjoyed working with the staff and mangers it was a comfortable setting there really wasn't rarely hard days at work it went by pretty fast
good,Graybar is an excellent company with a solid management team in most areas.  The utility vertical did not have competitive cost that would allow for competition and development.  Business development planning and execution was very poor in utility vertical

good,"I would arrive, sit at my desk, then proceed with my day. I would answer phone calls, transfer phone calls, file transactions, photocopy transactions, and run shipment information between the warehouse and the manager. My managers were lovely people and extremely flexible. My co-workers were a lot older than me but treated my professionally and no different than anyone else in the company. The hardest part of the job was being everywhere at once; answering the phones, making copies, filing, and handling ship information all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was being in a professional environment, it was good preparation for my future."

good,"Great job in a fun environment. Very fast paced fitness club in a corporate location. Very much enjoyed the flexibility of being in charge of scheduling clients. The more challenging part of the job is the mandatory floor shifts. Generally, the hardest part is being at the mercy of a clients schedule. Some days your first seesion could be at 5:30AM and the last one could be at 9:00PM. Client cancellations are frequent and a nature of the business."
good,"Graybar is the strongest electrical supply house in the United States and Canada. It is Employee owned with stocks that are sold to employees based on job and pay levels. The profit sharing program puts Graybar above and beyond most company compensation, and there is a pension plan as well. These are all part of what makes Graybar a great company. Their testing policy assures that Graybar hires quality employees.They are organized in all processes making the work challanging until the employee gets acclamated however it makes the company uniform in all nearly 300 locations."
good,"On average everyone seems content and satisfied at graybar. My only complaint is that you rarely sit down. Your literally on your feet from the time you clock in to the time you clock out, unless your a driver. We have a lot of customers on a daily basis and it’s a very fast paced place. Everyone in general gets along and are friendly and welcoming to new staff. There is always some kind of cookout or food to be had."
good,"This a wonderful ""employee owned"" company to work for. Everyone got along wonderfully. It was truly a team effort. It is a little difficult to be competitive in a Corporate structure in today's market."

good,"People are great that work there, customers are great too.  Deadlines and broken parts can cause a real hassle and stress you out.  Modern society needs electricity, graybar is one of the places they go when they need to replace parts for broken electrical parts, or networking materials.  When the systems are down, their customers aren't making money...makes for a very stressful situation as the worker there is responsible for graybar's customer, and anyone that messes up that order can cause severe backlash.  Attention to detail is a must, and you have to be willing to go that extra step for the emergency customer at any moment.  The people make it rewarding as long as you do your best to make those customers happy."
good,Great school to learn and move  on to bigger challenges in the electrical field unless you want to make your carrier on sales.
good,the people at the office and warehouse I worked at was full of great people who had a lot of knowledge and were very helpful. I learned about a lot of electrical material as well as logistics.
good,I learned a lot from the management team on how a big Electrical Distrubitor functioned.  The company tried hard to help you to achieve your goals and gave you the tools to get them accomplished.
good,"Graybar electric is a great place to work."
good,"Graybar was one of the best companies I had a chance to work for. I only lost my job there because of the stock market crash and the major crashes in the economy. If things had picked back up there, I could have had my job back and I would have taken it. Most of the people there were great to work with; especially my co-workers in the warehouse."
good,Graybar is a great company to work for I would like to work back aat graybar I enjoyed working there everybody was good to me
good,"Unfortunatly I was laid-off by Graybar Electric,but I would go back in an instant if asked."
good,"They have long time employees 30+ yr type that proves their employee owned business is a great place to work and invest your future in.  They give many opportunities to advance - even have a women's group to help each other.  I moved and the commute is just becoming too much on a daily basis... otherwise, it would be a great job to grow in."
good,Great employee owned company to work for.  They care about the employees and have a benefit package that can compete with anyone.  Every day provides new challenges and opportunities to shine.
good,Graybar corporate is out of touch with the current competitive sales culture. Training for sales people is minimal and they set their people up for failure.
good,"My time may have been short at GrayBar, but I learned a great deal about the industry. The environment was something I had never known from other companies I had worked for.
