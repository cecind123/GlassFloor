rating,review
bad,This was the works company I worked for. It was poor training and a poor working environment. I would not encourage anyone to work for this place. The management was not good either.
bad,Simon is all about making money as their first and only priority. Employees are overworked and underpaid for the amount of work and expectations that they are given.
bad,No proper training. The accounting department run the operations with a different system. This was the worst experience I have had working for a management company. PTO was not given on time vacation kicks in after 180 days but says other wise on the offer letter. Very dishonest people.
bad,"The pay is trash,to much work not enough pay or advancement. No hours. Not enough hours given to make a decent check. If your think about working for this company, don't do it complete waste of time and energy!! Management is rude and wants you to do their job for them ."
bad,If I knew going in that I would be working for s bunch of egotistical armatures I would stayed at my last job...by all means steer clear from this company!
bad,"DO NOT bother going to work for this place.  The douchebag managers are over glorified salesmen with the arrogance to boot.  Even the interview is lack luster.  They won't give you time of day, in fact I think they are bigots there.  If you value a true career do not bother yourself at the Del Amo location."
bad,Thank goodness I left when I did. Job started off tolerable but when I was up for a raise then I was told I had to wait another 6 months. Finally got approved for a raise but didnt kick in for 4 months and they didnt want to retro pay me the difference. So I finally decided to leave.  Now I found out they had a meeting and fired the whole department with no notice. This company is thw worse place I've ever worked for.
bad,"The work environment was terrible. When I wss first hired, I had a good manager, then she was promoted and they promoted the newest hire, and youngest prison to be the manager. She wad terrible, and wouldn't hire anyone, which forced me to close 6 nights a week and she would not pitch in. The pay is terrible, and the outlet stays open for all holidays except Christmas, and the employees are forced to work all holidays. Before Christmas the debit machine went down, and to my knowledge, they have not replaced it. The computer software and hardware was so out of date, it felt like a time warp. "
bad,"Perhaps the worst corporate culture since the firing squad. I know many people will take what they can  get these days, just be prepared to sell you soul and watch out for the back stabbers."
bad,"Morale is terrible and there is a constant fear among employees that any mistake that is made, you will get fired.   Upper management micromanages and criticizes everything, even your emails.  Thereâ€™s a sense of paranoia coming from upper management."
bad,"I enjoyed the work I did in this position. However, the company overall was terrible to work for. There is a lot of turnover due to how badly they treat their employees. It is all about the money with this company and they don't care about you or your family life. The worst place ever to work. I could not take time off to attend sporting or school events with my children. You are not allowed to speak with your co-workers for any reason. It is all WORK WORK WORK, to bring in money for the CEO's pocket. Selfish and greedy company."
bad,"You will only advance at this company if your Regional allows it. Assistants get told they can advance to get them to agree to be used by others. No one wants to share information or help you. Its a sink or swim type of job. No bonus program for assistants even though you support other who get a bonus. In some cases, you have directly done the jobs of others who get a bonus for your work."
bad,"I prefer not to give a review; however, in all my years of working, this was the worst job I have ever held.  It was a very poor work environment.  The last manager was in the job only for himself, gave no encouragement whatsoever and basically was a poor leader."
bad,Very very unprofessional Managment. Subcontractors are treated better than employees. And if u give a 2 wk notice to leave make sure you use all your vacation time. You will not be paid out for it. Worst company I've ever worked for. The KOP mall Managment are all a**holes  that think their ðŸ’© doesn't stink..
bad,"The company as a whole sucks no room for growth no say in anything everyone acts so fake the supervisor of maintenance is having an affiar its just horrible"
bad,"The most toxic place to work in downtown Indy. Steer clear. Horror stories from this place unless your in the click and even if you are it's still a very toxic stressful work environment. The big thing is managment has been told and HR but does nothing"
bad,The office of 15 people management did not interact with the customer service representatives. We are out on the sales floor as the face of the company but literally the managers would ignore us as they walked past our customer service booth. This is the procedure throughout Simon.
bad,"The guest services manager position is the worst job that you can get at the mall I worked for. It was a retail position masked as an outside B2B sales position. You never know if you are going to get your weekend off because someone always calls out. The general manager expects you to cover the shift even if it means you have to work throughout all the business hours 7 days a week straight. I worked overtime almost every week. This place does not respect work/life balance. You will get burned out. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers but everything else such as management, workplace culture, and a typical day at work is so toxic that you could easily get stressed out. If you decide to apply and get the job my advice is to document everything that goes on during the day including recording messages on your phone for your job security. Try to transfer to another Simon Mall as soon as you can."
bad,This was literally the worst company i ever worked for. The work culture was hostile and you never received help from upper management or Human Resources.
bad,People were stealing from the company but when it was reported I was fired. The site I worked at had no ethics or to eat supervision. Supervisors were allowed to bully and harass the employees
bad,Steer clear of this company unless you enjoy having to be available 24/7.  Company has zero work/life balance and they foster a culture of fear and intimidation.  Favoritism abounds.
bad,Management is poor no direction.dont know what's going on in the work place flying by the shirt tail.always last minute decision.t he management always puts work off on lower people.
bad,"I would not recommend any part time positions from a Simon mall. They are making a lot of changes in the way they do business, which involves letting go of a lot of employees without notice."
bad,"If your looking for a job that has chance for improvement Simon isn't it ,it's a dead end job ,no bonuses,no Christmas bonuses,"
bad,"This is a terrible place to work for! the manager shelly bryant will give you a 500 page booklet. She will get angry if you ask questions before reading the book. 3 strikes and your out! You make more than 3 mistakes, she'll fire you! If you post anything that happens bad in the mall, and she finds out! She will fire you!"
bad,"It was an opportunity that I'm grateful for but I would never recommend anyone to work for Simon Property Group. Wages were on the lower end, not much cultural diversity."
bad,"I worked for a Starbucks licensed store in a mall owned my Simon. They did not care that some employees were causing a toxic and uncomfortable environment for other employees. Direct management did nothing to aid or assist those who were being wronged, and did not care about the well-being of the employees. The manager was allowed to manipulate things in any way that would benefit their schedule and advancement in the company. "
bad,"Loved my job, hated the nonsense which eventually caused our separation. Multi tasking is required and fine unless you are pulled so thin that you can't complete required items. You make the management team succeed, while you are left on the sidelines. It is a pattern of exclusion and remember you are the only hourly person in the office so you are the one that can be left out, written up and badgered at will. And remember, no matter how someone treats you, whether another employee or a ""guest"", you must take the nonsense, and smile or you will be reprimanded. Also, there are no friends at Simon. Once you are gone, no one will call to see how you are. Every man for himself. A terrible way to work and live.Getting fired was a blessing in disguise. And there is no value for hard dedicated work - doesn't make a difference."
bad,"For some reason, to be a RVP you have to be rude and think too highly of yourself..  Upper management dumps on them and it all flows downhill to the Mall Manager.  Regional tells Mall Managers to continue to cut their budgets.  This is money the retailers pay into for common area maintenance for flowers, customer service, safety, security, parking lot improvements, to keep the parking lot lights on, custodial, etc. No money to fix it, just paint it and go on. The pay is good if you want a corporation to own your life and soul.  There is no workplace culture. The closest thing to a culture is the fear they push down on the malls each and every day."
bad,"This job has no benefits. There are no areas for advancement. However there is job security, they won't fire you (unless you do something illegal of course) But they hold on to workers because they know the pay is awful and the turnover is high due to people finding better jobs. This is a stepping stone job. Do not think you will make a living from a 4hr shift 12-20hr work week. This company has the funds to pay well but they do not! If you are a recent high school grad, retiring,or looking for pocket money this job is for you."
bad,Upper Management demands are hard to achieve.  Lack of support and quick to throw you under the bus!! Long hours and no time to use your vacation or other time.
bad,"The culture at Simon needs an overhaul. They are stuck in the past and have no plans on changing. This will cause them to lose great employees very quickly. "
bad,"They are a big company and very stable but a lot of  changes, training, not friendly environment, no life balance, no commission, poor benefits and bad health insurance."
bad,"There is no further explanation needed. The staff were great. The manager was not professional. Fast paced, decent work environment, very busy. To learn skills in this company then move to a competitive like business."
bad,"Worked with multiple departments, coordinating with clients into a retail enviroment."
bad,"Itâ€™s as easy as it gets when it comes to cleaning and making the facility look good for customers. But Iâ€™m not a fan of individuals telling me about how bad of a job Iâ€™m doing or my performance needs improvement. I know what Iâ€™m worth and how much I get done. The work speaks for itself, just get off that office chair and go look for yourself. Along with that, if you enjoy getting harped in about the smallest things, this is perfect place for you. Make sure you absolutely have no life because the hours are back and forth. Was told itâ€™s basically first shift but there are days where you had to work until dark and go back right away the next morning. Would recommend this to an old person who is retired or a young student looking to pay off school or bills."
bad,"Great pay and benefits, but that's where it ends.  I received little to no training.  It's a sink or swim culture.  Very high turnover.  Employee moral was very low."
bad,Most of the people that work there are sufficiently doing their job but some areas like maintenance the people that have been there for 20 or more years do not work. They get paid big bucks but do nothing but put the problem on the tenant or to a hard working new coworker.
bad,Senior management is very tenured and old school.  Change does not happen easily. Company operates on fear.
bad,Was a good company to work for. There was not much room for advancement and very hard to get to know the management team. Good benefits and times off.
bad,"Super great place, nice boss.  Lots of help provided from management and staff.  Recommended field, great place to grow and find your passion.  Lots of attention to employees of town."
bad,"Simon Property Group is one of the most fast paced, competitive and intense work environments one could ask for. It is unapologetic in its approach to being the biggest and strongest player in the commercial real estate game.  Working there is not for the thin-skinned or faint of heart. If you are driven, interested in making money and working with the best in the business, with some of the most aggressive, intense and brilliant minds in this industry, then SPG is for you."
bad,"Simon is an average company. Just like most companies, you will experience your ups and downs. You will have to be the master of your career destination. If you dont, they will not come after you."
good,The guest service information booth is no longer there but I had a great time working there. the people were wonderful and have had a great time working there.
good,The company had no real positive aspects for it's entry level employees. They offered no reason to incent it's employees to work harder and try to advance.
good,"Just Ok, Although I actually enjoyed working there and engaging with customers and tenants. Worked with all departments; Mall Manager,Office Manager, Marketing Director, Operations Director, Leasing, Maintenance and Security. Also answered phone  for two differnt Malls of over 200  stores. Answered questions for customers, vendors,contract vendors, transferred calls to all departments  Worked selling gift card from walk up customers to Corporate orders.Schedules were always inconsistent. Hardest part was during the Christmas Season."
good,"Management did not help build my career or advance my career.  Once they did, there were unexpected results for me but expected results for the company."
good,"This is a pretty easy job outside of the holidays. The pay however, is very low. Management should care a little more about their employees. More communication is necessary."
good,"Though I don't recommend Simon to be the first place you seek employment, I am grateful for the experience I received while working there. I left because there was NO work/life balance or teamwork - as workplace culture goes, consider yourself solitary. That may have been property-specific, so note that; however, you'll still have an endless list of tasks no matter where you go. "
good,"Very old system and needs complete overhaul. Comfort Cooling hugely affected by worn out seal on Air Handler Units, dirty duct system, Cooling Tower Fills in bad shape, Spring Vibration Isolators  of the cooling towers badly affected by rust etc..."
good,Everyone is afraid of the CEO and therefore honest conversations can't be had.  VP's are afraid to push back or fight for their positions. So budget numbers are ridiculous and  unrealistic.  Employees are paid horribly but don't worry...share holders always get paid.
good,"working at the Simon property group has been a learning experience to be able to interact with different cultures and ethnicities, and the ability to think on my feet."
good,"I worked at Phoenix Premium Outlet Mall full time, terrible, terrible management. I was allowed to see all sides of this company, there is no opportunity to grow especially to minorities, theres also a lot of micromanagement, they want you to work for them not for the company, on any typical day, staff had drama, salary employees would come as they pleased, not to mention that some of them would show up for a few hours and left . There wasnt an even and consistent time for the entire management office which was poorly managed, and the work environment is TOXIC. Overall working with "
good,"This is a great job to get you started in customer service and sales. It is a very hard job, and a lot of things to remember. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,"Management was horrible! They donâ€™t know how to interact with their workers and talk on the low about their own associates. Theyâ€™re always short staffed because people are leaving due to the poor job culture, you donâ€™t get any benefits being part time and even though you work at a mall, no discounts on any store,"
good,Salary does not match the amount of work that you do. You get paid to little for what the cost of living is. Health benefits are pretty decent and the 401k as well.
good,If you are looking for a place to get work. and need to learn future skills and would need to be able to get ahead. this is a great place there is no upward movement for the tech side.
good,"Don't try to be an individual thinker. Best to be a ""sheeple"" with this company. They say when you work there they ""Simonize"" you and that is no lie."
good,"I learned a lot during my time at Simon. I appreciate everyone that walked into my life and supported me. The pay was okay, considering the job position I had. I felt like I grew and am working at a position similar to this and utilizing the strategies I learned from this position to my current position."
good,"Everything at Simon was strange.  The building is falling apart in the IT areas, but the executive offices are almost gold plated, there are full sized classic cars in Dave Simon's ""office"" (read the whole floor), and the other floors are dirty and falling apart."
good,Am not happy on the very slow resoponse/down play/reject  to reports I make as regards to timely repair and maintenance of the equipment.  This caused me to frasterate and stress. The Mall we have is technically a dying Mall.
good,"under staffed to meet the demand of the business                                                        "
good,Let me clarify something this job is as good as the attitude you put into it. If you come to work with a lazy or I don't care attitude yow will be gone as fast as blinking your eyes. If you put your best foot forward in all that you do you will be fine and if you mess up you will get chances to fix your mistake. You are the face of the mall and they keep a heavy eye on you with secret shops to make sure you are doing your job to the best of your abilities and they consider anything under an 90% a failure. If you come into this job expecting it to be a stepping stone for your career in Simon its not going to be. GSR's are the bottom of the totem pole and can sometimes get blamed for stuff that we had no say or action in. If you want this as customer service experience on your resume then great this job is a good fit. Overall it can be a fun and easy job if you apply effort.
good,Simon limits who they want to advance and minorities are not high on their list. They keep minorities locked in positions that keep them out of management.
good,"I worked for Simon as a Guest Service Representative for 2 years at one mall, then the position was pretty much dissolved overnight, the customer service booth was taken down, and I was jobless without warning. I was pretty upset with the company. When I was asked to return seasonally at another Simon mall I hesitantly accepted the position (just to make some extra cash around the holidays). Itâ€™s an easy job, slow paced environment except at Christmastime then the workload increases as it does with any retail job. The pay is minimum wage with very little room for advancement so most people only work as a GSR as a second job to make extra cash, itâ€™s not a career you can live off of unfortunately."
good,"Office I was at has closed down. low salary for a lot of work, some mangers are ok, Fun office just horrible pay. Pay may be better at a corporate office"
good,"Simon Corporate is very hands-off, preferring each property to operate as an independent entity.  They offer very little training to incoming, new employees.  As a new Office Administrator coming in to the company at a property that operated without an Office Administrator for 3-4 months, I was given very little guidance or training.  I was given the phone number of an OA at another property and the access to the Company's Policies and Procedures and told I could research and find everything I needed to effectively perform the duties required of my position.  I rose to the challenge, quickly learned my position, and resolved many Accounts Receivables issues that had grown out of hand during the time with no OA on staff.  During this time period, I implemented a new system for Procurement and Accounts Payable very smoothly and with virtually none of the issues that can arise when dealing with a brand new policy dealing with vendors and invoices.  After only 8 months in my new position I became a Point of Contact for other Office Administrators and Mall Managers."
good,"Great company overall with lots of advancement opportunities. However, they do not treat the Director of Marketing and Business Development position with the respect it deserves. Upper management is still run like a family business with people in charge who are borderline abusive with their communications. These people make it hard to do everyday work. When they are not involved, the rest of the team is pleasant and allows for fun and rewarding opportunities. It is a fast paced career with a lot of potential to learn and grow professionally...if you can survive the leadership of certain individuals."
good,"Responsible for the preparation of  4 large retail trade shows & conventions both domestic and international (ICSC)."
good,"There was nothing to atypical in reference to working for this company. Would recommend someone to apply for employment with Simon Property Group, as long as they don't mind working long hour work weeks."
good,"The people I have had the privilege of working with at Simon Property Group have been nothing short of outstanding."
good,"I've not been there for several years so hopefully things have changed.  At the time there was extreme employee turnover, chronically behind on work and really poor morale of coworkers."
good,Simon Property Group is just an ok company. They dont really show any appreciation to their underpaid overworked employees and honestly felt like I was just a seat warmer who could be replaced for someone they could bring in and pay less.
good,"Working at Simon Property Group was a good experience; Administrative Assistant at a receptionist desk, Customer Service Trainer. Learned about mall management."
good,"The culture and environment at Simon is fast paced, competitive, and stressful with very little work/life balance.  Time Off benefits are not competitive."
good,"Competitive atmosphere, real estate experience, leasing, marketing, demanding, aggressive business and office atmosphere, good first job learning experience, average employee lasts about 2 years"
good,"The corporate culture was very challenging. As a team, we achieved many great things. It was enjoyable to work with the team along with community leaders."
good,"Over all good place to work, but does not offer a good work life balance.  Also, salaried employees go by the same guide lines as hourly paid employees."
good,"Tough and stressful work environment that required you to always be on top of your game. Excellent pay and benefits are two key factors why people work for Simon, but there is little to no work life balance."
good,"In the beginning it was fun, fast passed and great place to work.  Over the years the policies changed and SIMON shifted it's interested in making employees and shoppers comfortable.  It was to make more money.  Which I know is the companies job to make more money for the shareholders but they stopped carrying about what made them a great place to work for."
good,"Company has high expectations, multiple fields to get into, internal advancement is possible. Some lack of organization between departments, decline of retail industry"
good,A typical day at work was 9 to 5 but it was flexible for me because I was still attending classes. I learned about Cisco and all other aspects of IT Support. The management and the workplace was great and helped and encouraged me every step of the way until I understood what I was doing. The hardest part of the job was trying to fit in the culture of they do things when I first got there. After a few weeks some of the coworkers became my best friends. The most enjoyable part was to learn all the different things and apply them in the real world settings where what I did had an impact on the customer and the company.
good,"Kind of a boring job, if you enjoy doing the same thing day in and day out this is the job for you. I prefer to dabble here and there not being pigeon holed to just doing one thing day in and day out."
good,"The Melbourne Square mall a different then any job that you would ever work for it has its ups and downs, the pay is low and the demands are high."
good,This is a great first job but there are no opportunities to further advance within the company and they do not give any raises.
good,It's an awesome job and the people I work with are great. I enjoy interacting with the customers and being able to help them out on a face to face level.
good,Write 5 blogs a month on the styles and events of Wolfchase Galleria.
good,"A lot of responsibility very little support staff; however, great company overall."
good,I have worked for a leading real estate investment trust for 5 years and am looking to now join a company with a great corporate culture.
good,It is a good place to work. You meet a lot of people from different Countries. It is nice to be helpful. The hardest part of the job are the  upset customers you may encounter in a day. But I always do my best to have a great day at work.
good,Great learning experience and very much a change of pace from most jobs.  Very detail oriented job.  Work is always changing and providing new challenges.
good,"Simon Property Group was the owner of the Premium Outlet. Ops Director position was the face of the Facility as I was onsite, out every day in the Facility."
good,"Great company, unfortunately I was hired for a special IT assigment."
good,"Starbucks retains a mission that is irrefutable in its ingenuity and consistency. Despite the circumstance of licensing, any store strives to provide customer serviced that is memorable and keeps customers coming back"
good,"I didnt work full time, so I cant speak for any of the full time employees. But I can tell you the only reason I wasnt hired full time was becasue they didnt want to give another employee benefits. The management basically had me doing most of their work for them, I didnt get any type of raise, they had one other person working one day a week while I was working 5. When that other employee asked for more hours, they slashed my hours completely without warning. The overall atmosphere was fine on most days, the office vibe was very relaxed until they needed something done and then it was them breathing over your shoulder. The management considers ""training"" handing over a big binder and telling you to figure it out for yourself. It was an okay job to have for a few months but I cant say I would work there again."
good,Tough place to work in the field when all decisions are ultimately made at the corporate level and simply given to the field. No autonomy to make decisions about the business any longer.
good,"This is a great place to launch your career & build your resume. There are other companies that are willing to pay more & give better benefits -- work from home, pay, etc. Most companies appreciate seeing SPG on your resume though & you learn valuable skills for the real estate industry."
good,The work was fast paced.  I enjoyed interacting with the tenants and the attorneys we used.  Management waivered between unprofessional and competent.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the atmosphere of the employees.
good,No management structure or accountability. Company of great longevity definitely should be more involved in department structure when it comes to management.
good,"The management team hardly come of of their office  to help you when you really need help. But when thing go bad. we are get all the blame. "
good,"I operated their golf carts while attending school and it was super fun! It had its moments of disappointment as any job does but mostly, I enjoyed it. The tips were my moneymaker and I met so many people, I built networks into other future employment opportunities. I cannot say I would work this job again because the atmosphere has changed. When I worked there, I worked amongst such a strong community between us shuttle operators, the mall security team and store employees. Everyone has moved on but I will never forget it."
good,"Typically a days work as a Simon property group Guest service representative at Desert Hills Premium Outlets is very easy going."
good,Simon comprises some of the worldâ€™s most premier shopping destinations - Forum Shops at Caesars Palace and Fashion Center at Pentagon City for instance.
good,Simon was a fine company to work for. The job was fun at times too. The management could be nicer and less snooty at times. There could also be less false encouragement.
good,"Managed my own cash drawer, and gift cards daily. I sold gift cards and memberships for our kids club. On multiple occasions i was secret shopped, and received 100 % on providing high quality and efficient customer service."
good,"All business all day.  Tenants call, meeting, and lots problem solving.  Always looking for ways to improve bottom line. Dynamic place to work with no day alike."
good,Great company to work for!  Small office with tight knit team  that works for much larger company.  Many company policies to learn and highly audited.  Great for self-starter!  Loved the humor in the office. Loved working with my Food Truck tenants!
good,"maintain the center throughout the day. very good company to work for most enjoyable is doing different things each day, hardest part making sure everything is done on time."
good,"Majority of the employees are cross-trained in various positions as they are expected to be able to answer questions if need. Positions  with the company can be very challenging to its employees, making the quality of their jobs above average. Employees become knowledgeable from working directly with my managers. The atmosphere in the management office is that of a close knit of friends."
good,All aspects of commercial property marketing and administration at the Lincolnwood Town Center
good,"A typical  day at work is inspecting the property, discussing new and outstanding issues with the upper management, security personel and housekeeping. I am leaving this company with new knowledge of the business side of contracting, management, warranty and many other aspects of running a large complex. All management and co-workers are pleasant to work with as a team. I don't consider any part of my job "" hard"", only a new challenge/experience to learn & master. The most enjoyable part of my job is the respect I receive from all co-workers & tenants alike.I truly enjoy my job."
good,"On a day to day i am responsible for A/P, A/R, Payroll, H/R information, Project Management and balancing an administrative budget."
good,This is a fast paced job. Must enjoy training new employees due to high turnover rate in the Guest Services Booth. Must be very organized and have a professional attitude due to dealing with the public.
good,Challenging and demanding work environment. Great benefits; company cares about its employees. Expect the company to face many future external challenges due to online retailer concerns.
good,"busy daily in operations "
good,"A typical day, fact is there are no typical days in  [FIELD]"
good,"Good benefits and people that work at the company. They work you,  deadlines are always running late,  not as much training as could be given.  Good support from other managers ."
good,"If you have the drive and an aggressive, positive approach, this could be the place for you. Advancement comes to those with a good education, great technical skills and the willingness  to always go above and beyond.  Bring your patience, advancement will be slow but rewarding. Switch departments as often as you can to learn the business. This will make you more valuable as an employee to management."
good,"If you are looking for a first job, this is a good place to work, there are many different job opportunities around the mall and many are willing to hire people with little to no experience."
good,"Simon is a good company to work for, but the management is not that great. Some of the managers are great, while others have no concept of what it means to manage people."
good,"I learned quite a bit working for this organization.  They had very high expectations and demanded the best."
good,"I get really flexible schedule, but not sure that is the case in every dept.  PTO could be better.  Their IT could also be better,  use Lotus Notes and that is not good"
good,"I do not wish to discuss anything about this job, everyone has different experiences and preferences for the jobs they apply for and are entitled to their own opinion"
good,"I loved working as part of the management team. They are like a second family. I was always given addition responsibilities allowing me to increase my skill set. It was a great experience,"
good,"I help customers find what they are looking for. I help my co-workers out when they need help, we work as team. I am also the receptionist a few days out the week for mall management."
good,"Selling gift cards, and being a customer representative in the mall is a pretty nice and relaxing job.  Out office was located near the end on a pretty deserted side of the mall so it wasn't overly difficult."
good,"The office can be very slow and not have any work to do, so we could relax and talk to coworkers, but when customers came in the atmosphere immediately changed and we would go above and beyond to try and please all customers."
good,I wasnt there long enough but i really enjoyed working at that company. The co-workers were very polite and very helpful. Good place to grow and move up within the company.
good,I enjoy my job and career at Simon Very much. The enviroment is a creative and open one to share ideas in.
good,Depending on the day of the week determines how your day will go. Weekends are stressful and annoying and during the week itâ€™s pretty slow and boring. But all in all itâ€™s not too bad.
good,"Simon  is a good place to work if you can take the stress and remain flexible. In my early years at Simon, before it became a NYSE stock company, things were more collaborative.  By the time I retired from Simon, in July of 2017 things were mostly ""top-down""."
good,"Very fast paced environment, lots to do, never ending tasks. But great challenges to prove yourself in the position with raises to complement it. Some weekends and Holidays are required. Holidays are extremely busy."
good,"I am constantly busy with various tasks throughout the day from repairing carpet, lights and plumbing. In between times we are asked to stop what we are doing to get a major job done with all hands on deck.
