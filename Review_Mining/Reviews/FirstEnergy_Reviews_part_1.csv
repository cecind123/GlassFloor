bad,"Always talking about someone behind their back while they sit and do nothing.have to come in to work phones for a power outage instead of having enough people to cover there already. Not a very good place to work, would not recommend."
bad,Expect you to work like you don't have a life outside of work. Child was hospitalized and they still expected me to be at work and told me I would not ever get on full time permanent from a contractor if I did not come.
bad,Working for FirstEnergy is not what it's all cut out to be. There is a BIG turn over for this company. I worked there for 1 year. You bid on the shifts that you want was not bad. But if you get up trained to do something else then you get up on the 930 to 6 shift. You have to volunteer 1 or 2 weeks a month to be on call. Work hours up to 16 hour shift is there are there are outages in the 5 states. Stressful. Coaching
bad,"Long hours, no time for family, friend's, always on call. No room for advancement unless you know someone in upper management. Racist culture, primarily caucasian employees."
bad,"The best company I have ever worked for, as most people I interact with are  very professional, sensitive to employee work/life balance, knowledgable employees with a focus on safety"
bad,The corporate culture was corrosive. The working environment was miserable and it showed in the work that was performed. There was no incentive to do anything better than minimum because you'd either get screamed at for doing too much or screamed at the next time when you weren't able to get it done as quickly as before. Eventually people stop caring...
bad,I worked as a contractor for First Energy. They like to bring in contractors to do their work while they do nothing let lay off the contractor. First Energy is continuously calls me every 3-6 months looking for someone to fill their contract position.
bad,"I wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds clich√©, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for. Everyone in the Glassdoor community is truly genuine and extremely helpful in all aspects. Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals. Since I've started as an OSR (only about 3 months ago) 3 of my teammates have been promoted so growth in the company can be fast and is expected."
bad,"Staff were rude, brash and were not friendly. managers were driven by what sales they could reap from new staff. Work environment was cluttered, with faulty machines, old chairs. broken desks."
bad,Those are more appropriate names for this company!!  I really don't know where to begin.  Unless you're willing to be miserable everyday you are better off working somewhere else.
bad,Ot is available and is mandatory at times it could be way too much and would not allow you to enjoy outside life because you could be on call and have to stop what you are doing and get to work with in 1 hour
bad,"required to be on call once a month with pager, and even when you did not have pager you could still be mandated to stay over up to 4 hours and be required to come in early up to 2 hours"
bad,I had never worked for a more racist place in my life. The co workers talk to you in a rude way and management doesn't stop the rude actions of the other workers.
bad,Was a contractor  for 2 years with this company. The boss is quick to throw you under the bus. Anything  that  happens  to you or your vehicle  whether  its your fault or not is your fault. No company  trucks you must use your own  vehicle. Poor milage  compensation . If your  vehicle  breaks down be prepared  to get in trouble  for not having a perfect  vehicle. This job really  beats up your vehicle. It will get to the point to where it feels like you can't afford  to  work there. No one cares about the contractors you are replaceable. I worked there for 2 years. I would not suggest  this job. I worked  my butt off did a good job but still got let go.
bad,There is nothing good to report when you are  a contractor working for this company. You are treated like second hand employees because they can fire you at any point in time for no reason.
bad,"Loved getting the chance to talk to so many different people on through out the day. "
bad,"Hired as a contractor.  Supervisor was awful and very unapproachable. Non-stop calls. Upper management was stuck-up.  Unexpected overtime (couldn't leave until calls were cleared). Unrealistic stats required, example; on pa power outage calls you have to ask are you satisfied, really?!? Wouldn't acknowledge doctors notes if you or your child was sick and you couldn't make it to work. Dont Ever Work Here!!!"
bad,typical workday for us at first energy is to take inbound calls to regarding first energy customers who have billing or collection issues on account. We take payments and offer payment plans to all customers depending on there need and offer financial assisted programs for those that qualify.hardest part of my job is making sure all account are documented correctly and making sure you are giving all correct information to ensure u are fallowing the previous notated information given.
bad,Was promoted to a position that in the end never existed per management. Was cheated out of two promotions that 3 years of grooming went to waste. Was lied about and was accused of misconstrude stories in my reviews after 6 years of hardwork in my department as well as across the corporation. Was put in a stressful work environment for 3 years on a daily basis until I was fired for false accusations by supervisor. Stress caused physical and emotional damage. Healtcare was very poor and employee benefits continue to be taken away from employees.
bad,"Unsafe to the public.  Do not believe in the bailout of nuclear power plants.  They pay people $100k to take smoke breaks, lie, and harass people. People with 30 years + experience cannot perform basic or simple tasks.  There is no ownership or accountability by management.  Unprofessional and arrogant culture."
bad,"I was a contractor for 10+ months as a meter reader for FirstEnergy.  It was the worst company I have ever worked for. Anything that happens, regardless if it is your fault or not, you are responsible for. H.R. does not care about employees.  You are replaceable in their eyes.I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"For unknown reasons, the company had shut down 3 out of 5 PA Plants, they're selling off the hydro plant too! A larger Ohio company, with cloudy reasoning has devasted it's work force in PA. Use extreme caution with this company!"
bad,This was the absolute worst place that I've ever worked. Everyone is miserable and they want you to be miserable too! I often heard from employees that they hated working there but have worked at FE forever and will retire in 5-10 years so they are just waiting it out. Everyone is always throwing others under the bus and then backing up on their team mate to make sure that they ran them over. They expect you to live at work and then get home and get back on your computer because you might miss something.
bad,"Lies, hooks, and more work than what you are paid for. The only pro is you have to TRY to lose the job, but there is little to no room for advancement."
bad,"I worked at first energy for about a year and a half. At first i didnt mind it, i worked in customer service since I've started working, i do not mind working with customers/people. i am a HUGE people person. As time went on, the job got more frustrating, working for this company got more frustrating. They put you into training for 8 weeks before you hit the floor and are on your own. Teach you what to say to customers, what the proper information is, what the companies guidelines are. All of a sudden, its like all of that went out the door, supervisors weren't following guidelines, just so they didn't need to take an escalated call, making us as repersentives look like we are incompetent doing our jobs.. i don't think realizing this is why customers so often ask ""well i believe a supervisor will give me a different answer"" They have no care or sympathy for their employees. You are expected to do SO MUCH for them (example: ALL the over time you are FORCED to do, as well as stopping your life 11 weeks + out of the year to be on call) You have no say, but god forbid you take a sick day, or would like a personal day. Its not all bad tho, i met some wonderful people with this company, and i will cherish their friendships. This place just needs to care about their employees a little bit more, then maybe the employees willl care about the customers as well, if they feel like they are actually being appreciate and seen for what they do by management, instead of only ever being told what you are doing wrong."
bad,This job was awful this was the worst place I have ever worked in my life and I would never go back.
bad,"it was a nice place to work until i got laid off. i started with the company as a temp contractor. throughout training they promoted ""if you do well, you'll get hired."" i believed them. until i found out all they do is hire temps for a year they lay off everyone and hire a new class of temps."
bad,Management holds you back from ever achieving goals. You will not succeed here until you kiss butt and keep your mouth shut. Never listen to suggestions or take advice if you don't have a degree.
bad,"I was a contracted Customer Service Representative for about 9 weeks.  Training is hard.  You are in classes for about 4 weeks, then you go to nesting, which is when your classwork is mated with using the software, and applying what you learned while handling inbound customer calls.  There are a lot of rules because the power utility industry is heavily regulated and First Energy owns 10 operating companies across 6 states.  "
bad,I have no comment to give. I am filling out this section because it is required. I don't know how much detail is required but I don't wish to elaborate other than to say I worked for this company for 13 years and believe the current management in my department has no understanding about how to manage people.
bad,"Don't work here unless you thrive on bad stress and mandatory overtime with no or minimal (a few hours) warning. The stress in overwhelming, and no matter how fast you answer calls, it isn't fast enough."
bad,"Typical day at work is 95% at your cubicle taking 100+ calls if its a Monday and at least 50+ during the other days. You go thru training and lots of it since this place is constantly changing. Everyone in the call center starts off as a temp to hire but don't get your hopes up because your hired in based on who you know and who likes you. Sometimes if your just good at your job. most temp positions should be about 6 months before they let you know if you if you'll be hired in but not this place. You could be here for a year or longer as a temp without getting a raise, no paid vacations, and no benefits all the while still being trained for other things than what you originally came in for. Management is okay, some people are really good but most are complete jerks. When asking for help, most mangers will just look at you as if you are unworthy with the exception of a few. There are some really awesome managers there so don't get me wrong. The most enjoyable part of this job is the end of the day. Be prepared to stay after your shift almost every day, for the most part just a few minutes which is nice because it is overtime. However, during big storms be prepared for long hours of working. I once worked from 9:30am til 1:30am and then had to be back for the 9:30-6 shift. It's ridiculous how much they are allowed to overwork you and that's all they care about it working YOU. The turnover rate is so high because this place is really for the hard, unfeeling, unbending person who really just wants to work and have a very poor work to personal life ratio. Be prepared, you've been"
bad,If you like too much work and not enough pay - while Union workers receive all the pros of working here - at an exempt level  - you will not.
bad,Due to cutbacks and First Energy purchasing Allegheny. Moral of the people actually doing the work has dramatically declined. I worked there for 20 years and it was a great place to work. Now you aren't even a number. Good luck and best wishes to the old timers.
bad,Work always must come first. You may not have a sick child you may not leave on time to pick up your child from daycare you are expected to stay overtime at a moment's notice whether you have childcare or not
bad,"I was a Meter Reader for Potomac Edison in Frederick Maryland. "
bad,9.00 an hour isn't enough for a call center representative! Especially for a collections department rep.  Training could have been longer  before sending us straight to the floor.
bad,"stressful working at the call center, management was very very stuck-up and pretentious. Wanted so much and all while we were paid so little, you can forget about giving a supervisor a call, they were so rude and not helpful. Co-workers were good cool people. Only thing enjoyable was going home and at least people there were nice."
bad,"A typical day at work: Substation design and construction management, cost estimating"
bad,"Horrible place to work, avoid at all costs. Constant micro managing and if you support the union please be aware you will not have an easy time advancing.  Favorite games are still played even with a union in place, also pay and negotiations are a joke."
bad,I do not have an opinion of First Energy since I am not an employee of First Energy.  I only work there as an independent contractor.
bad,"when calling people you get abused by them for doing your job, the pay, colleagues where not very nice."
bad,"I met all requirement CSR requirements YTD,  but was let go because I was slightly behind on my numbers for the first two weeks of the month and was a half hour late one time. On multiple occasions was told to lie to the customers about their bill. If you're a contractor they will fire you for the slightest reason, huge turnover"
bad,"As a engineer working here I say that your typical day at work will be struggling with management to get projects approved, documenting things to cover yourself when they decide not to approve them and pass the blame when something breaks or evaluations happen. Management uses engineers to lie to evaluators stating that they will implement said projects and fix things, this keeps the managers clear from any repercussions. There is a struggle with the huge knowledge transfer curve. The older guys don't want to share everything with younger ones due to fear of being retired."
bad,"you never work close to home when you worked and you only worked when it wasn't windy, rainy, to cold or to hot!"
bad,Management all over the place and will degrade you. Tell you can be hired in after 6 months but then not tell you much on how to get hired in.     Customers can curse you out and you have to ask them if you can help with anything else
bad,"I was hired as a Contractor. When you get hired on all the hire ups come &  talk this place up. They talk like they are there to help you not to be afraid to ask questions, safety is huge there, they don't allow you to have friends, you are there to be micromanaged & belittled by their trainers. If you get stuck with the trainer that teaches PA Credit sorry he's arrogant, talks down on you for asking questions. He let go 5 temps before we were even given a chance. Its if they don't like you they get rid of you. Doesn't matter your previous work experience or your knowledge. Your not given a fair chance at the job you don't even make it out of training to the phones. The phones is where you learn more if your a hands. NOPE sorry you get a call from your temp agency with some made up excuse on why you were let go. Which really stinks because you weren't give a fair chance at the job, sitting in class is different than being on the phones. Customer Service is where it counts that why you have a Quality Team to listen in on your calls and actual supervisors on the floor that care about your job. Contractors pay is  $12.50 an hr. There are contractors that have been there for over a year, being pushed to diff. depts. to up train with no increase in pay. Your not given a fair chance"
bad,"First Energy bought our company and soon started closing our plants.  They have closed six stations and sold our hydro stations.  We used to have a good company, but went downhill fast."
bad,"The benefit packages are decent (or were decent, they are mediocre now with health care changes) and the pay is good. They pay just enough to make you feel like you can't go anywhere else and make the same amount starting at day one. But doesn't pay enough for the jobs you are expected to do. Vacation allotment is decent. No room for advancement. None at all unless you know someone or your current Director sees value in your department, Directors change frequently. Not a lot of guidance on projects which is held against you later, most projects that directly affect you and your department are farmed out to groups and circles that are considered the current ""stars"" of the company. No room to make positive change or an impact in your own department. Hardest part of the job is Outage duty. You are not permitted to say no to storm. Storm duty can last 2 - 3 weeks at a time, no days off, all 16 hour shifts. Illness in the family doesn't even exempt you from storm. Best part of the job, co-workers. A definite unhappy camaraderie."
bad,"I have been with the company for 7 years now. The pay is very fair in certain aspects. However there are times where you are under paid for doing more dangerous work. I have excelled at everything placed in front of me. The company has no desire to hire the proper candidate, but rather hire the person they are friends with."
bad,"Current Davis-Besse Security Manager and Superintendent has created a hostile work environment between management and employees."
bad,"Interviewed for an operator position.  Passed the entrance exam and interview was positive.  I was informed I was on the short list, but then was informed that I did not get the position because I was over-qualified and the manager feared I would leave the position for opportunities more suited to education."
bad,"I enjoyed working at this company until I realized that they had no care of anyone's personal life and/or our struggles.  When they said ""all hands on deck"" and you dont't have childcare, you will get written up and although you may have time to take off, they will not allow you because it wasn't planned or approved ahead of time, plus they're ""all hands on deck"" also so essentially, screw you."
bad,"Was hired on as a contractor, was difficult to prove yourself, you thought you were doing great, but without notice you were on the chop block"
bad,"Enjoyed able to work undisturbed, but when questions arise difficult to find help or support.  Good co-workers but due to companys lack of appreciation, attitudes are low."
bad,"The company strung us along making us think that we would get hired in 3 months. Six months in and we were only offered a placement test that we had to read a 200 page booklet and had 3 sections to the test. The majority of the test was on things we did not learn outside of our Credit and Collections department. Once you failed the test you are told to bad and ""it looks like your not getting hired"". Temp to hire's are given 14 hours of personal unpaid time, no vacations, no benefits, no participation in some company things. Everyday we dealt with getting called vulgar and derogatory things by customers and are given two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch to take a mental break. Supervisors are NEVER available when you have a supervisor call or any other issue you are not used to taking. When giving a Supervisor call back to a supervisor they only call a select few and never call the rest and we get stuck with the brunt of the anger when the customer calls back to complain more about not getting a supervisor call back. The turn over rate there is so high they had to bring in 8 new groups of 15-20 people in one month. Not a very good company to work for in my opinion especially when your temp agency complains about them as well and states that they "" are almost out of people to send to them"". The only enjoyable part of the job was helping customers in an emergency situation and making them feel their situation is very  important to us or helping a family keep their electric on and they are extremely grateful for my help even though they hate the company."
bad,"This should have been a great stable job but if you want to be micro managed and have ridiculous demands they put on you all while using your own vehicle which will get beat with the places you have to go then go ahead and apply. "
bad,Make sure you don't have kids or a sick parent. Hours are long calls are high. Overtime is mandatory. Power outages are frequent which means high call volume.
bad,High turnover in management. However there were numerous opportunities to develop and advance from department to department and with different company areas.
bad,"it was a real great experience to work,it was all about the middle management game and i personally think the gap should be reduced and there should be voice to listen in the upper crest so at times the organisational goals can be attained more accurately."
bad,"This was my first job out of college, since that time I have learned a few things.  FirstEnergy Generation is a shrinking company, there is no way to sugar coat that.  I worked at a nuclear generating station and the regulation was simply back breaking."
bad,"My position was at one of their nuclear facilities, everything we did was such an uphill climb.  Management has been selected to be ultra conservative based on years 'experience'.  In this case experience translated to old management practices and reluctance to upgrade even the most basic equipment to 2013 standards."
bad,A typical day was 9-14 hours. Management was the type to belittle you in public. That's why I became a supervisor to try and change the culture. The hardest part of the job was during refuel outages. 84-96 hours per week. The best part was seeing a job done successfully by my direct reports.
bad,"Loved my job. Did everything that I was told to and still was let go. After a big remodle, pay increase for the  whole company and hiring  to many employees. They could not hire all of us. So they let about 20 people go in one day. Worked there 14 months."
bad,Managers are non empathetic to work/life balance; mental health stress/disability. The best thing of FirstEnergy was the compensation and benefits. TLR
bad,Answering the phones all day is not for me. The Supervisor was a twit and a baby who had his favorites. A lot of in house animosity between employees. They strung contract positions along for up to two years without hiring them.
bad,"A typical day at work was to sit at my desk and just read emails. Management needs a lot of help. Not much of a workplace culture, but I was out in the field a lot."
bad,"The money is good, but First Energy is not a family oriented company.  They do not help employees balance their personal lives with their professional.  The company is extremely poorly managed."
bad,"A typical day here involves answering doctor and agency calls to add holds on to account so customers electric is not shut off. I learned how to work a new computer system and add these ""med-certs"" to accounts. Management is confused and not sure of what to do when something goes wrong because this is a new group and no one is sure of what to expect. Co-workers are aggravated and irritable because of the non stop calls coming in. The hardest part of the job is taking call after call, day after day, saying the same thing every time someone calls. The most enjoyable part of the day is clocking out to go home."
bad,I use to meet new customers and give a detailed explanation of the product and make him to understand the benefits regarding commercial cylinders.
bad,"The power industry has been decimated by regulations and red tape at all levels of government,  the uncertainty of closures and layoffs is rampant in this particular industry,  and the company isn't helping to ease the burden of this problem.  They give people of lower classifications and much, much lower seniority premium schedules and preferential treatment while disregarding any union contract definitions. This is a practice that runs rampant in my.department."
bad,"FirstEnergy is the epitome of what‚Äôs wrong with corporate America. Employees‚Äô advancement is based on who they know. Senior management protects their friends and creates cushy, high-paying positions for them. Managment is very reactionary as opposed to being proactive. Problems are solved only after they become a crisis. Complaints about managers are only given credence after a good employee leaves. It‚Äôs very frustrating for employees who are loyal and want to do their best."
bad,The workplace culture was enjoyable with the union employees. Knowledgeable. The plant operators were very well trained.  Most of the management supervisors retired therefore very little supervisory knowledge was passed down.  Safety was very good and this was controlled by the union.
bad,"Very one sided, political climate. They do not reward for loyalty nor for experience - most of the tech jobs have moved to a pay for performance model.If you are looking for advancement as a woman or minority, look else where."
bad,"I worked for several years at FirstEnergy and after being gone for over 3 months now working for a new company, I can say without a doubt that there are way better companies to work for."
bad,Working in this environment was very hard. i was working on a large table with many people. trying to sell solar panels. hours were long and pay was poor.
bad,If you do not pass their tests you are let go. They don't even tell you what you missed or score just a phone call not to come back. It is nice other than that.
bad,"I had the displeasure of working or slaving at the FE. You will be forced into overtime no matter what your schedule is, as well a minimal opportunity for advancement. All the reviews an ow ratings of this company cant be and arent wrong"
bad,"I feel that it's more stressful for people who have children's this is why they have a very high turn over rate. I also got into a car accident and had to go to the hospital, they said I was using personal time. I have in the hospital not by choice, I wonder what would have happen if I was unconscious or I died. They had little consideration for people they just wanted you to work but not actually be there for you."
bad,"The work is high paced and stressful.  The emphasis is placed on perfection, and nothing else is accepted.  There is little room for thinking outside the box, and all work is done by procedure or company process/policy.  Many of the company initiatives are antiquated with little contemporary thinking."
bad,the corporate culture was not interested in the employees satisfaction with the position. Forced transfers of position were mandated with threats of being terminated if the position was not taken
bad,"extremely strict place to work, be prepared to throw away your entire outside life to work here, and be able to sit still at your desk for 8+ hours a day"
bad,Answered phone calls of concerned customers. I learned that patience is key. Management cares about their employees. Co-workers are friendly. Remembering everything was very hard. But learning from my mistakes and becoming better is what I enjoyed the most.
bad,Does not have great work-life balance. Opportunity to make a lot of overtime compensation during the winter season. Ultimately moved away from the area after obtaining my degree.
bad,the supervisors do not care what is going on just worry about themselves. I was having seizures and was let go due to missing some work because of them even though i had dr notes for every day i missed
bad,"Great job with job security. However, they do not work with you when you need them too. I went through some legal things and because I could not get them the information in time, they wouldn't give me my job back."
bad,"Learned how to calibrate various valve, transmitters, Scales, meter."
bad,I left due to managers taking leads and cancelling them which was unfair they also had a massive turnover people are contantly changing and was a very rude manner in the office.
bad,"Management was really hands-on and helpful. You always had someone available to ask questions to, and they really seemed to care about each person. They were a bit obsessed with safety, to the point of being over the top, such as not being allowed to walk and talk on the phone. You are only allowed to stand in a single place to talk on the phone, it was a strongly enforced rule, as were all the over the top safety rules. Of course the biggest issue was the customers. Being that you are dealing with people's electric accounts, most calls were angry people. If you can tolerate being yelled at all day it can be a good job, but I found it too mentally exhausting."
bad,"My typical day of work consists of working the phones, i learned communication and vocal skills."
bad,I enjoyed working with the managers.But the job is very stressful and the pay in very low for how much we do and how much we take. The hours are stressful for single mothers with kids that get sick and things happen.
good,"I never worked for First Energy.   They bought Allegheny Energy. "
good,"Constant turnover and feeling like I am undervalued while talking calls from irate customers is physically drowning.i was constantly rewarded for customer compliments weekly, and there was no moving me forward into the company. i felt used and stuck."
good,"ungrateful management, will fired you as soon you are about to be protected by the union. Worst experience ever, working so hard for nothing, yes you get paid of course but they don't appreciate their employees."
good,Firstenergy is a great place to work as far as pay and benefits. It‚Äôs an office and they pick favorites. Managers and supervisors decide who gets what bases off popularity
good,This job is for a young person with no family obligations and no health issues. They are very strict with time off requests and sick days. It is fast-paced and breaks are strictly enforced.
good,"Nerc compliance fines are excessive related to   transmission substation upgrades , First energy is experiencing difficulty in growth and the ability to meet Nerc compliance , projects are poorly managed  and understaffed, roles and responsibilities are constantly changing, making it difficult to succeed at projects assigned  , numerous contractors are less than qualified"
good,currently still there just looking to move along. I been there 5 plus years and not opportunity for advancement ...........................................
good,"When I was originally hired as a contract worker last year, I informed First Energy that I was looking for a full-time employment opportunity. At that time, I was told that they may hire a full-time person for my position after 2 years as a contract worker. "
good,"Felt like a prison, amazing money but is it worth it? You decide. If you don't mind the 12 hour shifts and the prison like feeling, go for it."
good,The company is great for anyone who is either finished with raising children or someone without children. This company demands lots of  their employees time. The pay can be great with all of the mandatory overtime. The benefits are great. Work/Life balance I believe is the biggest hurtle. This can be a great place to work for someone whose life revolves around work.
good,"Physical security at a nuke plant. I've worked here for four years. It's a lot of sitting around waiting for terrorists to attack.  Boring work, unfulfilling.  The pay is great if you are willing to spend all of your time there and have no life outside of work.  We work twelve hour rotating shifts.  Be prepared to work nearly every weekend and holiday.  Management doesn't seem to care much about employees.  It's a job to pay the bills, but don't look for any job satisfaction out of it."
good,"Was sometimes stressful dealing with the unhappy, disgruntle customers."
good,Fast paced with no opportunity for advancement. During high call volumes overtime was mandatory and was given at the last minute. Managers are not very flexible and most often are unavailable.
good,Great benefits however a lot of work hours due to being short staffed. Very good  salary and compensation which is the upside to working rotating shift work.
good,This can be a good company to work for depending on the department and the management. The problem with the company is that it has gotten too large and the employees are no longer as valued as they were prior to all of the mergers.
good,It was very stressful working for FirstEnergy. I was a customer service representation in billing for a large electric utility company. We had mandatory overtime and some weeks I worked one hundred hours. I was exhausted the entire time I worked there.
good,"This company will get rid of you after 2 years so they can hire someone else cheaper instead of giving you a raise.  They do not care about transfer of knowledge."
good,"A typical day consisted of managing 250+ accounts. A fast paced environment. While there for 14 years I learned to juggle tasks, respond to various levels of customer concerns by mail or returned phone call. The hardest part of the job was being on a rapid response team and working 32 hours straight when needed. The best part of the job was the interaction with customers, and various township representatives."
good,"The company is a good place to work, as long as it is not in the contact center. The work is stressful, and the compensation is lacking. However, the contact center is a good stepping stone into the higher paying parts of the company."
good,Good place to work with ok management. I love the schedule but nothing is fixed around here so we have to work around equipment that is broke.
good,"I've worked for three different divisions/departments in FirstEnergy. The job depends entirely which fiefdom you work under. I've had one excellent, and two mediocre positions within the company."
good,The pay is very good but management has no idea what they are doing. Most of the management are people who are not qualified for the job and can not run the place that is why we went bankrupt.
good,"the company offers many opportunities and experiences with working at a higher level, but due to being union, most promotions are a simple rotation. demotion comes within a year"
good,First Energy is a classic example of a big corporation setup. All jobs are divided into teams and crossing over work from team to team causes a lot of red tape and extra work. Side note be prepared to visit the same topic over again because after a year it still might not be done processing thru the system (People Tree).
good,It is an okay work place structure not built so great don't have a great communication level with boss but great trainer but not good co workers don't treat others well lots of favoritism
good,"Employees feel valued technically. Management is archaic  It can take a long time to achieve supervisor status.  Layoffs are used often to cut costs.  Layoffs do not generally affect Transmission operations, but morale suffers."
good,Business Partner role with engineering rewarding.
good,You were always in crisis mode; you were either coming out of an outage or about to go into one.  The goal was to keep unplanned outages to a minimum and shorten the planned ones so that the equipment was available.
good,"if you're hired on. All employees are hired in as contractors to start and you have to earn a hired on spot with the company."
good,"Worked revenue protection. Must work as contractor for 18 months before consideration for hire. As contract worker, you receive zero benefits."
good,"directed the construction of and maintenance of transmission and distribution substation facilities installation & construction of low voltage equipment, communication systems, lighting, grounding, cabling, rod ducts, and raceways "
good,"Taking phone calls and enrolling and cancel service. He i need more information about a customer account, i will ask my co-workers to help me research the account. The hardest part of the job is when you have to tell a customer that i can't waive their cancel fee from there account. I love communicate with people and to talk with them."
good,"My department focuses on multiple projects at a single time. We are basically a group of consultants for all departments within FirstEnergy to ustilize. Quality is the main form of advertisement that we use. Each day varies based up on the projects that you are assigned. We work in groups and each analyst usually has 4-6 projects at a time."
good,"In a Faced paced multi-task operation, customer payments are received in from United States Postal Service, envelopes are sorted, opened, digitally imaged, printed date of receipt, filed, and digitally transferred to banks. On average, approximately 110,000 payments are processed in a distinguishing manner using several unique OPEX machines and running data through UNNYSIS software. Special operations include process of oracle and FirstEnergy Solutions high dollar payments, handling detailed inner office mail, Comsquare Document Workflow Center, distribution of returned mail, and account look ups for damaged mail and accounts with no account numbers using SAP software."
good,"Over-all a great company to work for with great wages and benefits, but it demands lots of hours worked. It does not offer a very good work / life balance and the upper management consistantly micro-manages the work force."
good,"Great company to work for outside of call center, very demanding job, great people to work with, but personal life has to take a back seat"
good,"The plant that I work at started as a good place to work, but do to economic issues and the lower need for power, the plant is closing. Overall it's been a good experience."
good,"Unions do not belong in an office environment. They do not support and uphold the employee's individual needs and desire for expansion and growth within the company. Any advancement is based solely on seniority and not merit - in essence, you may have a 20 year employee in the same position out of comfortability that performs sub-par vs. a young vibrant employee who is enthusiastic and seeking advancement and performs above standard consistently; the senior rep will be offered any chance of advancement over the younger employee who outperforms the senior rep. Unions only get into an office environment when the employees are not well supported by upper management."
good,The working environment is somewhat toxic. No consideration is given to the opinions and knowledge of the employees in the field. The directives of managers is absolute and without discussion or redress.
good,A typical day was walking in and take about 80 phone calls a day. You handle a variety of calls from paying bills to relocating service. There is quality assurance and guidelines to follow for calls.
good,Perks of a large company like compensation and benefits. Struggle with employee retention and replacement due to change in unregulated business. Mixed company culture depends on department.
good,Working site protection requires a lot of hours away from family. The work/life balance is not good. Being forced to work over time is one reason why I am looking elsewhere for employment.
good,worked with agencies and NP organizations to provide electricity to those without the means to make consistence payments. work environment was above average.
good,Work experience has been relatively positive overall.  The company going through bankruptcy has definitely affected the morale and the day to day job satisfaction.
good,"This company is currently in bankrupcy.  Until they are through this process and a new company emerges, any reviews would be unfair.  I would choose to not comment, but Indeed won't let me."
good,"Work 12 hour swing shift"
good,Easy place to work. Co-workers are pretty easy to deal with. Pay is fantastic base and even more so when you pick up OT. Work has been unstable during the time of bankruptcy though.
good,The only thing i didn't like was the lunches and short breaks everything else was ok some of the employees were not for that environment overall the excitement and guests were amazing
good,Overall good experience at company.  Company policies were not always followed or were tempered to favor certain employees over other.  Job security was in constant question.
good,"A wonderful place to work , I handled calls from New Jersey to West Virginia. the Work place was a multi Culture area The Hardest part of the my job is when I run out of option helping a customer"
good,First Energy is a decent place to work if you are looking for a long term job.  Learn alot there and the environment is what you make it.  Hardest part of job is staying motivated.
good,There is no such thing as a typical day at work.  It can vary from 8 - 12 hours a day.  Middle management does not get paid overtime.  I learned that this is a highly stressful job.  I've seen a number of management styles throughout the years.  Some are better than others.  Right now the primary focus is on the company's bottom line with little consideration for work/life balance.  Workplace culture is generally good cooperation between people within a given department.  Sometimes it is very difficult to coordinate with other departments and groups.  The hardest part of the job is the expectation of near perfect performance all of the time.  The most enjoyable part is providing tools for people to move ahead and work within the facility in a safe and efficient manner
good,"Workplace benefits, work life balance, medical dental, vision, vacation, sick, management, employees, moral, vision, part time, full time, temporary, commission. 356 days and closed on holidays"
good,"First energy is a great place to work for, however trying to advance out of the contact center is meerly impossible. I want and need to advance my career, and feel like that is far from obtainable."
good,"fast paced job, great training, management was fair, long hours of mandatory overtime during special situations. public facing, good coworkers, adequate tools to complete job tasks"
good,Takes awhile to move up but other than that it can be fun be very fast paced. Management is helpful but it can be hard to get time with them. Customers can be very rude
good,"The job has good benefits but can be overwhelming at times. The job is sometimes overly structured... no time in between tasks. "
good,"We split off into groups of 6 or less and we begin cleaning the stadium from head to toe. "
good,"Overall good place to work. Currently very stressful due to changes in company. Management and supervision is inconsistent with expectations, which makes for a difficult environment sometimes. Enjoy the work and co-workers are great."
good,"For being a entry level engineer I get a lot of experience I didn't think I would get at another company at my current level. The management gives you a lot of autonomy when it comes to projects and day to day activities. This usually lead to working 60 to 70 hours weeks even multiple weeks in a row with no time off. For the amount of work you are given the compensation does not seem enough. Though first energy does have a good market competitive rate for each engineer level. However, their ""pay for performance"" policy doesn't really seem to be existent at the plant level. Over all its not a bad company to work for. You just have be mindful with your work/life balance."
good,"Not my favorite place to work. The customers I talked to on a daily basis were extremely rude and hard to deal with. They changed my position with no pay rate from Customer Service Rep to Billing Rep adding 75% more stress to my position. Also, I am allergic to bees and they had an infestation of bees in the building I worked in. They made me drive an extra 20 miles to another city to work. They had me and 15 others sitting a room that was hard to hear over the phone with no supervision to help employees with questions. Horrible!!"
good,Gather paper and plastic sweep pathways of peanuts and food and maintain clean restrooms on each floor make start from the top of the stadium and worker our way down the aisle ways towards the fields and pick up any trash
good,"I worked here for 5 years and ever since training, the top managers in the call center had it out for me. I was the type to show up 45 minutes early every day to set up my computer to be ready to take calls at the start of every shift, I stayed late when ever needed, I would go above and beyond for customers. I learned so much about electric and how to be energy efficient for my home which has helped me save money and allowed me to help customers. Fellow employees were always there to help when you are not able to find a supervisor who was willing to help because they were busy talking to each other or doing other things. For me, management would have quality monitoring go through every call I had and would find the worst calls to grade and would suspend me all the time. If you are not a pet for the supervisors and kiss butt, you will be no where fast. To anyone wanting a job here, be very careful and be on your toes. You do not get paid enough for what you have to go through."
good,"Provided me with the opportunity to gain an education and increase my skills in projects and management, from coordinator to supervisor to superintendent"
good,Short Staffed which leads to no work life balance and management does not recognize the problem. Need to work much unpaid overtime just to complete normal workload.
good,"A typical day at work involved communicating with customers in regards to their utility bills, and researching accounts. I learned patience. The management was ok but not to friendly, the co-workers were great. The hardest part was the mandatory 11 hour shifts during winter storms sometimes for 2 weeks straight with no days off. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers"
good,">sensible hours "
good,"Working at First Energy has been a learning experience for,  It is a very busy and fast paced job which required 100% dedication.  There is room for advancement and the potential for a long lasting career if you like working in a call center."
good,"Provided a stable income to raise my family,  35yrs I worked there without any regret. The hardest part of the job was shift work every week a different shift, most enjoyable was working along side with my fellow workers, There was a lot of interesting people I came in contact with."
good,"Fast paced, high stress job. Typical day requirements involve answering 60 + calls."
good,go to work go home management blows you just chase your tail all day long hardest part of the job is going to work nicest part is leaving there is a lot of favoritism
good,I really enjoyed my job here. As with any job it had its up and downs but a job is a job. The only part that I didn't like was the lack of communication between management and the reps everything was always last minute literally and no time to make arrangements or anything
good,"A fun interesting place to work, lots of over time, cooperative management, enjoyed working with coworkers, interesting people, hardest part of job was working during storms, most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships made"
good,If you are a temp they are very strict with time off.  I left due to them not being flexable with me
good,Supervisors do not communicate properly. Associates are not judged based on performance.
good,I have worked at First energy for approximately 39 years. This company has given me and my children good life. It‚Äôs very sad to see it end. FE is getting out of the generation. Unfortunately I work at a generating plant and I need to pursue another job
good,"Good place to work"
good,I work at FENOC and the pay is good but you are on call 24x7x365.  If plants are running well it is not a bad place to work but if anything happens you are expected to be at the plant to support.
good,"I priced natural gas for large corporations. On 9/11 my job was eliminated because we priced gas against the stock market, and the stock market crashed."
good,"I had wanted a desk job for a while, but a call center is not for me. Mandatory overtime to be yelled at with by the client is not my idea of a good time."
good,"In the position I have been able to excel but it has not been easy to maintain a work/life balance here, and it can be very stressful to meet the outlined stats required to meet our goals. The upper management team has tried very heard to make life at the job as fun for us as the can with the little tie that they can provide off the phone but we are under very strict time restraints to meet the demands  of the public utility commissions and that stress is handed down to the employees..."
good,First Energy has good job security with a good life/work balance.  The set schedule makes it easy to have a family life.  Different work groups are managed drastically different.
good,"The hiring process was very intensive, and I was very excited for this job. It's a very stable workplace (they need good phone reps) with plenty of overtime you can pick up weekly. I advanced quickly to the billing department. Unfortunately, being screamed at by customers over the phone took a toll on me pretty quickly. Customers would be immediately screaming at you when you answered the call, and there was really nothing you could do about it. You try to help them, but really, your job is to convince the customers that their bill is correct and they really do owe $_____ for electricity/their meter hasn't sped up/nobody is stealing their electricity. Also, it is nearly impossible to get time off. While you're still a temp (and you have to start as a temp), you basically sign up for 6 months with NO time off, period. Also, you only get a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks; not nearly enough to decompress and calm down before getting back on the phone again."
good,"The only good thing about this company is the pay and the benefits.  If the company does well, there is a bonus paid every March.  However, given the company's history of financial distress, the bonuses have been a few hundred dollars instead of a few thousand."
good,"employees are key to our success. We depend on their talents to meet the challenges of our changing business environment. We are committed to rewarding individual and team efforts through our total rewards philosophy which includes competitive pay plus incentive compensation, a company-sponsored pension plan, 401(k) savings plan with matching employer contribution, a choice of medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, and life insurance programs, as well as skills development training with tuition reimbursement. Please visit our website at to learn more about all of our employee rewards programs."
good,With the ever changing restrictions on emission and changing parameters in the coal industries the job security is starting to look bleak in the area  
good,"I enjoy customer service  some days where good most days customers were very nasty and rude "
good,"Very out od fate technology, mostly using oracle package software, and full of the contractor. The very slow pace you always depends on another person. Your salary s under market value"
good,Good Company to Work For.  Great atomosphere   Fun place to work.  Contribution to 401K is average.  I worked in a coal plant for FE and industry was dying so I moved on.
good,Not a lot of teamwork in the food department that I work in. But other deparments get treated better from what I hear. So I guess it depends on what your going for.
good,"Very dry culture.  Not fun, very standard, very boring business. Expectations are less than other companies, so not very challenging. But I am not an engineer."
good,"Strong safety commitment"
good,i never thought i could sell beer the way i did here i learned how to compete with others to get a sell co worker are very competitive the really hardest part of the job is selling your beer because theres so many other vendors out there with you but the best part of the job is counting up your tips before you leave
good,"Very fast paced call center, very strict on meeting statistics. must be able to multi task. must be able to work mandatory 16hr shifts at time. pay is great, however they do not work with you when it comes to school, you must put work before everything. prepare to come out in the rain sleet hail, and snow for this job, it is a requirement"
good,"50/50 split between work in the office and out in the plant.  Great place to experience all kinds of engineering (project, process, service, construction, etc).  Poor communication between all departments occasionally slowed project execution. Dependable and helpful co-workers."
good,"The company ended up closing the department that I worked in, so that's the reason I moved on."
good,i would be on the phone helping customers with electric move in/out and billing questions. Management was tough but yet very fair and with the company their extensive training is equisite. They do not let you fail in any way.
good,pay is great. 12 hour shifts suck. great benefits . closed down many nuke plants. people are good. forced to work on days off. work in the elements. follows a hurry up and wait attitude
good,"I typically start my day with logging on to the server to bring up all the systems I need to access. I answer credit calls, billing calls and also help to move customer in or out of properties. There are days when I do have new class memebers sit with me to get a feel for how a call should go and also see if they can get a cal flow and what should be accessed based on the call to better assist the caller."
good,"I loves this job. It was amazing. I was ready to make a career out of it. Took advice to field position and was bit by a tick and lymes disease while being a meter reader. Caused major physical end emotional issues. Was given FMLA and personal leave. However, not enough. Was extremely disappointed when I received the phone call that I was being let go. Devastated me. No one would take my calls. Managers, supervisors, and HR completely wrote me off. I really miss this. I live in WV and all answers came from corporate in OH."
good,"The management for my department is very good at what they do. The Manger and the more senior members of my department go out of their way to make you feel welcome and to help you learn new things. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job... learning how to cope with working long hours (especially during busy season) and depending on other departments for information in order to do our job. Each department has their own priorities and requests from other departments take a back seat. That happens sometimes in my own department, it's a side effect of being in Tax since it's always a hard deadline you're trying to meet. The best part of my job is... my co-workers and learning new things."
good,First energy is a well structured company that assists with resolving customer issues.
good,"this job was harder to get used to. there was a lot of chances for advancement within the company. most work was done on computers daily.,which the work was mostly sent to you by managers."
good,"It is a call center, which you take inbound calls regarding billing, outages, transferring of services or establishing new accounts. Very busy office."
good,"A very good company to work for, overall.  There was a concerted effort to encourage teamwork. "
good,Great Place to work! I was a contractor through a staffing company and I never got hired in permanent.
good,It was a temporary job with hopes of full time but there were never any openings while i was there.So i seeked other employment and got a full time job.
good,"FirstEnergy is a good company to work for. They do a good job of looking out for their employees and trying to allow them to influence the company's direction. "
good,Pay and benefits were very good. Management was very poor. They were always looking a way to get you in trouble. Security is the only department that is not unionized
good,"Atmosphere is good. If you're a contractor, be prepared to be underpaid. Work schedule is horrible if you want a social life or time to spend for family/friends."
good,"I Wish they can hire more sooner then 6 to 9 months. It's a great place to work, but they only give you 16 hours the whole time you are contracting with the company. It's not useful if you have kids and appointments."
good,"Working at First Energy has been a challenging and stressful experience at first but procedures have become second nature.  It is a face paced environment that requires the handling of situation according to rules and regulations established by the Public Utility Commission. The company intranet is a very useful resource in guidance and learning procedures required to accomplish tasks. Meeting the stats set by the company and the PUC is the most challenging part of the job.  It is a daily learning experience whether its a change in procedures, rules or regulation, or options available to the customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing, that at the end of the day, I was able to assist customers to the best of my ability."
good,Over the 21 years at First Energy I can honestly say it is up to  the individual to keep yourself safe. It is up to the individual to learn and progress. Its hard dangerous work at a utility.
good,Great place to work however during storm seasons you can work 12-15 hour days due to power outages. I did like it when it was a normal day but the keeping the stats at the beginning are very difficult to obtain but with time and practice you can make your stats very easily.
good,"First Energy is a well known company, offers a fair pay scale with raises each year, according to your production.  Great benefit package, and a great range of training."
good,"I sit at my desk and take calls all day. I have 2 breaks and a lunch, but am at my desk the rest of the time taking calls."
good,"Installing, repairing or replacing all types of electrical equipment from residential home drops to substations. Including poles, wire, and transformers, both underground and overhead. Management effectiveness depended upon their level of experience, because of the vast variety of work that was done."
good,"It was a okay job. I never felt like anyone wanted to really get to now any of the employees. It was strictly come in and do your job. The volume of calls is also really high, fast pace environment"
good,"No complaints, I went from the street to a Shift Supervisor in 11 years. Opportunity is there to move up if you apply yourself. I would recommend this company."
good,"this is a temp. job that is the reason for no benefits, they do offer benefits for their perm. employees. there is a gym on site and the people are very nice."
good,The union makes F.E. a pleasant place to work.  The pay is great and the safety standards are top notch. I would recommend this as a place to work for anyone.
good,"The company only hires through temp agencies, so they hire a lot of people at once and many do not make it through the process of getting hired by the company. It is a competitive process to be hired by company, attendance is a huge factor . It is a call center environment so it is fast paced with constant phone calls. The people who work there are all friendly and helpful for the most part."
good,"Contract only position."
good,A Typical Day At Work Was I Will Go To The Basement And Clock In To Begin My Day I Learned How To Mulitask Between Two To Three Lists Of Items Which Would Add Up To At Least To 100 Pounds Or More Management was Excllent My Co-workers were fun everyone worked very well together there were never any altercation the again there was no hard part to the job as long as u followed the items on the list with no problems the most enjoyable part about the job was I got a chance to see the players
good,Awesome company to work for. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement at this company. The company does offer overtime often which is nice for some extra compensation. Supervisors are very supportive.
good,"I was a customer service representative for just over a year.  Safety is a top priority for the company and they try to make working there fun.  It can be a stressful job and a good portion of your days are spent being yelled at on the phone,  However, often times the angry customers are just looking for an outlet and many customers do a 180 if you just listen and try to help them.  However, even if a customer is screaming at you or cussing you out, you can never hang up on them.  On-call is pushed on you but there's lots of great opportunities for overtime.  The pay is decent for what you do and the people are great."
good,This company is like a tight knit family and they operate at a very high level. Very experienced work force and they treat everybody with respect.
good,"Sometimes fun environment, but often long hours for only mediocre compensation unless middle or upper management. Definitely not enough to contribute significantly to cost of living if you have a family to take care of."
good,overall a great company great room for advancement and the support staff have a good labor union
good,"Good place to work but you were pretty much a number due to it being an Public Utility."
good,"answering incoming calls regarding power outages, billing questions, starting service, ending service, setting up payment arrangements"
good,"I am working as Design Engineer in company, I am designing all the parts in every new product development. All the parts are design with the help of CATIA V5 software.

good,"‚Ä¢	Developed a Win forms application in C# that manages the user roles, survey, rules and used it to pull out the profile placed from the SQL database using ADO.NET."
good,Worked for 12-13 sales reps as their secretary. Nice group of co-workers.
good,six and two work schedule.  Learned how to deal with personnel issues as well as operation of coal fired power plant.  Management and co-workers good.  Shift work and under staffing were main complaints.  Teamwork was the best part.
good,I worked 12 years for Allegheny Energy/First Energy.  11 years a shift worker from laborer to Shift supervisor.  I learned how to operate and run a 1700 megawatt coal fired super-critical power station.  I worked a six and two rotating schedule.  Management was supportive.  Co-workers were like family.  The hardest part of the job was the shiftwork and the small staff levels the last few years.  I liked the teamwork of the crew the most.
good,"on the phone from the time you get there till you leave.  due to the fact this is a electric company you tend to work long hrs if there are outages."
good,"Typically I would arrive at work early so I could read my e-mail and look over my schedule, then  I would begin taking phone calls at the start of my shift. Training was extensive and very helpful, it taught me everything I would need to know to perform my job duties, I learned about the utility industry and the ins and outs of electric companies. The supervisors, managers,and trainers are great! I have gotten to know all of then very well and they are very nice genuine professional individuals. My co-workers are great we have all  worked very closely together and work well as a team. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with angry customers, especially when there isn't much you I can do to satisfy them. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people in need, meeting new people and working in a professional enshrinement.   "
good,While working here I met nice people the only things to be careful of are calling off and you will do better if you ask questions and understand the process of computer tasks.
good,Would love to work for company again..its a very demanding job that requires open availability and it's not for someone with small children because you may be called away and they frown upon that .
good,"They said it was a merger....."
good,FE is a well-organized company that puts safety before performance and they put stock in their employees. I was given many opportunities for advancement and challenged with numerous difficult projects.  Unfortunately  the current energy market is not secure for deregulated markets which has plagued the industry.
good,"Very entertaining  work environment, employees and managers were very nice. I was a temp from @work personnel but wasn't treated any different all the employees  treated me as a regular employee."
good,Stressful environment because of all the different types of inquires you have to deal with during the day. Management is OK and they are willing to help you perform at your best.
good,"Did not understand why my contract was terminated due to a sudden problem from a past surgery. It took almost a month to get on a computer. Had to learn job on my own (with some help from co workers), since everyone was so busy fighting fires."
good,"Daily activities include preparation for instruction, instructing in both classroom and simulator.  Extra responsibilies include preparing documentation for license application and performing company representative for VA benefits for employees."
good,"This company offers a lot in the area of benefits and compensation.  There are some opportunities for advancement but even with a willingness to relocate, most moves are lateral in nature."
good,"the hours were bearable and the pay was good. couldn't complain, the environment was friendly. the only hard part, was gaining customers due to cold dater."
good,"Good recession-proof company. Not so great during severe outage conditions for anywher in the Midwest to East Coast. Mandatory 12 hour days during those outages and ""on-call"" 6-8 weeks out of the year (also mandatory)."
good,"normal round included boiler operations, trouble shooting and light repair, training employees and lower job classifications.  Lockout Tag out procedures, use of PPE, Job safety analysis"
good,I enjoyed going to work every day. My goal was to retire from this company. I was a very quick learner and there wasn't a job that I didn't enjoy.
good,was good place to work but constantly seeing people come then leave for wrong reasons. Overall some team members made you feel welcome and also made it fun to be around. I learnt some very good customer skills.
good,"i have learned about basics of sales techniques."
good,"Its a very fast pace changing envrionment. Difficult to keep up with all the changes. Not very much incentive but bonus and raises are nice. Most enjoyable part of the day are breaks. People here are nice, but can be vindictive and competitive. Management team is supportive but lacks empathy b/c of time gap between their transition from rep to manager."
good,"The energy consulting business was very challenging and wasw nationwide in its efforts. The business has evolved to hiring many ""friends and familly"" employees which makes it difficult for advancement"
good,good coworkers and people but hard to advance job wise - great benefits including pension and life insurance that you dont have to start paying for right away
good,I have been given the opportunity to be promoted within the company. They have assisted with growing my education and experience and have many programs to promote further learning and growth.
good,Great Job. Great people to work with. Horrible management. Didn't care or lookout for employees. Back stabbing and vindictive. Shouldn't be managing their own home.Find another department in this company to work for in this area. Manager will look to replace you right away.
good,"Dedicated, hard-working employees at this northwest Ohio power plant who are keenly aware of their responsibility to keep the public safe and the importance of producing nuclear power.  This facility has been the only place of employment for many people who work here.  While this makes for a comfortable place for those who are from this area, it takes a long time for those transplanted to feel truly part of the team."
good,"Good job. Must love being outdoors and walking to enjoy this job. "
good,"Type A to the end. Teamwork is required, Good group of co-workers, advancement is slow. Turnover is moderate. Nothing else to say."
good,Relatively quiet and kind of boring. Would like to have been in more active environment. People are nice for the most part but they are completely understaffed here. Tons of work with not enough people and nearly all employees are quickly approaching retirement.
good,i loved working for 1st energy as i picked up some really usefull skills that i can use in my future to gain further employment . a typical day at work would require mer to meet up with all of my team at the office and do some roll play / training to warm every one up before we go out on the feild . i recruited and trained 12 people to work to a high standard and learn all aspects of the feild and sales .
good,"I really loved working for Firstenergy, nothing bad to say about it. Only thing if you like a challenge, well this company is the place you want to be! Also you want to make sure you are the right fit for this job, because when you are call during emergencies you have to go so make sure you have a baby sitter if you have kids!  üëç"
good,Working with others on a team is very positive and everyone knows the importance of getting things done. Everyone is so kind and friendly always willing to help and learn more. Even the supervisors are awesome they really like to keep you engaged and do weekly pr bi-weekly check-ins.
good,"Great work environment, but uncertain future for jobs or advancement.  Very helpful co-workers, responsive supervisors, flexible with time off from work."
good,"As an intern they covered my rent since I had to relocate. All other employees were willing to help ant way they could. However, there was no way for me to apply for full time employment internally."
good,"this was a temporary job I found out about while working another job. First Energy is a nuclear power plant.  You needed to go through intense security and background checks, because it is like working for the goverment. The pay was good, I would have loved to have been able to be hired on with them full time."
good,"Very family oriented working atmosphere, great team leaders and lots of help with training and while you were on the floor as well. Great company to work."

good,"I retired from First Energy. Everything went fine. I made money and supported my family. Thats what counts, I miss my coworkers and many of the clients."
good,"It was a nice work environment, but limited availability for advancement. Security was not extremely important from what I noticed. Security was mainly suited to assist company employees over actually security measures,"
good,"My typical work day included work related duties based on the project I was assigned.  I worked with clients to improve their processes with automated systems and efficiently designed databases. I also helped them with daily operations as needed, troubleshooting, data entry.

Management speaks to you as a responsible individual and let's you get your work done without watching your every move. Taking a walk to brake away from sitting at your desk, there is a kitchenette where you could catch up on the weather or refill your coffee. I learned more CAD programs and how to managed the company's data."
good,"If you can stand alot of heat and pressure,and had a thick skin, this the place for you. Compensation was very good."
good,"I enjoyed working for them while I was employed. I cannot say I really liked the job that much just because it wasn't necessarily for me. If you like being on the phone all day and doing the same thing every day as well as repeat yourself a hundred times then this might be for you. It's a day job which is great and your schedule doesnt really change. Overall I really liked the company, the hours, the pay,  I just didnt like the actual job."
good,Good company to work for. Really like it. Make sure tht you are on time. Full pension. Good benefits. Flexible schedule when needed. Easy advancement opportunities.
good,FirstEnergy Treats their interns very nicely. They prepare you for a permanent position after your final rotation. Unfortunatley the company just downsized generation so that was not the case for me.
good,"Great diversified group."
good,"Overall ""team"" atmosphere.  Some room for advancement but mostly for ones in the 21-35 age group.  Great group of people and well diversed company.  Good company to work for."

good,This job was taking calls from a variety of customers: everything from starting electric service to billing to outages to special requests. Most work was completed on the computer but some required paperwork follow-up.   Management help and assistance was very good but the need to be fast paced was stressful at times. I retired .

good,"Mid-level sales managers are amazing, but top-level management as well as expectations are often arbitrary and seemingly unjust.  However, all things considered, a very good place to work."
good,"I really enjoyed my co-op experience with the company, but what department you end up in really can make or break the experience. Pay is great for cost of living in the Greensburg area, and though this necessitates the occasional commute to Ohio, the location to me was a far better fit and worth that drive. The people I worked with were friendly and supportive. However, I personally felt a bit understimulated."
good,"It is a great place to work, relaxed work environment, friendly and helpful co-workers. The members of the management are very accessible and helpful."
good,Still pretty New but after reading other replys figured Id give my take!!  With this job you will earn every penny!!   Lots of walking and plenty of hazards with Dogs of all sorts allllll the time!!  If your thinking of getting a job well thats great but if your not the working hussling type dont bother!!  This is a true Blue Collar job!!  No time for day dreaming or slackers here...on your toes constantly!!  Ive met some good people and personally I have no problems with management for the most part...Best part is most managers have done their time in the trenches and actually know what their talking about!!  Another plus part of the job is your pretty much out there on your own all day so got no one to blame but yourself!!  Not to thrilled about beating my vehicle up with minimal compensation other than gas mileage.  I feel the pay is outstanding and not alot of mandatory OT so definitely a family mans dream job!!
good,"I truly enjoyed working for this company. I had a terrific supervisor and very friendly and helpful co-workers. My level of responsibility increased at a comfortable pace. Management did a good job of helping when needed but also leaving you to do your job when that was needed as well. The hardest part of the job is learning terminology and becoming qualified. In order to perform just about any task in a nuclear power plant, one must be qualified. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxed atmosphere when the plant was operating smoothly."
good,Good people to work with; management good but can micromanage sometimes. Hardest part of the job is trying to get answers to many questions if you are new. Most enjoyable part of the job is that it is a fulfilling working environment.

good,A typical day at work can be challenging. I learned a lot about electricity and the usage. Management was very professional and always willing to help. The workplace environment was very friendly. The hardest part of my job was telling customers that I was unable to help if they ran out of options such as obtaining other payment plans. The most enjoyable part was able to help others and knowing I did my job well.
good,"A typical day at work started at 8 am which means at 8 am you are ready to take your first call, not just walking in the door at 8 am. There was mandatory over-time a lot of days so we'd to be prepared before hand. When we did have to work overtime management made sure we had a good meal and anything else we needed to get the job done. Management had a open door policy which was a good thing.Our call center consisted up to 200 employees. My company was one of the best companies I ever worked for, They took care of there employees. Which is probably was employed with them for 14 years."

good,"I worked for First Energy for 21 years. I went through several mergers which all went fairly smooth. The company is secure. The harmony comes from within the tight knit family of employees who work amazingly together. The work conditions are good considering you work 24/7 in most departments for storm restoration work. Company records are well documented and information is easy to obtain to preform your job accurately and safely. The work was fast paced and challenging. They offer a reasonable bonus programs, overtime and raises. There is a common respect between the Management and Union employees as a group. There is not allot of movement which is good for job security and knowledge. You can advance through the company just at a slower pace. Management does have to rebid their own jobs every few years and can get relocated but usually does not impact family life or relocation. You have the option if you are in Management to relocate to various States if you so desire."

good,"Great place to work for!  The only thing I could think of to improve First Energy, would be to offer Journeyman Credentials as well as proper certificates for trainings completed."
good,Management is wonderful in the Meter Reading department. You are expected to do a full days work and you are compensated well for the work you do. The company has a great focus on safety and realizes that it is important for an employee to remain safe and uninjured. This ideology works very well for both the employee as well as the employer.
good,"It was a very interesting place to work.  I was only a temp but getting to see how a nuclear power plant operates was amazing.  Pay was fantastic, hours were amazing, and there was so many different things you did day to day."
good,"A typical day consisted of me and an operator performing a walk down of the turbine side or the boiler side. When needed operators needed to perform general maintenance; such as, a drain cooler was clogged, so me and my operator had use a steel rod to shove through the hundred+ holes in the drain holes until the water in the drain cooler started to drain the remaining water. I learned the power plant was more than just a tiny box with lines traced on a piece of paper, I learned how to distinguish between components; such as, a condenser, a coal bunker, an economizer, etc... Plus, the operator taught me how to trace lines. Management was nice, they were helpful, they for the most part allowed the workers perform their jobs with little interference, but were there if things went wrong. The co-workers were amazing, they answered any questions I had and they would take time out if their downtime (breaks) to walk me through my sytems I needed to know for classwork. The hardest part of the job was feeling helpless at times, at the beginning of the internship the company set guidelines on what type of work we were allowed to perform, so when there was things I seen the operator struggle with I fealt like I should have been doing more. The most enjoyable part of the job was the various weather conditions, I would walk down the boiler side where the temperatures were extremely high, then walk down the turbine side where the breeze from the outside would cool you down it was a refreshing feeling."
good,FirstEnergy is a fantastic place to work for individuals who have a serious work ethic and are committed to being there.  Attendance is mandatory but the benefits are definitely worth it.  I worked there for 17 years and I can not say enough good about the environment.  Safety is a Way of Life and it shows as they are employers who truly care about their employees.  Thank you FirstEnergy for all you had done to help support me and my family through those years.
good,"A typical day at the Beaver Valley Power Station was very busy, involving meeting, work planning and oversight.  Management expectations were that we ""plan the work and work the plan.""
