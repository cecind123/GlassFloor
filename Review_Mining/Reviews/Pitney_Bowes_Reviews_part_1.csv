rating,review
bad,"It was a simple position but the coworkers were rude and gossiped a lot! Don’t like that environment. It’s been years, hopefully they changed their ways."
bad,"Porque hay que levantar unas bandejas llenas de carta y aveces pesan más del peso que ellos dicen que tiene, también limpiando los bones uno se lastima los hombros y las manos ."
bad,"Unfair management if you’re not in, In crowd you’re not In. Very unprofessional!!  You give your All and they Hate it. Some Drivers are paid more, CDL B Drivers are paid less!!"
bad,"a typical day is a day that something new is found and dealth with, also delivering what is needed and ask for.  "
bad,"Pitney-Bowes does care about their employees, only the bottom line.  Rather strange system of evaluation for performance appraisals. They used surveys for just about everything. They surveyed the customers to determine if the service was good but didn’t take into account the customers had they wrong equipment"
bad,"Not a good place to work. Horrible management, low pay, expectations that did not make the pay worth it. Which is why they sold the division to another company."
bad,"The worst! "
bad,"Pros: Monday- Friday, no weekends or holidays. Benefits are amazing."
bad,Management was poor and communicating was almost impossible with PR.I was supposed to be paid a shift premium and was never paid the shift premium and when I asked the supervisor to put it on the computer he would not do it for me
bad,"Outdated and ill-maintained hardware, operated via cumbersome, beta-like buggy software, communicating on an undependable and slow network."
bad,"Purposely trying to get rid of senior people to hire others for less pay. Micro management, reduction of portfolio accounts while double monthly goals. Reducing commissions and overall ability to make money even though quote doubled. Too many chiefs who do not listen to their employees. In a declining industry and using leverage in the wrong ways. While their employees make less and less money the executives make more and more. They need new decision makers and not fire the people that actually have been there long enough to know how to navigate and help clients. Customer service is extremely awful. Disconnection between each department, person, and clients. I would not recommend any business to do business with PB."
bad,"Be prepared to be forced into sales.  They start out acting like it is just a tech job, but will eventually force you to do sales and meet objectives.  The management does not care how good of a tech you are if you can not sell for them."
bad,"This place is terrible. Bad working environment. Sometimes no toilets, company needs to invest in they employees. Managers, supervisors are incompetent."
bad,Poor management hot under staffed nice people crappie restroom and break room unorganized attire comfortably not too stressful smoke area okay lunch break
bad,"it was a very stressful job, you are always in a hurry, running around chasing the mail, make sure everything has their correct label before sending it out,"
bad,"No raise."
bad,"Poor management skills employees know more then the managers "
bad,My last supervisor treated me as a no body even though the manager for the company that we were contracted for saw potential in what I could do.  The company as a whole didn't want to advance.
bad,"Very,very,poor management,like to show partiality, it was sickning.would not give you a raise when it was due,the owner of the company wouldnt help me"
bad,"Poor management,racism,favoritism, "
bad,the company will never move you up. you stay in the same position for as long as you stay employed there. i was with the company for 6 years and had one raise. i had to work a second job to survive. but its my fault because i got to comfortable working there. Monday thru Friday. weekends off you couldnt beat it
bad,Culture is unprofessional.  No support from management and extremely low pay with limited training.  Benefits are horrid compared to other orgs in this market.
bad,"The shift is good. Management is TERRIBLE!! They are rude, condescending and cynical. Supervisor talks about employees personal business to other employees. Pay is low for amount of work expected. The company cheats workers out of overtime hours by cutting hours one day and requiring work on another. They lie about schedule to get you in the door. 1st shift is the only shift required to work Saturdays. Point system is RIDICULOUS! Doctor notes do not excuse points for absence. No bonuses. In order to get considered for employee of the month you have to do OPTIONAL stretches in huddle meetings!! Overall turnover rate is AWFUL!! DO NOT WORK HERE!!!"
bad,The job was fine it wasnt for me i guess.  I was kind of young and didnt realy know what i wanted at the time.  Im now look for a job similar but maybe a little less stressful
bad,Management was more interested in share holder value than actually supplying customers with useful products. Work was done in agile SLC. People were nice.
bad,"Pitney Bowes was once a good company to work for, but went down the hill quickly.  Let a lot of good people go that made a difference.  Company is not what it used to be."
bad,"PB is all about how many outbound calls you can make. They do not value their employees nor length of employment. They will threaten to terminate anyone at anytime.  Zero HR support. "
bad,"Lot of work with not a lot of training, was only making min. wage for lot of work, then if anything went wrong they would not correct it until a couple of months down the line"
bad,This place was horrific and they were not sympathetic to any cause. I was given a promotion and then it was taken away. Many lies were told as to the reason why.
bad,"Road warrior.  Leasing office equipment to businesses. Unfortunately, Mail is changed dramatically over the years.  They are not keeping with that times.  Less and less businesses need to seen out large mailings.  Leases  start at 18mons.  Making it even more difficult to sigh new clients."
bad,"poor management, senior tech/ site coordinator, plays childish games, literally tries to make the other techs look bad, always takes credit and never shares information. He convinced the regional manager to come in and ""straighten out"" all the problem techs. He came in and hollered at us then he got pushy with two techs, they were let go with a 10k severence package. everyone else is still there"
bad,Everyday we were doing the same thing and this job was very stressful. The management was very bad and the workers in there were poorly trained to do the job. I Learned how mail was organized before being delivered out. This job is just so hard to describe and explain....There is too much to talk about and even think about...
bad,"I loved it. Great pay. Dippy management. Antiquated rules. Good benefits from day one.Great hours. Easy work. It was completely unethical, though. PB coerces clients into buying too many supplies, upgrading postal equipment and extending contracts long before a contract expires. It's a shady company. But a good place to make money."
bad,Lays techs off constantly while promoting managers and CEO's. Hardest part of the job is dealing with managers. Clients are great. Work hours are fine.
bad,"Pick & pack used equipment and/or printing machines to prepare them for shipment once"
bad,"This was a very stressful job.  Good training was given but once you hit the floor there are too many systems needed to find answers for your customers.  The lower tier team is in another country, makes the customer angry and then cold transfers them to my team.  Worst of all, when we had a question we needed help with we put a red cup up on a stick at our desk and waited endlessly for help.All the while knowing my calls are timed and recorded.  Call centers are awful."
bad,"Good company to work for. Great benefits, but horrible client service. I enjoyed working there, but they have a different view on curtain people. I have seen people miss a lot more days then me and still they are there. Yet I got let go for it. So they are a bit discriminating, and also not willing to listen to you"
bad,Very hostile company that is not recommended. Treatment of employees is deplorable. I would not recommend working here. I am very disappointed in this company.
bad,It was an okay job not enough money for all that wear and tear on your body better pay would have made the job a little better with benefits and 401k benefits
bad,Has the potential to be a good place to work. The things I would change would be the management and to carry out work orders. I think they (Shift lead's especially) could treat their employees with a little more respect. Especially employees who are just starting out.
bad,"Be prepared to answer behavioral interview questions. For example, How would you react if you were asked to do something against company policy? What are the steps you take if we're to work with a team to complete a task? How do you work with difficult could workers? ETC it was ten of those type of questions."
bad,I did not enjoy working with this company. Management was terrible. HR very unprofessional. Managers act as if they were confused. Most work sites were very unorganized.
bad,"not a good place for extended career"
bad,"Non-Applicable. no longer in the industry of Mail services"
bad,Not a good place to work. No advancement within the company. No raises given. Not nice people to work with. Food in the cafe not that great. Location from metro not convenient at all.
bad,They made empty promises.. no raises after 5 years of service and still no raise  no promotions..showed a lot of favoritisiam
bad,"They are now called Novitex. Their management is poor, depending on the manager at each site. They do not promote within, usually they feed that to employees, but hire new from outside when they have openings. Their pay is below average, and ultimately do not even want to offer full time jobs to avoid paying benefits and related expenses. While I worked for them they never did Christmas or any other similar holiday celebration for employees."
bad,"I really don't want to say anything negative about this place because I am currently looking for a better paying job.  There hasn't been raises in over 7 years.  I have a better relationship with the clients that I do with my co-workers, the reason being that the further it looks like I'm moving up the harder it is to see who your friends are.  Realistically you can't have friends when you are bypassing them."
bad,I love working with people and learning new things. All the mail has to be perfect before I put it in the mail tray. I enjoy seeing  the 18 wheeler drive up and unload their trucks of mail that means more work for me. I love to stay busy.
bad,worked in call center . the company is past its time. its very outdated and they expect you to retain customers in a lost business
bad,Awful place to work. Never again. No communtion.Didn't have any training. Left me by myself on second day on the job. I learned nothing. I have been working for 38 years.Only had 2 jobs in all those years and never experience what I did at pitney bowes.Terrible. Only lasted 3 days. Would not recommand pitney bowes.
bad,Not one of the best places I have worked at. Poor management. Very strict.Horrible to employees.
bad,"I was a temporary worker in the Madison, WI location. I didn't mind doing the work, but after reading some of the other reviews at other locations, the same environmental factors are in place. A racially divided, uncaring management, totally hostile environment. Loud machines, territorial about where they sweep the mail, unfriendly to new people who could potentially work for the company, no wonder it's a revolving door around there. I lasted a couple months, most new people last a day. Oh ya, a 10 minute break in a 9 hour day? Hummm."
bad,"I have nothing to say. I am glad that I have a job. My favorite aspect of the job, is learning more about my industry of mail presorting."
bad,"consider your self before you make decision to work at this company,i had inappropriate experience for 5 years .i wish i did something else instead of this.you regret yourself. not worth it."
bad,Terrible place to work. Period! No chance for advancement. Only if you're showed favoritism amongst management you'll always be where you started when you come in the door.
bad,The company was great the training was very detailed and the people were very helpful and if there was a mistake that was made they were good at coming to you letting you know you made mistake
bad,"This place is terrible, no money , $18hr to start, and penny raises every year no matter how great a job you do no overtime, start times can be 4am or 2pm thru the week never the same, except for a few special drivers. Benefits and medical...So complicated it should be criminal, dont have a medical problem or you will owe thousands. Thats what you have to pay out first and then new year starts and you have to pay it out again. Pay the workers minimum money like sweatshop pay, I dont know why people put up with this.  "
bad,"Pitney Bowes has good people, except for one person.  The manager that hired me should not be in that position.  He is an ignorant disrespectful bigot."
bad,The company is probably fine to work for but the manager I had was a complete monster. He used one of the lawyers credit cards to fix his own car and tried to get me fired after I went to HR about some of his daily activities
bad,"Pitney Bowes has no structure, not a good training program and you have to be very good friends with the super to make it there."
bad,"PB does NOT value it's current employees, preferring to hire outsiders from IBM and other so-called prestigious consulting firms."
bad,This company only takes care of how to profit and nothing for the associates!!!
bad,"When I took the job I was assured that I would get a $1.00/hr pay increase after 90 days, which I did get.  I was also promised a yearly increase of $1/hr which I have not received even though I have been on the job over 2 yrs and have NEVER called in sick or been late.  I rarely see my manager, he is usually at one of the other sites and there are times when I am required to go to another location (not a location I was hired to work at) but not let my location know.  PB seems more interested in billing the company for workers they are not supplying then paying the workers who are working."
bad,"They hire Americans to start, have us train the illegals, then kick us to the curb. They rather have cheap labor then quality american employees"
bad,coworkers do not get along customers are mean and they cut your pay
bad,"Worst place I ever worked for."
bad,"Lots of drugs and alcohol problems, with the supervisors and managers.  One manager was fired for being an alcoholic and another manager for sexual harassment.  Crystal Meth found in the supervisors room.  Mail hidden and thrown away.  One manager takes kickbacks from his employees.  Cover ups of accidents. Lying to employees about employment law.  Overcharge customers.  Intimidation, bullying. "
bad,No proper training manual.
bad,"What ever you do dont work here; transportation department stinks; manger favors certain people and the other people get pushed aside and get cruded hours. alot of people quit after a month cause of management. there is no benfit about this job that it stinks, transportation department is all drama. people who made mistakes so many times should have been fired and havent been are the bosses little pets and than if another person has one mistake and dont kiss up to the boss gets put on a year probation right away."
bad,"The facility In Plainfield lacks management, leadership, and integrity. Employees are harassed, bullied, threatened and verbally abused on a daily basis. Material expiditers lack the knowledge of the job and refuse to help employees and create a violent work place. Management refuses to address these issues and rewards and coddles those who have done wrong. Serious accidents have happened inside facility and are never reported. Horrible company. Horrible management. Horrible leadership. Don't see this facility lasting much longer. Someone is going to get hurt and they don't care. I left with my knowledge to be used for a company that respects its employees. A company with integrity. Pitney Bowes goverent solutions does not have any."
bad,"what can I say? Nothng good. Poor management, poor working conditions, no respect, no chance of advancement. Many of staff were browbeaten for wanting more out of their work environment. You were blocked at every turn when you hoped to expand yourself or potental."
bad,i learned computer skills also shipping experience got along great with co workers enjoyed the job but got laid off cause work is too slow.
bad,After working there for 5 years it took a downward slide-compensations benefits were offered once met then they were taken away
bad,"They are very old-school when it comes to managing employees. You are expected to work long hours, with no overtime compensation. They don't encourage over-time, but they schedule work so that you have no choice but to work or you'll be written up for not completing your assigned work."
bad,it was okay job managerment was unfair this job is for anyone that dont want to exceed in life the pay is not good
bad,"no structure inside the company, no chance for growth and no concern for the employee at all"
bad,This company used to be great but as of the last 5 years it has rapidly deteriorated. It is ruled by an iron fist approach from the top execs who are very out of touch with the everyday operations and employee well being..
bad,"A co-worker harassed me, berated me at my work station for nothing!!! I told the manager but nothing was done. I heard later on that he was the manager's pet and that was so discouraging to me, especially being black in a work environment where the people in charge are white males who don't even care I quit a few days later. I had forseen that it was now gonna be a hostile work environment."
bad,"Serious problems between managers and supervisors,mistreatments to the employees are daily basis ,Job security is none. Favoritism is on the whole company.."
bad,This company thinks the product is more important than the employees. Tried to force drivers to drive in blizzards and other hazardous conditions. I wouldn't recommend this job to any drivers.
bad,"Great people and a great solution just need a better focus and pricing, it’s all over the map.  Great solutions and lack of focus, plant managers run the show.  One Monday morning the VP of sales and the regional managers of sales were called by the SVP and fired as they were getting ready to board planes and make calls, not hint of any re-.org not a good business model and as they struggle what market share they can via acquisitions"
bad,"I've worked here for some time now, and I use to love my job but now this would be the last place on Earth I would recommend someone to work. This place sucks. I hate working here. If you're not sleeping with someone in management you are public enemy #1."
bad,Never would recommend to anyonecuthroat teams and no imagination in management.  Management only focuses on money.  Company is contracting and career advancement is nonexistant.
bad,"Management is more concerned with stuffing their own pockets and leaving work early, leaving all the entry level positions to do overtime. Pickers get screwed regularly, having to work extra hours doing other positions jobs while said positions get to leave early. Stalmark pays 14.44 an hour as a temp agency but full time hire ons get 12.00 and worse paid time off rates and overall benefits. Management has no problem with their own sexually harassing others and will only punish the victim."
bad,"*poor management"
bad,"This job is physically demanding, overly so.  It is very fast paced, sometimes unmanageably fast.  Training is horrible.  And almost all pre-sorters are crabby and unfriendly as well as talking about everyone else.    This is not a long term job.  I would not recommend the pre-sort job to any friends for family. Maybe there are better departments, but not in the warehouse."
bad,"At PB, two types of people exist. Those that barely do anything, and those that support the weight of the world due to others lack of participation."
bad,If you want to work 80-100 hours per week on salary this is the place for you. Poor support from management for existing products and a tendency to drive for products which are glamorous but not thought out. Lots of good people have left.
bad,Very cut throat everyone thinks that everyone else is out to get them. No cohesion or team work and no trust just fake smiles and hand shakes. Management delegated their responsibilities to their employees that didnt need to be in their employees daily jobs.
bad,"If you want to be talked down to and yelled at constantly. No real world compensation, no advancement and deal with very poor managers then this is the place for you"
bad,"Sales organization layered -- results with too many sales persons in a deal?  Product-focused."
bad,Not a very nice company to work for....treat employees horrible
bad,We're to start way under payed you only get 0.20 raise yes it's true if you're from a nother country they treat you good if you're a us Born here watch yourself there are some good people and some not so oh don't go on 3rd shift in levittown pb I say this they have no idea what there doing corporate sucks so don't be dum like me and stay 10 years
bad,"Poor pay, poor treatment.  Highly unprofessional work environment.  Management was not cooperative with family life needs.  You will work every holiday and make around 40k yearly."
bad,"Constant layoffs... never knew if you were ""on the list"". Managers would mute calls and call employees bad names. No on wanted to work on projects. I was constantly rebuilding relationships in a married environment."
bad,Okay so they are the most unprofessional people I have ever worked for. The management never are on the same page and they treat you like your just a number. They don’t manage you nor listen to your calls to make you a better representative they are awful. And it’s unequal pay for everyone. People have been working there for 3 years and only make $11 while others just started in the same role and make 14
bad,They promised lots of things and did not follow through on anything. Manager would tell me one thing then sent a note to SR tech telling me something else. very confusing. I would not work here and i would not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,I can not in good faith recommend this job to anyone.  In the last 5 days 7 people quit.  Avoid this company like the plague.  Seriously you will regret working here.  Location York PA
bad,Pitney Bowes is horrible I worked their and loved my job. Then I accidentally. Grabbed the wrong phone on my way out of work and they treated me like a theif. I trusted the company to do an investigation and clear me to come back to work but instead they let me and my husband go. I've went as far as offering to take a polygraph to prove my innocence. At pitney Bowes your guilty no matter what don't ever trust in this company to do the right thing because they'll screw you over and it won't matter if your innocent They don't care...
bad,that place only promotes you if your friends with upper management and they change their schedule to often and make you work mandatory overtime so you barely get to spend time with your family. the supervisors are all mostly lazy they sit down and depend on the leads to do everything. they have no integrity what so ever and the pay sucks compared to other warehouses in the area
bad,"All the work, you have to do, dose not add up to the pay being a presorter is a very low pay, Mangerment is very poor, they are all for them self,then they give you points, if you call off, or if you late they want a 24 hr notice if you not coming to work & if you go to the doctor & have a doctor statement you still get points..its Jack up, no advancement, unless they like you, not off your hard work, management needs to be replace, including the Lead with people that care about their workers, & get an Increase in our pay!!"
bad,They monitor everything you do. Give you 5 minutes of personal time then scream at you for using any of it including using the bathroom.  Robbing clients  blind.  Most unethical company I have ever worked for.  Charge late fees on invoices that weren’t paid late and only fix those that call/chat to complain.  Company is a sinking ship.   Sending all account support jobs overseas seas.  Wouldn’t suggest a job at Pitney Bowes to my worst enemy!!!
bad,"There was nothing I liked about this company. They treated the employees terribly and very inconsistently. Certain departments they were too lax and wouldn't hold people accountable, while others would have to work overtime without breaks and or shorten lunches without notice. Management was generally terrible. Most were very rude for no reason."
bad,"A dying industry that is constantly trying to reinvent itself - postage meters are becoming a thing of the past.  PB has adopted a very strict and non-flexible call center environment to create a workforce that will work for peanuts and pedal what remains of 20 year old equipment.  This might be OK for someone just entering the workforce and doesn't know any better, but seasoned professionals should look elsewhere."
bad,"I had been working with NOC / PSG/ TechCentral department  of Pitney Bowes pune office, it was a horrific experience working there, i am lucky that i could step out from there soon, Sharing this info so can be helpful to career oriented people to avoid taking the big wrong step in their career and life. People out there BE CAREFUL  if you are joining their NOC / PSG / Techcentral team at their Pune office. Its actually a Call center environment, if you are joining this department please be ready for getting a call center type of treatment. Local manger of the department is good in creating gaps between the local team and higher management just so that his job is secured, he dosent has mangerial skill nor work skills or ethics no humanity, no respect, just has a call center experience.  due to his such behavior not a single team member trusts their own team members and its all because of the politics and the Call center management trying to get implemented there."
bad,Very boring and dry place to work. No collaboration and nothing fun about working there at all.  Company has all new management. All new employees and mostly from old IBM employees.
bad,I work at the Levittown facility as a presorter. The company hires temps mostly out of Trenton New Jersey and most don't speak a word of English ( mostly Hatians) not being racist but it's very hard to communicate. The job its non stop sorting mail at a ridiculous pace. The traing you get the first week is useless because the temps come in without any training and make numerous mistakes but you get blamed for it because you work for the company. On top of all this your never going to make 40 hours a week they make sure you only get 37.50 plus mostly there isn't any work for a full week you get told there's no work tomorrow at the last minute after they told you on the beginning of the shift to hustle that there's a lot of work on the floor......I see this company going out of business in the near future ( the mailing facilities due to the technology of today)
bad,a typical day at work there was no opportunity for growth. i learn that everyday is the same as the last one. it was hard on the state of mind.
bad,This company doesn't cares about their employees at all. they hold people back because management is scare of change.
bad,"Not very good management.  No one is held accountable, no one takes responsibility.  Someone else is always blamed.  Management micro-manages and so everything is do as I say and not as I do.  Safety is optional."
bad,"You will spend hours amongst hours with little to no management support, you'll find yourself working 3 shifts in one day (on a very low salary) with no upper management support.  Managers can expect to work 3 shifts with no team leads or talent otherwise to move the company forward because of pure exhaustion and frustration.  The pay was below the median pay for the area despite accomplishments presented to leadership with a request to be brought to at least the median income.  The request was denied and I eventually had to move on to support my family and maintain a more efficient work/life balance. Very hostile work environment."
bad,"my experience was bad overall,pushy,mean manager,too stressful,too fast for so lilttle people used per machine"
bad,"Strategic Planning | Budgeting | Process Development | Safety | Compliance | Inventory Management | Implementation, Management | New Construction | Cost Reduction | Purchasing | Vendor Management | Maintenance Scheduling"
bad,I couldn't wait to leave. Management is always looking for reasons to write you up. No one ever is able to meet requirements in annual reviews to get raises or promotions. Got wrote up for using sick days. Got wrote up for authorized time off. Very bad company! Run Away Fast!
bad,"The management was underhanded and lied all the time, very petty, horrible management skill."
bad,my job and that of my entire team was sent off shore with little regard to how it affected the individual or their family. Profits before people was the policy and the norm.
bad,"Management logs how much time and how many calls you respond to per day as a measurement of productivity.  Customer calls sometimes vary by customer depending on information customer is requesting, which prevents employee from meeting daily requirements.  Company should set other ways to determine productivity."
bad,If your salary can be cut to save money the company would. The company played office politics more than if looked out for its good hardworking employees.
bad,The company needs to either update or correctly fix their operating machines in order for them to run properly.  The staff can be hostile and unpleasant.  Teamwork can vary on a daily basis.  The company strives for that but usually does not occur.  The benefits are good and keeps employees from leaving.
bad,Very stressful and things is always changing. And you don't have a voice. If you speak there will be retaliation. So don't talk just work. The leads has control of everything. They have there picks .You can't advance unless you be quite. The management team needs to be clean up .And a need staff need to come .This job control your life
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone, very stressful, customers very rude, not helpful, no help from co-workers, left by yourself to fend off the animals"
bad,"Working with the the coworker was great. But the manager was a piece of work. No clue about printing. Confused about print jobs. Had anger issues. Unprofessional and self centered. Left the job, and was hired immediately with another company."
bad,Serious lack of leadership and direction. HR is a nightmare...this is a VERY liberal company and needs a stronger backbone. Employees run rapid over management...
bad,The day is very stressful and for the money really not work it as far as working there. Even if you are a producer it is not enough. There is no enjoyment in this job at all.
bad,"2016, $12.50/Hr , with management communicating yearly that there will be no cost of living increased, as a contracted Receptionist at Microsoft, is not a livable, sustainable wage."
bad,"Working at Pitney Bowes was always a challage , employees not working together, very hot in the summer time, no AC. Being paired with employees who don't pull their weight. Management sucked the hardest part of the job was doing your work and others.  It's also a Hostile work environment, you file a complaint and nothing gets done about it. Employees using profanty whenever they want and not held accountable for it. There was nothing good about working at Pitney Bowes."
bad,"Excellent strategic direction from the senior US management but poorly executed locally. Budgets generally unachievable and, therefore, a culture of failure and acceptance thereof. Local (country level) management unwilling to give real situation feedback to group and constantly massaged facts to present a positive view. The end result being a constant cycle of over optimistic forecasts and disappointing results."
bad,"Pitney Bowes is not for individuals with proven skills looking for advancement into mid/senior management.  Closed network for upward opportunities-old boys and more recently old girls power plays.  Compensation is not equally distributed among achievers, politics play too much of a role at PB   Customers should also take notice of what they are paying for"
bad,"At first, Pitney Bowes was good. After being a temp for 9 months, getting hired, I quickly moved to Dispatch side of production. After a year of busting my butt and working hard and more than anyone, I moved to Lead. 6 months of being a lead, and it went downhill. Management only cares about the production number at any cost. Leads are held accountable for all problems and no problems actually gets solved, just pushed aside."
bad,"This job was beneficial, they let me go after 16 years, without any explanation basically. I did love my job. Very hard worker, reliable. I miss it. The benefits are great."
bad,hours was great not to far from home didnt care for the work environment and no raises no room for growth work load was not balanced between workers making it difficult for everyone involved
bad,"I tried to Plan Organize Staff Direct and Control, while creating a SAFE productive environment.  I was terminated for pursuing these objectives versus getting recognition and promotions."
bad,"PB is not an uplifting environment. "
bad,"Everyone that steps through the door of this place within the first month or so already wants to move on to other employment. Unless your a favorite of management, you have no chance of promotion."
bad,Years ago this was a nice company to work for. Anyone looking for a job currently I do not reccommend you take this one.
bad,bad company management is terrible. This is a company that dont take care of there workers. This job needs a union very bad.
bad,work here only if you out of work very poor upper management good people to work with
bad,"The management @ the site that I worked was on a power trip. he had a bad attitude when it came to work. He had his pick and choose. If you had ideas that he didn't like you wre so called ""Blackballed"". I was told on several occasions that I would be written upif i attempted to help the clients while on my lunch break when they requested certain items that took a couple minutes out of my lunch break. I felt it became a hostile area to area. When i explained to H/R dept nothing was done. Eventually I was let go."
bad,Zero work life balance for the average joe   Can’t take vacations without feeling bad and when your counter takes some you end up working 11 12 hour days straight  No holidays off because customer works 24/7 365  You might get Thanksgiving/Christmas
bad,"Pitney Bowes is not customer centric.  They only care about what you did TODAY, not what you can contribute this month or this quarter. Mid management is helpful, but upper management only cares about the bottom line.  No continuous development of employees."
bad,Every body was a rat. Company tries to tell the company where you pick up mail how long it should take them. Always in a hurry. Never same working hours
bad,False promises as far as job growth.  Many long term employees have suffered a great deal being stuck.  Management is NOT good to their employees and treats them as low class employees AND HARASSES THEM... ULTIMETLEY FIRING WITH NO CONSCIENCE .  Especially in the sales department. Have a plan B in the works your time might be short lived.  The company employees say you need to get out of the sales department quickly... when they find out your in the sales business unit.  Sales Management team is clueless to the needs of the employees and could carless unless it directly affects them. Put on a good front.  Portfolios are not good and the chosen get all the attention and good leads.   Customers are very unhappy and feel stuck in their contracts... not good for sales and making quotas.  Management could care less and does not acknowledge any of the the issues and problems to make it a better department.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN POSITION.
bad,"They want you to do too much for too little...11 an hour is good to sort out mail but when i got there and had to do more then sorting out mail,i didn't apply to be a slave. Machine operators make 15 and up,General laborers make 12 and up.people please don't be a fool and except this job."
bad,My summary Speaks for itself. Not a good financially secure company. Sales targets are very unrealistic. Sales territories or not based on an accurate information. Else territories are all considered the same. No internal trust with in the organization. Most of the high executives or ask IBM employees which do not know the mailing and shipping industry
bad,I worked for this company for almost 10 years.  Stayed only because I love most of the people and the vacation.  Managment will over work you to the point of exhaustion.  Pay was good at the end.  I had one manager tell another I was not confident in my job yet I was helping others most of my day and taking escalated issues.  At the end I was advised that I had to reapply for a job I had been doing for almost 3 years because the qualifications were different.  Every year they let go more and more people right before Christmas so they can make their end of year goal.  My prediction is that they will not be around past the next 5 years due to a poorly mismanaged company who doesn't appreciate their employees.
bad,The company is not doing well and has sold off their biggest businesses which generated the most income.  They once had an outstanding reputation and was a great place to work — not any more unfortunately.
bad,Very few people can get ahead in this company.  There are a select few who get promoted year after year while the vast majority have no room for advancement and get yearly raises that do not keep up with inflation.  Don't work here
bad,Service contracts very dynamic resulting in last minute moves as required.  Poor management causing loss of service contracts at multiple sites.  Not enough being done to retain client relationships.
bad,Pitney Bowes is going through major changes trying to reinvent themselves. They have been in business for almost 100 years selling postage meters. With email being an easier way for companies to communicate with clients. The product that they carry is obsolete. The changes that they have made trying to maintain relevance in the industry have been at the expense and detriment of the employees. They have brought in a whole new executive management team within the last few years. The majority of these individuals have no industry knowledge and are driving business into the ground. As an employee I fear that I may loose my job everyday! This is not the place to invest and where you can see a long term career potential.
bad,They don't seem very concerned that customers are waiting anywhere from 30-60 minutes to get a representative. There menu prompts need to be better organized as well for customers so they aren't getting shuffled all over. Some of the supervisors need attitude adjustments and a class in professionalism.  Also did not like the fact that you couldn't get up and use the bathroom without being questioned. Asking for help was frowned upon.
bad,I did not like working at pitney bowes . They weren't family orientate at all .The way they had us working was horrible . But i did learn how to sort properly and professional at this workplace . My Coworkers were all on the same level everyone wanted to quit the job because it was a horrible business .
bad,"If your in print services your compensation is higher than mail services, politics play small role in office services but dependant of management you can be recognized or ignored of best efforts to company goals."
bad,Stuck in the past and living off their near monopoly on postal metering.  Little interest in trying new approaches to grow business in other segments
bad,This job was not military friendly. Management from the Regional Manager to the team leader was involved. Was not permitted to advance because of current military deployment opportunities.
bad,"Inspect equipment, log daily work, assist clients, interact with different departments, answer email, process paperwork, ship out international and domestic packages. "
bad,"No training , everyone is for themselves, supervisors playing favoritism, no growth in company ,,"
bad,The management will do any thing to make themselves look good.
bad,Business has gone true significant changes and leadership shifts which as resulted in a significant lose of clients and quality of services being provided.
bad,"I enjoyed my job for the most part.  Always busy, always something to do.  They recently downsized our department and instead of basing their decisions on who works hard and who has a broader range of skills, the supervisor based it on seniority.  This has happened over and over again.  It's a practice of favoritism that is never ending."
bad,"I recently accepted an executive level position with PB, and left a company where I had a successful career for over 15 years.  The job was posted in Austin, and I live in Florida.  Initially, I was not interested.  The recruiter then told me (a) travel would be 25%, 50% max in busiest times, and (b) I would focus on implementing strategy and a new system, and have no direct reports for at least a year.  Just five weeks into the role, they told me I would have an entire team in Austin reporting to me.  Hence, 25% travel was effectively insufficient, and was little more than a recipe for failure.   They need a leader who travels 0% of the time, meaning he/she already lives in Austin."
bad,"Unless you want to be jobless very quickly with their Panama center growing very quickly; don’t waste your time. No job security, management is in the toilet all the way around. I can say, the co workers are great (at least the ones I worked with) but, this just isn’t it sis."
bad,If you like to be micromanaged and enjoy having your job threatened for not hitting metrics you don't get paid on then Pitney Bowes is the place for you. Also no availability to move up.
bad,Well been working 10 yrs an out off those10yrs 4 yrs i been a shift lead an i been trying to move up to supervisor but they seem to not train me the correct way.
bad,Pitney Bowes clients are raked over weekly for sales.  Hiring more and more people at cheaper hourly to push out hire paid employees. Toxic work enviroment.
bad,"mgmt. doesn't communicate with employee's and I haven't had a 40 hour work week since I started, constantly changing schedule making it difficult for family life"
bad,"Pitney Bowes was a good company when I started. Then ever since last year they've been downsizing while increasing territory. "
bad,"Work with different contracts with Government, State departments.."
bad,Pitney Bowes Atlanta is the worst!!! The management is awful. Everyone is sleeping with each other and its impossible to do any work over everybody gossiping. They fire ppl for stupid reasons!!!! Its very unprofessional.
bad,"This company will not support their works. Even when you achieve, they never lend support. All they care about is their image to the client. All they care about is profit."
bad,Based on what I know now. Overall work is easy. Watch out for the backstabbing. Not honest with a person directly. Wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a long term position. Most of the management was younger. They were pretty cool.  If I had to do it all over id pass. Maintenance didn't seem to know what they were doing. Couldn't think outside of the box.
bad,"- If you’re looking for a job, don’t even think about going here. This place is a joke. The managers and supervisors here doesn’t treat employees fairly. If you’re not the favorite one then good luck. The site manager is so stupid. "
bad,"Waited too long to pull lever on Legacy systems in their so-called IMPACT 2017 internal switchover project."
bad,"PB is a sales-driven company. Unfortunately, they care more about their investors on the Street than they do about their workers. They expect everyone to be responsible for their poorly-trained sales force and the support people turn into blame-catchers."
bad,Not the company is ok... But management sucks... They let the people do what they want... So they are losing control slowly...Also the pay they don't pay enough for the hard work...This could be a better work place if they improve things
bad,The employees and management were very unprofessional. I had to deal with a lot of inappropriate behavior from other employees. The Job culture was not very good either.
bad,very good people to with and for . flexablie hours as need .good customer skills
bad,"This company has been downsizing for a long time now. There is no job security here. The management does not know its workers and they are judged by a matrix that does not show the workers true value to the company only that they know how to make the numbers reflect what the manager wants to see. The manager does not come out and say falsify the report by it is inferred. They have fired great employees and kept poor ones because of this matrix. The service managers are not in touch with what is really going on in the field. The field service staff went from being a highly motivate group of highly trained techs to techs that are trying to figure out how to make their day look productive on paper. Wall street will have to take some of the blame as their demand to show high profits have caused layoffs to make the numbers Wall street wants. This company has sold off sections of their business, their headquarters and is now outsourcing repairs on some of their machines. The customers are not getting what they paid for in their warranty contracts when a under trained third party worker shows up to work on their machine. (many times they are not repaired). I believe that this company will be laying off more people shorty to again reduce their operation costs at the expense of customer service. If the company really wants to make a change and save money it should reduce the over paid management staff and leave the service staff alone. Its a case of too many chiefs and not enough Indians."
bad,"Upper management is terrible; The job itself is very easy. My location was very laid back and comfortable, but the upper management made it more difficult than it had to be. It was good for the time being, but definitely is not a CAREER!"
bad,To many friends and family members working in the same place.
bad,"If you address issues, management will judge you quickly & fire you. Basically I started January 2019 and they have succeeded to fire me within 6 months. I received unnecessary write ups basically 2-2019, 4-2019 and 5-2019, terminated 6-2019. Management is horrible and HR is onsided"
bad,"The job was Friendly, and needed a very high pace of movement. The management were friendly, the reason why I left the job because of the timing of it, it was third shift and I have school."
bad,Incrivel apoio e ensino por parte dos colegas de trabalho. Experiencia para um maior amadurecimento. Porem havia pouco reconhecimento e oportunidades para crescimento.
bad,I worked Pitney Bowes 3rd shift as a persorter. The trainers were gettho and very unprofessional. One of the trainers told us about her not being able to go to the bathroom for two weeks. The other one told talked about the other associates and what she knew of their personal life. The job itself was ok other than the fact that the company is under staffed and the employees are over worked. The night management are very arrogant and apart of the reason the company is under staffed.
bad,Hiring executives from other companies with little or no knowledge of PB to manage critical business interest adds to the overall poor management. Add that to the many layers of management and that local decisions require HQ approval resulting in non responsiveness to local customer needs. Although PB has a history of over 80 years they have only experience competition in the some product lines in last 8 or 9 years. Do you remeber Bell telephone before deregulation?
bad,"If your looking for a part time job,then this would be good. The hours vary everyday/ week. Unpaid lunch break, which also varies from thirty minutes to an hour."
bad,the enviroment is negative and not a nice place to work. It used to be a great place and a company you were proud to work for
bad,My vehicle was broken into while working 3rd shift i went into the office early the next morning and told them they said they was going to watch the video an get back with me! I never got a call back went back up there an nobody ever answered the door! They do not care if you work for them or you or your personal property! How are you supposed to work for someone that doesnt care what happens to you
bad,"I worked in the copier division.  They did not manufacture their own copiers, they used anther manufacturer and just re-labeled them.  Product was too pricey and everyone always thought of the mail machines when you said you were with Pitney Bowes."
bad,Again I've learned communication skills great team work how to be responsible coworkers were great the hard part was when the rush came and all the mail flying all over the place the most enjoyable part was when everything went a bit smoothly
bad,"Well organized, Highly motivated , passionate and result oriented sales professional."
bad,This was my first time learning how to scan and edit and preserve old documents do data entry so the experience was great.
bad,"Did not enjoy my 5 months there because of business decisions and all the turnaround. In 5 months, I have changed manager 3 times and their vision is not mine"
bad,"The work was easym however the way the emplyee's were treated, they were unfair."
bad,They do not care about their employees. They will belittle you and make you feel like you are worthless and can be replaced at any moment. The company is slowly dying because nobody wants a postage meter any longer. They also treat their customers like garbage by tying them into long term contract for things they don't need.
bad,I really can't review this company I was only there for a short period of time through a temp agency
bad,"The company is great on training, but, does not offer raises or advancement opportunities"
bad,The summary says it all Get a career go to college and get into a position where you are valued and appreciated thats all Im gonna say
bad,My day can range from having nothing at all to do to not having enough time in the WEEK to get it done! PB management is non-existent. They are too busy trying to secure their position to worry about us.
bad,Very unprofessional working environment. The shift hours were inconsistent.
bad,"I worked there for about a month and things were going well. Long story short, there was a racial issue going on and human resources, supervisors and management did nothing about it. They tried to make it seem like I was the problem and attempted to place me somewhere else. I quit and they called it job abandonment."
bad,"Great company , good benefits, friendly work environment"
bad,"Typical day in the Office pleasing the client ."
bad,They hype you up and waive the carrot in front of you and then snatch it. Even if you are doing the best on the team. Snob people that deserve promotions. They would rather tell you they are going with others who have senority and then hire someone from outside the company.
bad,"The Co-workers were great. The Manager was off her rocker."
bad,Poor pay. No career development. Poor management. Bullying tactics from management. They make.you stay late without offering overtime. Make you travel to Henley and don't pay expenses.
bad,No opportunity for growth. Poor workplace culture. The people here lack team work and communication skills. Under new management who lacks experience.
bad,There is absolutely no room for growth at this company. Culture is stressful and not fun - it is very awkward to ask for a day off or plan a vacation.
bad,I have worked there for five years hoping to be permanent employee and not stay and on-caller/ temp worker. It took five years to be a part timer!
bad,A typical work day is hectic not leaving much time to learn. The management is horrible at communicating daily tasks. Most of there staff are young adults who don't understand how a system in a fast paced area is supposed to be managed. The hardest part of the day is dealing with management and there dictatorship. The  most enjoyable part of the job if that is getting paid.
bad,I prefer not to provide information based on the culture of this organization and its ability to reprimand for bias reasons.  I am currently seeking new employment opportunities because of the lack of leadership and management incompetencies throughout this organization.
bad,not really much to say. the company does not know the way they want to go. everyday they are making new rules or changing something that doesn't need to be changed.
bad,"Clock in, stair at PC terminal or assist in mail sort, or answer phones.  Learned... self teach, learn as you go.  Management???"
bad,-kollegen und kolleginnen sehr nett
bad,Postion was challenging. I have provided all details related to this positon.
bad,"The ""fun "" fun part of the job was the clients. As for management-when you had other ideas or if you went against what they wanted you were labled ""troublemaker"" . . I lost my job because my belief the management was called on the ""carpet"" so to speak. I really miss only a few of the employees of Pitney. The Human Resources dept. isn't a big help to the employees. They are out for just themselves."
bad,I would like to have an oppourtunity for my full potential to recieve some reconition with compensation. This is not intended as a complaint.
bad,The compensation is low and no benefits for part-time employees. The management style is strictly from the top down.
bad,"typical day answer phones "
bad,"Unfähige Geschäftsführung, die nur Handlanger für den amerikanischen Mutterkonzern ist, der gerade dabei ist massiv zu sparen und Standorte zu schließen. Nur eine Frage der Zeit bis PB Deutschland das gleiche Schicksal erfährt."
bad,"I feel for the type of work and pace that the company has you go thru isn't fair to everyone.  The salary is so low paying that it doesn't make sense.  No one can live off of that salary.  There are employees that sleep on the job and nothing is said about it.  If you inform management that there is material under the machines nothing is done. Most of the employees don't care how they do their jobs and that isn't good at any company.  Too little is being done at this company.  I would have stayed, if I could have been able to survive with the salary of $9.75 an hour.  I didn't make enough to survive with taxes/Insurance, etc coming out of check."
bad,"Neenah Call Center management lacks creativity and Imagination."
bad,"Poor Local Management.  Would not provide required tools, and didn't seem to care about employees. Would not listen to employees requests or complaints."
bad,This company is truly not looking to build a great culture. They increase employees as a way to increase sale in the 4th quarter for Wall Street with no intentions of keeping people long term.
bad,I gained more computer skills and experience. I enjoyed working on the
bad,"Not a good place for career growth. Very immature, non-serious, interestingly confusing, etc."
bad,"Workplace had favoritism, managers act like job is on the line,  I experienced unfair treatment. Mandatory Overtime. Messy Environment."
bad,It's a good place to work if you have something else going on outside of work
bad,"By being a Digital Operator at Pitney Bowes, you have be a key member of the Pitney Bowes team. Being a professional in Mailrooms I come from a variety of backgrounds, bringing an assortment of knowledge and skills to every area of our business."
bad,They will ‘let you go’ and claim ‘transformation’ as the culprit. They do not care about their employees even after 5+ years of service. Company direction is unclear.
bad,Cambios completamente injustos desde hace casi un año y no se ve nada positivo
bad,"Entreprise ou l'on apprend énormément de choses avec une bonne ambiance de travail malheureusement ternie par une Direction dont les objectifs et la manière de traiter son personnel est à revoir. "
bad,"After being hired was told that there would be new hire training but never was officially done, Apparently I picked up quick because I had a one day ride along and for the three years and a half years I worked independently. Poor management was my main issue besides having an medical emergency that caused me to leave. Too much stress for the pay scale."
bad,"Upper management team is constantly pressuring their sales reps to be more productive and be more aggressive on their sales, but they are overworked and understaffed, because they are all over the place and nothing gets completed in a timely manner. Directors wants bigger results from their reps, but won't help delegate admin work to help maintain high productivity."
bad,They had new magement change talk times and change goals to increase constantly. They took sales goals from 38% to 58% persent and took away things like marketing counting twards the goal and made it impossible to reach the tarkets and then let me go after a 15 year commitment and lowered the goal slightly before letting me go.
bad,"Very physical, stressful and disrespectful environment. Most would treat you poorly due to race, gender and age. Only a handful of ""good"" team workers. The rest are lazy."
bad,"Very difficult work environment due to system upgrades.  "
bad,"Dangling the carrot culture. Back-stabbing management. Worst customer service in the industry. Fog a mirror, pass the drug test you're hired -- then you're tossed around while management has everything figured out. Way too many captains on that ship. Pitney is absolute mayhem and can waste the prime years of a career."
bad,Internal issues and lack of innovation. A good old boy internal click.Tough to break in and has a unusual go to market methodology. Focused on compliance selling and growing existing customer base.
bad,"Worked there for about 4 years on site."
bad,"They don't and will not care about you. lots of work for little money, yearly raises are low. management not trustworthy and consistently plays favorites"
bad,"The manager of the new hires sales department is a brute. Only about making the money on accounts and no relationship with anyone beyond young females, what a disturbing flirt and favortism. Complaints made but to no avail. Very driven work enviorment, rough and not for the light of heart. Stress high and not friendly."
bad,"This company is only valuable for on the spot training, gaining experience/years of work under your belt. This company is not career driven!!"
bad,"Coworkers were friendly but management had no respect for their staff. Learned to stuff 50 envelopes in 10 mins, the hardest part was dealing with supervisor."
bad,"Company is run like an annunity to maybe last another 5 to 10 years. No product development investments are made in the traditional business. History of continued downsizing has resulted in a very harsh and hostile work environment without teamwork. Who is next, you or me? The leadership of ex IBM ers is focusing only on new areas like ecommerce, hoping to reinvent the company. Reality is that the business environment is changing much faster than Pitney Bowes is able to change. Management practices are about 15 years behind."
bad,I work good with all my co worker I love my duties meeting new people.
bad,"Pitney Bowes is working hard in restructuring the business. The company is facing some challenging times with no revenue growth. With the declining mail meter usage, the company is working on becoming a software company by launching Volly. Pitney Bowes has invested an enormous amount of money and time is making Volly their new bread and butter. The goal is to make Volly the turning point for the company."
bad,I wasn't to happy working at Pitney Bowes it was very low standard and the supervisor never took there jobs seriously when someone would complain my experience there wasn't all too great
bad,"Horrible management"
bad,"Overall management and higher-ups do not really care about the employees on the floor, unless they're going to be terminating an employee! Employees are just a number that's easily replaced."
bad,The senior leaders are only revenue focused.  They continue to increase quotas which has taken away the time to provide high levels of client care that the client deserves.  Pitney Bowes leaders have a disconnect with the current market and client need in the SMB group.  Don't expect to retire at that company.  You will be selling ice to Eskimo's at a premium cost.
bad,I worked through a temporary agency.  I disliked the management and the wages are poor for the work your doing. There's really no room for growth nor pay advancement.  A place full of favoritism.
bad,Good company to work for however the service dept is in a downhill spiral. Majority of work is contracted out to 3rd party vendors who doesn’t know the in or out of equipment. PB Technician wears company shirts while 3rd party wears cargo shorts and rainbow shirts
bad,"I got this job through a staffing agency and I'd say they pretty much misled me. I asked if it was a temporary position or whatever and the guy said it was ""ongoing"" (which seemed kind of evasive in hindsight) but one of the employees said it was temporary. So that was kind of shady right off the bat. Anyway, when I started they pretty much threw me right into the fire and I was put on a ""slow"" machine which was still hella-fast for someone on their first day doing it. I was working with two ladies: one who fed the mail into the sorting machine and the other who I was helping sort the mail into bins. The first one was pretty nice to me but the second one got on my case even though I was literally new there. She apparently didn't speak English too well which didn't help matters either. After about 2 hours of doing that I was sweating my butt off from the non-stop action and was feeling a little lightheaded so I just said screw it and peaced out. If you like that kind of work (or are horribly desperate for something) then I guess go for it. But considering the size of the warehouse and the amount of people working with you, you're just another brick in the wall."
bad,"The management are the worst that can be had. They treat you like you are in pre-school. Stand over your back, walking up and down the Isle chanting next call, lets go etc. The pay is okay, that is if you are able to make bonus which changes about everyday. They make it hard for you to make it. They do not care about your outside life, only about the extra buck they can get. "
bad,A declining feeling at this company in the last few years.  I feel they are phasing out their service department.  We have seen many people retire but they are rarely replaced.
bad,"Nothing to Add. "
bad,"The overwhelming feeling of working for this company, particularly in my location was that people were viewed more as a resource than a person. There was no incentive for good work or punishment for bad work. Priorities seemed to focus more on dress code and attendance policy then employee training and the quality of work being done. Management seemed solely focused on the product and retention of employees seemed embarrassingly unimportant. Scheduling was almost never in advance, and management seemed to ""err on the side of caution"" far to often creating situations where emergency shifts were called in on weekends with little to no work to justify the decision, often resulting in the employees then being sent home or on break fro extended periods. Even management positions appear to be a revolving door, with the only those arguably the cause of the situation remaining for extended duration."
bad,The environment at Pitney Bowes has changed so much it makes you not even want to come in.  Very stressful and always wanting more production with no pay increase
bad,"Mailing industry has gone through a great deal of changes with electronic innovations. much downsizing, I left before it was too late. only a handful of employees left"
bad,"Micro managed down to bathroom breaks"
bad,"I so enjoyed my time at PB. The review doesn't reflect how much I I appreciated my internal clients, their work ethic and their decency. I'd give the management of the Service organization 5 stars and their culture 5 stars. The issue lies elsewhere in the organization and I will leave it at that!"
bad,"Good company but management in transportation logistics is terrible. First 3 years was great but this last year since we've had a new transportation manager is terrible and not getting better, feels like this will be my last year working there"
bad,Call center workplace. Many entry level positions available and located in the Fox Valley. Most hours spent on the phone. Good opportunity for customer service professionals.
bad,"Very tough work environment with little to no support.  The people are great and committed to doing the right things for customers and the business, however, the overall culture and  work environment is challenging."
bad,"I was hired with over 20 yrs in the service industry, The required training to service pitney bowes products was never supplied. Management lied repeatedly, no job security, Every tech i met was afraid for his job, not only managers but dispatchers(navigators) can create a negative effect on your productivity. Most people that work here are looking elsewhere."
bad,"I really enjoy working with other people and the challenges and satisfaction of sales. "
bad,A typical day at Pitney Bowes consisted of working in multiple computer systems.   I worked several queues that consisted of correcting billing errors where needed.   I also billed clients for rental and lease of their mail equipment.
bad,Typical long day everyday. Horrible Co workers. Salary wasnt too bad. Manager didnt know anything about the job.
bad,The overall state of the mailing industry is in decline. Marketing and field support is lacking. Earning potential has been complicated by a poor commision plan.
bad,Pitney Bowes was a company of down sizing. I really enjoyed the work. I got along with all other employees.
bad,"PB was initially a good company to work for back in 2003. As mail fell out of fashion over the following years, PB didn't keep up with the times; their business dwindled to nearly nothing. "
bad,the job was ok but they sold the division so it was not a great transition. i wish i could say it was a good place to work it started off not  great and moved to getting better once i moved location and managers
bad,India teams are very good but  they make USA teams insecure. all american management is insecure of growing teams in India. small Connecticut focused mentality.after the sales of software data business and after old CIO left no future left. All old timers in Connecticut cannot think new and different.All buddies there working for 2-3 generations making each others job safe.It has to bring senior management from outside otherwise dont expect any change to happen
bad,"It is a stressful company to work for, compensation was ok, usually. They have ridiculous HR policies, in practice. And the company is a wreck, more so the further up you go. "
bad,Management is one way and does not listen to employee concerns. Low pay but offers suitable OT. However the stress level weighed against the “benefits” do not make it worth your time.
bad,No room for growth they work you  like slaves. You  clock in at 6:00 am and don't get a break until   11:30 am come back from break at 12:30. We clock out to go home at  3:00 pm. On dsys when they say that we are going to finish around 1:00 pm we don't get a break . We would work from  6:00 am until 1:00 pm with  no breaks. It's  extremely hot on the inside. Just imagine working in the heat with no ac fast paced and not getting a break. On my first day I was very disappointed. They say on days when they see that we will be finished before 3 PM. They take away our lunch break so we can hurry and finished so we can leave.
bad,It was a horrible experience working with Pitney Bowes hence won't recommend it to anybody. The Operation manager and some other senior staff of the company makes work so difficult
bad,"The concept of team work and their motto we do the right thing sounded good, but no one seemed to care as we start our shift everyday with most of the time useless information. How they rated the day before production and errors. "
bad,I really do not have rating for this company do fact they no long exist . Therefore my opinion of them do not matter in the lease. Commenting on them has not effect.
bad,"Very hard job to work at as a sales person of any type. Long hours 24/7 with too much paperwork and complicated order entry program."
bad,"PB is a great place to make excellent commission, provided that you are good on the phone and willing to sell Postage equipment. The management is the single most micro-managing organizational system that I've ever experienced. Every single part of your day is tracked, from number of dials, to talk time, to contracts sent out, to contracts received back. All of this would be just fine, if it was helpful. Even if you hit 100%+, 150% or 200% even of your sales quota, you can still be written up for not hitting a metric, which seems absurd to me. It's the #1 reason that I would never recommend working here to a friend. The lack of reward for selling something as basic and soul-killing as postage equipment makes for a very weak trade-off."
bad,"Responsible for bar code sales in Houston and greater Gulf Coast Area of electronic marketing equipment to"
bad,"Worked as an on-site technician.  Company is shifting focus to software, which is understandable, but has neglected employees on physical side. "
bad,was notified of being downsized from company on the smae day without prior notice via conference call. Unprofessioal environment that pushed product over providing serivce.
bad,The compensation and benefits were average.  Work/Life balance was average.  Job demands were reasonable.  Poorly managed and not a very diversity friendly environment.
bad,Changes are made for the sake of making changes. Many times the changes or the expensive updates made things worse and customers  and employees are always frustrated. The trend was to try and force out long time employees who have more benefits like vacation and pay and hire off the street. The constant retraining of new employees made for frustrated customers.
bad,Receive and  make labels for the packages then deliver the packages to the customers and we have a lot of down time  like stapes and ups and fed ex express
bad,"I was to support mailing machines in a fast paced environment.  I received only partial training, and management did nothing to make me able to support the site."
bad,Pitney Bowes is a company in transisition and it has a lot of staff slow to accept or not accepting of new processes needed by businesses today.  They have a great technology foundation but their processes hamper their ability to take advantage of it.
bad,"Although they say they are trying to change the culture they still do not embrace employee development. Ideas to develop employees are continually shot down by executives."
bad,"Trying to reinvent itself in a digital world.  With the decline in mailing, the company is focusing more on the digital market place.  There is a push further leverage it's investment in software."
bad,I was initially excited to work there. But over time i was very stressed and my spirit for being the best i could be was deteriorated by negative energy.
bad,"I learned a lot at Pitney Bowes and was a great experience in this country as my first job. In the past, over 15 years ago, I did not have many opportunities to advance in the company. I don't know the current situation of the company."
bad,Learned the value of hard work. Love how the company took care of the employees. The family first culture was great to be apart of. My time there was great.
bad,"The company is great but the site in west Sacramento is a joke. Management don't take anyone serious, they're always joking around and making fun of people. No room to grow what so ever! Management is big on favoritism. I worked there for 5 years and was making .40 cents more than minimum wage. Be careful!"
bad,"The work itself is great. It is a physical job, it keeps you moving. Not much thought needed. Some days are more challenging than others. They are very unorganized. They claim that they don't know when and what mail is coming in. Slow through the week, sent home early and called off for lack of work, than come the weekend that you are not supposed to work you are expected to drop everything and work outside of your normal shift."
bad,"daily employee  meetings"
bad,"Deliver mail to different departments and meeting people every day and help them with day to day issues they may have. Making sure very important packages was delivered on time, Admin assistant job was to make sure the 25 to 30 people time was logged in properly and making phone calls to corporate for any issues with payroll."
bad,"Working with mail, having to work many weekends and holidays. "
bad,all they care about is making money and the never pay the workers who do the  work the job suck they want you to do everything in the building for 8.50
bad,"employee very rude, some management are ok to work with.  There is little to no work and the company sends employees home."
bad,can't rely on the job existing 6 months at a time. sudden changes in direction.  reassignments of management.  culture of uncertainty
bad,The company is alright. I do like my boss however the job is just that a job not a career.
bad,"I shuttled people back and forth from the campus to the admin offices,"
bad,"Hired as a client account manager. We were filled with all this bologna about how they were changing to a relaionship client centered company that wanted to be more consultative. Pitney Bowes wants to sell more solutions type sales. But after only three days on the floor they gave up on the strategy and switched to there traditional transactional style model of get them renewed now and forget taking time to build a relationship. "
bad,Pitney Bowes provides an excellent foundation for selling skills and training. Need to be able to work autonomously with little supervision. Changes have been made within company to spread work staff very thin. Very little support and leadership.
bad,Great team of co-workers. I Really enjoy working along TIAA-CREF.
bad,"Salary is low and management are tough on their workers. No advancement, no bonuses and very small raises."
bad,"Pitney Bowes pays very low, and there aren't many advancement opportunities. The Management seems to be rocky at best and you should be ready to be micromanaged at times.  They seemed to be a new company and the corporate cared nothing about the entry level employees. They didn't go over the handbook, and didnt' go into detail in the handbook but would site people for things you didn't know were rules! They were pretty shady, However it has been taken over by another company now so things may be different!"
bad,Currently all work you do need 2 people but they only have 1 person trying there best to do it. Working with less is this company's unannounced motto.
bad,I learned different programs hard part of job management. i shipped and recivied for liberty mutual.
bad,"Great for part time. I worked here part time while i went to college Managers are great to work with, team is great, however there is no room to advance in this company."
bad,"Loved my first manager. However, after he left it went downhill. I did his job and mine for about 9 months. Then they gave his job to someone else because they'd do it for less than me. Then they reduced my current salary to top it off and reduced my job responsibilities. Management was not very good. No room for advancement. Poor morale and pay was terrible."
bad,"morning meeting, then short death claims into right folders, help scan insurance claims into computer, doc claims, help open mail to short claims to be scanned. loved my co-workers"
bad,It was a good company to start with right out of school. It is a very competitive and tough sales process.
bad,"No loyalty to workers low pay,benefits not good there is no pension plan there is no set shifts days off are normally split during the week no two day weekends besides that warehouse clean and comfortable some what loud from all the machines"
bad,"Good job for people with no college education, mostly immigrants and lazy Americans work here. You will be micro managed by someone who 9/10 doesn’t know the job as well as you. Management is unorganized. Great benefits, poor pay, mandatory weekend shifts so you have no time for your family."
bad,New company lots of opportunity to rise to the top but the thing is they are slow on work sometimes i worked 4 hrs a day which i did not like at all bu other than that the job was rwally laid back
bad,they ask for the impossible at times   there is no such thing as job security     you may work hard and lose your job but those who screw around get to keep theirs
bad,"Processing mail, managing people day to day schedule and managing operation efficiently. Learned how plan on a day to day, communicating is a must, managing production with diverse employees. the most difficult part of the job is not having a proactive manager to stand behind you on situations.The most enjoyable part of the job is working with amazing employees from different cultures and encouraging and motivating the employees."
bad,"If work for a temp service they will force you to take a day off during the week so you will have to work every Saturday and the hours varies every day and weekend. People have rude attitudes and speak to you in a  hasty manner. Also feel like I was in prison lockdown, cause you can’t have your phone with you or wear any kind of jewelry except for a wedding ring."
bad,The level of verbal abuse a person takes 8 hours a day is hard to do. The team lead that I had would not work with me on calls especially in a timely manner. Supervisor was not trustworthy.
bad,"The company is undergoing some major transformations to try and become relevant.  While some business units are run better than others, in general the whole company is in massive churn. The culture is very hierarchical and those who try and invoke change are shunned and for lack of a better word - bullied.  Overall, the work environment is not pleasant. People are killing themselves working on initiatives that have very little impact and while those workers know this, executives don't seem to. The leadership at the top seems to not understand how painful the culture is and they do little to make the right decisions for this company. If you care about how you spend 50+ hours a week - don't work here."
bad,Overall good and nice company and working environment is very nice and time to time management give me directions and supervisor also cooperation I to much thks
bad,"home office with autonomy and flexible to do a good job. "
bad,"Sometimes you will be challenged because of the lack of supervision through the workweek.  Making decisions on your own in a face paced environment. Lots of support from other departments and co-workers.  "
bad,But the company became more social instead of a work place. I didn't feel comfortable working there no more so I all interest the and company itself.good  for me I pick up alot of skills that I use at another place of employment.like mail sorter machine operator quality control receive mail and shipping
bad,"Formé sur les produits de la division d’insertion mécanique haut volume (DMT)."
bad,"I worked here for almost 8 years and had seen them fire people who had been there many years to bring in younger people with no experience and then do it all over again in a few years. Recently, they fired 75 people, including someone who had over 20 years in, and then did a hiring job fair a couple of months later. NOT the kind of company I wanted to work for."
bad,"The job itself is fairly easy. It doesn't take long before you pick up the job. The pay is decent you go from a 9.50 to 11 ,if you go as a temp to hire, I was a presorter and that involved working in the machine line with one or two other people. The environment is friendly, your coworkers are mostly nice. The only problem I had with this job was at it was poorly managed you could hardly ever catch the supervisors or your manager on the floor and if you could it was always they were busy, and I couldn't talk to you, or they would completely ignore you. It just got harder and harder to deal with I would have loved to stay at this job had it better management but unfortunately it doesn't"
bad,"Stretching, lifting, reviewing mail codes. Learned different postal codes. Management stayed busy. Co-workers were very supportive. The working environment. meeting deadlines, Knew my job well"
bad,"Log in to phones and computer and immediately start to reach out to customers to up sell and take care of customer inquiries. "
bad,"Great environment, the leads is pretty cool to work with, but many of the regular workers can be...immature, and inconsiderate, many comes to work just to get in people business, and if you happen to be a attractive female...WATCH OUT! because there are many low self-esteem woman(haters), up in there, that will try to pick a fight with you out of jealousy, and will rain on you're picnic, anyway they can, and management doesn't care about you, or you're complaints."
bad,"I worked at Pitney Bowes for a year. During that year all employees including myself who were working at the time were promised we could be in the higher paying sales lists. It did not happen. We were given a decent sales quota to begin with. At the end of the year the quota climbed to a whopping amount and the only people making that goal were those who had contacts on the inside of the company and those who were priveledged enough to be in the higher paying sales lists known as Connect plus accounts. I did my job with honesty and integrity everyday and would not use the lies and verbiage they wanted me to use. At the end of the day I want to be able to sleep at night and I always slept very well. The customers liked me, even the ones who had been angered by other sales agents. I would not recommend working in outbound supplies. However, there are other departments who are fair and treat their employees really well."
bad,"I worked for the company until recently before I bailed and found something else. The work itself is monotonous, it is not hard work and is easy to do. I was a pre-sorter on 3rd shift at the Charlotte, NC area facility."
bad,"The work culture is great with a lot of fun, supportive and positive co-workers, but this is hands down the most unethical and devious company I've ever worked for.  Once hired, they pulled a bait and switch maneuver, put me in a position I did not hire on for starting a pilot program with none of the compensation they promised, no training, no support, and compromising every opportunity to excel. Very high pressure with little reward."
bad,"Started Delivering newspapers. Checking photocopier to see if they had supply’s and ready to operate. Then we sorted mail.  After sorting the mail it was delivered on our assigned floor, were we also picked up outgoing mail. The outgoing mail envelops and packages were then metered, this was done twice a day. The rest of the day we took calls and to help client needs. We did copy job and printing when they came down. My manager was always helping, coworkers work together as a team. The job was at time fast paced and very demanding, but the best part was getting the job done and getting the gratitude from the client. Their smiles made my day."
bad,"I actually loved my job, because i love data entry and the people i worked with. I keyed information into the system and i prepped and scanned and delivered mail as well."
bad,"I worked for Kelly Services as a temp, but worked AT Pitney Bowes Legal Solutions. Once you have a job assignment, thats where you go. You don't ususally need to talk to Kelly Services unless there's an issue with your pay. When I worked at Pitney Bowes, I worked in Electronic Discovery, which is essentially taking client files from CDs, DVDs, Hard drives, and scanned documents, fixing anything that's wrong with them (according to client specs), categorizing and organizing them in a searchable database, and sending that back to the client so they can use the info for legal claims. It can be tedious, but you work in an office environment with a small team. My co-workers were good fun to be around as well. Usually the management is pretty casual, though sometimes the work can be extremely stressful when something goes wrong."
bad,Overall a healthy and conducive organisation. Work-Life balance is good in PB
bad,"I worked at a Pitney Bowes mail processing plant for about 21 months (1 and 3/4 years) and it seemed, at first, to be an alright place to work. At first, like any other work place, seemed kinda tough because you had to get used to the procedure, guidelines and the functions of the workplace. I thought after I got used to it, it would get easier and that I would have little to no trouble continuing on."
bad,"i worked for Pitney Bowes 10 years plus. If you have no goals in life and want to be at the same spot for the rest of your life, then this is the company for you. There is no advancement and growth, while I was there I applied for a bit higher positions within the company, but HR does not even take the time to reply to applicants, I doubt their job postings are real. The assistant manager at Century site is a perfectionist, never happy with the work one does just to mention one example. Lately Pitney Bowes has become cheaper with its employees, not giving more than part time jobs and of course for thanksgiving or christmas you can expect nothing from Pitney Bowes because they never do anything except a pat on the back if they even do that. Some managers I know were former regular employees, so the requirements to be a manager should not be that high. But then for other positions that one applies for, one only gets BS of why one does not have requirement for that certain position. The other thing is that Pitney Bowes seems to never have a clear leadership and goal. Any christmas celebration, or thanksgiving always comes from employees themselves. I stayed long with this company for convenience only, I worked days and lived very close, but that was it, and I had great coworkers. Other competitors like Williams Lea and such, are a slightly best choice for employment, been there, done that."
bad,"As this was my first job out of college, it provided a good learning experience."
bad,Management roles are not given to the most qualified or most successful candidates. They are normally given as result of favoritism. They need culture change.
bad,They did give me a job when they bought out ODMS and I got to keep my pay rate. So that is Great but they have not really said if the International department is going to stay here in Pontiac or if they will be moving it to Chicago.
bad,"When I first started working at PB, it was a great place to work. Lots of fun, great benefits, and great people. The job was not a hard job but as time went on, and PB decided to make changes, the changes that were made were for the worst, Customers started to cancel and it became harder to make money there. Then they get a new Director who was the absolute worst ever. He treated everyone like they were children and not adults. There was no talking allowed among employees and if he couldnt control you then he didnt want you there."
bad,I enjoyed working for Pitney until they were unable to continue with the contract I was on. We were absorbed by the winning bidder for their replacement.
bad,Many changes in Senior management led to years of bad decisions which led to massive layoffs. Senior management did not keep up with tech changes and lost major aspects of business. I am not sure PB is even a frotune 500 company anymore.
bad,"Faire du trie de courrier"
bad,Not saying that overall Pitney Bowes is a horrible company to work for but I can say that the Indianapolis Presort facility gives this company a bad reputation.  Advancement opportunities are not based on experience and education but if you're liked by management.  New hires for positions of leadership start off making more than senior staff.  That's their way of being competitive in the job market.  Wouldn't discourage anyone from applying at any locations because Pitney Bowes is a well established company internationally.
bad,"It is a job. Co-workers are great, management is good but growth isn't there only if you wanna stay in that type of business."
bad,"I had high hopes when I started with this iconic Stamford, CT company.  However from the first day I started through seven years there were layoffs, management changes, tension and distrubitions."
bad,"It was very physical work, and hard to work with coworkers. Although,"
bad,I worked there for a year. the microsoft campus is beautiful and I met a lot of wonderful people. The pay for what you do does not exactly match. It is not a straight receptionist job it also has some admin qualities. The hardest part is knowing that they do not care. The biggest goal is becoming full time because if someone in management does not leave you have no upward mobility. alot of peple take this job as a stepping stone to beocming an admin. Usually it takes a long time to get those admin positions. I mean its a job but it most certainly not a career and they do play favorites and leave many receps disgruntled. the highlight is getting two weeks of for christmas because microsoft is closed
bad,No opportunities for advancement at this time.  Management is inexperienced and do not communicate well between shifts
bad,"PBS was created by merging very different companies with very different cultures and business models. It doesn't work."
bad,"They state there is much room for growth, when in fact there is not. Management likes to ""favoritize"" employees, therefor, when ever there is a possibility for growth the determination is not based on experience and qualification, instead it is based on whom that manager ""likes"" the most."
bad,Starting out with the company was just o.k. As a whole management really did not know how to relate and work with their employees. My coworkers were great to work with.
bad,A very repetitive work which will get you bored all day long. It was an assignment or temporary job with no chance to get hired or promoted.
bad,had het reuze naar mij zin daar maar kon niet meer door groeien daar ook heb mij VCA 1 en VCA2 gehaald ook
bad,"Pitney Bowes was an interesting place to work. The daily task requirements kept one on their feet. You learn new things due to availability to various training that was offered. The hardest part of the job was learning to deal with management that didn't take advantage of management training, Therefore it affected the flow of the work day. Overall it was an experience in that meaning you were able to exercise and build character. Due to the declining economic status, the company suffered economically, which in turn effected the opportunity to receive raises."
bad,"the company is trying to work on growth but facing challenges on entering new areas from management. Their decisions impact business growth, especially on M&A area."
bad,It was an okay place to work sometimes they're mad Tori overtime is too late management definitely has to treat you fairly but overall you always have something to do.
bad,"Been a while since I worked at PB, can't remember much.  The pae was rather slow but when it mattered it mattered.  Timely upkeep of machinery was necessary."
bad,"Buyout. Company downsized, but let go of the unit that handled the the clients that handled 30% of top clients.  The company is in the process of restructure or buyout."
bad,"The company offers flexible working arrangements which is very useful, but does not invest in its people. There is not a lot of emphasis on people growing into new roles and progressing. There is a lot of attrition due to poor systems and work loads."
bad,Pays good but stress isn't worth it.  It is constantly changing and people are getting let go all the time. It used to be great back in the day.  Benefits were good when I was there but its been a long time.
bad,"Service Tech: "
bad,"Management staff did not train their fellow colleagues, a lot of mistakes were made. When the mistakes continue to happened, that's when they wanted to begin a training program."
bad,This was a bias company.  There was room for advancements but more often than not it doesn't happen based on who you know.  The training was subpar.
bad,"the typical day- The typical day at work is very boring because no talking and it is hard to stand on your feet all with only getting a 30 minute break and nothing more."
bad,"Poor management skill. I was able to meet a lot of people, and the job was simple and had daily routine schedule. Overall good for out of high school students."
bad,"I found that all staff and co-workers below the level of Director were sincere and hard working individuals.  Upper management fell victim to the office politics regarding ""who knows who"" for promotions and choice assignments."
bad,I used to come in @ 8:00 am dispatch and sort all the jobs according to destination and gave it to my girls to be process. My co-workers where very friendly.
bad,"A decent company to work for if you are just looking for a 7:00am-4:00pm job. Needs better leadership, better pay, and company employee growth."
bad,"My daily duties are supervising a crew of dispatchers, ensuring that they perform their duties effectively. I need to make sure that the workers take the mail from a conveyor system build pallets with said mail, wrap those pallets and eventually load those pallets onto trucks. I have to monitor several areas around the warehouse, and around fifteen employees throughout the day. I also communicate with my supervisors and managers as well as the truck drivers and transportation office workers to ensure that the trucks leave in a timely matter and are loaded safely and according to work safety procedures. I learned how to monitor, delegate duties and keep a crew of people working efficiently and effectively.The hardest part of the job is adapting to drastic changes to the procedures in place when new tasks need to be performed when new machines are introduced to the warehouse for example. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of catching up on the production when we start the day behind."
bad,"Metrics closely observed, Salary+commission. "
bad,Had to work to several different places in the heat and pull hand trucks upstair wells. Not organized the way it should have been organized. Not a job for women.
bad,For the most part job is easy.. But the coworkers; especially the operators( who send out mail to you)  are rude to new people.  They expect you to be perfect and know everything after a couple of days working.  Operators tell you what to do and watch you.. They talk down on you..when you complain to supervisor all they say is ignore them or just stare at you like they don't care. A lot of foreign people  work here so your most likely have to work side by side with someone who barely speaks English.  You work neck to neck with another person: meaning you share the work and small space.  Some machines are faster than others.. Alot of people quit this job.
bad,Company has been going through system changes which is causing many issues in processes. These issues were the reason the job of speaking with clients is so difficult and stressful. Company is very behind in work and does not have enough staff to do the back office work that the front line callers have to do deal with.
bad,Was a thriving company when I joined that quickly became outdated. They didn't keep up with the times. Has a huge work at home culture which sounds great but wasn't.
bad,"I really enjoyed talking to the customers and there were a lot of unhappy customers due to billing or equipment issues. I was skilled across the billing AND the equipment so when I got a call from an unhappy customer, who was transferred multiple times. It was great because I could help them with their equipment, then there billing and finally ordered supplies. They were so grateful when they got me cause they got all their needs taken care of in one call and NO transfers."
bad,"Able to work remotely, good employees.  Travel is good.  Customer is good."
bad,When the site I was at had a competent management team I enjoyed my job and would have recommeded the company and that site to anyone. Within the past 4 yrs. of employement I would not recommend that site to anyone who had any pride in themselves. During that time several employees complained to HR about various things & none of the employees were notified of any investigation or actions taken in regard to their complaints.
bad,"If you live to work, then this is the place for you. Started off with first week out of every month having to do 12 hour days, then later changed to 2 weeks, including weekends, of mandatory overtime. Forget about having free time or spending time with your family and friends. After getting employed by them, you now belong to them."
bad,"decent job, little pay or chance of promotion. high speed machinery that required high skill in mechanics, pneumatics and electrical systems. nothing special"
bad,Difficult to work under pressure where there's no procedure in place. Management have a good sense of leadership and problem solving. Night shift is difficult.
bad,"it was good to work with people, co-workers were always ready to help you out despite the lack of proper training. The promotion was hard to get. I enjoyed working with co-workers"
bad,"Good sales training, but their compensation plan could be better. But it was long ago that I worked for this company, so hopefully they have a found a way to improve"
bad,"fast paced and competitive"
bad,"Company lacks clear direction and is very silo'ed.  People leading who are from another firm and don't really understand the business or the need for working cross functionally and in a forward thinking manner.  Multiple people doing similar jobs in different divisions which creates a confusing situation for the client.  New ideas not particularly welcomed and very, very hierarchical in obtained any budget for new ideas at all.  Disempowering culture.  Hope that they get it together, but the future is here and so far they don't seem to have figured it out."
bad,I got to do a lot of different job duties. I also was able to help out in other departments including marketing to learn new things.
bad,"This job required a lot of repetitive work and required knowing how to work independently. I was required to handle documents for Medicare and Medco for the changing policies for 2013. I did enjoy my co-workers and how everyone was easy to work with. However, sometimes it was very difficult to meet the daily requirements work wise with all the papers that went in and out in a day."
bad,I liked PITNEY BOWES as a compay but the pay was not good and the demands were too high.
bad,This was temp service job and I did not enjoy it at all. I The co-workers were very helpful though.
bad,Did not feel valued.  Would not work there again. That is all I have to say.
bad,At times very busy working to deadlines.
bad,"Deliver packages in the morning,receive packages from various vendors scan them in the tracking system then deliver them to various sites."
bad,"In my experience, Pitney Bowes Software can be an interesting place to work as they attempt to transition to a more software/service company, but the work force has been shrinking causing them to demand more productivity from their employees."
bad,Het was wel een leuke werk maar tegelijkertijd veel onzekerheid
bad,I really don't like working there we don't get 40 hours a week they work us very hard I've been working there for 5 years I never can move up the management is very poor they have no respect for you but team leader is very bad the whole company has no structure it's a lot of favoritism and they pay you nothing
bad,Pitney Bowes was the last position I held before going back to nursing school. It was a sales job and very stressful. It was contract selling which is very hard.
bad,I was a print operator of the addresograph multigraph machine in a large printing area.  I would run machine that were mae by kodak called kodak  ektaprint.  I could let machine run while i manually hand stuffed mailing jobs and mailed them out
bad,"The local management was great, friendly, knowledgeable, willing to work with an associate. "
bad,"My work day is to start all the computers, say good morning to all lawyers, secretaries, paralagals and other co-workers. I greet everyone with a smile, I go on the floors to see if they have mail in the mailbox, I learned how to deal with difficult people and I stay with a positive attitude, the attorneys get a little crazy when a trail is coming up, they dont get under my skin, I make them laugh and I always smile. The hardest part of my job is to walk around every hour or picking up packages, I really doesnt like big packages to bring to there office, What I do love about my job, I talk and speak to everyone and I make them smile, I love to hear what they did last night or what project they are working on, I also love to make copies and scan, It really is a nice place to work for"
good,I loved working at Pitney Bowes the only downfall was we were working 6 days a week including Sundays and holidays. guaranteed check every 2 weeks. I think that is really the reason i gave 1 star
good,was not trying to hire on worked for this company 7 months this company have its picks and chooses the supervise is trying to coat with any woman that comes threw the door.they dont recognize the time and effort there sorters put in the training suck they will put beginners with no training that makes it harder on the other sorter they put you on a line alone
good,"Email, review actions lists"
good,The environment was always uncomfortable and shaky at times. When you do a good job you were not told you did a good job however when something went wrong you were definitely notified
good,"If the managers does not likeyou, you will never succeed. They like people who do juicy gossips about other employees  which is bad. Work life is only good if you sand with the managers to give them information about another employee.Work really stressful and no encoragement from managers."
good,"New senior management does have a clue about the industry and is trying to run as they did IBM.  There was a reason IBM stopped its computer division and that would be the same reason they shouldn't be trying to run another asset company.  They lack the skill set and have failed to replace the weak links that were within PB prior."
good,"Ive been a technician for many years. The job pays pretty decent, that is the only reason i work here."
good,"Good they let me work part time which ended up being 3 days a week, 8 hours days. 20 min lunch. One 10 min break. The job is fairly easy. Just very physical"
good,Not helpful when it comes to employee safety and satisfaction.  Work you like a dog without many perks or benefits.  Hard to work under those conditions and stress.
good,Esagerato carico di impegni e responsabilità non riconosciute e non retribuite in maniera equa.
good,Pick up school age children transport to and from school daily. Not enough consistent work hours. Great to travel all around Wisconsin for charter work. Fun to work at local events.
good,When it was Pitney Bowes the company was just okay to work for but a new company took over recently. Poor management lead to a lot of clients not renewing their contracts with Pitney.
good,"Sorted and distributed mail."
good,"for the most part the job was fun very productive                              "
good,"I learned how to interact with customers over the phone. I learned how to log all of your contacts with customers so that if you have further dealings with them, you have details about past conversations that help you solve some issues."
good,The work was reasonable. The branch management was a bit vague co workers were team oriented and helpful. The company did not offer the praise deserved for the branch employees performing quality service with minimal leadership.
good,"The job consists of managing all deliveries to offices in 3 buildings on the Microsoft campus that come in via Fed Ex, UPS, DHL and USPS etc. A normal day would be 40 to 100 deliveries. Ranging in size from envelopes to 70LBS. Deliveries include but not limited to computer equipment, software and time sensitive documents. All deliveries are treated in an expedited manner. Also maintain and manage all mail rooms in all 3 buildings."
good,"Extremely hierarchical with so many layers in between and some managers do not know whats going on in field.They are good with processes only. "
good,"A great skill builder; communications are mediocre per Management, could use improvement. Some on-the-job training; fast paced and timed processing of mail. Very very little room for error"
good,Pitney Bowes is a great place to work with great benefits but they work you too hard. Make you work  too much mandatory overtime. Not much time left to be with family.
good,"working here will keep you on your toes running back and forth to all the pockets to gather mail, lots  of options for times to work ,good FT, PT job."
good,"Company is not growing, continues to make budget cuts. Little job security. No innovation. Not a fun culture; no collaboration and little creativity. Would not recommend to anyone, especially if you are young and looking for a creative, innovate and inspiring environment."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Its a great company for those who don't mind the shift work or 3 12 hours days in a row"
good,"I was employed here for roughly 5 years, it was an ok place to work, its just there was not much opportunity to move up because it was just a mailroom located in the Hartford Insurance company, and Pitney Bowes associates were not allowed to work for the insurance company for 6 months after getting done at Pitney Bowes. I got along with all my co workers young or older they were all great to work with."
good,"When I come in to work, The first thing I need to do is  login into the database and assigned job tickets to myself and complete the job request.  I perform color and black and white copies. I also received hardcopy jobs from walk-in cutomers and occassionaly answer phones from customers that have a question about their  job request.  I do work in a team of 15 other co-workers. The work environment is enjoyable and we all work as a team."
good,"Pitney Bowes is a hit or miss. If you don't get into it through their HR, then consider it a temp to contract position."
good,"Currently, my position is a part-time position. This position offers no room for growth. The only way to advance in this position is if a person resigns, retires or quits."
good,"Management cares about profit, not employees. The trucking routes were not predictable. You might work days one week then be put on nights, then back on days. Pay is low and benefits are expensive. On the plus side, if you have no education, no work history in the USA and speak little to no English this place will hire you."
good,"Okay place to work. Higher ups were very unprofessional, went to lunch for drinks almost daily and back to work. Workload vs compensation isn't anything to brag about. It's okay if you need work."
good,Work with limited resources. Long Hours . Rotating unhealthy shifts. Lack of leadership. Neglect or Whip from management. Inadecuate tools. Bad Documentation or support.
good,"General Manager was an unfair man and treated the employees in a hateful manner, unless you were one of his pets.  There was no encouragement or opportunity to advance oneself."
good,"too busy not enough pay. company changed. poor corporate management"
good,A typical day was fast sorting out mail for across the world by zip code. I learned and became a Dispatcher within a week. I really didn't know my management team and the work culture was not what i was use too.The hardest part of the job was wearing gloves for eight hours and getting paper cuts.The most Enjoyable part of the job was that i only worked eight hours a day.
good,"Certain people continue to advance while those deserving are often left behind.  Pay does not match to performance, but instead to playing the game and being one of the chosen ones.  Way too many people hired into upper management while engineering jobs are eliminated or off-shored.  Lower Management poor with very bad decision making.  Could accomplish great things but too many bad decisions made by the wrong people."
good,"I was cross trained in all services that were provided, I was able to train new employees."
good,"Direction and management were not productive.  Manager was not organized and prepared in most cases.  Everything always was a reactive process, instead of a proactive process.  communication was non existent.  Was difficult to perform my job to the fullest, when management was always going in circles."
good,The President of the company could see through the lame managers which was really good.   My Aunt who was my God-mother passed away while I worked here and was turned down for time off to go to her funeral by my direct report.
good,Very faced paced environment but great fun. Multi-tasking several projects and tasks. Great colleagues and lovely offices.
good,"I have had the opportunity to learn alot within a small time frame, I have excelled in all areas, and am ready for my next challenge."
good,to start the day we go to what we call a stand up where the supervisors talks to us about daily expectations and lets us know what is needed for they day
good,"Worked there so long ago, have no idea what its like now.  Good cold calling experience. Good sales experience but that's all."
good,"After Pitney Bowes bought my company CPC they poorly handled the responsibility of running a company.  We handled it better ""in-house"" without them!"
good,"Intially working for Pitney Bowes proved to be very rewarding work, with good pay. However as the days went on i became more comfortable in my role, and the management took advantage of work room politics. Eventually they let me go due to having an allergy to penicillin , and the workplace not wanting a lawsuit, (even though i said i would give expressed written consent to not ever submitting one if something did happen) because there was penicilin used in the facility i was in , in a different wing that my job never required me to go to."
good,"It is a good company when you start a new project, then  when the project is seattle you are by you own."
good,This use to be a great place to work until it was bought by Pitney Bwes and they brought in an operations manager.  He is a bully and intimadtes most of the employees.
good,"Pretty products and services offered but very dysfunctional operation."
good,"usually a 12 hour day with no breaks, in order to complete workload. engineer support either in India, the phillipines or USA so no immediate or intelligeble communications.  More interested in making money than providing a good service.  Terrible customer relations which impacted on field operatives who had the face to face contact.  poor salaries considering the profitablilty of the company.  Lots of the ""training"" was of the ""Tick box"" type.  Good fun workig with end customers.  a day's work for which you were paid 7.5 hours could involve driving over 300 miles and covering 5 or 6 repair jobs.  The company focus is on meeting targets rather than giving goodservice."
good,Process long term care applications. Learned to help others. Management was fair. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Job wasn't hard at all no room to move up. I enjoyed working with others.
good,the company was a good company overall. i learned alot of skills from excel to performing certain reports. co-workers were excellent and friendly and management was also great
good,"On a typical day at work, I did next to nothing. I was told quite often to ""look busy"". Management was not great there. My manager didn't come in if there was too much snow or rain for her. She also wanted us not to tell her boss (if she called) when she went out on smoke breaks."
good,"taking care of inventory,preparing servers for install managing payroll and all shipping and receiving"
good,This Department needs many training and development inititives-smarter Management decision
good,Pleasant people to work with.
good,Company continues to evolve with the changing of postal service.
good,"Good opportunity to work as part of a busy sales team and to gain my first real experience in sales. The companies commission structure allowed me to earn up to an extra £1,000 a month."
good,"supervisor had picks and choose let other employees basically bully people to put who they liked and or wanted on their line,,if there was no work you would leave early so your check could be 25-35 hours,,also at times if there was no work you would have to wait an hour to hour and half for a truck.You would have to literally be standing around."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company at first, I was motivated to succeed and excited to learn each aspect of the warehouse to thrive and grow with the company. But I was told by my supervisor that I couldn't get my forklift certification because I'm a woman and ""We all know how women drive"""
good,"Pitney Bowes is the incumbent in the mailing industry.  They have been going through a transformation since 2013 in an effort to stay relevant.  Although needed, it has been extremely painful for both employees and clients.  The company needs to improve communication.  Senior level executives often ask for ideas and feedback, but are not willing to listen and dismiss.  There is a huge disconnect between our executives and our front line managers."
good,"Coaching and training are two things that managers have to be good at. If their department is to succeed, it starts with properly training the team. When feedback is not received, especially by new hires, it leaves employees lacking confidence in themselves and motivation. Lack of trust in management is a major issue that leads to workplace dissension among departments and high turnover rates as employees are dissatisfied with the performance of management staff."
good,PB is trying valiantly to find its footing in a changing mail environment.  Leadership fights the change with cost cutting and headcount reductions.  It's a tough place to work.
good,"I worked for PB for 14 years.  They are a stable company and with the right manager, you can really enjoy the work.  Flip side is with a not so great manager, the company can be struggle to get things done.  I worked in a remote position (work from home) some there is much that you have to ""do yourself"" since there is no office support.  The people in the company are great and most want to get the right thing done for the client, but there are processes in the organization that make satisfying clients a bit of a challenge and when you are in sales/marketing/business development, that can be hard for building the long terms relationships as so many things are a part of the company and you have little effect on.  They have also been on a track for the past 10+ years of providing very substandard pay raises, as they were always under the ""belt tightening"" and average raises were 0 - 1.5% annually, which is extremely slow growth once you are in."
good,Pitney Bowes was very boring slow environment never did pick up. A place I could not go back to work for.  I heard they got better back then very slow.
good,Century old company with a lot of potential.  The company has gone through many rounds in executive leadership changes as it goes through digital transformation.  Expect to hit the ground running and to be viewed as a resource for any and all things.  It is great place to gain experience and move around horizontally.
good,"When I worked here my base pay was 20k a year.  That was absolutely low for any company that I've every heard of.  They wanted you to go around making calls all day, basically cold calls."
good,You sit in your cubicle and are on the computers and the phone interacting with people who'd rather not be bothered in the first place. I learned that the workers who lie to customers just to make a sale are the ones that made out well here. Sales people with integrity should avoid this place.
good,Work was non stop and repetitive. Not much room for advancement at the location I worked at. Some friendly people. Management was a little hard to deal with on a few occasions.
good,to check quality on barcode on the letter. put mail letters into the right trays and good attendence. along with several cultures coworkers to work with..
good,I learned a lot working for this company. They gave me a lot of opportunity. I got a chance to expand my knowledge and skills.
good,"I got to travel around all over New York and up state Connecticut to set up postage meters. My learning of how to set up the meter grew more, that I was able to do it myself at some job sites."
good,"PB's postage meter and mailing equipment are in a declining market, and executive leadership understands that a complimentary market needs to be identified and to reinvent itself. The company is doing just that on the outside; new logo, new CEO, massive capital being invested in the infrastructure. However, the company is still top heavy. Positions are being eliminated too often with people being let go without the company even looking into the job or person's value. I have seen many people in these circumstances, only to leave others in the company wondering how they will recover. More responsibilities are piled on those remaining.  Managers eliminate the ""worker bees"" and those that bring no value continue to remain with the company."
good,"A typical day at work. I turn on all the computers. Log in and do the Daily Reports for my Supervisor. I email clients regarding their tracking numbers, status of delivery and any information regarding their shipment. I also call clients to inform them about the status of their shipments.  I collect all couriers and process them and delivery them to their clients. I get signatures and follow up with the clients.  The hardest part of the job is when you have a dissatisfied client. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you have a satisfied client."
good,Very metric driven.Success very dependent on the portfolio you are given. Compensation and growth very limited. Lot of turnover. Left to do it on your own.
good,"Great people to work with, unfortunately CP is slow to adapt to the changing technology and therefore could not make changes fast enough for a newly developed technology."
good,My first line manager made this job great.  He was sensitive and caring and listened. My interaction with executives was limited but it was always when they had to deliver bad news.
good,"professional, and fun based job. Made me feel important and i learned a lot about insurances and different terms. Wish there was more advancement in the job and that they would keep their staff longer."
good,"heavy workload, lack of direction, very unorganized. every man for himself. no real training. unrealistic expectations"
good,"Filing, sorting, and delivering mail to employees"
good,Paid incoming bills for Swiss Reed thru Pitney Bowes on a soft ware packet called Oracle.   Work along and answer to the Vice President of Finance.  I had to be a detail persona and be good at making good judgment calls.
good,"Working there on a daily basis was ok and easy going. the new management team is not ideal and has changed the culture quite a bit. My co-workers were the best park of the job. However, it was a great place to learn and grow. The hardest part of the job was the lack of consistency of the management team. Too many mixed messages and expectations without real direction"
good,This was an ok place to work but I didn't want to live there. Which is what I did for well over a year. There were several days a week that I would catch a nap in my office and go back to work without going home. Not worth it.
good,"A typical work day would be fixing machines or waiting to fix them. But the worst part is you may work 1st shift one week and 2nd or 3rd the next, the rule was 24 hours between :) The company is on the decline, so more work with less man power and less pay."
good,"Low pay for the extremely high expectations of employees. Good that high amounts of overtime were available until the work ran out and I (plus the majority of my department) were let go due to poor management."
good,"Supervisor's rules and procedures were not standardized. Each day the rules changed, depending on the individual."
good,"Great staff to work with. Work day is busy and challenging. Understanding the importance of customer relationship management."
good,"Caters to the slackers, outsourcing everything. No room for advancement and pay is below scale. raises have been frozen for years and bonuses are non existent now."
good,"I am currently working in the underwriter support group, where i process new business,  by pulling reports, email the underwriter if there questions, process the new business application in ecliq, and send endorsements to administration for review."
good,"A ton of preparation, many hours spent in processes that could be more streamlined"
good,I tested new products for errors/problems proir to release to the public. I also tried to reproduce errors/problems that customers have had with products.
good,"Worked for Pitney for many years.. Once one of the greatest companies to work for hands down. The current CEO has driven the company into the ground.. shamfully he has not stepped down. Sadly many of us feel PB is setting up to be sold, the stock price is so low that it ripe for the picking."
good,"While Pitney as a job is great, the work is challenging, but do-able. It is the non-trained responsability of the new team to train those whom are new, but it lacks in process and the management can use some updates to policies. It is kind of go with the flow and correct your mistakes after you make them. This is not Pitney's fault really as we had merged into two different departments with different responsabilities and the old manager had not trained the incoming group. No room for advancement."
good,This place is not a place to workif you have a family they are always cutting hours an showing favoritism an the management is beyond trash and most of them do not have a clue how to manage
good,"It feels as though sometimes management is working against you."
good,"Pitney Bowes is usually a good place to work, if you remove the ideal and culture that you have to sell your dignity and self respect by telling management how great they are, turning a blind eye to management waste and mismanagement of employee resources."
good,"Never a dull moment is the final surviving benefit of this company. Trying to transform itself into something else, has gutted this once Fortune 500 / customer-centric company, into a technology chasing slave to the shareholder."
good,"My typical day was going to current customers to make sure all was well. Also developing new business in the downtown area of Miami."
good,"Typical day includes opportunities to work with broad range of employee's of all levels and diversified responsibilities, so you're never bored. Great pay and  benefits, remote working available, onsite gym, medical facility, cafe."
good,"Started out as a great place to work, with promise of being able to advance after 6 months. After 6 months, however, when a new job position was posted, it was required to have been there for at least a year. The opportunity to move up doesn't come around very often, and with a new call center opening recently in Panama, it appears as though there's a restructuring going on with more opportunity for them to downsize than for employees to move up. Also many other call centers in the area increased their pay significantly (Approx $2/hour) with the tax breaks, but they only increased by approx 50 cents."
good,"Most experiences at Pitney Bowes are customer dependent. Some customers are extremely demanding, while others are more reasonable and easier to get along with."
good,Pitney Bowes was good for entering corporate but the management style is questionable and was not employee friendly. Better management would bring the department further.
good,I would not recommend PB they focus on sales but do not care about the customer just the $.  Most of the service technicians are nol longer Pitney employees but third party companies.
good,"I was under the impression I would be doing more technical work with this job, but in the end it was more mechanical repairs of mail machines. It was interesting work, but not the best fit for my skill set."
good,"Pitney Bowes built its empire through mailing. Through savvy business ideas early on, they were able to dominate mail. They are still the major player, but, mail is not a growth industry. They are focusing on long term options. It will be interesting to see how they navigate the dense Cloud computing space."
good,Started my business to business career here and they taught me the business to business space. Had only one good manager while I was there who taught me to cold call. Severed 80% of the sales staff in January 2011. I moved on.
good,"The company was Borderfree, later acquired by Pitney Bowes. Convenient location, nice office, plenty of snacks, easy-going coworkers. Work is work, can't complain much."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are cut out for sales. Unfortunately sales was not the right position for me and this was made clear by management. If you are good at sales and are very confident, outgoing and have 'banter' then you will do well and earn very very good money. However, if you are not so good at this you will notice a decline in help and the attitude of the office does change a lot towards you!"
good,"It's a mix.  Good people, but hectic schedule with direction that keeps changing.  Stressful, as more people are cut the rest are left to pick up the pieces."
good,"Good place to get started but if you have experience  the compensation is no good. It is hard to move up the ladder. The place is too dusty and not cleaned. lack of proper people in management positions.Need better pay, the equipment is too old. How can you say you are innovative and have an old fashioned mind set? Need to be upgraded to the latest production equipment and computer systems."
good,"Loved the company and people I worked with everyday, but did not like the Pitney Bowes people I worked with. This was not a very challenging position and did not provide much variety regardless of what the interviewer tells you."
good,"To many cut backs, to few employees, work load overwhelming most days. Little timely support from management! Poor communication from upper management!  Constant expectation to work on products you are not trained on, and have never seen!  Best part of the job is the customers!"
good,"Can learn some new things and projects.  Can work independently on volume of work. Have support of other team members.  Quiet place, if you like that, to work"
good,The customers you deal with on a day to day are rude and always in a hurry. You will be forces to try to sell on all calls even if they call for support
good,"went out on current sales leads and also tried to gather new sales accounts, was a tough sell and they pay was not great. worked with a great manager and fun sales team but was not what i was into selling"
good,I loved working at pitney Bowes managment services . In the morning I sorted and audited mail and then had my own route . After lunch I maintnannced 115 copiers  and had a company van that I drove to other locations . Unsupervised from lunch til work was over for the day . I enjoyed the job very much. .
good,The job has a ton of stability. Opportunities for overtime if wanted and sometimes forced. Management changes too often.
good,"Running the daily operation of the mailroom and some facilities work while providing excellent customer service to all clients, was surrounded by a great group of co-workers weather working individually or as a team they were wonderful to work with completing all tasks put before us. Lead by a knowledgeable team of management all customer inquiries, duties, and jobs were meet to completion with customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was the job security with layoffs constant because of loss of contracts to underbidding competitors made for an uneasy feeling not knowing how long would you have a job and would you get reassigned to another building under contract if you lost your job, this and the lack of advancement with qualified employees staying in the same position for years not being able to move up with company was very disheartening. Because of this at times morale would be low just a simple good job can lift spirits and make your co-workers feel more appreciated."
good,"Poorley managed, no growth or support, most"
good,Easy typical warehouse job. Pay wasn't good nor the raises. Friendly people and management. I knew everything from machine operating to forklift but was still getting paid minimum sorter wage.
good,"process mail for 330 members house of reps, team player. Getting all the work out. Cross trained in other dept, recognition from team leader."
good,The Client We Worked For Was Very Appreciative Towards Pitney Bowes Workers.
good,It was a very learning position. I actually liked the work just wasn't manage correctly.
good,"Travelled a great deal and stayed in various cities for months at a time. "
good,"Responsible for shipping and mailings internationally and domestic which included packages, insurable items/goods, etc."
good,Unfairly challenging. Lack of od no communication. Good opportunities to learn. But not a good place to advance.
good,"Monitor servers on networks to ensure that they function efficiently, monitoring performance of the network and troubleshoot any problems such as slow performance or network crashes and  Keep documented records, problems and errors as well as the steps taken to solve the problems and to prevent them from happening in the future."
good,"A typical day was balancing between customer demands and trying to sell an overpriced product to people that had less and less of a need for that product.  Losing potential sales to a internal sales team that could offer rates and terms that we had no access too. Co-workers were great, fun to work with and enjoyable people."
good,"My day at work is trying to make sure that my job is done accurately, fast and sufficient. I was once chosen to manage a team of 15, because my lead was out sick for a couple of days. I love being part of a team and learning new things. I learned every process   at my job, so I can pretty much be place or utilized where they need me. I make sure that everyone that works around me learn the process as best as they can. I don't pressure anyone because I feel learning should be fun and should come freely."
good,"I enjoyed working the night shift.  Yes, it was a bit stressful because of the timing but I adapted and enjoyed working with a team of hard working, dedicated people.  We were cross trained for all the jobs involved in that shift.  This made it more productive for the shift and the company."
good,"working emails taking inbound calls, Ive learned all systems in the facility and all major account programs. Management very communicative and responsible. Hardest part of the job is taking the inbound calls from the customers cause you never know what you are going to get"
good,This place is nice to work.My colleagues are very friendly &  helpful.Work environment is very good.We believe in working as a team.
good,"Needs restructured. Happy with onsite managers."
good,"Learned to work together as a team in extreme work conditions. I learned alot about the shipping process. Management kept on top of what was going on. My co-workers were like family and worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job was learning how to label the boxes on the line in a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the day is our break times, because we all gather around and talk."
good,Typical day at work was starting your day and getting right to work. I learned quickly that the opportunity for advancement was little to none. Management had huge flaws although there were those who were great at their job and handled issues well. Co-workers were the best and made the day fun. The hardest part of the job was being motivated when leadership was lacking in positivity. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help and consult with the customers in a way that gained their trust.
good,Overall Good Compant with Family values in mind and Customer Service Oriented.
good,Overall Good Place to work but unfortunatelly moved around too much until finally moved out of VA area.
good,Outsourcing nightmare. Management is self serving. Recent year was my worst ever with the company.
good,"stressful,under staff,under paid,over worked,co worker are not trained,the hardest part of my kob is working with a group of people that dont work together as a team..the most enjoyable part of the job is the end of the shift..management is not on the same accord,alot of micro managing going on.."
good,"Work, began at 8:00 a.m. with mail coming in, most days we would sort over 3,000 pieces a day. We learned how to sort legal mail, dispute mail, and non-dispute mail. We worked with accounting department, with funds that would came in everyday. Management would help when, the work would have a deadline. My co-workers would work like a team to get the job, done. At the end of the day, I would work the mail equipment to get the mail out, to go to the post office. The most enjoyable part of the day, will be when all the employee's work together, and we have completed the task for the day."
good,Typical day at work: A normal 8-5pm schedule that revolved around service level agreements mutually decided upon by company/client.
good,"lots of work and mandatory overtime, no time for family or friends no perks and under paid."
good,"Pitney Bowes is a dying company with no future. Although i still enjoy my job at troubleshooting this highly sophisticated equiptment, i still feel there is no future here."
good,Good company. Could not advance to Sales Management in timely fashion due to the phasing out of management jobs.
good,Great company to advance in a career in. I love working with the many and different people.
good,"I found working for Pitney Bowes conflicting in that their values stated that the customer comes first but in the end I was placed between two management teams (Pitney Bowes and Host company) who did not have the same view. My host company was pitted against the views of my management at Pitney Bowes. This caused a conflict as I continued to follow the path of the company values, putting my efforts into the request of the host company while not compromising any directive of Pitney Bowes Management. I was continually assigned more duties without any regard or discussion. I did not receive any type of new hire training for three years even when it was requested multiple times. If I did not do for myself then it did not get done. There was no support. I was constantly asked to promote morale boosters where all costs came out of my pocket and I was not allowed to get reimbursement. I did not feel that management had my back and I was placed in a position to defend my managers actions when the ball dropped. If my manager would have just said Good Morning to the Host company staff that would have gone a long way. It was a weird environment to be in and I now know it is not for me. I will say my direct reports were supportive and very hard workers."
good,"To many indians and not enough cheifs, there is alot of drama but there are some pretty cool people  there as well and people are very helpful when needed"
good,Employees feel like they can call HR for any reason and HR supports them better than management. If you don't have many direct report management feels like they can leave when ever they feel like.
good,micromanaged and coached often. Beneficial commission if you are exceeding monthly budget. Poor communication between departments creating poor customer experience.
good,Things are starting to look up for the better with more hours and better Managers. You just need to come in everyday and do your job and go home like every other place.
good,I have worked for the company for almost 3 years and I find that the end of every quarter is a pressure filled rush to bring in as much revenue as possible. Company is focused on bringing in money but they do not uphold certain past due issues that really should which would increase cash brought in.
good,I loved the people I work with but seemed like we did all the work and management just sat around on the computer and check Facebook and other Myspace
good,"Company was a great company to work for back in the day, But just let it go management didn't care for employees any more no special partys, get togethers etc"
good,"I enjoy working with the my fellow co-workers, I would like to see everyone compensated better than they are. It seems that the raises are minimal for today's economy. We our a very diverse company with many cultures. Also I applied for a position here which they gave to an outside individual with absolutely no mail service background. This really left a bad taste with me as I have been working in the mail environment for most of my working career."
good,"It was okay, Poor Management, I felt as if I could have been trained better as it relates to operating the sorting machine. I also dealt with several immature employees."
good,Plenty of SAAS based systems.  Good products.  Need additional training and more ongoing training.  New computer sales systems are still working out all the bugs
good,I learned a lot working as a supervisor at Pitney Bowes but the company doesn't provide good training. I like the diversity and pay was isn't all that
good,The working environment is nice and welcoming. But the only challenged that comes with the job deals with standing and walking around the machine while production is on.
good,"Its been over 25 years since I worked there and they moved on to other markets. But overall was a typical fortune 500 Company."
good,"Pitney Bowes as a whole has really done a lot in the technology department when it comes to advancing certain products or services. As far as the postage meter side of the company, the business is very cut throat and commission based. The requirements for sales and retention were set too high in a dying business. Lots of companies are pinching pennies and the first things to usually go are the luxury items such as the postage meters. Unfortunately, because of the decline in business, my department was closed with no option of transferring to another area within the company since other positions were as max allowance or the next closest facility was half way across the country."
good,"Pitney Bowes is trying to reinvent itself in a shrinking market, and cannot seem to settle on consistent direction. There is something to be said for the ""stay the course"" mentality. I would like to see Pitney Bowes choose 3 things to be be exceptional at and make a prolonged and concerted effort to achieve those objectives."
good,In its early years PBMS was an exciting place to work.  We were a leader in the industry and we continued to grow by expanding our client base.  There was training and opportunity for advancement.  However in the early 2000s we began to cut labor and real estate.  It became apparent that outsourcing was not a business the parent company wanted to remain in.  As cuts continued the client base deteriorated.  By 2009 it was no longer an exciting place to be.
good,"always moving fast"
good,Was at this company for some yrs until taken over by new management. Everything was good until then.  Pay compensation changed as well as benefits and appreciation for employees
good,"I just felt underpaid for the work and conditions there. You are on your feet all day and you don't make a lot of money. If you stay long enough, they may make you permanent and then you are able to make more but, not much more."
good,Company has a lot of good hardworking employees. Only issue is that the management is runned by people that needs more managerial training skills in dealing how to help employees advance in the field of work and not to discourage them on any interest in other departments.
good,"A typical day could consist of many things as you would deal with filling the copy machines each day, changing toners, doing copy jobs for employees, binding books for presentations for employees. Logging in and delivering UPS Packages, burning discs and other stocking duties as well as clean up duties. Hardest part of the job was probably having to bind about 200 books for presentations and meetings. The most enjoyable was my co-worker."
good,"Eigenständiges Arbeiten wurde gefordert, ich war beim Servicezweig von Pitney Bowes, der PBMS tätig."
good,Not many perks.  Job was fairly easy to grasp.  I became very proficient at it.  WAY too many middle-level managers with very few responsibilities.  The people I worked with ere very knowledgeable and cooperative...pleasant to work with.
good,"The industry was having to deal with email and the lose of millions of mailed bills, letter and more."
good,"The company used to be good many years ago. However now it is cut throat. They treat you as if you are a number and all they care about is dialing the phone. The customer experience is horrible. They run out of product so they do not ship the product, therefore you do not get paid on the commission that you earned. You can never take time off at the end of the month. Told that people will be loosing jobs because the company is not doing well."
good,"This environment is in constant flux with systems platforms always changing to meet a need to consolidate processes worldwide.  Although some persons have been with the company forever, new personnel turnover is very high."
good,"Typical workday included cold calls each day then call on existing customers to try to upgrade equipment or sell new equipment. "
good,The place is ok. It has some rude people there but you can manage to succeed there if you choose to. Easy money just stay out of the bull that goes on there.
good,"I worked for PBMS (a division of PBI), and there was 'always chaotic situations arising, and upper management had to clue how to solve them without terminating the lesser person involved. Many 'shady' deals and working there was not easy (though their clients never knew it)."
good,Had no problem with the company  it was worth the job they just count a lot of people out sometimes  the co worker was awesome to work with everybody worked together
good,The job at Pitney & Bowes was ok the leads and supervisors were not helpful and did not know how to give direction on what to do and managers that mislead you.

good,"Answered incoming calls and direct to appropriate department"
good,"A typical day involves calling Pitney Bowes clients to find out if they are stocked on their supplies or if they need more Postage Meter Ink, Tape sheets which are the sticky labels for larger packages and other supplies for their postage meter. I've learned to handle rejection well in sales and learn how to overcome objections. Most of our management at Pitney Bowes are very driven and motivational and assist us with whatever questions or concerns we have.The hardest part of the job is the high pressure sales goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is with focus and determination you can push yourself to be the best in sales and that is a great feeling."
good,"On the presort side, pay starts at 8.50, you only get one raise a yr, and it's usually no more than $.20. The turn over rate is also really bad which means theres always room for promotion."
good,"Worked with very good workers, upper management, team lead and supervisors were  great workers and HR is great, regular co-workers were not very good to communicate with sometimes, everyone was very nosy, knew things about you just by telling one person, very gossipy. Job environment was not too bad, nice people to work with. Everyone treats each other well. Hardest part was keeping up with mail as it comes out of bins, with experience it is not too bad, high pace environment so some can handle it, some can't."
good,Once I started working the overtime that was said to be mandatory and was making more money than the Site Manager I was still made to work the overtime but instead of monetarycompensation I was made to take comp hours to be used only midweek.
good,My day at work would include sorting out mail that comes out the machine and putting it in the correct tray labeled with the correct zip code and postage. I learned about the operations and worked in the different areas of the ware house like grabbing and sorting the trays from the conveyor in dispatch to operating the machines used to sort the mail. The management was fair and I had no problem with any of my co workers. The hardest part of the job was pre sorting the mail the most enjoyable time was clocking out.
good,Typical day was very busy considering I worked the third shift. Hours were long. This job will have you in shape and fit!
good,"I pick up ticket request, and drive to my customer. I would drive to most of the DC customer during the day. I had no inter acting with management."
good,"I put files away , I set up new offices and cubicles for new employees and I do data entry also order supplies and take care of the break room and move furniture as needed."
good,"I was inventory control and loved my job besides the managers.  They would show favoritism to certain people. Co workers were great, almost everyone worked very hard.  I enjoyed the fast pace and little supervision to do my job to the best I could."
good,Nice place and the people were very friendly.  I learned about the call center life how to handle the calls.  I really enjoyed being there and learning the different systems.
good,My time at PB was brief as my project was to integrate two customer service teams as a result of an acquisition. I learned a great deal from a close counterpart who took me under their wing to show me the business.  The most difficult part of the job was not getting the support I needed from my direct manager; there was quite a bit of turnover and moving of positions.  I was grateful for the experience.
good,"*Companies being re-structured"
good,It has provided me with job security and many opportunities to learn new applications and programs and to hone my project management skills. It is in transition as it looks for opportunities now that traditional mailing is on the decline.
good,"Pitney Bowes Provides Office Services and Hospitality for the Legal"
good,"Twelve hour work days beginning at 6:00AM and ending at 6:00PM. Most service calls are due to operators failure to properly setup the machine prior to job start. Several different things can cause an error of a single machine problem. There are several mechanical adjustments and software parameters that effect proper machine operation. Onsite Supervisor is very attentive and approachable. He addresses every issue promptly. My co-workers are very helpful and are willing to share their own experiences with machine issues they have encountered. The most difficult part of the job is getting the operators to do proper machine setup prior to starting the machine. Proper setup would eliminate several problems that the operator faces. When the machine malfunctions over and over again, the operators attitude becomes unpleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving the machine in good running order and the operator smiling as I walk away from my repair."
good,Morale wasn't the best. It was a better company to work for around 4 years ago
good,I learned how EDI and an E commerce platform enhances international shipping. The most enjoyable part of my job is spent doing research whether it be finding a lost parcel or figuring out a claim request.
good,"Worked at Pitney Bowes for seven years, and unfortunately their equipment did not keep up with the times and they lost 30-40 percent of their product base to competition, and laid off 50% of their national sales and support workforce."
good,"A typical day at Pitney bowes is presorting mail by zip code, as well as inventory (loading and unloading mail unto truck), data entry on mail received and mail leaving, talking to other business's via email and phone (trucking company & post office) wrapping barrels of mail, and spraying stamps on parcel mail as well as first class mail. I learned basically everything there is to know about the weight, transport, and packaging of mail. Management was more so stayed in office and employees were often left unsupervised which led to a lot of employees not actually working. The hardest part of the job was waiting on truck drivers or the struggle of everyone staying awake during shift ( midnight shift 10 p.m. to 6 am). The most enjoyable part of my job was the sense of feeling like i was  very important to the partner businesses that we partnered with. I did data entry and inventory, without me the numbers wouldn't add up correctly."
good,"A typical day at work consists of sorting bulk mailing into their proper zip codes. I have learned how to use a mail sorting machine, a pallet jack, how to use different software programs for the mail machines. Some of my co-workers are easy going and fun to work with, there really isn't a hard part to the job and the most enjoyable part of my job is those that I interact with on a daily basis"
good,Looking for stability with a company I can retire with!
good,"Great job to have, just meeting different people."
good,"They made like they where for people, but it was not like that at all."
good,Mail room associate is good more for a young person or some one who does plan on working that long. You are working for a company that is working for another company. So there is no guarantee that they company will renew.
good,Overall Pitney Bowes is a great company. I learned a lot about selling against competition and gained a lot of computer skills. They offer awesome benefits and they have good opportunity for advancement. They also have a very in depth training program. They also have a lot of support for sales such as a solutions specialist and competitive specialist. I can not say much for the management however. They also demand a lot of personal time for work and the compensation does not make it feel worthwhile to work so many hours. I enjoy the interaction with clients and potential clients.
good,Pitney Bowes started falling apart when the CEO changed. Supervisors were nasty a lot of the time.
good,"If you are a person that will do anything to make it to the top, this is the employer to seek."

good,It was a great place to work for several years but they did not stay competitive and these poor decisions are not helping Pitney Bowes to be a successful company.
good,"This was a job in the ever shrinking (to be nice) mail industry.  We were presort facility that presented already sorted mail to the USPS for a VAR (Value Added Rebate).  The margin on this was tenths of a cent per piece and as mail volume declined each year, so did the opportunities at this company."
good,"Goal oriented, productive, ready to expand. Held multiple positions from Mail Center to Switchboard/Receptionist.  Ordering of supplies, scheduling of meetings.  Supervision of multiple employees."

good,"Fast paced and stressfull. "
good,"First starting in PB was a fun experience.  Everyone worked together. PB was like a big happy family.  Over the years with new CEO's, it became all about them and not PB anymore, so the company and the work environment changed.  I still love what I do and enjoy coming to work, but not like before.  You still need to have fun and enjoy who you are working with, like one big happy family.  I just don't come to work for a paycheck.  I have high expectation of myself and my co-workers."
good,"It s been quit a while since I have been employed by Pitney Bowes Management Services (PBM). From what I remember about PBM was the opportunity  to come in at a entry level job,very young, and get experience in the professional environment."
good,It was marvellous and best experience I ever had to work with Pitney Bowes Software India Pvt. Ltd. I have learned so many new things which will help me in my future career. It is my pleasure to worked with one of the famous IT software company.
good,"I was a temporary employee here twice.  I'm told they actually requested me the second time. I enjoyed the second time more because I was in the technical troubleshooting department. When they offered me full time employment with benefits, they wanted me in sales.  I explained I don't like sales and would find it hard to sell a product that I wouldn't by."
good,"The building was depressing, but the work was easy. The people were nice. The work could be overwhelming at times, but isn't too much to handle. Over all, the job isn't bad if it is for a short amount of time."
good,"the mailing company is very fast pace just how i like it, the mail come out really fats into zip codes and u have to stay up with it!! its a company that worth what u work for"
good,"Overall working at Pitney Bowes was a good Experience.  They are very focused on Employees and especially their health.  There was a small exercise room we were allowed to use as well as computers with treadmills which allowed us to get up and walk for up to an hour a day."
good,After being part of the sales team for a few years i quickly moved into  a management role.  I took a team that was failing in every avenue and turned them around to be top producers.  I look forward to finding a job where i can use all my skills to ensure revenue for that company.

good,"After being there for 9 months, the workload was getting lighter and had I not been looking for a job closer to home, they were going to cut an employee down to part-time"
good,"This is a great job for someone that is looking for a summer job or just a little pocket change, the pay is alright. The environment is okay. The work load can be a bit much and sometimes it can be overwhelming. Management could have been better, our supervisor was pretty friendly and helpful but the shift leads were a pain in the neck and often only looked out for certain people and left the others to do the hard work. Overall I would only recommend this company if you are in desperate need of a job, but if you can find something better then leave after about a year."
good,The company struggles with it's vision for the future and how to successfully reinvent itself.  2008 really hurt the companies customer base.
good,Good vacation and benefits with education reimbursement to acquire additional education/degrees.  Flexible work environment offering some work from home days for some positions with yearly team building activities.
good,"Work environment, for the most part, was relaxed -monotonous at times. Volunteering to help other coworkers, inside or outside the department, made the days go by quicker. "
good,I was able to coach and develop agents for promotional opportunities.  I loved working for Pitney Bowes because they cared about their employees.
good,"we would start with  a ten minute huddle with all staff, production goals and what is expected from every employee, Quality control was a big priority. hardest part of my was trying to get to employees to work as a team, most enjoyable that i was engaged with all my staff members and treated them fair.

good,"Good training provided."
good,"During my eight years while employed at Pitney Bowes, I had the opportunity to work in several different areas of the company. I became comfortable working one on one with upper management and developed many close friendships there. The hardest part of the job was organizing your day as it felt that there was never enough time in the day to get all my daily tasks completed while  ensuring that I was servicing the client in a timely and efficient manner. I loved having my own clients that I worked with on a regular basis as their account manager and developing a trusting relationship with them and being their go-to person. The management is about putting the cleint first; however, their policies do not allow that as way to many policies, which in turn is very frustrating for the client"

good,"I first was extremely happy to work for PB but as the work started piling up and each day's work was never fully completed. The best part of working there was my co-workers. We all worked as a team and that's how we all got through the deadlines successfully. The phone calls were never ending with descrepancies that needed resolutions. More staff members were needed but were never hired. Soon, news came out that our jobs were being outsourced, eventhough managers were saying our jobs were to stay. Who knows whos job will be gone tomorrow. It would be nice to keep the American people in their jobs."
good,Recevie mail check it in check machines make lables its a pretty easy job
good,"I would get up and drive to my first call, sometimes it was close to home and sometimes it was a two hour drive. I enjoyed the travel time. After the first call I would get my next and than next until the day was over.

Then six months later I was laid off again with the same reason, position was eliminated nationwide. I was told they wanted me back but they didn't have anything for me at that time. I started the hiring process with another organization when they called me and hired me back for a second time in six months. Soon after starting back I received the offer from the other company. Given the circumstances I decided to accept and leave PB behind. I loved working there and I respect my manager but I needed something more stable. They're tied to the USPS and have no choice but to continue shrinking. When I started I was one of 12 and when I left I was one of four."
good,"My job has no future. There is no room for advancement. I was told within 6 months of my start date, I would not be doing a mail route. I was supposed to moved to more of a clerical administrative role. That was 3 years ago. And I don't see it changing."

Later in the day Fed-Ex and UPS drop off boxes and other packages, and we sort and deliver them to the clients like the mail. We also maintain and re-stock the pantries on the floors each Messenger is assigned to, Management are some what helpful and my was a joy to work with."
good,"Best part of the job was the relative autonomy I had on my route.  Declining mail volumes have hit this company hard, causing many of the perks of working here to disappear.  Had to leave because it was becoming apparent that this location would soon be closed."

I had to sort mail on each line and was on my feet for 8 hours. I learned how to do my job and do it effectively. Management was very friendly however some of my co-workers were diificult to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to stay focus and not getting bored with the work I was doing.

good,"It is a typical 8-5 job siting at a desk, while answering phones and greeting everyone who comes into the building. I have learned how to work in a fast past business environment, while being polite and courteous. The management has a lot to go in being the best. There where a lot of trouble with either trying to communicate to them, or them waiting till the last minute to communicative to you. The co-workers however were wonderful, willing to help in anyway they can. The hardest part really was the managers, I believe that if they were better trained and more compassionate, I would have still been working for them. Though being able to move about into different building or working with different people was a blast."

They lack a lot on discipline and mostly everyone that is a hard worker get blamed on low productivity because they do not punish those who are lazy and slack off.

good,"It was required to aggressively target and penetrate key accounts including competitive wins. I would generate new business opportunities by cold calling and prospecting within my territory. It was key to maintain professional relations with current and prospective customers via telephone, email and face-to-face communication. In order to maintain quota the ongoing organization of my sales funnel and monthly forecast was crucial. The reach quota, I deliver comprehensive sales presentations to key decision makers as well as design and negotiate contracts.

I found out that I am not cut out for cold calling in sales or for being away from home a lot. It was a good experience but the wrong job for me. At the time, I worked in central New Hampshire but had to report in to the Portland/Westbrook Maine office. This was supposed to be for 30 days and then I was supposed to be transferred to the Manchester, NH office which was a lot closer to my home. Nine months later this had not happened and I still had to make the at least once weekly meetings and overnights to Maine.

Only interacted with co-workers at lunch or on break. If management was ever needed, we had to throw up white flags to have a manager come over to our desks. So not much interaction with them either. Hardest part of the job is the work environment. It was very restricted and limited. All belongings needed to be locked in a locker including cell phones, pencil, paper, etc. Also had to walk through metal detectors each day."
good,Good benefits and good work flow. Similar routine from day to day. but it's okay if you don't mind it. Pay could be a lot better.

good,Relaxed friendly environment with employee friendly policies. Down side was that not too many challenges and very slow pace of work. Opportunities of growth limited
good,This could be a great job but the workload is hectic and sometime your work is not appreciated. The pay rate is not good either. The company needs to train the temporary employees a little better so the work performance is better.
good,Worked for some great manager.  Good place to start your career.  Tightly run organization.  The part that worked for has been sold though.  I don't believe they provide management services anymore.
good,"Scanning of records, documenting information into system, not much socializing because work had to be done. Lack of communication when asking for assistance"
good,Working at Pitney Bowes is a good start for someone who does not have a degree and needs experience and is willing to learn. Must like to talk on the phone and be somewhat a people person.
good,"dinamicità,innovazione mensa aziendale,ambiente giovanile"
good,PB was a multi function company. There were many departments to transfer to. They provided monthly training courses to expand your skills. The manager was always willing to work with me for time off.
good,Poor management . Favoritizm . They will lie on you if they dont like you. Pay rate is low even tho they just had a pay raise. The culture there is great lots of diversity!
good,"I was hired to work for an accounting firm. The environment was professional, and coworkers were knowledgeable. The work load could be a bit overwhelming, due to short staff."
good,"the past two years provided the most growth professionally and personally"
good,Learned a lot of mechanical skill sets working for Pitney.  Enjoyed the challenge.  Shift were 12 hour a day 3 to 4 days reg but with many extra days to pick up.  Overtime was good but worked all the time.
good,It's a simple job but the pay and the physical work is unfair. Fact of the is I only took this job because the original job I was hired for and passed all test for they which my location which is not on the busline.
good,"Too long ago to provide an answer to this question. I had a good boss (VP Marketing) but he was moved to a different position in the company. The new VP Marketing said he didn't understand my job and let me go, and then he was released three months after he let me go"
good,"I really had a great time working with Pitney Bowes. The supervisory managers were, generally, good and hard working veterans of the company and had a good head on there shoulders. Unfortunately, mail is a dying business and I just couldn't continue to stay as each quarter revenue fell despite working tirelessly as a whole department to increase revenue."
good,"Worked alone. Calls came in, I returned the call to the customer. Drove to the customers site. Fixed there problem. Replaced other parts that was going bad. Talk the customer and insured the problem was completely."
good,very busy setting most days. Lots of teamwork required to get the job done efficiently. Management is good but not able to touch base with team as required.
good,I really liked working for Pitney Bowes. I advance from many positions. It was a fun place to work too. I meet many different people and enjoyed my time with them.
good,"Compensation was fair"
good,The environment was a little nicer compared to my other call center job. The team of co-workers that I had were great. Management however needed to work on support. I realized I did not want to be stuck in call center work so I decided to move on.
good,Top notch local management. Worked with great Developers and QA Engineers. Lots of work/life balance. Great flexibility with flex time. I often had evening calls with other geographies and was able to leave early and take those calls from home.
good,"The staff is full of high school drama. Management is mostly immature with a few reasonable members. Work load and expectations are too high, but would be manageable if not for the lazy co-workers."
good,"very little opportunity to advance, no increase with random staff reductions. no stability and upper management was non existent. will not recommend. left employees to fend for them selves."
good,Great place to work however limited progression in the office I worked. You had to be at the main offices. Company is making an effort to make employees feel included.
good,"PB is a good solid place to work. You get to interact with all different kinds of people, it's a steady, fast work place. Very good job security. i recommend this place to anyone looking for a good stable job."
good,Pitney Bowes was a good company. We were under a contract. We lost the contract after many years. I really enjoyed my job and the management was great.
good,"Great place to work, great work life balance, great culture.  management is good. but be prepared to never make much more that you start out at.  The company rarely gives out big raises if any.  Much more if you get promoted, you can only make 15% more that you currently make anything over that requires CEO approval., seriously!"
good,"You have a lot of freedom. Obviously you are expected to meet/exceed your goals. Hitting those goals have become tougher and tougher every year. The company has been downsizing its sales force for several years now leaving little room for advancement. Given the right territory, sales reps can attain a good income,"
good,"Its a really good company to work for. There are many locations, sites and Accounts all around the TriState areas. All levels of work and skill levels jobs available."
good,"An overall decent place to work. Aside from the coddling of the lazier employees. If you are a bad employee, lazy, or cant get along with other people, they will find a place for you somewhere and they won't ever get on to you. So for the hardworking employees such as myself this means overworking yourself to make up where others are lacking. Other than that the management team is really respectable and a pleasure to work with. The company doesn't pay fairly IMO, hence my search here on indeed. People seem to be constantly leaving since I started working there so it seems there is lots of room for advancement. The benefits seem to be fair other than the 401k match which is around 4% and I know some other companies do 6. They have a lot of raffles that go on throughout the year which you can win by getting tickets which can be earned by getting noticed doing a good job."
good,"Typical Day At Pitney Bowes: you come in, greet your co-workers, put your things in the locker, clock in & go to your assigned line & start work. It may start off slow or fast, no in between. "
good,benefits were very good training was a must great team and good people nice breaks and food was brought in many times by staff great friendly staff of people
good,"Our group (company) was acquired a few years ago as we were a direct competitor. Many of the team felt we were the ""red headed stepchildren"" . Corporate made little effort to change that culture. "

Presort Services network provides mailers with end-to-end solutions from pick up at their location to delivery into the postal system.
good,"I liked my position and accompanying work load. I was able to learn a lot of different aspects of the overall operation. I was able to learn inventory control, QC, shipping and receiving, customer service and several other aspects of the operation."
good,"Pitney is a cool company but, not a company to retire from as a CSA (customer service associate or supervisor). For a multi-million dollar company they should compensate employees with a  substantial pay increase."
good,"Overall Pitney Bowes/Novitex provided me with a huge amount of experience to grow, and work with many types of people on a day to day basis.  "
good,"Pretty fair in work/life balance. Good compensation. It's been quite a while since I have worked there, but they had great opportunities for advancement and really good benefits when I was there. Management generally pretty fair and down to earth. Company has changed a lot over the years with reorganization, not positive where they are at now with job security."
good,"The work at pitney bowes was very easy what I didn't like was the hours. I would come to work and set up my line using Microsoft words. This job was confidential because we were working with credit cards, doctors letters to patients, dmv, and colleges, etc. I learned how mail was sorted and I learned how to operate a machine. The co-workers were very nice and respectful. They made you feel welcome."
good,Typical day was pretty much the same.  Clocked in and set up our area to begin work.  Look at any new changes and pin up to view while we were on the phone.  Signed in on the phone system and set up head sets and began work taking calls for orders and questions or concerns customer may have.  The hardest part of the job was getting help when there was a question.  It was hard to get noticed when we needed help.  Management changed frequently which made things uncomfortable.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,I enjoyed my work at Pitney Bowes while I was an employee and later as a contractor.
good,"Benefits and compensation was good for technicians and management, but job security and advancement in the division I worked in is not great. No set schedule either make for a harder life balance and sometimes you would need to use vacation/personnel time off to ensure you could have family time during the year. Worked on technician jobs or in operations some days to complete the work load."
good,"Hardest part was finding my way around SAIC Building 12 floors and 4 towers, not to until doing daily mail runs and sending outgoing ups and fedex and postal mail."
good,"Answering emails, running daily operations. I learn how to manage over 45 drivers on a daily basis . "
good,"I can't stand the way management approach people, They have no respect for their employees, The pay is way to little for the kind of work you do and the way you are treated...I see people quitting almost every day."
good,"J'ai apprécié de m'occuper du salon du bourget, je devias réaliser des documents pour préparer cette événement."
good,"Enjoyed learning something new everyday. Call center for the mint, never knew how big coin collecting was. Management was firm but fair. Worked with a good group of people."
good,I worked there for almost three years. In that time I only saw one person from my department actually get a promotion. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"Nothing bad or good to really say. It was a warehouse job, who really enjoy those jobs. It was more about the pay then anything, they do pay fair to mostly everyone that i know of."
good,"Utilizing self-discipline and prioritization, a typical day included a significant time spent on project management and planning, while also accomplishing large amounts of administrative work due to cuts around the organization. Projects were large, fast-paced, and extremely demanding, however great satisfaction could be achieved by finalizing a tangible, complete site where the organization could continue to grow. Decisions at the corporate level often works a major barriers to successful completion, however, creating a difficult, contentious work environment at times."
good,"Faced paced, strenuous work."
good,Management is inconsistent and often advancement is based on politics rather than merit. Significant disconnect between stated company values and demonstrated ones.
good,"my typical day of work was mostly cleaning, helping checking people in and out and help out co-workers"
good,- A typical day is never typical since there are unique issues every day.
good,"Resolving financial, human resource and operational issues. Hardworking dedicated customer service staff. Managemnent dedicated to finding business solutions."
good,In the job the I work there is not much room for growth . I would have to move into another area to advance . But I like what I do .
good,- Operate power fork lift to provide all required in plant transportation of material
good,It's a consistent place to work where not a lot changes too often.
good,A typical day at work is walk in check in get to your desk and begin to enter data into the database focusing on the priorities in the system. I have learned how business transactions with 2 parties and more are processed and how to upload and create a sharepoint folder and ways to analyze and come to a conclusion with brain storming. co-workers are not too bad some work more than others but thats typical in any business enviorments. Hardest part of the job is the irregular rule changes on invoice instructions. Lunch is the most enjoyable part.
good,Not much knowledge on the company...I was only a temporary employee for Tech Supply
good,Pitney Bowes gave me an opportunity in my life when I did not have very many options and I am very grateful for that.
good,It's okay been working alomost for five years and theres no opening for manegment or to grow with company.
good,Enough said in the summary. J.M. is the best manager! Use this job to build resume then jump ship!
good,"I would definitely go back if the pay was more and we actually got 40hrs a week...."
good,"It's a long work day no matter what department you work in. With any job, you should just find a rhythm and try to enjoy it. However, my work space kept people who were off task constantly and fired at random. They also hired people from the outside, rather off the already trained temp team."
good,"This company is very diverse with a nice culture environment. Work/life balance is good because they have different shifts. Also, plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Good hours with an opportunity of overtime if desired. Flexible schedules, good management, and great work environment. Opportunity for advancement in the work place."
good,I enjoy what I do. I just need more hours in a week.  Management is great and helps when needed. But we went from working 40+ hours to now not getting 40 hours a week.
good,"In charge of 3rd shift maintain 10 machines and customer service expectations. In charge of 10 machines to maintain with break and fix issues, PM's and customer expectation to maintain."
good,"I recently quit 4 days ago.I loved my job the fast pace the challenges it brings .Helping co workers, helping with the operator. I started as a temp and became with company June 2018.I was on probabtion till September and thought my probation was done in August so she said in September that my attendance is an issue to improve so i didnt come late or call off the month of September and October but i did request days off only 3 and I had 40 hrs time off /vacation time.She had told everyone in the meeting that we could request days off because we work weekends and that it wasnt a problem kept me on probation till October pulls me in and said because u requested to many days off your fired but its not my decision it had to go to HR and GM General manager you recieved a CUP forgot what it stands for.So instead of me waiting a day ,week,or even a month to get fired I quit.How was i going to know i would get fired for requesting days off..Honestly i think my supervisor wanted to fire me but needed somthing to use to fire me..To me made me feel like i didnt matter and that it was jus an excuse so i could quit.Didnt get paid the reminder sick pay/vacation pay.She said you don't use them you lose them.I worked in total for this company as a temp and with company a year and 4 months."
good,Not a bad place to work.Other Pitney bowes companies in different areas were better places to work overall it's not a bad place to work if you could put up with some of the favoritism by some management but not all were bad.
good,"Overall, a decent place to work.  High expectations on quota.  If you put in the time and effort you will be rewarded.  Possibility of advancement is there as well."
good,"Mail sorting is very fast paced. Overload of mail can be stressful at time. Might be helpful to have two people sorting mail when operation picks up. Co-workers are very friendly, despite the low staff."
good,"Everything is clockwork at Pitney Bowes. You cant waste any time, even if you are in the bathroom (I seriously mean that). But what else do you expect from a mail warehouse?"
good,Pitney Bowes is a competitive high paced environment that is Extremely Client focused. They focus on learning about their clients needs to ensure that they are fitting them in th best product.
good,"Legacy industry, too much wasted efforts trying to buy innovation. Good place to gain experience but not very stable. Competitive salary, goo benefits."
good,"Pitney Bowes in its day was a great place to work.  Due to shifts in technology and how mail is handled, the company suffered and changed its business model from an outside sales force to an inside sales force."
good,"I enjoyed working for Pitney Bowes, there were good incentives for us, always a nice atmosphere in the office. I had targets to hit each month and always did hit them. There were also bonuses for when we did hit our targets."
good,It is enjoyable working with high speed equipment. My coworkers are exceptionally good people to work with. However there is a high turnover rate and it can be difficult to continually work with new people that require constant training.
good,"Only work is concentrated. learned some new tech, pioneers in e-commerce global shipping. Working with PB has been a good experience."

good,"its a good place to work as far as with the employees but there isn't much room for advancement, and raises are very scarce."
good,"Pitney was good experience. "
good,Very diverse atmosphere with people from all over the world.  There is always room for advancement but only to a particular level.  It is very hard to advance pass team lead.  If you are looking to advance into management it is best to have the educational background to back it up and to hang out with the management.
good,"I think in today's challenging economy, job security is worth more than reward. Having been laid-off, twice by the same company in the last ten years, due to a lack of market in our field, I would rather risk some benefits and rewards, for improved job security."
good,Use to be a graet place to work for.  Now they just laid-off their entire outside sales staff besides the major account reps.
good,Many employees are temp to hire. The sales department was eliminated 3 months after I was hired on full time.
good,I worked in a specific location in business.  Management of the business would interfere with the manager of Pitney Bowes.
good,"Work Hared and Learn a lot."

good,Pitney Bowes Management Services (PBMS) held the Avon facility management contract for a limited amount of time.  They ultimately were outbid and could not compete.
good,"Although I didn't like my role, I did like my team and my boss. It's a very male dominated company and a good amount of folks have been there since they graduated college, which is fine but have developed tunnel vision on how a business and/or department should be run."
good,This was a an straight business development and account management that relied heavily on new and old business development.  Relationship retainment.  It was great place to work.
good,"I tracked, sorted and delivered mail. I learned administration and clerical duties. My direct manager was great. It was a close family like atmosphere. The hardest part of my job is when I wasn't provided tools to perform. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."
good,"Required to use personal vehicle to travel to customer sites.  The vehicle was also used to store a boatload of inventory such as machine parts, shipping labels, tools, etc.  This means, if you wanted to use your vehicle to go grocery shopping, you would have to remove all of those items from your trunk first and then put them back afterwards.  They really didn't have a central warehouse.  Your office was basically your vehicle.  "
good,"I repair and service mail sorting machines including conveyor, industrial printers, hardest part of the job is we are always understaffed and over worked"
good,Because of the small staff the work day was very varied on what you would be working on from day to day.  The executives made it a little challenging but the direct report manager was excellent.
good,I got great benefits offered including 401K and help with Education  they offer to help students with a protion of costs  it's great job I would recommend
good,"I work for and with several departments within PB and had a mostly positive experience.  The biggest issue most people have with this company is that it is a corporation and goes by that outlook.  Once you understand that, it can be a great place to work."
good,as servicing printers & copiers at different location was a lot of excitement. besides being out of the office it gave you the chance to meet others people.
good,Loved working here. Great place to learn and grow as an individual. Management believe in their people. They take chances on individuals. Company environments provides a lot of areas to learn.

good,Lot of work to do. Always very busy every  day good coworker to work around. Good Manager company may not to in city area. Different shifts to work
good,"I can only speak for the manager I had, but the other managers at other locations were not so nice and never tried to help the worker get ahead. I actually worked out of two locations that helped me to make more money but made my car work too hard. The co-workers were great but the people who we delivered mail to, were not always nice.  I left because I had no room to grow and didn't like the corporate backstabbing environment I was surrounded by."
good,"I enjoy working there and my co-workers there.  I enjoy solving problems.  I love to dress to empress with my outgoing personality.  My typical day at work is making people smile and feel comfortable. I learned that all people are different and need to be treated the same."
good,"I myself loved my job! it was exactly what I prayed for.  I liked that everyday was different with different jobs that could be done. If people would work together as a team it was very pleasant.  the Management could have been better but, they tried to please everyone and you just can't do that! All in all you get what you want out of a job!!  Good luck to all who work for Pitney Bowes/ Novitex."
good,"While I enjoyed my coworkers and the environment, the pay was not enough"
good,A great company to learn about sales and management\team building.  We were provided with great product and sales training. I enjoy people and the outside sales position provided me with that experience. I worked with a great group of people which took away some of the stress that is always present in a sales environment.
good,I had many weeks of vacation time available There was a Nurse Practitioner  on staff so you don't have to spend time and money going to the doctor. It was an enjoyable work place until departments were getting closed and relocated to Manila. It became a stressfull place when you never really knew how long your department would be there. Eventually our department was close and relocated to WI.
good,Overall it was a good place to work but the compensation could have been better.
good,"A typical day included me traveling to a client's site to repair malfunctioning mailing equipment. The equipment is typically a lot of mechanics that is PC based, and networked though a client's network. This job taught me how to interact with customers of all sizes from small businesses to medium and large enterprise business. My PC skills improved dramatically while working in this field."
good,Assist with acquiring and sending faxes for our business partners.  Assist with receiving and delivering of faxes to our business partners.
good,the one thing I always like and respect in a job environment is team work....
good,"Pitney Bowes is a mailing company where you sort   mails to go to different post offices, it is a constant  fast moving  environment where you have to be on your feet for eight hours , flexibility is a plus must be able lift up to 25lbs to . it is an interesting job. I enjoy working"
good,Pitney Bowes was a very enjoyable and rewarding place to work. They took good care of their employees with a good rewards and compensation structure and were very pro-active in promoting and supporting a work/life balance for the employee. I enjoyed the relationships with my co-workers and had a lot of respect for the technical abilities of the people I worked with.
good,"the people i worked with were a lot of fun, once you get the hang of the job it is pretty stress less. the benifits were good as well."
good,"I am responsibile for managing accounts that I am assigned to, as far as billing, postage, and service. I start off the day with follow ups that need done, along with any new work that has come in. If there are purchase orders that need to be reviewed for current or expired contract year. I correct any billing issues that need taken care of as well as communicating with sales team on potential problems or concerns. I love my co workers and the environment that we share is a unity to help one another out if need be. The hardest part is getting in all done the 8 hours that your there, but it's also a good thing because it pushes you to have a productive day."
good,"At Pitney Bowes you are constantly trained on new software and new systems in order to serve clients better. Everyone on your team is a team player, which I found very good and postive as well as productive."
good,"Pitney is a comfortable place to work at, you go in knowing what your day is going to be like. People are very friendly and easy to get along with. Teamwork is something we really believe in and look out for each other. The only negative thing about the company is that there is a big communication issue from upper management. The company's future looks very uncertain, therefore making staff members very pessimistic. Asides from that, it is a good company to work for, I just feel the recession took it's toll on the company and need to find a position where I can feel comfortable about having job security."
good,Pay structure is low but overall it is a great place to start a sales career
good,It’s been a great learning experience for me. I learned a lot of different aspects of the mail services that’s Pitney Bowes has to offer. Great training tool if you decide to work USPS.
good,I have enjoyed my employment while working from home (remote)  great hours and challenging. Learning new things is fun. I have learned about technical aspects too.
good,"I liked that job because everyone works together like a team, and everyone is nice to each other. We learn a lot of things. The hardest part is facing some bad customers. But it was a good experience."
good,I liked the job however they would only hire part time for what was classified as excess driver . I liked the managers I worked for with only one draw back and that is they said that I could only get 6 hours a day however when they asked regular full time employees to work overtime or come in on a Saturday no one would volunteer so I would volunteer which they let me work the extra time then the bosses boss would have fits about it because I was only allowed 20 hours a week. I really needed full time work but it was the only job I could find at the time. Note the hours I worked over my 20 hours involved special projects like moving and assembling customer furniture setting up for special events etc. I left this company not because I don’t like it or the work I left for a full time job with benefits.
good,A 98 year old company trying to turn things around to remain relevant.  Creates a challenge in terms of constant cost cutting.  Pay is generally competitive and the company provides excellent work/life balance.
good,"Very Much liked the work from home environment - very productive work place. "
good,Learned new technologies and knowledge.  Manager was very good and I really liked working for him.  Is not a faced paced environment and feels like home.
good,"Pitney Bowes really lacked proper training. Their training was hands on which is not always beneficial when the training is very fast past. Pitney Bowes should provide training materials as well as classroom training prior to hands on training,"
good,"idéal pour commencer dans la vie active, horaire de journé"
good,"Overall a good place to work at with a hard working staff who all worked well as a team, the Management Team were good to work with in completing the heavy workload."
good,"Good management. Good amount of paid time off. Nice benefits."
good,You are not provided a vehicle to use so you must your personal vehicle. You are reimbursed for your mileage but your reimbursement is dependent on the age of your car and the depreciation value. I liked working there but was severely undercompensated.

good,Invested on employee development. Team oriented management style. Good place for training and staff development. Limited Room for advancement to a management role.

good,Complete customer request
good,"This is a laid back company. The only thing that I do not like is on how there is a lot of favoritism meaning but, not limited to if you are a hard worker it goes unnoticed but, if you are a lazy worker when it comes to pay reviews everyone makes the same pay raise. There is no room to grow with this company. I am seeking a future career to where I can grow with, to share my capabilities with other employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for Pitney Bowes, I would go to work and no matter how much I had it was never a problem because i knew i would get compensated and appreciated for the work I did.

good,"A typical day at work is going to a meeting each night and finding out what is expected of me doing the course of the night. My co-workers were very interested in learning what is going with the company as well as other co-workers and management.

The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my co-workers and to learn something new about my job , as well as working on a different machine each night."
good,"The job was ok if you are looking for immediate work, but the overall aspects of the work is very stressful physically as it deals with mail sorting and shipment."

good,I enjoyed working for Pitney Bowes. The only complaint that I had was that employees weren't paid enough for all the extra duties that they had to do.
good,i were required to work in a small work area. it was sometimes hard to function and keep up from being cramped . but it taught me about area codes and the us postal system for future experience and complications
good,So long as you didn't complain about anyone harassing you because of your religion then you were fine.   Don't complain about them cutting your hours.
good,"Seems this company expects you to provide a vehicle for their use, the employee does not benefit, they are used.  Difficult to please customers with what is provided.  High stress."
good,Pitney is a great company to work for unfortunately I don't have much to say about the company to tow my personal reasons that I have to leave the company so I don't know too much about in depth about the company but my time with them was great as the employee I could have stayed there with them for years I like the job the environment
good,"it was a high pace job a lot of walking, bending and standing. I earn printer skills and sorter skills and to lead more. we had a lot of management so the ones that stayed were good.not much culture there. there was not ant hard part for me because i learn fast and do very well. working with enjoyable people."
good,Wasn't professionally organized. Sometimes worked from 4:30pm until 11:30am. Lunch breaks were short due to production demand. I can't give you any more because it was all work and no play atmosphere.
good,"dont have the right people working as supervisors or leads , they understand things if tell them , but supervisors dont know how to talk to people, they well say everything in a bad way, and they had family working there when they say no family in the same shift, there is not chance of growing here."
good,"Hard working employee's, who work as a team to meet the deadlines of the secretary's, paralegals and attorneys. Each day has a new challenge."
good,"I love the people worked with, the management is great, they have little conducive working environment, the hardest part of the job is when you have to do your work with different setting, but the most enjoyable part is the shift it was night and permanent."
good,To many turn overs as far as managers.  All promise the samething and then start over and over again and again.  Never accomplished anything they started to do.
good,"Unfortunately they moved the PB from Cleveland, OH and I was out of a job.  It was good while it lasted."
good,this job is easy to work at once you learn the zip codes and identifiers.i enjoyed working at this place of employment.people are ok to get along with.
good,For the most part Pitney Bowes is not too bad to work for.  Lately there were to many hoops to jump through just to order parts.  In 10 years in Jacksonville I had 8 managers. and only one was local.  With that type of turnover how can you get to know someone and how can they get to know you.
good,"Since you are working for another company, sometimes they would look behind you back too much. crew was good, but management made it stressful. "
good,It was fun working there and its was the same thing everyday funny people there nice the machine was very loud I had set hours you knew what time you was done
good,"Company had a big turnover. Company just filled slots, did not encourage advancement. Poor management selection. Hard to get a hold of the right personnel to resolve issues."
good,"took loads and delivered them, I learned how to tie down loads real good. The management was not real understanding about medical issues and after they were taken care of putting you back to work after you had an all clear from a doctor. I loved driving."
good,Help customers on a daily bases with computer's and PB software. Hours are good.Team members are great. Pay is a little low and growth is none.
good,"A day at work is dealing with customer issues, arranging transportation via FedEx for customers, inputing pickup slips and balancing the counts, prepare to bill customers on a weekly basis.  Do many reports for customers and upper management."
good,"participate in srategy meetings, review of proposal response, assure all contracts personal are engaged"
good,Always know what needs to be done for the day
good,Great management over many years. Employees truly care for one another.
good,A regular day there was kinda pretty mich the same.. if they needed help in other areas the would send me in Different area to help.. but I learned more about RF scanners and more things there so it wasn’t really bad.!
good,"IBM execs were hired recently, and have killed the service aspect of this equipment company, to cut costs.  Management seems to think this is a software company living in the cloud, rather than a supplier and servicer of hardware, primarily."
good,I liked doing my job. It didn't pay enough. We sorted mail and learned a lot about postal service. I liked my job. The pay was not good enough to keep me working at that job after taxes and insurance.
good,"Nothing bad to say about it, nothing too glowing to say about it either. It was a great learning experience but at a cost! I was young and could soldier on through it all, so I keep it as a good memory!"
good,"Enjoyed handling/sending/receiving policies."
good,"Sempre tive muita liberdade na execução das tarefas. Aprendi a lidar com essa liberdade, a importância de se cumprir prazos e de executar as funções com excelência."
good,"Up Keeping on site computer systems "
good,Works hard demanding people want everything yesterday.Especially since clients can be banks law firms and major corporations
good,Daily task consisted of sorting delivering & retrieving mail & packages.I met alot of different people & Congressmen & Congresswomen that was a very rewarding & unique experience for me.
good,"Overall, a good company, with good core values, friendly working environment that offers room for advances to the right professional.."
good,"Então, a empresa é boa, gostei de trabalhar lá, dos funcionários e de alguns gestores"
good,Staff is very welcoming and helpful. Environment is very clean and put together. Little room for advancement. The people who are hired on have been there for years.
good,"I developed systems and procedures to increase the correctness and for the effectiveness for customers contracting copies, fax and mail services.  I also performed management functions including recruiting, training, payroll processing and capturing/reporting of statistical data utilizing Copytrac Equiptrac systems."
good,"Empresa em constante mudanças, ajuda muito as pessoas a se desenvolverem como profissionais e pessoas."
good,"Fast paced, Pitney was an outsourced company working for a major law firm in Manhattan.  We actually took on the culture of the Client.  Their procedures and how to do things."
good,"Supervisors were very good, The work place in general for me was a little over difficult Because I don not speak Spanish, Many of my co workers did not speak or understand English, very hard to communicate with a co-worker"
good,"its quite relax supervisor are very good super cool even the Manager sometimes they even give us free lunch,free work boots..there is a chance for career advancement."
good,Was promised more than I received.  Innovative ideology but no real outlet to advance my skills.  I really do not have much to say other than I liked my co-workers but I hated my manager.
good,"as supervisor on salaried pay you will work from 45 hours a week to over 80 hours a week. it is not uncommon for weekends, nights and conference calls even during your vacation. They will push for more, more, more until you are so beat down you have no family life and can not get away."
good,"Unless you are in sales and meet quotas, you may be let go at any time.  In my time there, I've seen whole departments eliminated over and over to where now the Spokane Center is almost empty."
good,The hardest part of the job is getting there especially if you work the 1st shift. This job is very fast paced and requires you to have a lot of energy and be able to multi-task and move quickly.
good,"Pitney Bowes is a nice company but too many changes, and too many lay offs. Nice cafe, good work life balance. Nice people. Nice medical facility, and gym."
good,"This company had great set hours, benefits, but I did not get along with some of my coworkers and the management of the department.  There was too much favors done."
good,A good company to work for but could pay better for the work required. High call volumes make for a fast but tiring day. On busy days the company does try to do things to help out with the employee environment by providing food and snacks
good,"Pitney Bowes was a great place to work. Everyone was very warm and wanted to help. Unfortunatley no one I worked with knew how to share their knowledge, but they expected me to absorb their knowledge that they didn't share? Asking questions only seemed to frustrate others."
good,"cold calls 4 days a week, supportive management, lots of rejection in sales.  They provide excelling sales training.  Lots of turnover which can cause negative atmosphere at times."
good,I was able to go into interesting places to inspect meters. I inspected postage meters for defects and tampering.  It was a fun job.
good,There is always opportunity. Skills are needed in order to perform daily tasks. There are some days when business is either slow or in high demand.
good,"I really enjoy the job and the staff, but not a fan of the nit picking they do with time management. All in all a nice place to work."
good,"Pitney Bowes has helped me build a network of friends from the work that we have done serving our clients.  It was a fun but semi-hazardous working environment because of all that lifting and transporting of packages and boxes to our client's mailroom."
good,"I have been at Pitney Bowes for more than two years and have enjoyed it, but was informed in October 2014 that my position would be eliminated. While that decision has yet to be finalized, knowing that I will eventually asked to leave is a bit disheartening."
good,"At this position I would normally  Check out and check in real estate and franchising folders for legal departments. There was a lot of circulation involved.  Requests were handled by E-mail typically. When problems or time sensitive matters came up, phone correspondences would be made.  We would respond to the E-mails to confirm we had received the order and to create a paper trail if we needed to back track to see if a request had been processed."
good,"I handled Strategic Accounts for Pitney Bowes.  Strategic Accounts were the highest revenue producers for PB.  I was the one point of contact for my customers.  I handled service issues, training issues, presenting new equipment and software, conducted quarterly and annual reviews.  For each account, I was assigned a quota for new business.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my customers and working with my colleagues at PB.  We typically managed these accounts for years as there was very little turnover within our group.  We had very strong relationships with our customers.   The Strategic Account Managers were typically the most senior sales representatives in the company.  We shared success stories and supported each other. We all had one goal in mind and that was to maintain a lasting partnership with our customers by treating them the way we would want to be handled.  We valued their business and never took it for granted."
good,Worked for this company for a year. Manager at the time wanted me to do her job while she took 2 hour lunch breaks to do personal errands
good,"Chevron is a great account to work at. The Chevron employee's are fantastic, great environment and makes you feel like part of the team. Every day task are shipping, receiving & mail room duties. There was always ongoing training and at Chevron, Safety is always the key training courses. Chevron really cares for everyone's safety."

good,I've commute to New York for about 7 years straight and just recently was able to work from home. Being able to work from home has been very helpful. My commute to work is usually 2 hours door to door meaning I would lose 4 hours of my day from the commute alone. I personally feel like I work just as much at home as oppose to working in the office. Being able to bring balance has been great

good,work hard follow order make sure everything was in an timely order order. multi cultured. the hardest part was coping so many document to get out on a timely manner. The best part was being able to meet and work with other as well as helping when needed.
good,I  work at my own pace because I know what is expected of me and I achieve that and more. People say the mailing market is dying and that is far from the truth more and more clients are expanding their mailroom and making their mailing more intelligent. Of course this company is focusing on software because clients want that intelligence they want to know what's happening in their mailroom and they want to be able to focus on what's important when it comes to their mail which is Security

good,I enjoy everything about the job. I love my co-workers and my managers.
good,"Pitney Bowes was a great company to work for in the begin, when the first set of management people started doing underhanded things and top management did not stop it ,after we complain every thing started going down hill, they would'nt listen to the USPS people that was in the building with us seeing the same errors being done day after day.This could have been a perfect addition to the Pitney Bowes family if they had just listen and made some changes to make sure we got the mail out on time with out errors. It was a learning process that we could have conquered.I learned what it takes to get the mail out to the public on time and what special services there is in the postal system.Management that was in place did'nt really know as much as was needed to run the plant and did'nt know how to go to the postal rep., that was there to ask and get the right infor to drive the plant in the right direction ,as how to get the mail in and sort and move it out on time. The people that was put in management position had warehouse experience and could not see that this was different and take the knowledge that USPS rep., would give to get things on the right track. We all learned a valauble lesson to carry with us in the future that a open mind is a great thing to have, because you can always learn something new or a different way of doing it."
good,"Working with this company for more than 11 years I've been through several transitions especially as far as technolgy is concerned. I've learned quite a few things, met alot of wonderful people while being employed with Pitney Bowes. The hardest part of the job is seeing the beginning of the day when all packages come in at once, all phone lines are ringing, and there are people at the counter that require immediate assistance. I pull it off by by knowing how to prioritize things, and treating all clients with respect, courtesy, and the upmost professionalism that my years on the job allows me to offer. What I enjoy most is when my boss gets an email, or a phone call praising my services that I've given to the client, and when they tell me that I'm the Best."
good,"typcal day was in at 9 out at 6 unless doing overtime or trying finish a job.maintaine the copiers scanners fax machines printers and all jobs located in my work annex . keep a good professinal relationship with the clients and make sure all clients all happy by days ends .i always check the equipme3nt dailey and throughout the day until time to go home . i make sure all jobs are done and delivered on time and with no mistakes , log in my finished jobs and jobs for next day we had eary morning meeting to discus our work and and problems and express our voices .the envoiremnt was pleasant for the most time there . we had our problems as do all employors but yet like family we work it out and continue to do whats needed"
good,A typical day at work would be doing your job a little bit of small talk with my co-worker and learning each day what to do and what not to do in different situations. Both of my managers were good easy going but some of the supervisors were very rude to co-workers. The hardest part was to run the machine but i eventually got the hang of it. I really did enjoy working here because my co-workers were great people and the job itself was enjoyable to me.
good,Learned from some talented leaders on the need to make good financial decisions. These decisions often affected the business and people's lives and were to be taken seriously.

good,"Because the department I was in was phased out shortly after I was hired, I was not employed long enough to fairly ascertain the full scope of the company. I enjoyed my contract job because I could set my own schedule and it paid decently."
good,"The job was not difficult and it was easy to get by. Depending on the position you get, the job could either be physically demanding or it could be mentally demanding."
good,"In summary, flexible work schedules coupled with an extremely challenging work environment from a deliverable standpoint.  Compensation is competitive.  IT is expected to deliver new technologies with fewer resources."
good,Although it was not a thoroughly satisfying position I gained sales experience and learned the art of persistence.  I maintained accounts and provided customer service and created new accounts.
good,"PB as a whole is working to re-invent themselves, but it is difficult to turn the ship.  As they should, they are taking profits and re-investing into the future.  It looks to be taking longer than anticipated, but there has been a ton of turn as they ""right size"" the organization."
good,"Job security is non existent.  The people are nice and atmosphere is warm and diverse.  Training was i depth."

good,"Respond to customer inquiries and perform equipment diagnostics."
good,Utilized the Dialer phone system half way through my career. System reached a higher number of accounts and increased sales volume.

good,"My time working in the Custom Group was some of the best working experience of my life.  Designing machines and seeing them put into action doing a function was fun.

good,"Each day begins with sales call with an extreme nice customers."

My office in San Juan is the responsible to support the caribbean and latinamerican region. My daily duties are very exciting.It includes install new machines, fix existing machines, and travel overseas to give technical support. The hardest part of my job is sometimes the lack of training due to the economic situation and schedule issues. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to work overseas, and the happiness that I feel when i solve a complicated issue."
good,Working at Pitney Bowes teaches you how to be a professional. You are on the front line and you have to know your line of work. You are always asked to make a difference and to go that extra mile for the client.

My co-workers were onboard to do a job as a team. The most enjoyable part of my job was satisfying the customer and receiving that feed back as confirmation. The hardest part of my job, was at any given moment when I wasn't able to fully accomodate a customer's request, due to policy. And having to change managers after almost 9yrs with the company was the hardest thing I had to do as it pertained to mngmnt."
good,A day at Pitney Bowes was very busy. It started off with recievig fedex and ups grounds. After that i had to deliver packages and Mail. The management at pitney was great and created a peaceful work enviroment for workers.
good,Company was a place where an employee will work from start to retirement. Not the case anymore as other companies don't hold the same attributes.
good,"Pitney Bowes is always changing. The organizational structure, the business processes but all the while maintaining focus on good customer service and product offerings."
good,The company is a US based company that is continually evolving and looking to increase its market share while reducing costs. The workplace culture is a pleasant environment.
good,Business Analyst's were required to work pre sales with salespeople to document business cases and feasibility of solutions being sold.  Plenty of contact with external clients.
good,"I enjoy my job once you learn the machines your day to day becomes very easy.  If you are looking to make a high income this isn't the place. The pay is at best ok with very little chance of moving up in the company.  I like my manager even thou most guys don't.  Company is becoming more and more micromanagement, so not as much free time for the field techs like years ago."
good,"TD = Daily adaptability required to Manage seven accounts in Austin & Richardson TX.  "
good,"Great people but continuously downsizing"
good,The warehouse is advanced but it’s in the middle of nowhere. I had trouble getting to work from Indianapolis driving past greenwood. I don’t recommend working there because you don’t know what time you’ll get off.

good,"Good workplace. Great company. Flexible hours. Challenging, but learn new things. Includes diversity. Excellent company overall. Would recommend to anyone."
good,"The job itself was fun and challenging.  There were opportunities for bonuses and advancement.  The culture, however, was not friendly.  I met people there who were mean-spirited and antagonistic.  Jealousy  and backstabbing were a large part of the culture."
good,"le role de la fidélisation étant stratégique pour l'entreprise, j'avais une autonomie totale. Hormis le fait de manager une vingtaine de personnes, la diversité du travail à accomplir était déjà un challenge."
good,"As always with large corporation, there are always pros and cons."
good,"The job and atmosphere were fun, just hardly no advancement options or any overtime options. My boss was pretty laid back and you could buy vacation flex time"
good,"Processo seletivo criterioso, porem o periodo que passsei foi gratificante"
good,Worked with some great people but office location and pay did not match the sparse housing availability for the area. Not much to do outside of work either in the rural location. Not many options to move up in office to make more money.
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door. They properly train their employees which is very important for me. They are a sustainable company, although the chatter and the gossip the organization of the company as a whole didn't seem organized to my standards, and sadly to admit the pay rate they gave me was the starting. This is what any new employee is given, although after contracted for seven months working in the same department, I was disappointing with that as well."
good,"I LOVED my department, manager and people I support.  Unfortunately PB isn't doing good as a company and has had many voluntary and involuntary reduction in force separations.  While the severance plan is good for those who have been employed for a while, a job is far better than a severance package."
good,"love the people i work with, great hours. always overtime hours and ways to make a little extra cash. most everyone is friendly and willing to help out. Things that such is every three months is a quarter end and we work 2 weeks straight except for jan which is the busy time cause of taxes and we work the whole month straight with a day or 2 off in between. They dont really care about personal life so if u have a emergency at home u have to have proof and or family to back you up. the more mail there is the more you work."
good,"I enjoyed  my career with pitney bowes. I will always be thankful for the experience that was allotted to me. I will continue to have a relationship with management, and my formal employees. The reason, I left because my wife and I have a grandson with physical disabilities. And the opportunity to gain more experience in this field."
good,"Pitney Bowes is a good place to work. However, it has become less employee focused in the last few years. Too much attention to Wall Street and not enough to the internal strife."
good,Forced to retire.  They decided that 26 years was not a successful career and they were paying us too much money.  The people that they kept left much to ne desired.  Very disappointed to be treated that way after giving so much of myself.
good,"Pro:  Large corporation, room for advancement.  Sales and service environment.  Flexiabilty with work hours, great benefits "
good,"Great people to work with"
good,This was a short term job for me until I found a position that I wanted long term in a company I could grow with. Pitney Bowes was not that company for me.
good,Pitney Bowes has given me an opportunity to work as a field technician independently. The management gives orientated task to staff making achieving goals effortlessly.
good,"I was responsible for Pitney Bowes full product line in 4 counties in Central/Southern Indiana.  I called on existing customers as well as potential new customers.  Each month a new sales goal was established by the District Manager in Lexington, KY.  Commissions were paid on meeting or exceeding sales goals.  This position required 98% travel, time organization and customer service."

good,"Empresa terceirizada,mas sempre se preocupando com os seus funcionários,e sempre em dia com seus pagamentos e benefícios"
good,Very challenging to keep the standards of our client but rewarding in the end when a new contract is obtained. Pitney Bowes Mgmt Services is a great company to work for and my job was challenging on many levels. One of the ultimate goals in this type of work is to surround yourself with the very best and capable team members and that starts from the ground up during interviews and training.
good,"i learned to be hardworking, flexible, work fast,alert, and organize staff,                                                                                                                                                                                              "
good,The job is very stressful but with much self dedication and teamwork it will be completed at the end of the day. I have learned to work to perform best in a high stress place. The management was good. The co-workers were always missed by me for their help and teamwork sprit they have. The hardest part of the job was meeting the tight deadlines. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the beating all the challenges and meet the due dates required.
good,"Good place to work for several reasons: Challenging technologies."
good,This was generally a good place to work.  It was stressful and I was pushed to sell rather then help the customer too often.  Besides that it was fairly decent.  It would have been nice if the pay was better but I loved my co workers.
good,"Okay place to work - was a very long time ago, actually had a chance to work in the office in Norwood, liked the experience a lot"
good,"Duties included heavy data entry both alpha and numeric with quotas to meet each day."

good,"environnement international- evolution permanente"
good,"This is an amazing company with wonderful benefits and a good work life balance. The company like any major corporations has lay offs yearly so you are always on your toes come the start of summer and then again in October. Management is wonderful, they always thank you for your hard work."
good,"good outsourcing that train you in every department. whether its for a mail room position, receptionist, hired to work for firm. very corporate straight to busy. the pay is excellent. long term career path"
good,I enjoyed going to work at Pitney Bowes every day. I learned may things at Pitney Bowes in the 12 years I was employed there from the great mentors I had. My job was challenging but I wouldn't say it was hard. I had a great Supervisor and a wonderful Manger that made my job rewarding and fun.
good,"Here at Cisco, we have many involved, we are vendors and we also report to an Vendor that Cisco has hired to over see other Vendors.  We have a very layered structure.  Many meetings and collaboration to meet the scope of work and refine processes."
good,"It was my first time in a warehouse environment. Overall It was okay. Pitney Bowes was contracted with the US Postal, to help dispatch out mail. As a lead, I had to make sure that the material handlers were sorting correctly and dispatching on time."
good,"This job was pretty decent. I worked here through a temp agency. It was full time and if they hadn't of lost their contract I would have become a permanent employee. I liked that once I was trained, I could put my headphones on, listen to my mp3 player and do my work. I didn't like the fact that the very first day I was there, I was approached by about 5 people who all informed me about how I was going to hate my job, but I never did. I learned to stay to myself, do my job and would have been there longer but they were bought out and everyone had to reapply for their jobs. I wasn't a permanent employee so I wasn't hired by the new company."
good,The company itself was going down overall. Higher management started leaving or being fired stating due to changes in the economy.  A typical day was rewarding; I was with the company for 15 years and I learned a great deal over the years.  The company stopped giving differential pay for night shift and they also froze all raises.  I couldn't believe a company that is world wide was passing off as broke and ended up selling a portion of the company.
good,"Typical day at work would be mostly on the phone assisting to customer and coordination of daily task.I learned to multitask.I love working with people as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was cross training staff once a month so everyone have knowledge of every single duty on the floor and, the most enjoyable part was being appreciated and acknowledge for doing a great job,"
good,"good benefits, management is good too, advancement opportunites"
good,I enjoyed this job and learned a lot from the ongoing  leadership training provided.Worked with great people and made good friends. I truely got the most from this experience.
good,"Pitney Bowes was a good company that taught me many things."
good,"I have been here for about 6 years, and the people that I work with are o.k.  The best part is being able to get outside, especially on the nice days.  The bad part, going outside on the not so good days...."
good,I shipped out boxes ordered by different companies to the post office. Was a great experience while it lasted. It was a very physical job every single day. I would lift to 50 pounds at a time. The management there is very nice and easy to get along with.
good,"A typical day at work would require processing of incoming mail and commercial courier items. Using great technology provided by company intranet databases, research of client mailing codes for office locations and forwarding updates are essential. Time management is one of the most required tasks and management are directly monitoring standard levels agreements for time management. As a team all clients service associates communicate effectively to meet time managed tasks. Also by conducting daily huddles we promote spirit, cooperation and encourage employee appreciations. The hardest part of the job would be understaffed, while conducting a high call volume for numerous events. As a team the end of the day reports are accurate and all agreements are met we have enjoyable huddle about our daily progress."
good,When i first arrived at the company. They teamed me up with a coworker / supervisor who knew the job. He left and thing fell apart for me. not happy. then the company moved to newark n.j.. they said they moved there to have there own building.

good,"Separate the incoming mail, sort mail for ExxonMobile employees in Houston locations. Sort and dispatch international mail and responsible for look up; mail."
good,Alot of cold calling. Working the sales cycle. Management was very good. Coworkers were very easy to work with. Hardest part of the job was being shunned at offices for being a door to door sales person.
good,"This company cares about its employees, They work with your schedule"
good,Management encourages employees to do the right thing the right way and always maintain client's needs above the companies.  Management provides necessary tools for employees to complete their jobs.

good,It was an excellent opportunity I was very excited to explode my knowledge and experience with that company and to also keep learning as much as I could to keep growing professionally.
good,Really good company to work for good opportunity to move up decent pay and good people. I highly recommend working with them. Management really understand your needs.
good,"PB is a great company to work for, but because it's legacy mailing business is in decline, it is in the middle of a transformation that takes a lot of energy away from core business functions. The company is reinventing itself as an eCommerce/Shipping and Software business. It is a necessary path, which ultimately will put them in the right place, but a tough one for people to endure for an extended period of time."
good,"PitneyBowes is one of those jobs where you just have to suck it up and don't be picky. The work isn't hard. It's just the cramped working environment, the dusty floors, and occasionally the unsanitary coworkers. The managers are awesome and will respect you if you want to move to another station. Overall, PitneyBowes is like every other 9-5 jobs out there."
good,The typical call center that will provide you room for growth if you seek it.  I started out as a temp and got hired on after six months.  Been with the company ever since.  You  have to strive to want to do better or you will be stuck in the same position forever. Work hard and learn everything as fast as possible.
good,"Focused highly on sales, and less on work/life balance.  Not much engagement from head office or CEO.  A lot of incentives for highly productive sales professionals."
good,This position consisted of a lot of immediate turnaround time.  It seemed as if you never had enough time to review your work. The atmosphere seemed very rigid.
good,This company is always hiring and the management is always very helpful and works with whatever you have going on. Always pretty busy and plenty of helpful resources.
good,"Team players , Good Leads ... If you have the drive for over time then it's the place to be but I felt burnt out at a point in time just to keep up with bills and all ..."
good,"I like working at Pitney Bowes. Great management at the Fridley, MN site. Corporate has issues. Low pay! Chances for moving up but hard with favoritism. 8 hour work day for full time. Mandatory  overtime at the beginning of the year."
good,"I worked 3-4 days per week, 8 hours per day."
good,Good place for starter job but salaries have not kept up with the cost fof living and a growing family. Lots of travel and you get to meet many new people and make new friends
good,"I had a great experience at Pitney Bowes.   The company is in a state of Transformation and trying to stay ahead of declining revenues on traditional lines of business.  They have a good strategy and I believe will succeed; however, the shift cause annual resource shedding which creates a difficult culture."
good,"Overall good company.  Demanded above average, of course, but delivered on compensation.  A lot of windshield time to cover territory in Montana, as opposed to reps in large markets where territory was maybe a section of town.  Not fair standards overall, but still good place to work.  Left in good standing to pursue other interests."
good,"I pretty much liked working for Pitney-Bowes Management Services. I left for better pay and more career advancement, but I got along well with my co-workers and I liked my boss."

good,"I learned a lot in Pitney Bowes, the workplace is good and enjoyable, I don't want to comment on the management ethics and culture. I learned a lot from the company where.I did mostly the same thing for more than five years. typically the place is not bad,.except for the slim chance of building a career for people with an innovative ideal."
good,I don't work here anymore and haven't in years. It was pretty good back in the day. Decent pay and the best training in a fortune 500 business. I would recommend it.
good,"One of the best job I ever had. If the company wasn't bought out, I wouldn't mind returning there to work.  Amazing group of people to work. The management was supportive and willing to help you grow within the company."
good,"I worked in the Mailroom, sorted mail for delivery."
good,Balanced work/home life.  Enjoyed working there; good manager and coworkers many of which were not just colleagues they became my friends.  I had opportunities to enhance my career skills.
good,"The production is staff is on the go basically 24 hours a day - 7 days a week ....  It's a fast paced environment.  Supervisors answer questions to the best of their ability./  In the 3 yrs I have been there, I have seen a lot of favoritism but that's not my issue.  I jsut want to get back in the field I was trained in"

good,"A good internship experience, with a lot of responsibility delegated. Freedom to pursue projects. Great people to work with."
good,"This company has great growth potential for an individual, however, nepotism and preferential treatment plays a significant role in an individual advancement in the company. The ""buddy system"" is the only in-house game to be played. The overall environment is too casual and is in desperate need for a culture of professionalism. This company is in desperate need of a complete overhaul."
good,"busy, fun productive work place"
good,"I was a dedicated worker at Pitney Bowes. In my thirteen year career I worked at several departments. The work areas included Quality Assurance, Product Support, Account Integrity, Customer Service and Administrative Support. The majority of my time was spent overseeing the mail room. My duties included processing incoming and outgoing mail for a call center of 400 people. I work well both as a independent worker and as a team player. The most challenging part of my job using my time management skills to complete my tasks on a timely basis and ensuring accuracy. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction of my coworkers.I enjoyed the benefits of health insurance and time off."

good,ok but not a good place for minorities when we are in the worst place they want mindless insecured workers because they themselves are mindless insecure managers with very little expertise
good,"Management leaves a lot to be desired. 1 month of training and when we got on the floor, we were told to forget everything we learned and to do things a different way. When asking management questions, we were told ""you just had an entire month of training, figure it out"". It felt a lot like a popularity contest.  Very typical sales position in which you have a quota and the company pressures you to make quota while finding ways to keep you off the phone such as daily meetings during peak selling times, silly games and contests, fire drills, and systems that ""go down"" on a fairly frequent basis . They say the only constant at Pitney Bowes is change."

good,"I thrived within the environment at PB due to our upper mgmt supporting us in all endeavors. We built the site in Erlanger, KY and were very successful in doing so.

Next we went to our machines and waited to get a sign-off to start our machines, in the meantime I checked my labels against the sorting scheme, and if everything is ok, which normally it was not, I returned to start my machine. If things are not ok, I call over a QC member and get the mistakes on record so whomever did the mistake will be taught what needs to be done. The people I worked with were usually tired, or mad they were on my line because my line consisted of the ""hard"" mail. The hardest part of the job is not getting recognized and being good at my job didn't matter if I had points against me for attendance, where 4 points a day were given, in my opinion, that was too many points. The easiest part of the day was actually doing my job, my job is easy, and I made minimal mistakes."

Then placing them on the conveyor belt to where it went to dispatch to be sleeved, strapped, stacked, and wrapped. To then be place under correct marker for location then loaded unto trucks to be delivered. Now you also have to check the quality of the mail like are the bar code straight, are they dark enough are they coming out the correct slots on the machine. If your mails bar codes are messed up it can cause the machine to jam due to it going to the overflow and the reject bin because it doesn't know where to go. Now if your mail is going into the wrong slot on the machine that is called a miss sort and you have to stop the machine and call your manager and or a tech. You could also look and see if a piece on the machine is stuck or a belt came off and fix it. I did that because once the machine is stopped production is stopped. Once production is stopped it cost the company money and extra time and some customer wont be getting their mail in time. Another big thing about the miss sort is that the mail can be shipped to the wrong place and you don't want that for many reasons. Okay so i work there for 3 month before i was hired in full time for the company. Upon being hired through the company i was promoted to mail mover. Which included me operating an electric pallet jack. Unloading truck of the pallets of mail and delivering it to the correct machine to be sorted. I also was to deliver trays to each machine"
