rating,review
bad,"Working for this company was a joke, and circle k was not much better. Managers are stealing and being racist towards employees and they still keep their jobs."
bad,I stayed because I have dedication to any job I keep but I would not recommend to anyone. Unfortunately the area Manager was not following rules and therefore made fore a hostile work environment and so I found a new job.
bad,"a typical day. trucks are late for food and fuel."
bad,"Working for CST for almost ten years has been a very stressful time of my life, I would not recommend it to anyone as Circle K has purchased the company and all the great reasons to work there are now gone."
bad,It's very little pay for doing a lot work and top it off there's ABSOLUTELY no breaks. Don't work with anyone unless it's a big and busier store and it's very dangerous when you're by yourself so had close the store a little earlier to prevent from potentially getting robbed. Rude customers. Lacks good management. I've had 3 managers in my 2 years working here and I've had only one good manager that works around my school schedule.
bad,"Not worth the $9. You will get the $9 an hour and you will stay at $9 an hour so don't expect a raise. When asked to be a lead they will only offer you a 25 cent raise. One of my fellow employees has worked for this company for 1 year and is only getting paid 9.50. If you are of ""ethnic descent"" don't expect to move up in the company at all. This company is just a mess, the rules change everyday, so don't expect stability. With all the amount of work you do, you should be getting paid $12 an hour or more. Managers very prejudice, store manager gave a fellow employee of mine Cinco de mayo off and told him to ""enjoy his day"" because she assumed he was Mexican. Tons of high strung micro managers who are constantly over your shoulder  like you are a child. Store manager is very rude and disrespectful. If you are desperate for a job this should be your last resort. The company is horrible and is one of the worst run places I have ever seen."
bad,"Some of the worst managers I've ever had. They would yell and swear at employees in front of customers and were extremely unprofessional in general. To save money, they reduced our 15 man crew to four. This caused many problems, such as unhappy customers, and a lack of available products. There was just too much to get done. "
bad,The culture within the organization is not open door and teams do not collaborate well with each other.  Communication between people is not encouraged and chain of command does not truly exist.
bad,"Typical day at the CST in Premont it varies.. On some days it was really slow and some days it was busy. I learned that you need to do things yourself because NO ONE will do it for you... especially working there in that building. I worked w/ my ex Manager, Asst Manager for almost a year I never had a problem. Until this new Manager came in w/ the mentality of being a big boss and running things her way. Threatening employees because of something small and that can be fixed."
bad,"I worked here for a year, the company closed and left all employees job less and canceled benefits on day of termination. The store I worked in operated without a manager for over a year, they finally promoted the assistant manager 3 months before company closed. I worked the job of an assistant manager, left running the store alone and was only paid the regular CST salary.  I wasn't offered benefits until after they notified us of store closing."
bad,"Poor administration.  Too much back stabbing.when reqwested to work at a closer store to home, I was sent to a store further away. They want you to be able to go to other stores within a 25 mile radius.  There is to high of a turn over."
bad,"After HRM left, office environment was not the same.  Morale decreased and view of the company deminshed.  Complete culture change and not a very pleasant environment"
bad,CST Brands does not exist anymore. stockholders decided they did not like that the stock was not going up fast enough so they voted to sell the company and profit on the bonus a company pays. circle k bought cst brands
bad,"This is the type of company that encourages workplace bulling and harassment from upper management. They are not held accountable for thier actions. With few exceptions, area managers are spiteful and vendictive. Definitely a company that work quickly throw you under the bus to place blame for the company's failing ventures. Everyone is dispensable."
bad,"work was good to work at but its all depending manager you get after one transfer to other store and we get manager on training  type we get..thats when the fun stop from there, he got greedy and pressure by above..when money invovled everyone get murder on sight..one by one everyone been let go from last management position he hired...and i was lucky few last that long...longer and i seen many new employees come and go during my time as CSR...i been many different supervisor changes...now the store been closed due to decision made by higher up.."
bad,"The company has been sold so it doesn't matter much anymore but the it tried to grow too fast and spooked the shareholders, Were spending too much money and not making enough and now it's sold but prior to that the benefits are terrible, building is nice, management doesn't embrace or understand their own core values. Do not understand how to manage or treat people"
bad,"Lot of Work for Little Pay "
bad,I loved my job at first but I got transferred to a different store with horrible management and just got fed up. No one was held accountable for mistakes are not doing there jobs.
bad,"Not good planning by management, fair technical support, management changes direction equipment could be taken care of better. does not support maintenance personal, dose not admit if they are wrong, will not accept new ideas, Good pay"
bad,CEO kept purchasing other companies that could not be supported. Work load increased.  Benefit deductions were greater. Manager was unsupportive. Company got sold to Circle K.
bad,"Upper management is ridiculous and schedules change everyday. No room for advancement and no insurance until 1 year of employment. That's all? No! How about no breaks, bullying and harassment by other employees and laughable raises. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY."
bad,"A typical day at work would be working on the research depends on the state that you are actually do the tax returns for."
bad,"Productive and fun workplace. Enjoyed peers. culture bad due to. management constantly changing. the hardest part, adapting to constant changing of managers. A typical day at work consisted of leave management /phone calls."
bad,I would recommend this to someone going to college this is not a long term position steady work but desperately need more.u have good customers and bad ones. You deal with all the stress of the whole store being perfected everyday. It is not a good career move especially those with a family to support.
good,"A typical work day was somewhat enjoyable. I got a long with most of my co workers and if I did not I would tough it out and continue with work. The hardest part was the safety hazards, the best part was working with the customers."
good,No comment on CST. Company is a spin off and their culture is not the same as Valero's was. That's all I will say. The work was work.
good,It was a very nice job.  Manager was not the best. Was treated unfairly. Not happy in the end it was a very nice place to work.  But the manager was very mean. .
good,The staff employees were fun to be around. The job was difficult at first because of the pace you had to keep but other than that it was fairly average.
good,"You are expected to get a long list of things accomplished on your shift, while waiting on a never ending line of customers, with no assistance from management."
good,Nice place to work if your winding down your lifes work or just needed to pay a bill or two right now but the expectations on the individual are really outrageous.
good,"Job was just to get me out of the house while attending college. Didn't pay much at all, and after a year and a half, I had gotten a whopping five cent per hour raise. Store Manager always created toxic work environments, and expected me to work many days in a row without a day off because he was too slow to hire another graveyard worker so I could have days off. Store Manager was racist and sexist with his comments and remarks about most customers. Assistant Managers were awesome, did more than expected all the time, and helped out everywhere else when needed."
good,"The Culture that the CEO was trying to push down on the company didn't get reflected by the management. They are stuck in their ways and do not like change. The employee moral is low, but everyone is very friendly."
good,No comment at this time.  CST is currently going through merger with Circle K.  I would not recommend employment till the sale of the merger is final.  Feb. 2017.
good,"I did enjoy my job some days were worst than some as in any job, and some days were better than some, I learnt how to work as a team, I learnt how to communicate with my co-workers about issues in the work place and I also learnt how to solve them. My co-workers were fun to work with even though at times it was difficult working with them, The most difficult part of my job was when I messed up on doing stuff concerning the job, and the relationship my co-workers had with each other, it was difficult to work in that environment, but the most enjoyable part of my job was learning the job, meeting new people, interacting with customers on a daily basis and being independent."
good,"no Management support, or advancement into company, failed to ensure me new job position for hiring someone else into position I have trained for over a year when this person was hired from another country and one month into being into the company was given the position I was told I would have by the supervisor."
good,I had almost an entirely lazy and incompetent manager for the last 18 months of my tenure at Corner Stores. I hated having everything left to myself and two other competent employees because the manager was inable to hire persons whom had the motivation or desire to do the job they were hired for.
good,CST has been a good company to work for aside from the poor communication from management.  Coworkers are mostly great to work with; benefits are good.
good,"A typical day involves arriving at 5am. After reviewing the sales floor  and staff issues it is time to close the days business and complete the necessary daily paperwork. After that I would allow time to make sure the morning peak time is clean, efficient, and friendly. While doing this I am also prioritizing and deciding that days must do tasks and lesser tasks. Who will be responsible to complete those and about how long it should take. During the day as these tasks are being done, I work in newly acquired tasks based on the days flow."
good,"It was a okay place to work but the lack of hours was the reason I ultimately left. The management was amazing, even the ""big wigs""! You get a bonus every year!"
good,"If you enjoy a family oriented environment, this is the perfect place for you. But if you are not working everyday, the pay at this job is merely undesirable after your first check."
good,"I have work for valero for ankle and I love it but I need a better paying job"
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Never a dull moment with leadership.  Leadership was the biggest issue since the spin-off with Valero.  Employees not treated fairly and the attitude of ""be lucky you have a job."""
good,"Like most retail jobs, the pay isn't great and it's tough to keep help. It's always tough to see how the company is doing as a whole and chances for advancement/promotion don't come around very often."
good,The best part of this job was working with the other employees and the customers. Being able to get the experience working with cash and different people
good,"Working with coworkers can make the job more easy and makes everyone's job too. Your hours can be flexible by Lettin your manager know. "
good,"Money handling, ordering, helping customers.... stocking ordering"
good,"When the company was a new spin-off from Valero Energy in 2013, the culture was fun and exciting as a company that was seeking to grow rapidly through building new stores and making acquisitions.  However, when the company was purchased by Circle K beginning in summer 2016, the San Antonio office eventually became a regional office of Circle K that is mainly used for day to day operations and there is less decision making and seeking of growth opportunities.  The office atmosphere feels as if it has become one where people come to ""work"" for a paycheck, rather than one where people are excited about the company, the work they're doing, and their career paths.  There are still many hard working and talented people at the office, however the overall atmosphere is very negative compared to the previous atmosphere.  There are still opportunities for people looking to work for a large international company."
good,Entire 5 years there I had no upper management support. Expect to run the entire store yourself. no help. CSR always quiting. No body want to work for 10 hour. They just want to stand around. Company will not pay more to get better employees
good,"to much uncertainty with merger"
good,"Although it may not seem like a lot of time, in the year I spent working here I dealt wiith many setbacks from the job and I overcame all of them however it's very hard to actually get acknowledgement for doing so. You have to have very good commitment to be able to work your commitment to your job commitment to your schedule. As long as you have a steady pace reliable sort of work ethic you can easily get a job here or anywhere."
good,Little regard for workers involved in acquisitions.  Dismissed office employees without consideration and without providing opportunity within.
good,"a typical work day would probably be an 8hr shift, but can easily turn into a 10-12 hr shift if someone called out. I've learned that its a really competitive place. Management is ok. By that I mean if the manager was in a good mood you'd be able to have an amazing day, but if she was having a bad day you would pay for it by doing extra work or staying more late. The hardest part of the job is stocking. The stocking was ridiculous especially the cooler. The most enjoyable part was working with the other cashiers and my regular customers."
good,A good company to work for if you don't mind working all weekend and holidays. This is a drawback when you are an assistant manager. Benefit package and vacation are excellent. Pay could be better but seems competitive in industry. Sometimes employees are moved with no reason or any input from employee.  So saying that - if you don't mind those things it's great
good,"CST brands has been acquired by Circle K so much of what I would say would not be applicable. "
good,"great source of interacting and provide good customer service,some room for advancements,great for adventure and other states job,not hard job at all,nice working hours,great schedule,not too much stress or many problems."
good,With company for a very long time through acquistion and mergers.  For the most part it was a good experience but the last 4 years were  very stressful with a bad ending.  Enjoyed working with the people here and loved my job - just too much required and not enough resources to get it done!.
good,I maintain the operations of a convenience store.  I work a lot of hours with sometimes very little time off with my family.  If the pay was reasonable I would not mind things as much but we are very underpaid for what we deal with on a day to day basis.
good,I was in a smaller store. Manager was great and so we're employees but job was so demanding I never had time to myself without getting called in. Left due to a move
good,As a manager I enjoyed helping my employees as a team. My employees taught me many different things as I have helped them to advance in their positions. I was happy to help customers in any way to make sure they were happy when they left my store. If a customer was not happy about something I made sure to make it right before they left. The hardest part of my job would be leaving my job for a vacation or out sick. I felt that I was dedicated to my job and I needed to be there every day.
good,"I learned a lot at this job. A typical day at work involved cleaning and facing the store, helping customers with directions or finding items, and working at a cash register. I like my co-workers, and am somewhat sad to leave/see them leave. My managers are somewhat good while at work, but when they leave work they are impossible to get ahold of if I need help. They don't have very good communication skills either. I really enjoyed the fun I'd have with co-workers and customers, and was always told my smile brightened their days."
good,"Great working hours for current position, love people contact and fast pace,. Management could improve on consistency with reviews and be proactive in getting completed in a timely manner."
good,"you're the face of cst brands, you need to be on your feet all day at all times, sometimes it can get overwhelming and stressful, manager that i worked for was pretty cool at times but will be strict and once you become familiar with the environment and with your co-workers, you will enjoy coming to work each day and have some laughs - everyone that walks in the store is different, some will be likeable and some won't be, just gotta deal with it."
good,CST Brands was a spinoff of Valero Energy.  The CEO was great at Mergers and Acquisitions but had no idea of how to run a convenience store chain.  That is why I am looking for a job.  The company was bought out by Circle K and in the department I worked in no employee was offered a job.
good,"Lots of customer service involved"
good,I only worked for CST Brands for a short time after they acquired Nice N Easy Grocery Shoppes.  I thoroughly enjoyed the work that I did and the team of people I had the pleasure of working with.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was helping customers.Finding what is was the they needed,making sure wehad everything they needed and talking to them everyday."
good,"Until bought out by CK, CST was an rewarding place to work. With the conversion to CK from CST, standards, employee services, pay and benefit packages were lost. Work hours were increased from 45 to 50 hours per week at the same salary, disrupting work / home life balance."
good,CST Brands have a great culture to promote from within. Your potential is only limited by your own performance. The company extends the same benefits to management and senior management which shows the importance of each team member.
good,CST brands is a great company but some things need to b e worked on to make it even more better. I enjoy working here but just tired of settling I need more the benefits are great  an I just wish I can say the same about the pay.
good,Overall i enjoyed my time working at CST Brands. Management was always helpful in addressing my needs and concerns. I did disagree with some of the policies and procedures.
good,"I loved working at CST brands."
good,"A typical work day for CST Brand was to immediately start working on ordering Products, Merchandise for the store to keep us well stocked. After completion of store inventory/ordering I would meet with the in-store manager to conduct routine cash register checks to ensure the register was not over/under in money counts. What I learned at CST Brand was time management and the ability to work as a team to ensure customer satisfaction. The hardest part was taking in store inventory because you would need to red expiration labels which took up a large chunk of your typical day. Most enjoyable part was engaging with our customers."
good,"CST Brands is a good company to work for. There are a lot of opportunities to advance in the company. Circle K recently acquired CST Brands, so they are gradually implementing their own stamp on everything."
good,Was hard to continue with career when after the first 60 days the announcement of the strategic review and upcoming sale of company was make public to the organization.
good,A good job where you are expected to be able to work by yourself for the majority of your shift. You have a load of responsibilities that if you don't finish you will leave for the next shift to complete and it can throw the whole flow of the store off. Our management was good except for terrible scheduling. I never had the same schedule 2 weeks in a row.
good,"Wish they didn't close out California stores, made things hard to find a matching job, as not many places give as good of benefits or the general clientele you would meet there."
good,When it was CST or was a great company to work for you had the support and communication and their training was great but when circle K took over it got hear to work there so many changes and no support they those changes. Circle k itself not a bad company just wish they could've been more supportive
good,"It was fun working at CST. They provided advancements to employees that were serious about more up in management. But I guess you could say what is their biggest flaw, was that Human Resource did not get involve when employees complained about a store manager being hostile at the work place."
good,Difficult to fairly judge this company at this time as we are going through a strategic review and have been for over a year - morale is low and employees are leaving the company.
good,"I currently work here part time, I like the staff and location where I work the customers are nice and its a safe environment while working in the store, there are a lot of opportunities in this company you just have to work for it and be available."
good,"Steady work environment. Room-to-grow.Fairly competitive salary."
good,"I miss working at CST Brands, where upper management cared that their employees were getting their deserved time off.  I really wish that CircleK did not buy the company out."
good,I started as a 3rd shift CSR at one of the companies truck stops. I had descent managers that recognized my hard work and skill set and was able to advance to the Store Manager position.
good,Great manager high turnover rate for afternoon and evening shifts . Benefits not all that great and discount in store extremely limited. Schedule wait to my needs also....
good,"Each day we had to make sure the food was ready for the customers for when they would come in in the morning. We had to also make sure we were stocked up for the upcoming days, since our deliveries would come once every 2 or 3 days. Keeping our area was also necessary, and was looked over by our supervisor at least twice a week."
good,"2 days office and 3 days in the field in an average week."
good,"A typical day is to fulfill my tasks in a timely manner, and also management helps prioritize when tasks get hectic and promotes me to work harder, I have learned that working as a team we can all accomplish the departments goals... I enjoy my job when i get the task or tasks done and i get appreciation for my efforts"
good,"CST is a growing company that is expanding at a vigorous pace and trying to distinguish itself from the competition.  Management and company-focus have shifted and are experiencing the growing pains you can expect from new ideas and pathways.  Most of the company has bought-in to the changes and cultural shifts towards Servant Leadership, but there are many who are resistant to the change and it's hit or miss for the front line employees whether or not they will have a manager who understands and uses the Servant Leadership method or not."
good,"Great culture to work in, self paced environment, team efforts, flexible schedules, semi-annual gatherings. Lunch and Learn courses monthly. Online leaner net courses to advance in position."
good,"Direction and supervision of store staff to enhance business and comply with policies and procedures."
good,Was a wonderful company till they got bought out and was left with uncertainty about job security. Was a company I wanted to retire with. The uncertainty of the new company was the main reason for me leaving
good,"I enjoyed working for CST brands, My Area Manager had a tendency to favor certain managers and most times left my store unchecked on, Upper management had a tendency of coming in to visit the location and actually spend more time in the office reading emails than helping with issues in the store."
good,"Great Company to work for "
good,Over all this is a fantastic company to work for. Many friendly people  willing to lend a hand where its needed. Everyone comes to work or calls a head when things come up and I'm normally available to cover almost all shifts that get called in on.
good,"typical day getting to work by 4:30 am doing daily paper work reconcile cash, fuel and lottery, running register, keeping store up to standards, and other duties as required."
good,"This company was extremely training oriented which i liked and the manager position had a healthy work,life balance. The supervision was adequate and the job was easy."
good,Fast paced friendly environment.  Great team throughout the store. Management is fair to everyone.   Nice regular customers. Besides that just a typical convience store.
good,you have to have too many job skills to work for this company and cover a variety of jobs.
good,CST Brands was an awesome company to work for. Their upper management truly does care about their employees. I learned a lot of valuable skills working for them.
good,"It was a great job, i enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot about customer service and what it takes to keep customers happy. I also learned a bit about merchandising."
good,"I enjoyed my time at CST Brands. They provide you with the schedule that you most prefer. It could get difficult to learn all the programs, but it isn't impossible. I would love to still work there, but unfortunately, life got in the way."
good,"Great customers and fellow employees. Great manager, informative, fair, friendly, helpful. Good company to work for. You stay busy so the time goes by quickly."
good,"Retail service center culture is no stress. Unfortunately at the store level there is a lot of stress and the demands of management, while appreciated by most upper management, the compensation is not where it should be for the work provided."
good,"Flexible work hours are very nice. Upper Management - from Supervisors up - can do better at giving praise.  I personally think employees should be able to give performance reviews on the Supervisors to give them an idea of what their employees think about their management style and behavior.  Managers could interact more with the employees in their sections.  The employees are what make the wheels turn.  Without any recognition, those wheels will eventually run slower coming to a halt."
good,IT is a great work environment there there is a bit of uncertainty as far as the company's future. It was a lot of team work and communication with the other departments. There could be better communication with the higher ups but it is overall a good work environment.
good,"I loved my everyday routine from getting there in the morning and even closing the store, there is always something to do and I had an amazing team to do it with."
good,"Great company to work for, but the Manager was lazy and wouldn't help out her own store when they were short of employee's. The best part of the job is meeting new customers and seeing them return."
good,When I did work for CST Brands it was a great working environment but the management was poor at the time and eventually was fired for things that are confidential. Overall Great place to work if the management is good and knows what they're doing.
good,"good place to work but has come under new management.  Great benefits, good pay, good co-workers.  Everyone is really close.  CST has however been bought by another company so only time will tell whether things will be the same."
good,Great place to work and the training is extensive.  The bad part is being merged with Circle K and it's almost certain that the training and growth that was experienced will not stick.
good,"I really enjoyed working for CST Brands. I had great bosses and great employees. "
good,...Great place to work for. Learned a lot. Fun and easy to deal with. So much support and the most enjoyable part is being your own boss.
good,They are all about promoting from within. I went from customer service representative to training for Shift leas within 6 months. Management truly cares about employees.
good,"If you do your job, you will be great there. Everyone is very understanding if you are unable to make your shift, just call ASAP. Fun working envorinment. No one criticized your work as long as you do it to your best ability and do not take forever."
good,I work on hwy ! and when the summer hits our little store is so busy. We generate a lot of business due to the tourists and then the field workers come every march and pick all the fruit behind the store. On a typical day I probably  bring in about 100 to 200 cases of beverages from the shed to our cooler. I have raised the Gross Profit Margins on close to every thing in the store. I love fast paced busy all the time. I really enjoy all the people that come to the store it is a very fun and crazy job at times. I also enjoy the employees I really  like watching them grow I have a few employees that this is there first job. They are both still with me and doing great.
good,"Working at corner store was fun. Had the regulars that came in all the time and new people. The day was pretty easy, simple cashier, time management and stocking to get all the daily duties completed through the shift. Management was very friendly and family oriented, hardest part was having to stock back cooler while also being only attendant on floor and making sure customers are taken all at once. Most enjoyable part were the regulars who you always talk ot and remember and they remember you and ask how you are. just a good feeling."
good,I was a store manager for CST Brands and it was a great job.  This company promotes from within and takes care of their employees. I would have stayed there forever but my husband was transferred out of state to a location where there were no Cornerstores located
good,"Great place to work.  Colleagues are enjoyable to work with.  Superivsors are easy to work with and make the workplace a fun place to be.  Stressful at times, but that's a rarity."
good,I have learned a lot working At Cst Brands. CST taught me a lot when it comes to management. The workplace environment was wonderful. Only hardest day was on Mondays
good,excellent in job place an is teamwork from lower to higher post. enjoyable job serving in public and community. Organize all item that is easy to remember.
good,CST has now been acquired by Circle K. It's a good place to work and positive changes are happening! I am happy to be apart of the things to come. It's a business that thinks outside the box.🙂
good,I loved my job at CST. Very good people to work for. Good health benefits and good pay. The only problem I had was that they only offer 6 months short term disability.
good,"I was happy when work for this company and we work like families , receiving  stalking, handling cash  and good working atmosphere how to treat customary greeting and answering  immediately to their questions  satifing them as soon as possible and how to  say when they leave the store."
good,Culture was great everyone worked together to get the job done. the correct systems were in place to manange the processes set in place for the accounting dept.
good,"Great environment, co-workers were professional and treated me like part of the team.    Manager was a leader and benefit were great.  Leadership set a great example."
good,Petroleum company based out of San Antonio TX. Fast pace well organized. Management very attentative to employees needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was a very friendly work environment and constantly busy workloads
good,"From visiting store for compliance to assisting store employees, the company allowed the flexibility to tweek your day as needed.  Each day is something different, whether it was within the store or with a customer issue. Management was easy to talk to and really cared for the employees. The culture was ""family style"" work place.  With everyone working together there really wasn't anything that was too hard to complete.  The most enjoyable was the people and customers I interacted with daily."
good,The manager was easy to get along with as long as you do your job. Most of the customers you get are outgoing and it super fun to get to know new people. The job was over great.
good,"It was a Great work place,Fast and Easy Pace. Everyone was nice. They worked well with my school schedule. I was only part time. I enjoyed my time there."
good,loved working for this company for 10 years. They had great benefits and they cared about their employees.Very upset about the merge with circle k. I will miss working for cst brands. Hope to fine another company that can provide the same benefits and job security that they gave to me.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at CST Brands.  I got know a lot people while working there and made friends. I had planned on retiring with this company; unfortunately, my job was eliminated."
good,I had a great experience working for this company. Advancement opportunity was great good. Culture was one of servant leadership. community involvement was expected
good,CST spun off from Valero Corp.  CEO worked hard to maintain the work culture initiated from Valero.  Employees of CST were offered wellness checks and other benefits.  Supervisors are very involved and close to their team members and it really is a wonderful place to work.   We enjoyed monthly breakfasts with company briefings and we really were a family.  Company takes care of the people that take care of them.  I have enjoyed my time with them completely and will miss the atmosphere immensely.
good,"I loved my time here, My store in particular was amazing and I had amazing management. I felt safe always, even overnight."
good,Great place to work.  Employees are down to earth and easy to get along with. Management tries their best to work with you and your schedule. Fast pace environment
good,Reassure every customer is pleased when they leave the store or/and as they are waiting to be helped. Keeping store stocked for call customers needs. Management very flexible and very friendly as well as co-workers.
good,A great place to work! I have learned many skills and have had the opportunity to work with some great people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of fulfillment in helping other people.
good,"I been with CST Brands for a little bit over a year at one of their new stores. I love having regular customers, engaging and solving small issues. The compensations are great when you are a full time employee and you can actually grow with in the company pretty fast.  All you have to do is work hard. Bad thing is not everyone works at the same level, you can be friendly and clean but there is always someone that is rude or dirty and lazy. Overall is hard to just quit this second job."
good,working for CST brands was fun.My boss never got in the way of me moving up in the company and any questions i asked she answered.
good,Fun and easy to work with everyone at CST. Excellent support and great benefits. I learned a lot in my past 25 years. Co-workers are supportive and helpful.
