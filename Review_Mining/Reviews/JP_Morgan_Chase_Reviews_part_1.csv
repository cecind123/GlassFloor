rating,review
bad,chase is not a great place to work at. it is not accommodating or inclusive. overall their benefits are good but their hours and how they treat their employees is not good.
bad,Chase goal is to fire you when you start to question the ethical practices and the supervisor and management. My direct supervisor should be in jail. My daily job was one to provide excellent in customer service. Chase's job was how can we rip off our customers and get more money from them. Their ethical practices are non-existent
bad,Jpmorgan chase is all about spending less income on employees and focused on saving money with automatic services machines like smart ATM in the exact location of a human teller. The El Cajon branch had tree placed at. The teller window and tree tellers lost their job.
bad,"JPMORGAN Chase is an excellent place to work and grow. Plenty of opportunities to move up if you want to or not. People are friendly, helpful and professional"
bad,Okay if you've a good manager but hard to come by. Middle management is generally inept. Decent benefits but pay is comparatively lower. Always playing second fiddle to New York.
bad,All they care about is the Metric numbers. ZERO COMPASSION for the employee. Hired me as a closer and funder processing loans and now placed me on a team I know nothing about and getting ready to fire me..
bad,Avoid the call center at all costs! They lie to you in training about what the job is really like and once you are out on the floor you are on your own to sink or swim. Good luck getting anyone to help you as your requests for help will be ignored. Management is very rigid and inflexible and treats you like a child. Forced to work with very abusive callers with no recourse or help. Only took the job since I was desperate and needed the money. Turn over is very high. You are micromanaged to death with no work life balance or reasonable policies. Avoid at all costs!!
bad,I wouldnt be here if chase was a good place to work lol. I really dont agree with how banks do business with people. It feels like they keep the poor paying fees and waive all the rich people's fees etc..
bad,"This was a job I took and regret it from the start. Chase is too big for its own good and treats employees with o respect, but they expect the world from you."
bad,"Management is a joke, not flexible and not willing to help you succeed. Beverlly Hills Market is the worse to work in. JP Morgan needs to get better in making divisions when hiring managers."
bad,This is by far the worst bank I’ve ever worked for. The pay is extremely low for bankers and managers have it so hard that if you’re given a low income area or not as affluent for your branch and a peer is given are affluent area no matter how hard you work your pay will be less annually. Speaking of annual pay it’s so sad that managers work so hard for one pay a year that most of the time is really low/
bad,Worst job experience I ever had. They are to talkative and comfortable about throwing the word “gay” around. They are very unprofessional & leadership is Undependable. They lie! They conspire! They don’t help you when you need it! It’s stressful. It’s to big! It’s not all you would hope it to be!
bad,"i did not like working here terrible environment for veterans.  Veterans are not valued here. I would not care to work here again"
bad,This place is a joke!! 24 year old TL who have NO CLUE how to talk to grown women dress attire is unprofessional and the people are unprofessional!! Do NOT EVEN APPLY if you are not childish or professional
bad,"At will company will fire you if they don't like you, dare not go to HR to complain because you will be ostracized and fired for complaining even though they claim to have a no retaliation policy.  Do not trust your manager.  There is no diversity and you are definitely treated like a number."
bad,"The culture was difficult and stressful. This was quite awhile ago, so I have no idea what is going on in the company today."
bad,A micromanager that Try to do my job instead of his. I could not handle the stress you put on me. Every day he hounded me on some thing I did wrong instead of something I did right.
bad,JP Morgan has been on record for making the massive profits which they are not sharing with their employees their employees are working three times as hard managers do not answer customer complaint calls even when the customer request to speak to a manager it is prohibited they are anti employee there for making it anti customer there is nice to make money I'm glad that they have a prophet but they've gone into a grid situation that is beyond recognition is horrible
bad,I felt like I was just a number at Chase. Little to no concern is shown for employee's there. It's very much a slave like existence in my opinion. Every department tends to be just another call center.
bad,"it is a shame that with such a great leader and CEO, Jaime Dimon, this place is very hostile and employees only look at for themselves. Please do not speak to each other, and Home Lending it very cut throat.  Hidious."
bad,"Chase is a god awful place to work. The call center environment is run like a plantation where upper management is allowed to run amok without any reprimand. The pay is a joke, barely above minimum wage. Voicing a complaint gets you nothing, the employee hotline should be non existent. Trying to get a manager to take a call is like climbing mt Everest in a snow storm."
bad,I start with them in side Fred myer store location at Renton plaza  they have terrible management every thing not working machines print every thing horrible they are not organized. I am not recommended for any person.
bad,"Very unprofessional bank managers.  Terrible work environment with bankers and bank managers.  In 8 years I had 9 investment managers and 6 different region managers...aweful place to work, always looking to terminate top producers.  I have seen countless good employees terminated and disgraced for the most insane reasons...I am very happy to be away from the sick culture there."
bad,JPMC treats employees like they're doing them a favor.  Management doesn't care as long as they're are not tasked by their superiors.  Management always looks for a scapegoat to their inability to manage.
bad,"I dont remember working here, it was okay, not bad at all. I don`t remember having an issue, It was okay, they didn't have good policy and procedure. but amazing company, wouldnt mind working for them again."
bad,It Sucked*********************************************************they over work you. They dont provide excellent customer service. More about numbers than caring
bad,"Incentives decrease which means an employee has ot sell more accounts  and benefits in order to make ends meet.  "
bad,"Management does not understand the difference between a series 6 and 7. If you are a series 7 licensed person, do not accept a banking role equating your licensing with a 6."
bad,Management do not care anything about temp employees. I am not counted as part of human resources. I am just being used for a few months when the time is up I have to be gone. Management just want to have the work done that is all.  There are nothing to enjoy about the experience working here.
bad,I worked for Chase for more than 7 years. I had extensive banking experience when I was hired and I was never adequately compensated for my knowledge or experience. Chase made a business decision to outsource our department outside of the United States. Chase cares about their bottom line more than its employees or customers. I won’t financially support Chase as a business in the future.
bad,Good luck working with geology majors and people with no math background. Enormous number of retail branch employees undereducated for their role. Incompetence is the norm
bad,This is by far my worst company I’ve ever worked for.  The work environment is so toxic that HR actually defends coworkers that are threatening violence against you!  After working at this horrid company I had to quit because HR would not help and I dealt with unrelenting harassment for almost a year.  Coworkers actually commuted crimes and followed me home and broke into my house.  It was common knowledge what was happening and no one helped.  Even after I left I was stalked for over 7 years now.  I cannot even put into words what a horrible place this is.  Stay far far away.
bad,I have been working at Chase bank for 10 years and one day they decided to fire me because I was helping the clients out instead of the company. This company says it’s all about customer satisfaction but in reality is all about what makes them money..
bad,"This company was definitely not a people person company. Treats employees that have been with the company badly. When there was downsizing done, it was really amazing that all the people downsized had been with the company the longest"
bad,"This company conducts massive lay-off three times a year; every March, June, and October they let go hundreds of employees across the nation."
bad,Cited for a call was documented as mishandling with out screenshot. A grave offense to be called out for is unacceptable especially when there's no evidence to support poet it.
bad,"Unfair, racially profiling, stressful, always laying off, bias managers, unethical, no training, difficult to move up in the the chain and racist manager."
bad,Horrible company takes advantage of part timers as full timers without compensation . No work life balance has created jobs that do not provide a livable wage
bad,"Discriminating ,harassing practices ,they do not follow their own regulations or even the employment act . I have been harassed and assaulted by upper end management on many occasions ,my complaints were always laughed at . I was assaulted by an upper management employee and the manager didn`t want to file a report . I worked for 5 years without an increase in salary and when I asked for my personal file I was jerked around and it took well over 1 month to obtain and it was scrubbed clean of information."
bad,"not a company i enjoyed working for , advancing was hard and work life balance was awful. Leadership has high turn over rate and empty promises. insurance is ok"
bad,"This is awful company, I recently quite due to a harassing, unprofessional and unethical work environment! After quitting the company they decided not to pay me for my hours worked. Since I was given and used vacation hours at the beginning of the year and quite mid year. so since I used my vacation hours up they essentially took back the vacation hours from my last check. If you decide to get a checking account and have limited funds, don’t get a account through them! The company reorganizes the transactions so you incur a fee and they in turn benefit from the fee! I am not just saying this because I am a disgruntle employee. It really does happen!"
bad,Management doesn't care about work life balance. They would want you work 7 days a week if they could...they would ask if you can work on Christmas Day
bad,This company does not care about its employees only about aorkung you til the breakung point and then discarding you for fresh meat. Longevity and loyalty are mot rewarded here. Look elsewhere.
bad,"The management is bad I was not"
bad,"From the moment I stared working there I was mistreated.  The trainer that I had to shadow for 3 months was a woman on a power trip who really didnt teach me much. Then when I finally got placed I had a manager from down under. She liked me at first but when I had some health issues every thing changed. she would make fun my health and bully me. She even called one of my other coworkers fat and another the B word. She was the worse manager I have ever had to deal with. I called HR and two weeks later I was fired for being an unfit employee. Mind you I had been in my position for a year and out of nowhere I'm unfit? Plus 4 months later when a potential employer called to verify work she took the call and completely slandered my name. I called HR and they specifically stated that their policy is to transfer the call. Management is never supposed to speak to anyone about an ex or current employee.  It's obviously retaliation but supposedly Chase has a ""Zero tolerance policy "". Its a joke. All the stress is not worth it."
bad,no comment at this time the company not pay me on time and I didn't get for my final two months work. I have to file a court order complaint for them and didn't get paid yet.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working in investment banking here. Toxic environment with lacking senior leadership, not good enough deal flow, and too much marketing work"
bad,things were never concrete. every one was on a different page. the management spoke about you behind your back and no one appreciated you or the work you did.
bad,xxxx-no review given-good work environment very fast paced-trainin not so good.  No room for upward mobility management has disconnect with employees at all leverls
bad,"Horrible place to work.  Bad pay, and the company rules with intimidation.  Not a healthy environment.  They have a one touch, where you do three divisions work for bad pay.  The have one long desk, that everyone sits at, no privacy, people coughing, and sneezing, its like a sweat shop."
bad,No advancement opportunities. Poor Management and lack of communication/training. Time off was good. Was laid off with no assistance my last 45 day. We are just a number in a chair.
bad,"The training was very extensive .  The position did not warrant the classes that had to be taken.  "
bad,"Very corporate and conservative. That being said, not a terrible place to be. Pay could be better, but benefits were decent and the people were tolerable."
bad,The management team makes this a difficult company to work for. I really don't want to say a lot about this company as I don't have any good memories.
bad,Really not a great place to work. Management is misleading. You honesty can’t trust what some of them say. You have to learn to read between the lines while dealing with them. They’re very cryptic.
bad,"This job has been my hardest job with a manager that doesn't care about you or future, and didn't make my job any easier. Gave everyone a hard time and only cared for himself. I really don't recommended this company at all if you want to move up, because there is favoritism or should I say Politics."
bad,Contractors are noncitizens. Management thinks that they deserve excessive compensation while disparaging the efforts of the personnel who actually do the work. Thr board rates the ceo as 110% of the corporation efforts and everyone else is 0%.
bad,If you are looking to work for a very stressful company....this one is for you. The management is very poor and lots of employees are very unhappy and blamed for Sr. Managers bad decisions. HR will not support you and takes the managers side.
bad,"Chase is a company who doesn't care about it's employees. The calls are gonna be some of the hardest calls you ever had. Dealing with people who passed away, divorce, really angry, threatening calls that the managers will blame you for not making all these ppl satified. You are held 100% for customer surveys even if it's obviously for someone that's not you and will be drilled by multiple ppl for it. I just dont recommend anyone working here. I came here becuase I always thought working at a bank would mean great pay and benefits and it's not. You will be making roughly what you start at for years and years and years. They do annual raises but for like .10 to .30 cents a year and when they up the starting pay you will be left behind and the new hires will start to make more then you even if you have years on the new hire. This company is not worth your time. If you need a job take it but leave ASAP it's only going to eat away at your soul and you will be left broke and angry."
bad,"no need to expand on corporate America.  cut throat, stressful, bottom line focused. if you are ok with working in an atmosphere where people are deceptive and out for themselves, this is the place for you."
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They hire smart people, then micromanage them to the point where they know when you take a bathroom break. Btw no bathroom break in the first hour you get there (not a joke). Your taught to do some stuff that I really regret. If I could add a picture, I would include an email thread of management discussing how to stop clients from calling in by lying."
bad,"In my several years of banking I never experienced such a two faced people , manager trained employees to snitch on new employees and create awful work ."
bad,"its not the ideal bank to work for, stay away. Managers are controlling and mirco management. you have to pick a good manager in order to survive at that branch."
bad,I was miserable working at chase. People that called you thought it was your job to save their houses for them. This was not the job for me. I honestly could not wait to get out of that job.
bad,"All work, no care for your livelihood.  Stay away from this firm if your thinking retail.  They will kill you.  And if your a successful FA.  They will managed you out and take your book."
bad,really boring no work! long hours and where i am located its dead! but hey i seen every show on Netflix. anyone would love this job sit on the phone all day but not me i love making money and earning money bones but nope not here
bad,"You're just a number to them.  Don't work here.  No chance for career progression, small bonuses, no work from home, low salary, poor management, depressing work environment."
bad,"Be warned, annual bonuses AND raises are tiny, if given at all. Get a higher salary than you need, up front, because the raises, if granted, are lower than the rate of inflation. In return, the company will demand all your time, even some weekends, fire people and expect you to cover two or more full-time positions. Their motto is not work-life balance, rather ""let's see how much we can put on this person until they break"""
bad,"Difficult place to work, management is not vested in employees.  Communication from top down is not aligned.  Management can be misleading when asked direct questions"
bad,"Would never want to work there, the scheduling was real bad and the work culture stank, The clients were Spanish speaking who didn't understand their banking service and always felt the company was cheating them- charging fee's for 5 cent over drafts to a $1 during the recession."
bad,"no longer a place of good employment. if they would make positive changes then they could be a great company again. management is bad, high stress so bad that it literally makes people sick."
bad,"the work was okay the pay was about right there, some of the people there were great while others were not so great. do not look at moving up in this company"
bad,"A typical day included a daily team meeting with team lead and manager. During these meetings the team was reprimanded for turn around on processing. What I learned is the company placed little value for their employees to the point where it wasn't uncommon for employees to get sick on the job and occasionally 911 had to be called due to an employee collapsing on the job. The hardest part of the job was the long hours (60 hours+ was not an uncommon work week),"
bad,The management is focused on cutting on every corner sometimes affecting quality measures taken to prevent big disastrous scenarios. Have to watch your back everyday.
bad,Job was not great  very stressful and the training was not great  you were expected  to perform certain duties with limited  assistance  and management was not  supportive
bad,"They give you vacation hours but if you leave the company they will take half your money and insurance is high deductibles ridiculous horrible company to work for I will never work for them again not only was I part time but most of my check went to paying for insurance every check and still get charged co pays stressful,unorganized,schedule never set always change every other day Literally and always work long hours we close at 6 why am I in the branch until 7 or 8 one night I was there until 12:30pm (at night) I know sounds crazy right but the jpmorgan chase doesnt care about anyone but themselves and making their money if you want to get treated like nothing and stress yourself to health problems chase is the place for you to apply oh and dont forget all of the favoritism and you have to do all your work plus others too busy or not! I HAVE NEVER HATED A JOB SO MUCH IN MY LIFE!"
bad,There was no official training!  You had to depend on team members to help you understand all of their systems. The client base was to large to handle all of the merchants needs.
bad,"Managers would micro manage you and go look for you in the bathroom.  There was a lot of favoritism there , if you were not in there click you could not advance."
bad,"There was little job stability and a high turnover rate for new employees. Tuition reimbursement was offered, but only for employees that were in other departments. Moving beyond a supervisor was almost impossible because many of the managers never left to open up those positions. It was a hostile work environment once I returned to work after I had been out for a week for documented medial reasons."
bad,"No one was ever considered for advancement.  My main supervisor was always in a terrible mood, never spoke to anyone unless he spoke to us first.  They would make goals for us and when they were achieved they would change them just so we would not be able to make our bonuses.  We never were provided Holiday lunches we had to bring our own food for those."
bad,Working a JP Morgan was ok. You made a lot of friends and sometimes got to run into the CEO. My supervisor was fun and relaxed and always made us laugh at the begining of the day.
bad,"Work-life balance does not exist here. Your pay is constantly changing, your roll is constantly changing, and you are constantly made false promises by management. You are forced to work whenever they need you including Saturdays and Sundays. There is a lack of diversity in management by race and sex. There is little hope for career advancement. Everything in Chase will be a lateral move. Also, once you leave the company, Chase will claim you were overpaid and take your final paycheck. This happened to myself and multiple co-workers I personally know. Chase does not value you as a person. I worked for Chase for 7 years, and I am extremely disappointed in Chase as a whole. Save yourself the stress and find another bank to work for."
bad,"Promotion based solely on tenure. High turnover of the best upcoming workers due to low pay and slow promotion process. Exclusively a CYA attitude where anyone who speaks up get punished. Terrible for working parents. The support looks great in the brochure, but they will cut your bonus for taking advantage of extra time off."
bad,Managers keep to themselves. Withhold certain information when questioned. You really have to be independent in this position. Only your peers are the ones who will help you. When the VP comes around friendly voices come out and fake smiles. Managers actually put their phone away at that time. Love most of the merchants who call in.
bad,"The environment was toxic and thrived on creating dissension.  It was an awful place to work.  Hopefully that has changed since I left, but I would never go back."
bad,"Left after 4 years because of poor management, culture, poor pay and inadequate opportunities.They have great advertising but the reality is nothing like."
bad,The agency does not have good training and pays low wages.  The staff gets locked in and dedicated and never leave.  Many of them are working 2 jobs because the pay is so low
bad,Management is out of touch with the client base.  Management has unrealistic expectations for their Cash Management Officers.  Territory is too big and CMOs are spread too thin.
bad,"Low pay, and not a good company to work for. Too many negative things, cannot be described here. Trust me, the big banks are the worst. They never care about your career and always try to low your pay"
bad,This hands down was the worst company that I ever worked at. They will not let you break and if you do get one you will be called off for any reason. The amount of micro management and back biting was staggering.
bad,"Terrible experience. I attended banker school for two months and earned all of my licenses to do banker work, but when I arrived in the branch I was used to push angry customers on. Unrealistic sales goals considering I spent the vast majority of my time telling people we would not be reimbursing their overdraft fees. Treated horribly by the branch manager."
bad,"horrible never work there again, or will I tell anyone to work there. Management and everything was horrible. only good thing was the maternity leave."
bad,"Policy matters more than performance. "
bad,Management is not opened to change. Very combative and will retaliate if you reach out to someone else for help. HR does not investigate bullying within the workplace
bad,"This bank has layoff's annually.   They would prefer to hire from the outside than promote from within.   Management is not very strong, the bank has annual layoffs at every level.   You cannot plan a long career here."
bad,Main responsibility was reviewing a Que of applications submitted by Auto Dealers.  No formal training on system or process offered.  The role was a learn as you go.  Evening and Weekend hours were required for which no flexibility given with a sick family member.
bad,"Wrost company.  Do not join. High politics.  Worst management.   .                            "
bad,I really did like working for this company and fell as if they cared about their employees. Once management changed everything changed and it was a great place to work
bad,"Schedules constantly changing so you are unable to plan a balanced work/life calendar. Breaks and lunches are never on time.  Staff forced to call out sick as they are never given the days off they request."
bad,"It was very quick paced, which is one of the things that I did like about it, days went by very quickly. Benefits were also great! Healthcare was awesome."
bad,"You are given little or no training on how to perform your job and then when it is not done the way your manager wanted it you are reprimanded, even though you weren't given any guidance."
bad,"I have been with JPMC for 11 years and it was okay at first. As I moved to new managers it got to the point where I was going home in tears on a weekly basis, along with very bad anxiety on a daily basis."
bad,"unfair pay"
bad,Very large company but completely cut throat in their sales practices and unethical. Management is very poor and almost robotic in their approach. If your offered a job don't take it! Mentally cruel place to work.
bad,Bad management. Long working hours. The On-call person is no personal time during the day and without any extra pay. Micromanagement hour base. Daily tasks report is a requirement.
bad,The company cared more about their bottom line than they did about their employees and customers. The management made it very clear who their favorites were and gave them more opportunities for advancement compared to everyone else.
bad,Micro managers.  They don't trust you can do your job.  It was like being back in high school.  People had their groups and too much gossip; managers included. Bad culture.
bad,Not my favorite place to work. Felt like I was a letter and five numbers to them. If you did not make them money the did not care and you was always replaceable no matter how hard you worked or how good your attendance was.
bad,"There is high turnover since management is terrible. Lots of incompetent managers with lots of insecurities and drama. In my dept the good managers got fired and the lazy, stupid managers who are kiss ups remained. Management doesn't want to fire you since the company doesn't want to pay unemployment so they make your life miserable in the hopes you'll quit so make sure you keep a copy of your conract and detail notes of any meetings with management and any incidents. Because management lies. Also they are a greedy transactional company, they don't care about their customers or their employees so if you care about your customers or co workers you'll not last long at this company.  Very low employee morale in every dept, everyone hates their job and the company, just read a site ( google it) to see how much the company screws its employees. Be very careful and read your contract very carefully the job is not what they say it is. Management is deceitful and incompetent. Technology is outdated and crashes all the time."
bad,"Its everything you expect from them, a big coporate enterprise and it has its benefits. They have a big platform and they provided their employees with great benefits"
bad,Take calls for  hour shift and resolve card members issues. How to multi task multiple screens and resolve those issues. Management is eager to help. For me the long commute from Summerfield to Lake Mary. the satisfaction of resolving problems for the card members
bad,"Worked there for almost 20 years. Heavy workload, low compensation, brutal disregard for well being of employees. Eventually had my job sent to mid-west office  where people were paid less than I was making and laid off with no regard to my well being.  Left Chase exhausted and with few prospects since I was over 55. Now impoverished."
bad,"Minute by minute, the investment environment is shifting. Holding your ground is hard enough. Getting out ahead of your competition and differentiating for your clients? Even harder. Today, success comes down to how well you adapt to both challenges and opportunities. So we do more than just launch new products. We craft solutions to help keep your business moving forward."
bad,"Once hired, you are given a step by step itinerary to follow to help solve problems.  If an issue occurs outside of that itinerary, the issue gets escalated.  No room to improve and no education given.  Everything is self-motivated."
bad,"Terrible call center to work at. The salary is an insult for the amount of work one has to do. Management was terrible, they encouraged employees to come to work early to start computer before they clock in."
bad,Job was outsourced to India twice within a 3 year period. Check Linkedin.com to see all the ex JPM employees listed there. Don't want experienced seasoned employees.. would rather hire no experience necessary to cut down on costs.
bad,"Management was the worst I have ever worked with, they were dismissive and were not knowledgeable of the job, industry, or how to deal with people in general."
bad,"Data Entry position, no room to work as a team. This is not a place to build a working relationships with co-workers or even supervisors. No talking, talking is prohibited. There is no room for career advancement."
bad,"They do not take the employees side at all, and do not care about the employees just the money made.  No room for growth, as they try to keep all employees at the same level forever."
bad,I really wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company unles syou just ned a job. I think the managetment is terrrible. I wouldn't recommend.  This company does pay decent.
bad,J.P. Morgan was actually a great job very easy the environment was positive hard working and friendly the job was very simple great pay just good all the way around
bad,"Toxic work environment, managers refuse to assist their employees and are hostile when broached about the issue. You can't get anywhere if your manager doesnt like you so dont even bother trying for that promotion. no matter how good you are they will shoot you down everytime."
bad,On most days you are required to work long hours with limited breaks. You are responsible for functions that are in and out of scope of your job based on ad hock requests. The culture is competitive and cut throat. Hardest part was keeping up with expectations with limited staff and constant management and organizational restructures. Most enjoyable part was the exposure and learning tools which helped me stay ahead of industry standards.
bad,"The management was awful.  Promised advancement with no advancement.  Boss had no control. Was asked to work certain shifts, from 8-8.  Took over two different levels above me when people went on paternity leave.  When they quit they went with an outside hire.  It was more the group I was with, that was absolutely awful, and would not recommend it to a soul."
bad,"Some very smart people in the organisation but senior managers (MD-level) have been promoted to a level of incompetence. They may be very good at the Associate, VP and ED levels but are very ineffective once reaching MD."
bad,"Women should be empowering each other, not knocking them down.  But unfortunately the technology department has a few woman who see other smart, driven women as competition and do what they can to remove them from their current organizational structure.  It's sad."
bad,not a goo place to work at wouldn't recommend it to anyone not good pay barely any raises constant firing of employees didn't like working there and wouldn't go back
bad,Working at the branch is the most stressful place you will ever work. Sales quota are unattainable . Managers do not understand the lack of foot traffic does not bring sales.
bad,Was termed for random ridiculous reason. Was then CHARGED for my vacation hours. The mid-management team is horrible and they try so hard to push this uppety fake smile agenda then pull you to an office and show how ugly they really are. Was also written up for YAWNING. GLAD IM GONE.
bad,"The lay over at JPMorgan was very long and you lose a lot of clients because of the lay overs, not good when you work with good realtor they don't have time for lay overs"
bad,The management is so POOR. They would back stab you just to keep there job even if it was there fault. They have people in positions that should not even be there
bad,Avoid this place like the plague. I have not recovered after working there. If you get in there try to leave as soon as you can. Do not be suckered by how well they treat you in the beginning.
bad,Getting to work on time working together as a team with co-worker manage are always available when needed. Celebrating each other success and birthday
bad,It is really hard to move to a different position within the corporation. The only career path option would be within the branch.Branch management knowledge doesnt tend to be helpful
bad,"worst job at a call center. Too much favoritism and treated unfairly."
bad,No loyalty & poor management. The work environment was very stressful especially during the years the government monitored mortgage banking. My direct manager was not fair & at times very controlling. I didn't tell secure going to HR for any assistance.
bad,"My overall review of JPM Chase in the area I work in is that it is definitely a different type of culture especially dealing with the corporate politics.  For example, your raise depends on how you're rated against other employees under the same umbrella within the organization.  Your manager has to be prepared to fight for your rating against upper managements perception of you.  If upper management does not know exactly who you are or if you are not in their ""clique"" for a better term, you will not be considered worthy.  It doesn't matter if all of your responsibilities are met, if you do not literally part the Red Sea, you will not be compensated fairly.  In addition, this company caters to the newly graduated employees.  They are compensated very well and the loyal and older employees are overlooked."
bad,The general manager was mad at me for trying to improve the operation. The culinary skills were lacked. I love my job. I wish I could have had better opportunities elsewhere.
bad,"The atmosphere was horrible, the management wasn't very helpful at all. My 2 years there I had about 8 different managers nothing was ever consistant."
bad,"You'll never see the bonus the hire you and say you're eligible for, nobody does."
bad,being told you cannot work more than 20 hours at a part time job to supplement your income because chase hr department would like to keep chase as your main focus.
bad,working as an appraiser at Chase will lead to addictions as it is a stressful environment with no respect towards appraisers or the appraisal professional.
bad,"Low pay and poor management, my manager that was a great manager got fired for being to nice to the team he was manager over. He was helpful knew the product like the back of his hand but upper management felt like he was to lax on his team, but his team worked harder because we were not micro managed."
bad,it was nice working with jp morgan chase company. i got to learn many new things and its always challenging. very competitive and inspiring every day.
bad,Treated the employees with pure intimidation were often threaten if you didn't do something the manager wanted you would lose your job. We were encouraged never to call HR for issues or we would be on the layoff list.
bad,"Unprofessional place to work,filled with harassment that ppl ignore or blame the victim. Backstabbing co workers,full of gossip and ppl discussing they're pay which is the most unacceptable thing you can do in the workplace."
bad,"DCO has a very high turn over rate and is very a hostile environment."
bad,This was a temp job. The unsatisfactory rating would go against the temp agency and not the actual company. Lack of salary initiative and advancement would be the reason for my departure.
bad,I was in four different departments while I was at JP MORGAN CHASE. Each move was a promotion. The division I worked in was divided and we were sent to different departments. My job description changed.
bad,"Poorest management experience with disrespect for colleagues.  This company has a poor environment that instills fear of collaboration with others across departments and manager, as well as discouragement in personal growth."
bad,At Chase they will work your butt off. All of the branch managers do not have enough staff to run the branches correctly. Managers have to run the branch without the ability to eat lunch or to have a break its go-go-go-gogo.
bad,The culture was very bad... Lot of worthless process and so much reviews that one feels that we are worthless..... To make a single line of code change one needs to get the vetting from 7 committees and they work on their own sweet time.... Best thing is to avoid working here in the IT dept.
bad,It was just a bad time to work in banking due to the new regulations that were being implemented because of the credit card reform and the housing crisis going on.  I was given layoff status as was half of my team members
bad,I didn't like it I was just a job the want you to create impossible numbers and they managers was not friendly at all they where more worried about their numbers then the way the employee felt
bad,"call center with terrible atmosphere, bad managers, terrible standards and expectations, benefits do not outweigh the stress ////////////////////////////////////////////"
bad,replaced by Indians with absolutely no notice. my hiring manager quit half way thru my contract because he was being overrun by indians and could not handle the terror anymore even though he had decades wit the company. all regular American employees are terrified of losing their jobs. one supervisor in earshot of me used language that would make a sailor blush
bad,"I had to answer phones from irate customers about their mortgages. We were required to take so many calls a day, I was not able to meet these requirements."
bad,Made you feel like trash there and expected you to like being treated like that. Very Stressful and Cut Throat place. Avid working here if possible. I have even spoke to others after leaving and they said they experience same there.
bad,This company does not care about it's employees. I was working full time hours when it was convenient for the company. I would then be cut down to part-time when it suited them.
bad,"Managers hooking up with employees, getting aways with being rude to employees only pay twice a month which is horrible for the work that you do there,."
bad,The management was horrible. The company is a great place to strive. If they appointed a proper manager who cared about their position it would be different. I felt that I was being put down constantly when I only tried to better myself and ask questions. There was also occasional bad mouthing of other employees by the management.
bad,"- was lied to when I was hired."
bad,Overall Chase was a stressful place to work. The expectations and amount of work far exceeded the compensation. I would not recommend working there. Truth
bad,"Very stressful work environment in IT. Had to work off hours, weekends, and no appreciation plus lot of favoritism and bureaucracy. Nice place to work if you love to work off hours and weekends"
bad,Horrible and undervalued your treated as a number there's no consistency the left hand first know what the rights doing management and hr is horrible  policys are blurred
bad,This company always cut employees hours. They were never dependable or helpful. This company was very difficult to work for especially with the few hours given.
bad,"I would not recommend Chase as a company to work for there is very poor management, HR does not take issues and concerns seriously and neither does SR Management."
bad,"Run away, they harass and mistreat their employees. At one point they had people on Mandatory overtime, and only paying half the hourly rate for the forced overtime."
bad,"Lack of advancement, will tell and promises things that are not true. The commission system is set up so that employees can tag each other on sales. If you are new to a branch its unlikely they will tag you but if you been there for along time your buddy co workers will tag you on sales even if you didn't help make them. good ol boys club"
bad,They dont care about their employees at all. You never know when your breaks or lunches are because they make you go when its slow. They dont care about what else is going on in your life and the uniforms are really awful
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for the consumer line of business, because your capped on your potential to grow within the JPMorgan Co.  You have to leave the company and then re-apply for a better position"
bad,The Tampa Call Center is a very toxic & stressful environment in which to work where MANAGEMENT encourages its employees to take advantage of one another in order to advance ones future.
bad,The management is cold and unresponsive. The job is overly demanding for a low-entry level position. There is little opportunity for advancement and growth.
bad,it is your typical bank. Upper management spoke down to their employees. Branch management did not care about its clients only about how much money they had to bring to the bank.
bad,"The amount of work verse the pay that they give you is too low for the effort. Having to handle amount of work which is equal to 3 persons work, with having to go thru 100 tickets and 4 projects at time."
bad,Wouldn't work there ever again. When you leave the office after spending 10 hours there they make you feel like your robbing them. Lousy management very unfair to employees.
bad,"Employees are not treated well. There was little support or opportunity for advancement.  The banking industry was highly political and people were not interested in working as a team to get ahead, but more concerned with getting ahead themselves."
bad,"To Stressful. Not enough training, Supervisory did not have skill to teach you on the system she had been working on. Co workers were to afraid to go the HR"
bad,"Very difficult to move up in this company unless you are a ""chosen"" one.  The same people are tapped on the shoulder to positions based on outside of work friendships.  This has happened time and time again over my 15 years with the firm."
bad,This was a miserable place to work.  The supervisors are totally incompetent and lack even the most basic knowledge.  I have never worked for such ignorant people before in my life.
bad,on a typical day i came to work ready to work. i started work at 10 PM and got off at 7 AM I'd come to work ready to work and i just shuffled papers what i learned is you cannot always get along with everyone as far as management is concerned management was very strict and i understood because we were dealing with banking but you have to be extremely fast the coworkers were fine they were cool and the hardest  part of my job was i wasn't swift enough the most enjoyable part was when it was time to get off and go home
bad,The type of job is relaxing but i guess the account JPMorgan Chase pays good but Teleperformance is the worst company i have experience due to poor security with my basic salary of 14000 pesos a month would not sustain our daily needs since my kids are already 5 and we are seven in the family. I travel 37 miles and a commuter of Public Utility Vehicle and sometimes do the taxi. No travel allowance. Poor. Before  Teleperformance bought Aegis we were paid good.
bad,"Low pay"
bad,ridiculously terrible company to work for the management is terrible its not well run .15 cent raise is a joke and no supervisors have skills or knowledge of what is their job or yours when you need help it is terrible dont even apply
bad,I was a loan processor.  I processed loans and refinances all day every day.  Culture was typical corporate america where you have ideas and no one cares.
bad,The bank is a good fit for customers. They are willing to go above and beyond to protect the customers. As far as the employees the pay is not really good and insurance is a little high.
bad,"this was suppose to be a sales job, however all upper management were not sales people, they came from marketing or compliance. so the focus was never on helping people success in sales, it was all about saying the perfect thing. Everything was about scripts and becoming uniform in how we talk on the phone."
bad,"ok Place. Great Starter place to be. Opportunities if youd like. Great customer service. Convenient Banking. Friendly Staff. Vacation time, sick time."
bad,"Great company, benefits, money, etc., however the work environment (procedures, management, etc. needs help)!  Upper management needs to really take a good look at and spend some great deal of time within the Commercial Credit Card Services Department. I touched on this with management but nothing came out of it. I decided it was not for me."
bad,"The biggest bank in the US, that pays their employees 12 dollars an hour?! not sure if its still the case, but for the work that you were required to do, it was outrageous!! Turnover rate was in real! Also, they want you to dress business casual. while paying you 12 dollars an hour!! shameful!!!"
bad,"No work-life balance : have to work 12 hrs per day"
bad,Job that provides no advancement and no raise. Pressured to do sales. Favoritism and discrimination. I worked for a branch where I was the only one of my race and the manager would manage the lobby and send sales to people of her own race.
bad,They over work you for no pay. They will have tend to high very to little tellers. So if your a high paced bank location your pretty much going to work your butt off. Many of their workers end up on stress leave.They nickel and dime you with your raise. I worked there for 5 years and every year I got a dime raise. They will not hire enough people to work at their branches. You will have a managers responsibility with a tellers position and pay. Absolute worse job I've ever had! They also will make you work at different locations and schedule you for a 2 hour shift..... waste of time and money.
bad,"This company is outright garbage."
bad,"Do not work for this entity.  It is an atmosphere and culture ruled by fear, deceit and politics.  People are regarded as nothing more than cogs in a machine."
bad,You will get coached if you talk to much during your work. Literally no talking allowed. The work hours are strange. Weekends off. No benefits because your hired by contract. I worked for the company over a year and half and never got a permanent position.
bad,sometime it is okay to work here but keep in mind change is consistant in this company and you might be next to that think that is being changed. always have backup
bad,"work long hours never recognized no accountability leadership is not helpful and not knowledgeable. no resources, concerned on products instead of the emplooyees"
bad,"Extensive training, challenging work environment, rude employees. They expect a lot for minimum wage pay. They expect their workers to go through extensive training while the management does nothing to support training."
bad,A company that does not value their employees let alone their growth and professional development.  Employees are underpaid and sadly underappreciated.
bad,"This company is going to sink. Terrible management, and a crew of unmotivated individuals. The culture is horrible and nobody cares about each other."
bad,"Run for your life! This company is too big to sink in the next market crash, but I wish it did. Terrible culture and nobody is motivated to do better. I would recommend to stay away. PS, I left on a good note and the name sounds nice on a resume, but I'd stay away."
bad,"Upper management, district managers push you so hard just to compete with each other and they don't care about the stress you go thru........................................................"
bad,work place consistency is not  given at this location by management. no structure. The  work place environment is not fulfilling. No work life balance with the scheduling that is constantly changing.
bad,"very structured enviroment "
bad,"This firm used to be the ideal workplace, and still is in many of the major markets.  However, the Pacific NW market is managed by very poor managers.  Having been a rising star in the firm, and of a very high intelligence and education background, I found the ceiling to be very low in this firm."
bad,"The company has no regard for treating people as a human being, this company has a buddy system that management operates in and from and are apart of. This company has a bad reputation for not playing by the book if you are looking for job stability this company is not the place if you just have to have a job take there job offer but keep looking don't believe the hype go into this new job opportunity with knowledge of being warned."
bad,I was hired for a position.  When I started it was not the position I was hired for so I left.  Bad experience.  They ended up closing the department a month after I left.
bad,"Typical office drama, with little and guidance to your work other than having a 2000 pages guideline for the system that you are using.  No one to ask questions."
bad,"The most retail of all retail environments.  Commissions are only capped by how many people walk in the building, which you can't control"
bad,"Organization no longer exists.  The retirement department was eliminated. The organization no longer wanted to be in the defined benefit business, Their focus is defined contributions."
bad,"Hands down most horrible job I've ever had.  Kiss the work life balance goodbye.  You will work way more than 40 hours and you will work 6 days a week.  There are always a few nice customers, but depending on if you are in a bad part of town, most customers are awful.  I got screamed at, spit on, had stuff thrown at me, and called every name in the book.  It is personally your fault when their account is overdrawn and they can't qualify for a loan.  The pressure that upper management places on the employees to ""provide a great customer experience"" is ridiculous.  Customers know they can walk all over you and there is nothing anyone will do about it."
bad,i dont want to rant about a company but i will say this ! i will never advise anyone to work for this company. Under paid and over worked. Also no appreciation of your hard work . I was a bank teller with many many rolls.  I did the work of a full time employee  but would never get full time pay. My manager was very very fake ! She lied to me on countless occasions . I really hated working here and i think that is job is only good for a temporary moment (2 months) and thats it.
bad,High stress to produce numbers in the merchant dispute dept. Team leader and team lead boss lack people skills. No follow through on direction requested.
bad,"In my 8 years with JPMC, I've been to at least 4 Executive Directors. You will be lucky if you will be under a good one."
bad,"management is approaches employees with an attitue of like and prefer. No room for upward mobility and no incentives to stay with the company. Leaders are deceptive and lack depth, skill, and perception."
bad,"I guess it all starts at the top...when you have a CEO that has been ""caught"" with his hand in the cookie jar multiple times and the only consequence is raise freezes and bonus cuts for employees, how would anyone feel.  The expectation is that you work excessive hours with a poor pay structure and not receive bonuses because of lawsuits due to the CEO issues...makes for a bad overall experience and culture."
bad,Very unprofessional. Management that i came in contact with never took the time to go over my concerns being an employee. I dont think i will be here very long due to this. Bad management makes a bad workplace ANYWHERE.
bad,I didn't really enjoyed working for CHASE that was a lock of opportunities and my ex-boss was horrible that's why I quit.
bad,"Decent location, people,resources. Overall, not the ideal working environment. I'm glad to have moved on. Great learning experience at this employer."
bad,"no flexibility"
bad,"They do not value your hard work and loyalty. Their purge of older employees is disheartening. One day you're their favorite employee,  next day your position is eliminated."
bad,"I do not feel comfortable leaving a review for this company, as I do not have many nice things to say.  And I don't feel like lying."
bad,This was a terrible experience.  The pay was terrible and management and customers looked down on you and treated you awfully.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at JPMorgan in the financial sector. There is not much room for advancement or even management eagerness to help you reach that point.
bad,They laid off people because they didn't want to pay for the salaries and the health benefits. Worked with business bankers and assisted them with every aspect of the loan process.
bad,All managers are very inexperienced and unprofessional. District managers never have your back only the managers back. The speak to you very disrespectful and if you call HR or tell your district manager they somehow turn it around on you. They don't care about your personal life at all.
bad,You rely on your co-workers to teach you everything.  Management doesn't do anything about unprofessional employees.  The managers are unprofessional and swear all day in the workplace.  The money that they're willing to pay you isn't worth the hassle that comes with working there.
bad,"Management was despicable, they only cared about themselves and stepped on everyone else. Even if you did your job right they would find something to complain about. never gave kudos, always took credit for other peoples work. HR was no help either they would pass you off to someone else so they wouldn't have to deal with the problem."
bad,Good environment.   Nice building with cafeteria.  Enjoyed making a difference by helping customers.  I learned the default servicing process through foreclosure.
bad,"Work elsewhere and search for the top and the best companies to work for on the internet, of course JPMorganChase is on none of those lists, ever. If you have experience in system or network administration regarding user profiles and accounts, and if you don't have perfect credit, then you will not be hired and if you currently work here and don't have perfect credit, you will be fired. Politics play a part at this company and management is poor. They constantly find ways for you not to meet your goals and they are always changing them, so you will find it hard to get a raise or bonus. Make sure you don't work overtime, otherwise, if you make a few thousand dollars more in overtime, you will not get a raise or bonus. It seems like they want you to work 15 hours in a 8 hour shift and they will call that meeting expectations."
bad,I worked there for 26 years. I had good colleagues I worked with while  I was there. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the clients.
bad,I really enjoyed working for JP Morgan Chase. My co-workers were friendly and the environment was positive. The job was usually easy and sometimes challenging.
bad,"I liked being there , I just didn't like working late. my managers was helpful . I learned lot from my time at JPM. The overtime was sweet , and the bonus was great. I liked the site, they offered us all we needed at work"
bad,"This company does not cater to their employees, They push mandatory overtime on you without notice. The head bosses get raises but the lower levels stay the same."
bad,"I have been a loyal Chase customer for over 11 years. This all changed once I began working for the company. This was the most unprofessional experience within my corporate career. Chase does have wonderful benefits and perks but the people are ruthless. I had my personal life violated due to my partner working at the same location. I felt like I was reporting to prison instead of work. Management and trainers are clueless about their own operational systems, sound quality, & human compassion towards their colleagues. I excelled in my position quickly and got bored with the position just as fast. The customers overall do complain but I did my best to assure them with compassion for their financial well being. It is the upper management that shows lack of empathy for their own teams. Get it together Polaris!"
bad,"This job was beyond frustration with no true direction, The management was always clueless as to what was going on and in the event of a major issue they vanished."
bad,"The Firm is not the same post several bank mergers. "
bad,A heavy work load. Interfaced with other bank personnel. Love working with management and co-workers. Getting the job done.5
bad,This was by far the worst employer I have ever worked for. They treated their employees like slaves and redacted their compensation agreements in the middle of a pilot program without consideration of the employees who worked so hard for them or their families and children.
bad,"Not a positive nor productive place to work. Every morning when I wake up, I have a sense of relief that I am not working there anymore."
bad,"A typical day at work is team catch up, start the core of work, deliver the results; some online training; occasionally some townhall to keep you up to dates"
bad,I have mixed feelings about my time working at this Company for a little over 7 years. Great friendships have had some great experiences. I gained a lot of knowledge. overall it's just not a good source of off job security. Have been continuing laying off people since 2012.
bad,"Fun work place with supportive management.  Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.  The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
bad,"My manager had it in for me. I have two advanced degrees and was singled out and given the most horrific annual review possible. If a team member had the same issue with a project I did, it was fine. When I had the same issue, it was a major deal. I had no support from any manager. It was a very hostile environment and toxic."
bad,"I would rather keep my experience with this company to myself. What I will share is that I was truly unhappy. The health benefits at the beginning was my motivation. Unfortunately, that was short lived."
bad,"Poor company to work for. No union rights, no chance for promotion. Dull work, bad management. Bad office environment. This Company should have no place in any democratic society."
bad,The mission and the culture here don't match. They say they say they are all about work life balance but make it difficult for employees to achieve this when make changes to an already strict attendance policy. The turnover rate here is high. It is difficult to advance your career unless you know the right people. I would not recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,I was a consultant there but really liked the work environment and got to learn a lot about multi threading systems. It is a great company to work for and one of the best banks in the world
bad,"you are prisoners who are made to believe that there is nothing other than JP Morgan Chase"
bad,"No onsite training."
bad,"I have been working for this company for 6 years have learned a lot while working along side my co-workers, I have been able to build long lasting relationships with customers on a daily basis"
bad,JPMC is equally focused on the customer experience as well as the employee experience.  The environment is very professional.
bad,"No fun...    An environment of chaos where slavery rules.   "
bad,"Excellent "
bad,Enjoyed working with the fabulous financial company. I emphasis the  team i worked are really supportive and encouragable in nature.
bad,"They sell you on the pvc commission plan being uncapped and give you a low salary much lower than other banks. Unless your in one of the retail branches that is very busy you will not make any incentives. Very micromanaged environment, don't care about their employees just the number is all that matters. Plus incentive plan is reduced in the start of the new year. No merit pay increases or COLA adjustments."
bad,"·   Process customers transactions    "
bad,"The job was easy I enjoyed each day I worked there. I use to come to work on the weekend, we were able to bring our children as long as we kept up production with no errors. It was great, the supervisor was amazing and very concern about us personally."
bad,"Had a bad experience - sweat shop in Manhattan, NYC - they called it a high performance workplace, really disappointing experience. Reckless management, working at 3:00 AM in the morning (or just sending out timed emails at 3:00 AM in the morning), most of them are on the tip of their survival instinct. They talk about team work and keep stabbing and fighting with each other. They don't think through an activity, and recklessly pass executive orders, and keep reworking on it a zillion times, wasting everyone's time and pretending that they are working hard."
bad,"I did not stay long at this Company but overall was similar environment as previous work"
bad,JP Morgan Chase likes to discard employees like garbage.  Need I say more?  They have 166 cameras & planning to add another 100 so in essence they have turned the production floor into a prison.  That's what JP Morgan Chase is.
bad,Vacations are expected to be cancelled last minute as well as dr appts.  Work long hours and expected to adjust schedule accordingl to get exactly 40-hours a week...no over time allowed
bad,I have nothing postive to say.Horrible compnay towards employees. Did not care about the well being of employees only quotas.
bad,"there attendance policy needs review, the schedules needs to be clear to workers letting them know that you cant leave till que is cleared"
bad,Working a collections job for a credit card company takes a special person and it wasn't for me.  The pay was competitive but the work is tiring and the management are tyrants.  Benefits were okay.
bad,"These people don't care about you at all you will not be promoted its who you know they just fill you in, and if your a new hire your treated like a dog they make you do all the dirty work"
bad,they dont care about the employees. management is all about kissing butt
bad,Policies and procedures are not entirely transparent. The morale is low and there is overall poor leadership.
bad,Typical call center environment.  Not a lot of room for advancement.  Schedules weren't flexible.  Good starter job for someone in college or just out of high school. Not a good place to work if you're looking to move up.  Wages were standard for call centers.
bad,"If you are under IB or AM, then you should be fine. Working for Compliance is a dead-end. Teams are kept in silos, no career mobility, managers are control freaks they don't want their team members to communicate with anyone else."
bad,"great place to work.  schedule, flexibility, great pay. great people"
bad,"Very busy, learned to interact more with customers. My co- workers were amazing, and it was an enjoyable job."
bad,"This was a temp job, and it only lasted a month. Im annoyed that I have to write a review. I really don't have much to say about this job."
bad,"overworked and underpaid...everyone should get a 20,000 pay increase and allowed to go home ontime to your family"
bad,Unfortunately the management staff wasn't concerned with their staff.
bad,"Training was inconsistent, was told one thing by one trainer and then something totally opposite by another, was told would be a business card portfolio review risk analyst, then they turn around and tell half the class they will be doing new consumer accounts after we had done 90% training in portfolio risk review.  Awful company."
bad,"Speaking specifically about the Salt Lake Area management, they are some of the most talentless, lost and confused group of managers I have ever seen in one organization. There isn't one Leader on the collective management team. Iron fist is the way for these people. "
bad,worked here for a very long time and at times company had no structure.
bad,This company lays off people a lot. No job security. Office politics.
bad,I had fun working at here.It was good expierence. Everyone I worked with was nice.
bad,"This place is evil. Don't sell your soul. This is a place that doesn't have heart, instead, they will take yours and eat it raw."
bad,"Location, location, location, poor bankers that don't send leads yet they want to pay you the least in the business because of the referral aspect."
bad,underwrite and research loan reviews. excellent hard working employee.
bad,"Processed payments and applications for student loans."
bad,"A teller's day at work is usually long and can be interesting. Due to the hours of operations and scheduling, working 9 to10.5 hours (minus 1 hour lunch) is normal for a full-time teller. The long and inconsistent schedule along with standing for this entire length of time is the hardest part of the job. My colleagues are the most enjoyable part of the job. We are like a family and help one another (if needed). Working together gets us through the day."
bad,my most enjoyable day was on my birthday we had a small party in the office and our customers brought me gifts !!!!
bad,i don't recommend this job to anybody they don't support school
bad,My management was awesome they gave us kudos when goals were met.  I reviewed and documented errors to customer's vehicle loan contracts.   I loved my job because it was not stressful.  I enjoyed my co-workers and some are my friends.
bad,If you want to be micro managed every second and deal with horrible management then this is the place for you!
bad,"Save yourself stress, managers are rude, movement impossible"
bad,"Favoritism, promotions go to buddies of management not based on merit. The people on the floor are better educated than the supervisors. No consistency, policies changing all the time and people getting written up and fired for not following policies they didn't even know existed. Supervisors act unprofessionally and discuss other reps personal details and generally act unprofessionally.  Most people are either looking to leave or are trying to get on some kind of FMLA because the job is so terrible."
bad,Great place to work if you're willing to spend more than 9 hours in the office daily
bad,"Poor management, poor decision making, just an overall disaster"
bad,If you ar looking for job security do not work for chase. Even though you work for 16 yrs. They would not consider this and just let you even for smallest reason
bad,"We were to help customers but instead the way bonus was set up, it was to deny customers.  Our bonus was based on the number of completed files.  It took longer to approve one than to deny one.  I found where a woman whose husband had died and the underwriter turned her down.  When I asked about it, he said she was young...she can remarry.  (you can't make this stuff up)  The Management was oblivious to the fact that the way the bonus structure was set, you could actually scam the system (and many did).  When I pointed this out to them, I was the one in trouble.  I was written up for being snowed in at Christmas, I was written up for comments into the system when they ran a customer around for a month only to come back with what I had originally recommended.  There was nothing enjoyable about this dead end job from hell.  The manager I had obviously lied about their previous history as she had no clue as to what she was doing.  JP Morgan Chase did not care."
bad,"A typical corporate sweat shop. Employees are over worked, under compensated and not appreciated."
bad,"no work lfe balance, worst manager behaviour, bad working hours"
bad,Company is run from New York like a factory or a sweat shop. It is not kosher to make me force to write more by indeed.com
bad,"I was hired through a temp agency, in between jobs, coming from 12 years of prior banking experience and to be honest quite the step down from what I had previously been doing but the job market being what it was/is I had to have some type of income coming in my house. Training at the citadel building was for 3 weeks for the data keyer position, which was A LOT of info to learn plus certification was needed to pass the class. We were on the job about 1 month when the position abruptly(supposedly) went back over seas so we were offered a lesser paying position of mail extractors. OK, so we felt stuck, so we said yes. Training was 3 days, then we were released to the floor to work. Quickly we went from a class of 18 to 3 in less than 6 months! Totally deceived us on what the position really entailed."
bad,"There is a reason why Banks need to be regulated and carefully watched 100% of the time. This place was a joke, when I hit the floor as a fresh employee I got a manager who actually cared for me and taught me how to improve myself. Well, it was no wonder she got promoted to senior management team and moved off site because the rest of the ""managers"" were terrible (I could use better words to describe them but I will keep this G rated)."
bad,Wok is good and have more opportunity to learn new things and jell with different set of people
bad,First time I have ever seen managers yell at employees and get away with it.
bad,Very large company with allot of bureaucracy.  Work/Life balance is non existant.  I was oncall 24/7
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work!  There is nobody on the employee's side except other co-workers.  I had an issue that a manager had an issue with me being gay.  She created a hostile work environment for me. The mistreatment increased to the point I was being called names by the management team at my place of employment.  I went to HR about it and an ""investigation"" was processed once I went to HR everybody on the management team would not talk to me after that.  Then HR responded to me and said their finding is there is not a hostile work environment.  Shortly there after I was let go from the company for being 8 min late for my shift."
bad,"Lot's of promises, but never a follow through from upper management. "
bad,"Working for JPMorgan Chase on a typical day was contacting my clients via e-mail, or phone or answering questins about their account.    My job was to pay documents on a letter of credit on a specific day that they want their documents. I managed 8 clients in Import Letters of Credit. "
bad,This is temporary position and I simply work overnight when called to do so
bad,the job is very knowledgeable base. Great opportunity for promotions. TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF THE WORKER AND CO WORKERS.
bad,"Constantly making phone calls to card holders who were struggling financially.  The nature of the work was not a good match for me.  It was very much a race to make quota and encourage people to make commitments to send in what little money they had.  Depressing work and often had very upset custoers.  Managment tried to keep us encouraged but it was never something I enjoyed."
bad,"Productive and fun work place. Best employee experience, Work-Life balance is great, management is very approachable, job advancement is encouraged, great values, and benefits/compensation is excellent. I give Overall rate of 5 stars."
bad,"Day-to-Day working for the Chase Division of JP Morgan Chase, is barely a grade above a sweatshop. Comparatively their pay is lower than anyone else around, they have stricter rules (you need to clock out to go to the bathroom), and the management rules in fear, not through leadership, recognition, or development. It's selfish Capitalism at its VERY finest, thanks Jamie Dimon."
bad,company shut down laid everyone off and moved somewhere else
bad,"A good place to work, very challanging"
bad,"customer service"
bad,Managing my team. Talking to customers. Understanding that not everyone is at the same pace. Sales goals being increased during the last two days of the month. Looking at month end reports.
bad,After 4 years of service I was flown 1400 miles on half a days notice to attend a conference call so the man on the other end could tell me they were laying me off in two months and moving my job to Ohio.  Then told I was welcome to apply for my job in Ohio (if I was qualified) but that I would have to move myself up there if selected.  And I was excepted to train my replacement before I left.  Enough said…
bad,"Naice place to work"
bad,"A typical day at work was that I would arrive at the branch and try to originate loans and find new victims, er I mean... customers.  Most of the people who work at Chase Retail Banking are either not that bright, not that talented, have some kind of personality disorder, are not team players, etc.  Or, they have a collection of the aforementioned problems.  I learned very little on the job.  I did learn that there is little, if any, opportunity for advancement at Chase-- especially if you start at the bottom in a bank branch.  I learned that Chase makes a huge amount of money by not paying or compensating its employees very well and by treating its customers even worse.  I learned that the banking bailout of 2008 merely propped up a corpulent and poorly-run organization.  I learned that many people act 'fake' and 'phony' and will do anything for money.  The hardest part of the job was watching my customers being treated poorly and waiting, in some cases, for up to 6 months to get their loans closed.  It was extremely painful to watch my customers to be treated so poorly.  The hardest part of the job was showing up everyday and wanting to quit-- but not quitting because I was trying to hang on.  I was hanging on in hopes that perhaps things would improve in the company and I was hangining on just to show people that I could work in a poor job with poor co-workers and a poor manager-- for more than 1 year.  Why, I don't know... The most enjoyable part of the day was my last day-- when I got to leave.  I missed one of the greatest booms in refinancing mortgages and missed a great"
bad,A great & challenging work environment with innumerable opportunities to perform & grown in the field of human resources. Highly competitive & dynamic workplace.
bad,"When working for JP Morgan Chase you had to work in groups and teams, you understand peoplel more. And also  it gives a cnhace to learn and teach each other."
bad,"Start early and finish late and work under pressure at all time."
bad,have very very poor management. the payment is not enough for the amount of work you have to do 
bad,Great Company name
bad,22 years of mortgage banking experience
bad,"I worked for a small community branch and it was wonderful, until Chase redirects all their District Managers. There is favoritism, to where they will try to push you out to bring in the people they want. After I was laid off Chase tried to say that they over paid me for vacation. I had to deal with it 6 months after I was let go."
bad,"This job was very structure, I was a temporary worker and didnt get treat or recognized by our performace. We didnt get paid on time and always overlooked"
bad,"they let go of 10 temps the day week before thanksgiving. They have favorites, they give more hours to people who become friends with management. Finally, they are racist they only hire african americans."
bad,Chase needs to fix upper mangement to keep seasoned employees.
bad,"very poor management and no raise this year for achieving a ""meets"""
bad,"Management is very Poor. Decisions are made and not released to supervisors until they drop it on the rest of the staff. Most of the time you hear of decisions from the Managers friends and it goes around before anything is ever mentioned. Mainly the Sr. Manager is the problem and never talks to any staff members unless he ""is cool with you"". Co workers are the best part. It's one big disfuntional family. We all talk about wanting to go elsewhere and many of us have."
bad,.Great job work hard . Long hours no benefits. Your learn alot of information going out and getting the mail to the other departments .Poor management.Meeting great people and learning how to interact with the customers.
bad,Chase bank markets them selves as a customer oriented business advising Personal Bankers to sell based on customer needs. But the truth is they design the goals and compensation plan to force the Personal Banker to sell based on selling the banks most pofitable products and services.
bad,"This was an temporary position and my assignment ended. In addition, my duties included calling customers regarding past due mortagage."
bad,Via Philadelphia Airport. Pay scale fluctuated when they realized employees were making bonus everyday.
bad,"need more opportunities for advancement. In some locations, parking is not allowed."
bad,"• Processed student loan applications, responded to questions regarding loan process, and reviewed loan terms."
bad,The company is stable and with much potential. But unfortunately the staff who manage the company lack professionalism.
bad,I was a third party collections representative. I was able to offer settlement and hardship programs.
bad,will not allow you to get off if needed unless its scheduled which hardly ever happens
bad,Maybe if the personnel would be replaced it wouldn't have been too bad
bad,Just a huge robot factory. Learned how to try to make a sale no matter how
bad,Mgmt needs to take some classes on how to respect there employees. And not to promise you during the interview that there able to work with you regarding picking up kids from school. Then as soon as you come back from training she tells you she can no longer accommodate was she promised. Wish I wouldn't have wasted my time with them. On to bigger and better things!!!!!!
bad,Retail atmosphere is miserable. The only good thing about working here was the benefits other then that it is a high stress not worth the money environment.
bad,I worked there for a long time with the ups and downs. Management was great and lots of good people.
bad,"To many chiefs for starters. They waste money as evident by all the meals they were buying when I started there. Lunches, dinners and breakfast was provided. They said it was so everyone could stay working while they ate. The place does not know how to manage money. Worst job experience ever. Many many ex co-workers are trying to get other jobs. No one is happy there. I wouldn't work there ever again for any amount of money. If I could I'd give it zero stars."
bad,sign holding on the side of the road for several hours.
bad,A typical day involves doing absolutely nothing but staring at a cube.
bad,"Good learning experience, with good benefits but menial pay, heavily micro managed (retail branch setting), with high turnover, lowest employee morale, and constant change in management."
bad,"works you hard, little incentive, little compensation, terrible hours, terrible management"
bad,"Female employees and managers dominate environment. Must account for every minute adhering to specific minute performance measures. Frequent changing of compensation; never knowing what one will earn from quarter to quarter. Aggressive work place with micro management pervasive. Attitude of ""not-invented-here"" syndrome regardless of what PR exists."
bad,management are very deceiving and not trust worthy. Management hold the power to ruin anyone Carrier without giving it a second thought which is totally against what company stand for. management will frame you in such a way where they will cover their steps so the blame of discrimination does not fall on them directly.
bad,Unfair treatment. Do not really work well with students. Management is corrupt especially at retail locations. They are okay for temp. For being a big bank does not pay well at all.
bad,"You are merely a monkey in a giant wheel and when the company feels they are done with your service, they will quickly replace you for someone cheaper. They'll pat you on the back and reward only to squeeze every profit they can from you - they discard you just as quickly."
bad,The benefits were great but the management sucks. HR is also set up to not listen to the employees with issues but find a way to turn issues back on the employee when they call to report any type of issues. I felt like a complete number here and diversity is just a word tossed around but if you truly represent any type of diversity here you are considered a black sheep. The level of stress you'll have to endure is not worth the headache of working here.
bad,"JPMC 2020 Plan resulted in firmwide layoffs throughout the New York Offices as reported in the news like on Bloomberg News. Typical day at work required meetings and conference calls from 8am with work to complete until at least 7 or 8pm, sometimes later."
bad,"If you want high politics and a heart attack work here.  Rules are different but they change to the whims and fancies of the management. ....,........... "
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone!! If you enjoy being stuck in the same department for years with no hope of advancement, and policies that land you towards the path of no return then Chase Bank is for you! Absolutely horrendous management, no organization! Everything is done for the company and never for the benefit of its employees! You are just a cog in a machine! The managers seem to have an alibi for everything "
bad,Do not waste your time. This job was an absolute nightmare. And I even did extremely well here. The management is a joke from the top down. Just do not waste your time.
bad,"There is no worklife balance. Job security is questionable unless you are liked by the managers. It is all.about who you know to move up. The management is poor. There is no such thing as a 40 hr work week. Be prepared to work well over 40 hours. "
bad,"Management is all about doing nothing while complaining you dont follow the process.  They literally dbl your workload and ignore the job description.   They look for excuses to write you up, most false, and you have no recourse.  Everything is a critical error so they can fight unemployment when they downsize like they are now"
bad,They make it sound very good in training but once you get out on your own it's good luck figure out everything on your own. They don't care about customer service it's all about time and getting your customer off the phone in under 4 minutes. It's not a good company and they don't care when you have a family either.
bad,"Managers all slept with each other. The only way to the top is if you slept with someone. The manager was a woman and she would eye guys, sleep with her and you will get promoted. It was sickening. All managers played favoritism, if you weren’t brown nosing or in their cliche then you’re targeted and aimed to get fired until you do. I seen it happen to more than a dozen people. Then came the day when it was me. I felt it was coming, just didn’t know when."
bad,"Cultura e ambiente péssimo. Caso nao gostem de você, mesmo podendo te demitir, eles te seguram e fazem pressão para que você peça pra sair. Se você nao pedir para sair eles vão na sua vida fora da empresa para te pressionar mais, por pura crueldade."
bad,"My manager was unavailable at most times, choose favorites, made inappropriate decisions and non supportive in situations when a manager should step up and support their team efforts."
bad,"People who want to loose your happiness go and attend the interview."
bad,"chase will stress you OUT "
bad,"I took a chance on a lower-paying job at Chase. No internal mobility, no raises, and constant conflict with HR. Got laid off after six years with the same team."
bad,Terrible Management and realtors hate dealing with Chase. They are constantly having tech issues and the local management can no longer approve rate exceptions because they were playing favorites so it was taken away from them.
bad,This job sucks. You will never be promoted if you are a current employee. Management sucks and they can’t even manage anything. Worst job ever and the scheduling is super inconsistent nor do they care if you are in school or a parent. They expect you to come in even if you have no one to catch ur child or if your sick. Management will still ask you if you can make it. Worse job. Do not recommend. Worse 2+ years of my life. Pay is not even worth the stress. And pay is nothing. Only good benefits is 401k and vacation time.
bad,The pay was terrible. They only gave like 15 cent raises and that is nothing. They didnt have much advancement in the branch that I worked at. And if you did want legit advancement that would require you to go to college and get a degree.
bad,JP Morgan Chase lied about bonuses during hiring.  They use an outdated system to do your work on.  They only offer standard breaks like 2 15s and an hr lunch for a highly stressful job that is emotionally draining.  They base performance of collections against peers in an unfair competitive scorecard instead of just doing your job and constantly make changes making it difficult to be a consistently successful employee.  After working there almost 2 years new hires were making $1 more an hr than I was upon hire.  I can't say enough about how poorly employees were treated if they didn't do well every single month.  It was a turnover machine in my department and no one was safe no matter the tenure.  The most enjoyable job was some of the people there.
bad,"I worked at Chase for 8 years.  Great place to learn. Reported to managers with less experience than me.  Some managers were great, some not. Level of stress and unreasonable production goals made life tough.  No work life balance.  You could work a 12 hr day but you had to hide that you were working OT because they wouldn't allow it. We were taken from salaried and downgraded to hourly because they were sued and the employees won.  But it didn't matter because you were not allowed to work overtime.  If they allowed overtime, it was never to catch up, it was to do more production. Production goals could be met but definitely not within an 8 hr work day.  No time for lunch, breaks, bathroom breaks.  Under constant threats of layoffs. CEO great, but has no idea what was going on in a day to day work life of the average employee. Employees were tracked like being in prison. It could be a great place to work with some minor changes. Middle management cared more about production goals being met than the quality of work being done. You could win all of your appeals but if you were slightly off of your production goals, you were put on probation. Clearly winning appeals saved Chase millions, but middle management just didn't see it."
bad,This place makes you feel like not getting out of bed.  It is just a paycheck until you can find something that is better. If management dislikes you. Watch out you are automatically labelled. Heaven forbid you report something to hr that is not appropriate going on in your area.  You will be labelled a trouble maker and all eyes on you.  It will be more of a situation of how can we fire this person or make them find another job outside the firm just to get back at them for reporting them.  STAY AWAY!!
bad,"Worked as a ""Fraud Specialist"" which doesn't have anything to do with investigating or tracking credit card fraud trends as much as it's sitting on the phone for 8 hours a day getting berated by credit card holders because the credit card isn't working. "
bad,"No work/life balance, poor management, limited chance of advancement, very unstable work environment, promotions not based on skill/merit limited to no cost of living increases"
bad,"Positions are given to people that can be manipulated easiley by the dm"
bad,"High stress; impossible deadlines. One level up is uninformed, and distrustful of advice (very much like Trump.) A typical day at work includes request after request after request to ""do it now."" Extremely political environment; back-stabbing. Your management will not support you when push comes to shove."
bad,"I was a contract worker at Chase for along time. They kept promising full time employment at the end of our contracts. There were 17 of us on contracts. When mine was up, they renewed it several times. Most often with out a pay raise or time off. Once they stopped renewing them and again promised full time positions, they reneged and let go of 15 of the 17 contractors - all of which were promised full time employment"
bad,"Management is not interested in the advancement of employees careers. Very little support for employees in executing daily roles"
bad,"We all know that Banking is trending away from branches and towards online or mobile. "
bad,The organizational culture is such that is does not allow for employee contribution.  Management can be repressive. I worked for a another bank for 20 plus years.  I was unfortunately laid off.  JPM Chase makes me miss my prior employer that much more.
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of being chained to the desk and phone, strict schedules, zero family life balance. If you like to be paid less for more work, feeling like a slave, unrealistic quotas and expectations, cliquey incompetent managers, being yelled at by customers, feeling inadequate, poorly trained, micro managed, no job security.. this is the job/company for you."
bad,Big bank only concerned about the big bucks.  Worked in call center that was always threatened to be closed.   No job security or work life balance.  Finally closed out location.
bad,Training is excellent and the professional experience is great  It is an okay environment to work for but the pay could be better.  Need to know someone for advancement and have okay benefits.
bad,Installations of 100's of servers after 5pm everyday without the man power it takes to do the work because everyone has a bad attitude and constantly losing great workers because the money can't let anyone live independently on their own.
bad,"bureaucracy at its worst, too big to succeed, too many hurdles / levels of management, poor job culture, poor management, no opportunity for advancement,  managers use bullying tactics to try pushing employees to quit, do not recommend this company to anyone"
bad,It was a great place to work.Things always changing.The minute you speak up youre targeted.Management doesnt care and looks for ways to demoralize you
bad,"There was blatant favoritism, and forced overtime. When there was overtime, the management originally purchased dinner once a week to make up for the added stress. Then higher management said they did not want to allocate those funds in the budget, and quickly cut that. No morale. Quick turnover. No potential to progress higher, despite all the lies they pump out. Management was careless and spineless to protect their staff from senior management. The environment was completely stressful, where the better analysts were being pushed to carry the weight of the people who were not meeting their quotas. There were days where I was told to finish an additional pile of alerts before lunch, because another person was unable to do them over the past week. Absurd. Anyone who actually works, they milk you dry. The people who don't do anything and don't deserve any recognition or applause are the ones who move up. Steer clear of this place."
bad,"I would like to say that my experience with JPM was positive but that would be far from the truth. The company lacks structure, management skills and the micromanagement is over powering.  "
bad,"JPM is infamous for their poor management, lack of training, severe lack of job security (often times, people result in training their replacements without knowing) and their extreme cut throat environment. Everything is black and white, while the work is not. Do not recommend working here at all."
bad,"Very low pay, Extremely careless  management, And extremely backstabbing environment. no one cars for anything. Constant grilling from careless management."
bad,"Job too stressful for the pay provided.  Management doesn't know what they are doing because they are promoted without training and given complete power as they see fit.  ""Teams"" are treated at the discretion of the manager or relief manager."
bad,"Every second you are micro-managed and mistakes are not handled lightly. The industry is heavily regulated and everything is viewed as an expense. You are pitted against your peers in their ranking system and everything is counted against you. Employees are viewed as cogs in the machine, which are easily replaceable. "
bad,Lots of opportunities across multiple lines of businesses.  Wide variety of placements with exposure to many different parts of the business.  Working in an industry that is overly regulated.  Must be comfortable working with lots of rules and regulations.
bad,"Mornings usually started with meetings, and ended with meetings.  Not a lot of time given to actually do the daily work."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job if it was the last job on earth! I had such a bad experience with this company. I was there 3 years and my title was a teller but I was doing a job of a manger. I was switched around branch after branch. Was told it was for a definite promotion/raise each time but management failed to do their job and when I tried to take things into my own hands and apply for a position on my own and interview for it, politics played a hard role in my advancement which didn't happen. If you are willing to be a huge brown noser/butt kisser then this job is for you!"
bad,"If JP Morgan put the same level of effort to ensuring they have quality leaders as they do the marketing materials they create, then it would be an amazing place to work. Unfortunately, they live up to their reputation of poor leadership and management."
bad,"If I could rate no stars I would. Absolutely hated working there, no structure a lot of fake and phony workers. Low pay for job description, not worth the time at all. Chase is a complete joke and ripping their customers right out of their money."
bad,"The company is replacing and letting go of a lot of employees to replace them with computer technology.  They are making the company less customer service friendly, and putting a lot of stress on the remaining employees."
bad,"there is no way to move up in the company the culture is horrible they dont care about the customer they only care about how much money they are making. there is a lot of work discrimination, global security does a horrible job looking into elder abuse ( i had to push them to look into something for a client)"
bad,"A typical day at work, was stressful. Management is not helpful. They are not properly trained. They have no ethics. Their Code of Conduct leaves room for favoritism, discrimination, and isolations of employees."
bad,"High pressure sales. "
bad,"The department I was in was really good at hiring inept managers who kept  the attrition level quite high. The managers use all sorts of bullying tactics and threats to ""persuade"" you to work long hours without any additional pay; prevent you from utilizing your flexible work schedule; and dissuade you using your brain. In the end, you realize you are quickly losing your dignity and when you try to voice your concerns, the same inept managers who do not know much about HR policies, begin cultivating a hostile environment around you."
bad,"I was extremely  excited to secure a position with Chase, however, this was quickly snuffed out by the overall lack of leadership.  This particular division has no idea what a good leader looks like, they consistently loose the best associates because their lack of leadership, coaching, and overall caring, I cant imagine the costs associated with having to constantly replace people, if I were running that division I would replace the leadership, more cost effective to get the right leaders in.  A bad leader can break a call center, and that's exactly what is happening at the Tampa location.  Its very sad that a corporation like this allows the kind of apathy and discontent not to mention racism to existing within its walls.  I feel duped by recruiting and the hiring managers, this job is not worth the stress the environment puts you in."
bad,"Great place for customers to bank, however Chase adds titles to your already long title without paying you extra. There is little to no room for growth due to company eliminating positions."
bad,"entreprise à éviter : pression, harcèlement et mauvaise ambiance sont le lot quotidien des analystes."
bad,The only bank I was employed at and it was a great experience to be associated with this bank. I learned a lot about working in a financial industry. A typical day at chase would be making sure you meet deadlines all through the day. I learned about the stock market and how I is run. My co-workers always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job as the many deadlines throughout the day that had to be meet.
bad,"I was with the company for 10 Years and did not get the respect I deserved. Glad I left. "
bad,"Headcount reduction is an annual event and is always weighing on everyone's minds."
bad,"Chase literally ruined my life  My supervisor was a 50 yr old woman who acted like she was in high school and did nothing but create drama and talk about everyone behind their backs. I was hired on as a teller with the promise of moving up to a banker. Yea right. Once you get in a position,  you are stuck there. You are literally nothing to that company except a heartbeat and a social security number. And the pay you receive for all the rules and regulations you have to follow to the letter, is not worth it. You would be better off being a waitress than working at Chase Bank."
bad,"they dont care about you and its run by cyborgs, long hours, bad training, middle managers think they are gods gift, dont work here"
bad,I worked for the JPMorgan Cardmember services contact centre about 10 years ago in Canada. As it was an inbound call centre you can imagine that the experience was not fantastic. There was no room for growth.
bad,"If you are under 25 and looking for a low paying, high responsibility career with no autonomy, then Chase is your place. They stole WaMu during the bank crisis and treat their employees like mindless drones. Welcome to the 21st century banking giant"
bad,It's a temp job. A lot of hard work for not that great of pay. They let you go without any warning. A lot of rules like no pockets on your sweaters.
bad,"worst place ever. No compassion or care for there employees...its a numbers game."
bad,"Very secure company but the work is tedious ans monotonous. The breaks don't seem to be long enough for the amount of people that the company has working for them. Also, the staffing agency that I was hired through seems a bit disorganized."
bad,"They promise a lot of things to get you to take their job offer. ie. time off when you want, just take payments, plenty of opportunity for advancement etc.  The reality is FAR from the truth!   Hard to get time off even though they give you 3 weeks of vacation time good luck getting a day off unless it's a Tuesday or Wednesday,  yes you take A LOT of payments but you also take an equal amount of abuse from disgruntled customers about their bill, and for advancement LMFAO!   There were people who have worked there 6+ years without advancing. Current Managers in the Springfield, MO location try to get ride of anyone looking to advance in fear of losing their own  job.  There's more than this wrong with the company just hitting a few lowlights.   Don't believe their hype and look for another place of employment would be my advice.   ;)   or if you're good with being lied to and yelled at it might be the job for you.   ;)"
bad,"I was a banker for Chase, had to literally fight with the other bankers to get a customer that walked in... Very bad competition. Poor management that loves favoritism. I hated Chase from day one"
bad,"Hard working people. Interesting work. Very corporate atmosphere. If you are willing to work hard there are opportunities there. Overall, solid place to work."
bad,"take about 80 to 100 calls a day on past due auto loan accounts. make payment arrangements, take payments and answer consumer questions regarding there auto loans."
bad,"management not understanding of work/life balance,did not take concerns seriously,favourtism,what was told in private was not kept private.  Could not go and talk to anyone because supervisor had favorites,and always gave people hard way to go. No respect would embarrass in front of others.  Upper Management alllowed behavior and would not reprimand.  Its all about getting job done no matter the cost."
bad,I learned a lot about different softwares and customer service
bad,"Working at CHASE was irrefutably the worst work experience of my adult life.  I would compare a typical day to that of a hamster running on a wheel in a cage with no direction or destination..  I learned that more is more.  Individual clients were expendable, It was sad and awful."
bad,This place was the worst place to work for. The management made promises and would never follow through. The company would wait til the last minute to demand overtime or weekend work. We recieved all the broken processes to fix and when they we finished they moved the process to another location. As soon as our branch was finished with the work they closed the building and laid all of us off with no chance of relocation or remapping.
bad,"Average sales training."
bad,"The basis of this job was to offer customer service to the mortgage banking customers, and to act as an advocate, however the high case loads, and the under staffed teams, and mangers that weren't knowledgeable made it very difficult. The pushes for Out of Service Level and In Service Level erased any and all opportunities for quality work. The work environment was what you made it, it was hard to forge relationships because of the office politics, and the lack of partnership aspect across the various departments. The management focused more on their own development versus making sure that the team was knowledgable- there were no legit formal trainings provided for the job, it was a he/said-she said type of environment which caused inconsistency with research and case information that inevitable caused re-contacts by the OCC-CFPB-ATTORNEY GENERAL-CONGRESSMAN, and the borrowers and their attorneys."
bad,Poor management and job security unsatisfactory; a typical day is filled with pressure and stress for maximum production (even when there isn't enough production to go around); constant training for changed guidelines containing contradictory information for the actual work performed; co-workers always in a bad mood as they are always stressed to the max (pushed even when not busy!); emails sent by managers (pushed by Center and Site Managers)criticizing employees for production goals not met (often physically unable to be met)
bad,"Not recommended, unless you have no idea what you are doing. I only ended up here after a forced lay off at my previous employer."
bad,"I don't even know where to begin ranting about the Chase Wholesale Lockbox.   The job creates an environment where people hate one another, sabotage one another for favoritism status, wish ill upon their bosses and even cry during lunches and breaks, it is simply disgusting.  The process and quality and productivity expectations change so rapidly that it is impossible to settle into your job.  The quality and productivity expectations are unrealistic based upon how random the work is day-to-day, so unrealistic that it is impossible to advance your salary (this is probably on purpose so the bank can make more money).  Favoritism is absolutely out of control, from certain shifts getting all the easiest work to one screw-up employee getting fired, to another screw-up employee getting a new function.  The team-leads also would take easy work from one person and hand it off to someone else who was closer to them, screwing up productivity for anyone who got stuck with the hard stuff.  Work was not distributed in a fair manner even though all openers had the same expectations.  Only openers can receive errors, mail-sorters, who typically make all the mistakes, are exempt.  The over-time is also out of control.  Working third shift and 10-14 hours a day, 5 days a week, it is impossible to have a social-life while working this job.  Work-life balance simply does not exist and over-time pay is quite poor due to a lousy starting wage.  The company seemed to have a habit of raising expectations right before bonus payouts and salary increases as if to keep the wages low.  Any errors you"
bad,"Dont let them fool you when they tell you how the job is fun and not high pressure. It is very high pressure! Its all about quotas and numbers. And you will be lucky if the branch that you get hired in has only three managers to breath down your neck all day. Most branches have more then three. Kinda weird because the branch I worked in only has 12 employees! I could go on and on about things but I wont rant but please trust me when I say that this company will change your entire life. It stopped me from being able to go out with friends. It stopped me from going to the gym. I gained weight and started smoking again, after three years of not. It slowly affects your home life cuz it is STRESSFUL! And after all this I was terminated one day with no reason given. It felt so nice!"
bad,assist customer with balances
bad,"It's not a happy place to work.... it's very hectic,long days"
bad,And you thought Foxconn was bad. Don't work for Chase. You're worth more than they treat you. No room for advancement. Sixty plus hours with no overtime pay (this is the norm). They have no culture what so ever.....my restroom has more culture than Chase.
bad,"Management would require employees to certain daily assignments, no understanding we would not be able to service the clients with them requesting redundant daily job duties and reports."
bad,"The co-workers are excellent people with awesome personalities. The hardest part of the job is standing on your feet for hours on end, and the unprofessional behavior of the management team."
bad,"All aspects of the job are micro-managed by the most inept group of people on the face of the Earth. Long hours, you are held accountable for the work of others, pay raises are not based on performance or merit but rather given to lowest paid individuals on the team to balance out payscale or to those that brown-nose and serve as management's eyes. It's almost impossible to get out of the department unless you are willing to brown-nose your way out. Management has successfully converted a compliance review team into a customer service based call center group. Management likes to remind everyone on how they are replacable."
bad,"they hire to fire, rather hire kids off the street with no experience than retain employees that know their job."
bad,"Do not work in home lending. This area is at the bottom of the barrel. More and more jobs are being outsourced. Management wants you to believe in ""customer obsession"" but this is a sham. The technology is outdated and unreliable. The pay is subpar. Management would rather work with morons than intelligent employees that challenge the status quo."
bad,"Will never work for the company again, all they care is for the company to make their profit regardless who they have to move out of the way... there’s no respect when there’s emojis with cancer and all they will do instead of being supportive is to get rid of them so that their profits continue... JP Morgan is the worst place to ever work for."
bad,I worked there as a mortgage underwriter for 20 years and left because the stress was going to kill me. Goals are not realistic. They rule by fear.  Tons of clicks and gossip.  The right does not know what the left is doing as far as management goes. Zero work/home balance.  Impossible to get time off for doctor appointments.  Many layoffs.  If you get an error they treat you horrible.
bad,"They do not care about their employees or their families. They change your schedule that you were hired to work without a care in the world. Then announce they are giving the jobs away overseas with less than 2 months notice. They don’t want to pay severance packages so they are forcing workers to work in areas no one wants to work in if they want a job. If you don’t like it, quit with no money"
bad,"Worst job I have every had. I was a Teller for chase here in Flint, MI. I hated everything about it. The company didn't make me feel valued at all. Working there 2 years and the distract manager spoke to me once although she visited the branch very frequently. Management was horrible and very little room for learning or mistakes."
bad,"Able to perform multiple duties in business analysis, project or program management, and functional leadership. A wonderful team player who can relate and work efficiently with diverse groups"
bad,"Record earnings yet they are slashing bonuses, ending pensions and cutting jobs. Two rounds of cutting jobs this year alone. Little to no advancement. Benefits are ok."
bad,"Low pay"
bad,"They pay a pretty good salary for what I do, and i like my coworkers,  but you have to put up with very stupid decisions like them hiring managers who have no work experience, fresh out of college who completely ruin your whole team, because of ""diversity"". Then most of the senior people get riffed cause some higher up decided contractors could do the job better than people who have done it for 20+ years so they can show their superiors they saved money so they can get a big raise. They just told one contractor I know to do the job of 3 people for less than half what a full time gets. Just would like to be a fly on the wall when it all comes crashing down on their heads. Anyway I would not recommend working here, and if you do don't get comfortable."
bad,"Pros: Downtown location, near transporation, benefits, and incentive pay for top performers "
bad,"I worked for Chase while attending college, as I needed steady hours and benefits. Those were probably the only pros to working here. Extremely stressful environment and no support from management. There'd be times where we'd get very nasty customers (yelling, cursing) and the managers would take them into their office and treat them like royalty. Zero support for employees. I often left work in tears. "
bad,"The most soul less place I have ever worked.  "
bad,"If you're looking for a career here, don't bother wasting your time. Management is petty and unprofessional, and they have very little respect for the employees...unless they're kissing up to them. You'll be trained to perform a specific task, but the majority of your time will be spent doing something entirely different. How the daytime Manager got her position is totally beyond me."
bad,Pay was good but managers had favorites and if you’re not a favorite then forget advancing in your career. I tried for almost two years to move up and didn’t get anywhere. Asked for advice on what I needed to improve on or do to advance with the company and kept getting the run around. I spoke with three different team leads and asked to meet with the division leader and got nothing.
bad,"Worked for Chase as a Branch Manager for years and even after leading my branch to the top spot in our district, I was continually and verbally abused by my District Manager and he found any excuse to reducing or even giving me the bonus I had earned. I had evidence and paperwork that my DM was in violation of not only HR guidelines, but national labor laws as well. This all occurred during the recession so finding a new job became very difficult. Had Chase and their leadership truly cared about doing the right thing, they would have actually taken action against this DM instead of continually making excuses for him and trying to heal our already broken relationship. I really enjoyed working with my fellow associates and customers at my branch, but it was really disappointing to deal with an abusive supervisor for such a long time with the company doing absolutely nothing."
bad,The manager should be managed better. Chase allows it managers to do whatever they want too. I had one of the worst managers and Vice President within the organization.
bad,"Manager bragged about how many people he fired.  If he didn’t like you, you would be fired.  "
bad,Worst place and management in the world.....you have to be in with your manager to get ahead.  I wished I never worked for this company.  So glad it is over with.  When it is the management survey time....the treat you better.....but when it is over...it goes back....I think they should look more into what they are doing.....they need to he audited.     I have proof
bad,"Chase is completely obsessed with numbers, that is all you will be to them. While I was here I saw 4 separate employees get fired because their talk time was 30-60 seconds higher than they would like. All of those employees had been there 3-5 years. "
bad,"No matter how well you perform - you’re only as good as your last survey, always a fear of losing your job"
bad,I worked at chase for about 8 years going from a teller to banker to private client even getting into management. It is a company an organization that only cares about the number it wont hesitate to fire employees with or without cause. Its all about who you know and how much they have your back I finally decided to leave after seeing co worker after co worker fired for bad or no reasons. terrible hours and you were treated horribly. In addition the way they treat their customers was a joke.
bad,Decent salary for what you do but it’s so boring. Support teams don’t care to help you. The company doesn’t work together. It’s a constant back and forth to get stuff done. People get promoted that don’t deserve it just because they’ve been there for a long time.
bad,"This call center is poorly managed. It's very insulting to work there for a year and a half and then have new hires given manager positions without even given the opportunity to apply. "
bad,the company is top heavy in management.  The company should do more to truly avail itself of what it preaches around diversity.  There are many check the box activities but it is not truly promoted.
bad,"The only way I would ever reccomend this job to anyone, is if I really really dont like you. The pay sucked and they expected you to go above and beyond without fair compensation. I could go on but time/space doesnt allow"
bad,"Do not ever think about slaving at this corrupt organization. Management walks around like their sh** don't stink. You do all the work while they go around receiving the perks and praises. I was always stressed out, sickly and depressed."
bad,"Chase knows you are replaceable and you are treated as such.  Typical day at work involves being on the phone, while pushing product to every person that walks through the door.  Management are usually beaten down by the system and are only those who have drank the company Kool Aid.  Employees are constantly told about the record profits but incentive plans are cut regularly and base salary raises almost never occur for the banker position."
bad,"the job is very competitive, techs try to outdo eac hother, the job was easy but as soon as things looked good, the entire team was laid off and the jobs sent out of the country. ."
bad,"Once the 6-8 week training is over and you hit the floor. The managers as well as some job coaches forget about you, forget about being curteous & kind to you. There is a lot of favoritism. Pretty light skin girls get promoted faster!"
bad,"Overtime was cut and hours were cut. Also, yearly bonuses were cut, only management get the bonuses. Inconsistent scheduling, making work life balance hard. Offer tuition assistance for 30hrs or over but they don’t hire/give out those hours anymore only 20hr. Management is terrible, inconsitencies in how policies are followed makes it hard for employees and customers. Sometimes they would not give you lunches/breaks even when working over 6 hours. There is a lot of favoritism, they don’t care if you work hard."
bad,"Management was not supportive of the work force. Priorities were always changing, departments were usually run by unreasonable managers who were more interested in keep hold of their turf than what was best for the firm. Annual reviews were based on a mandatory ranking of all employees with similar titles top to bottom and laying off the bottom 10%. After a couple of years of this you start to lay off good people. December the CEO would state how great of a year was to the shareholders and in January state to the employees that the previous year was poor and could not give out bonuses. Raises were stingy and not consistent. Once had a managing director tell his team they are privileged to work for Chase. Employees are not valued. The firm talks one way but acks another way. They do not walk the talk. I do not recommend working there as their culture is toxic."
bad,"If you like being overworked and given no opportunity for advancement, then this is the place for you. Problems with operations are never dealt with and I have worked in multiple departments and was overworked in each one of them. Applied for job after job only for them to hire someone with less experience or they would hire from outside with no experience in the job."
bad,"This company only thinks about their name, and customers. Great place to bank but not to work. The company doesn't care about their employees. Incentive plan is good, if you can meet your goals. Speaking of goals, UNREALISTIC!!! Savings accounts opened with balances you get paid on, but if the client closes the account within 6 months you have to pay all that back to Chase, even though you truly did not get compensated the full value after taxes. Say goodbye to your personal life, you get one Saturday off a month, you will most likely work a closing scheduling everyday of the week, salary is a joke (lowest in the industry) and say hello to carrying a bug burden of customer complaints and responsibilities. Chase cares a great deal about their customers, but no the employees. The front-line employees make this company profitable, give the company their high standard name and are the ones who have to deal with everything."
bad,Words could never describe how shifty this company is.  The company brainwashed the employees. I believed what I was told despite the news. It was all true
bad,"Could not go use the restroom because I was threatened about corrective action including termination.  We were always threatened with termination if we took even 1min extra for lunch, if the calls were over 4 mins, start time was 8am but had to be there 15 (unpaid) mins early to set up the systems, we had no freedoms to go get water and there was only one bathroom for the entire floor."
bad,"joined the company cz of the brand name but very disappointed cz of the management. Managers very interested in hooking people up with other employees , very BIAS, unprofessional and interested in personal life. Very diappointed!"
bad,Poor management and lack of utilizing skill set. Poor work/life balance with emphasis on competing against fellow employees by management. I do not recommend this company.
bad,"My department was horrible."
bad,"No Paid for on-call and employee have to carry his/her personal cell phone to support. Sometime need 18 hours working per day."
bad,"I worked at Chase Bank for over 18 years.  I am sorry that I wasted so much of my time, energy and career trying to make a bad situation better.  The final straw was when the Market Manager flat out lied to an employee about their career.  There are so many examples that I could give about how management does things that only benefit themselves, to the detriment of the employees."
bad,Second class citizen at best - if you are a contractor you are less than human I would not work there if you paid me twice the amount I was getting before.  You have no future and you are giving the tools to succeed
bad,"Poor management. No support from team leaders. Not being able to give their customers the support they needed. No flex time, sick time was allowed however it was considered an occurence, which reflected in your job performance review. Restroom breaks were to be taken only on your lunch and breaks."
bad,"Politics galore, steer clear. Brand helps your resume. Must have a godfather to thrive/survive or else. I am sure there are worse places but this is one of the worst for sure"
bad,"Stressful, Harrassing and when reported to upper management and hr they act like it's your fault and allow others to Harrass and stalk others.  Management is incapable of directing others and extremely unethical."
bad,Work here is good if you can type fast and very well. Management is horrible though. Poor wages for the amount of work and frustrating and poor leadership in Data Entry.
bad,"I would probably try your chances else where. Typical day is sitting at computer typing all day long.  Nothing requires you to leave your desk besides going to the bathroom.  Big brother is everywhere.... your production is tracked, your errors are tracked, the amount of time your not typing is tracked.  Hours change every few weeks.... worked on holidays."
bad,"I have worked with the most incompetent managers. They point the finger at their employees when something goes wrong, even though your following their orders. I've been with the company many years and have had only 2 managers who were fair. Management will only promote their favorite people. Hard working employees don't get recognized. Forget about requesting holidays off and as a banking institution they have also taken away holidays most banks observe. There is no balance between work and home life. If you are a teller you are expected to work 4 times as hard than anyone else. There are 2 operating windows with a line that never ends."
bad,"This was the Latin American Section"
bad,"This place is a sweatshop.  They care little to nothing for their employees and are the epitome of ""company over people"" in terms of their philosophy.  Their management is equally as scared of losing their jobs so they ""crack the whip"" even harder on those underneath them and push people to the breaking point.  Each day was an exercise in biting ones tongue."
bad,It made me feel like i was doing nothing in life working in the collection department at chase. Management did not try hard to better positive productivity in the department.
bad,"Vollkatastrophe für den gesunden Menschen(verstand), unzufriedene Mitarbeiter durch die komplette Abteilung, absoluter Mangel an Verantwortung, Kompetenz und Menschlichkeit im Management. Einschüchterung und Rufschädigung die einzigen Mechanismen um davon abzulenken dass das Management für feindliche Stimmung sorgt um die Mitarbeiter besser kontrollieren zu können. Wer nicht mit macht und sich auf die Seite der Mobbingopfer stellt wird mundtot gemacht und bis dahin systematisch rufgeschädigt. Zusammenfassend: Menschen im Management ohne Anstand und Selbstbewusstsein, daher Befriedigung der eigenen Machtgeilheit durch willkürliche Schikane der unterstellten - Betriebsrat hilfsbereit aber nahezu machtlos. Man muss nur dem Geld nachgehen..."
bad,Chase is a large company and sometimes through no fault of their own can sometimes not remember there employees had help in them reaching their goal.
bad,"You are just a number and your clients are ""revenue units"" . High management turnover. Big dumb company. Low quality. They  Push their over priced, Poor performing, proprietary investments. Hostile atmosphere. Hard to be an objective advisor. Of course they say the client is first. Only if you squeeze every cent out of them."
bad,"will not recommend anyone to work for them, even if its a temporary or contract role. "
bad,"I had worked at JPMorgan Chase for four years.  Was making six-figure income.  However, the work culture there was inhuman. Management only cares about performance.  There are hiding rules played by the management.  They call ""manage you out"" if someone is unfavorable.  So the company doesn't even have to pay anything to layout employees."
bad,"Take in coming calls , Customer Service issues and support.Hardest part of the job is dealing with unorganized management and Training."
bad,Retail Branches are subject to excessive turnover. Company has no strategy on stabilizing the flow of workers. Excessive training regulation keep on reducing the productivity of workers
bad,Company does massive onboarding & offboarding. Internal mobility touted but never materializes. Highly bureaucratic & not as client-focused as other large banks.
bad,"CEO is great, minor management is terrible, lots of bullying."
bad,"I begin by going over the list from the previous week, setting priorities. I review the progress of existing projects., check progress, and then prepare for the week. I want to make sure, as much as possible, that I can all dedicate to tasks that move projects forward."
bad,I would not work for this company again as management is out of touch with reality when it comes to expectations. Pay / benefits aren't that bad but it's nearly impossible to get a raise of any merit.  Turnover is the highest I've ever seen.
bad,"No work life balance."
bad,"Excellent company to work for."
bad,"Long hard hours, pushy managers always hoovering over you. If you miss your scheduled break you cannot take another unless you want to mess your numbers up. Very messy workplace. Only good thing  are the benefits like health insurance and pto, other than that it's horrible."
bad,"•	Provide financial counseling to homeowner's in danger of being foreclosed upon"
bad,"While the pay is okay, the corporate culture sucks. The management staff is incompetent and mediocre. Computer systems are slow and outdated and training is poor."
bad,"Great people at the branch, but middle management offers no guidelines and no expectations.  Regional manager overseeing branches has no clue about actual work environment."
bad,I would not encourage anyone with a desire to further their career to work here.  The work/life balance is terrible; management expects 24/7 availability.  Management is completely disengaged from the reality of daily operations.  There is a significant management restructuring at least once a month.  HR grossly misrepresents job descriptions.
bad,trainers are awful and you are basically thrown into job not fully prepared.  management is awful and never around can never get help from directors.
bad,"3-4 months of hiring process just to give impression that job here is worth it due to brand name."
bad,"I worked at Chase for 15 mos. as a project manager.  I worked with some talented and bright people however only q few of them were in management. Chase, at least the department I was in, was into how the project and it's progress was packaged and reported to upper management rather than execution.  Chase expects you to be available 24/7. And every day is a fire drill because the lack of leadership from management as well as their short-sightedness.  Chase is understaffed and overworked which is a combination for high turnover and job dissatisfaction.  The culture is very unprofessional and there is no such thing as positive feedback.  The hardest part of the day was being there because you never knew what management would hit you with from one day to the next.  The best part of the day was leaving. If you like high stress, insecurity and chaos, Chase is the place for you."
bad,"The business cares about the business not the employees"
bad,Management doesn't take the time to get to know you. You are there to work and that is all. No training if there are any issues they discard you like trash.
bad,There are so many changes that management is implementing to make a Compliance position into Operations.  Production is what you hear all day long.  Integrity and quality are lacking.
bad,"This was a sales job that the company wanted to disguise as customer service. I found that often after a client had been sold a creatively financed mortgage that the manager did not like for me to sit with individuals to help them navigate through problems such as a double pulled mortgage out of their account. Also employees practiced unethical behavior such as signing up a 90 year old lady for multiple credit cards with out her knowledge, to make ""pvc's or credits toward commission. The unethical employees would most often receive promotion. In my 2 years at my designated branch I went through 3 managers all of which were demeaning and disrespectful. Often putting those who did not sell enough banking product on the spot in ""morning huddles"", or group meetings. This type of management is very discouraging and I have no desire to work for this company any more. The hardest part of the job was constantly getting lectured by my manager to sell more. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with some of them were ethical people. I learned that some jobs you hold on to just to pay your bills, I also learned how banks operate primarily on the sales of financial products."
bad,My supervisor worked so much overtime -- UNPAID -- that I realized I would never want to advance to that level.  So why stick around any longer?
bad,Traveled to 12 different branches to establish or extent business relationships and sell or cross sell business products or services.
bad,Decent company to work for. There is a lot that can be done to improve the work experience.
bad,"Stable company/demand controlled industry. Incredibly busy, fast paced work days."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked at, forced to work overtime, management treated employees like children"
bad,Management terrible. No work/life balance. Decent bonuses.
bad,Do not get guidance from managers to move you out into other areas of the company. Management never has the answers to important questions. There is not much that is enjoyable at the job other the coworkers.
bad,"Horrible place to work, hostile environment, processing dept did not do their job and were not made to do their jobs.  There was a rating system and when there was a layoff, the best processors would be laid off and the slackers some how kept their jobs.    My bonus was based on the customers reviews of the total loan process and 10 times out of 10 times, the customers would complain about the inefficient processing and the attitudes of the Loan Processors.  I would have to fight daily for my customers and was told that ""we have plenty of other customers"" when there was an issue.   the Managers treated you by how fun you were when they went out to the bars after work, Managers slept with LO's, processors etc.   It was a constant fight to get a customers loans closed in a timely manner and t was extremely rare to have a file close easily with no errors.   If you had a large amount of money in their bank, you were treated much better than other customers.  Many of us cried daily due to the horrible frustration of working there"
bad,"You do the same thing everyday. Button pressing and no one cares to advance, no one is ambitious, and the pay is way below the industry average"
bad,"What a zoo!"
bad,There were no opportunities to move into a position the best suited my expertise.
bad,I worked daily on processing home loan accounts. I learned a lot of the years about home lending and laws. the managers were very fair and reasonable to work for. We all worked as to team to complete dead lines.the hardest part was shortage in wok flow it was disappointing to know we were about to loss our jobs. The most enjoyable part was going to work everyday and the people that worked there also.
bad,It is a typical corporate job. Management often makes decisions without any real consideration for employees. Employees are often left out to the loop on important policy changes. They definitely don't live the core valued that they want the employees to adhere to. Promotions are not done fairly and employees don’t feel valued for their contributions.
bad,"Slow systems, system failures, old computers with problems, management showing blatant favoritism to specific individuals.  Too many software problems."
bad,"I would not work for this employer again. There is no room for understanding of a life outside of this company. The pay was decent and the office environment looked professional, but the staff wasn't nor were the people very friendly unless you were apart of their team."
bad,Lots of great people. Management lacks the ability to manage.
bad,I was not a very good fit for the manager at this company - they do not value the associates they have and diversity is definitely not a value!!!!!
bad,Productivity is viewed as most important by management. Tasks are added to the job which hurt your productivity and you're required to keep up.
bad,Answered calls first for home equity loans. Try to explain that the equity loans wasn't something that a person is entitled to and it must be pay back. When that department closed went to mortgages were you had take payments and explain why mortgages usually goes up each year.
bad,"The place is crazy. It's constantly in flux. It is not a place to stay. Most people seem to leave within the year. They layoff and your success all depends on your manager. They have a lot of immature, relatively young managers. You have to give 24hr notice before you call in sick or they give you an occurrence. They do not care about people. It's also sort of trashy. There was a fist fight between two women in the stairwell. They call it the work ghetto. Also, for such a big company, they have terrible programs, which in my opinion, hinder quality. I think their programs are an embarrassment."
bad,"Pay is pretty good but they strip you of being a human there you feel like a slave instead of a valued employee their punctuality rules are rediculous . ,management treats people like robots no social relations built.Never would work for this company ever again"
bad,"They change your job function from day to day. You never know if you will have a job when you walk into work each day. They work you until you have become burned out and large amount of staff is either out on sick leave because they want you to work around the clock and not have any time with your family. You are placed under a lot of stress and if staff isn't out sick already, 90% of staff are seeking employment else where."
bad,"The work was production based and while the manager for the contract employees was great it was obvious Chase employees resented our presence. The atmosphere of the Chase employees and managers was one of fear and were so busy trying to justify their employment that little to nothing go done. Lots of power struggles were going on and upper management seemed busy making a mark regardless of the effect on productivity and effectiveness. As a group the contract accountants constantly wondered how the full time folk kept their job. It must have been an atmosphere of ""just get it done"" that would produce postings to loans in the manner that presented A constant changing of procedures hampered production and astonishingly absolutely no procedures for loan analysis were in place until written by a former contract employee in 2011!! This being my first position within a banking institution I was appalled at the lack of accuracy and attention to people's mortgages."
bad,Employees are micromanaged so much that they are in fear for their jobs on a daily basis. This is not only at the branch level but at the Senior Management level as well.
bad,"In a normal day the seems that the training that you receive is not adequate, and generally you have to learn on the run"
bad,"Processing mortgage loans for Chase is difficult. You are expected to manage 40 loan pipelines while you use a horrible computer application called CLOSR that you have to close out each loan at least 2-3 times because they all freeze. You maintain at least 4 different pipelines. The micromanaging is through the roof! You are demeaned and scolded as if you were a bad child for every little thing. You are expected to be accountable for other people's work besides your own. If you are not friends with your manager you may be spied on and have lies spread about you. Some are constantly absent with no repercussions, yet others are written up. Mandatory O.T. for most, except Managers for the most leave on time. The Health Insurance is horrible. The worst company and atmosphere I have ever encountered."
bad,"The culture is a sweatshop. In fact (it is called the American sweatshop. They do not care about the employees, your just a number. It is all about numbers not people. Employment is a revolving door. I talk to many people in different departments and 8 out of 10 say negative things about this bank. Worked for other banks, this one is the worst. Beware!!"
bad,"I worked at JP Morgan for nearly three years and can only recommend that people refrain from applying to this company. "
bad,"Company acts like it cares about its employees. It doesnt. Benefits dept is run like a joke. Mgt are all overhyped. If it's your job to tell me how to do mine, you should know how to the job. They lay people off constantly.  Then treat them like garbage. Dont ever go out on disability, or have an opinion of any kind. You will be one of the first to go. Supervisors are backstabbing, and full of it.  Especially in correspondent funding."
bad,My manager was absolutely horrible and so was hers. I probably would’ve stayed had the environment been better. Position is definitely dependent on who you work for. Sad shame prejudice is alive and well!
bad,"This company is not for those looking for advancement or those of us who desire a welcoming and healthy working environment. I experienced a great deal of hostility and the management at my location had no experience in hospitality, leadership, discern for others or personal and employee growth and satisfaction. I knew immediately upon arrival things were not stable in this location, however I stayed to introduce change and a different direction in leadership. I am deeply disappointed in the company as a whole due to its lack of respect for professional and care for other’s well being."
bad,"when you manager is bad, your life is bad.  The sad thing is the majority of them are bad.  When you are lucky enough to find a good one there is a reorg or some change that happens."
bad,"Stressful,  Corporate Bureaucracy/politics more than actual work."
bad,"As the title mentions. The environment was one that saw little room for advancement. This caused me to make multiple lateral changes before I could even have the chance to move up. Management with my last position was poor. We’d always be expected to take the blame because my boss avoided confrontation. One time speaking my mind resulted in my boss not speaking to me for my final 2 months. When I finally left to pursue teaching my manager did not say goodbye or really interact with me at all. I was told I didn’t have to come back in for my final couple days so I took advantage of that. However when I came to say good bye to my coworkers (since they didn’t give me a chance on the last day I was there) they barred me from entering the office, even though I was still an employee and was told I’d still be able to come get my stuff. They had someone bring out my final items there."
bad,Employees are always being lied to by management. Management tends to strong arm employees and keep them in fear of loosing their jobs. The bulling tactics and favoritism needs to stop at Chase. They do not help with growth. HR knows and gets complaints from employees and they use fear tactics to keep employees quite.
bad,Chase is a typical corporate giant that does not always remember the workers are important too. It is not advancement friendly. The benefits are good. I wouldn’t recommend Chase . The pay is lower than what you would expect.
bad,Chase has managed that kissed so much butt to get promoted without management skill that it makes working for chase unbearable. If a manager feels u know more than them they will beat u down so much to discourage you from excelling as it will make them look bad. If u kissed enough butt and got on managements good side you will stay right there doing the managers work while they take all the credit.  It's a loose loose situation with chase in mortgage banking
bad,"The entire interview process was very unprofessional, left a bad impression. Would I recommend people to work here? No. Should people bank there? Maybe."
bad,"I worked here for almost 3 years I’ve never been written up or given any warnings about the way I worked. I was the best at what I do as an associate banker also known as a teller, I was number one on customer service and Referrals, I made a simple mistake on my drawer while balancing and it was corrected the wrong way by doing a surprise audit instead of calling teller services to correct the issue the right way,  everyone knows that if you get a surprise audit and don’t balance you will be fired and this is exactly what happen management does not have your back if they don’t like you you will get fired sooner or later ."
bad,"Call center rep, couldn't believe I lasted almost 2 years before I was fired. I had only 3 complaint calls in almost 2 years and got fired. 1 complaint was from a man who actually threatened to find me at my office, and Chase did NOTHING about it, I got fired. Super competitive, more stress than I had when my father died from cancer. Always told by supervisor that my calls needed work/bad/terrible/bad tone, etc.....I almost didn't survive this job that's how stressful it was, so much so they actually have a onsite doctor and nurse, people were taken out by stretcher 2-3 x per week due to stress/heartaches/anxiety, etc......they should be ashamed of themselves to conduct such a business that actually has killed employees/gone out on FMLA/had to go on meds to survive. I speak the truth since I am a very practicing Christian/oh and I wasn't allowed to go to church/unless I used MY timeoff to do so."
bad,"The overall training was poor. The expectations or goals were unreasonable, and recommendations for improvement we're overlooked. Managers were not open to listening to employee complaints."
bad,by far the worst company I have worked for. stay away for your own good. I really dont want to talk about how bad it is. just stay away from there both as a customer and employee.
bad,"I was informed my job would be eliminated. After 20 years, I'm ok with a years severance. Others with less seniority were offered other jobs in company they weren't familiar with and no money. They change systems all the time. They demand performance standards that are unreasonable. Supervisors are two faced. Divisions are constantly jumbled and/or elimated. Don't bother."
bad,"Chase made cuts and chose us. Chase got rid of the highest paid (transferred from a department chase closed) and people who came back from fmla, the day they came back from the medical leave and even maternity. The training class to replace us at much lower pay was in the building across from us."
bad,"After about a year of working for Chase Auto, they hired on a transition director who basically changed everything to online. A lot of long time loyal employees were let go. They also blocked many of those employees from being hired in other positions within Chase to avoid having to rehire new employees to have to later let go, so those employees had to seek employment elsewhere when we were told the department would be closed by the end of the year.  Chase was the worst company and bank I've ever worked for."
bad,The training should have been much more extensive based on the work we were told to do and therefore made the role very difficult to please management.
bad,I made it almost two years as a call center for Chase Sapphire credit card division in Heathrow. My last manager thought he knew it all and had the biggest ego. I made it almost two years before I got fired because I wasn't making the web stats. All your calls are listened to. They usually only go over the negatives on all of your calls. The stress here was so bad I had to see a psychologist. People were actually being taken out on stretchers and they have a full-time doctor and nurse on staff so that tells you something right there. It was absolutely horrifying working here. The stress is literally unbearable. My friend next to me had two strokes while working here because of the stress. I would not recommend this job under anyting. Unless you can take stress and you know that for a fact then it's good to work here because of the salary
bad,"Always reorganize, never in a position longer than 1 yr"
bad,"Long hours, tough culture.  Would have hoped for a more collaborative environment and better work life balance.  Very large organization and you need to be able to navigate the many channels."
bad,"starting off they are very structured long and very detailed training. everyone seems happy and enthusiastic in training.once you're in it you see the leadership doesn't care not professional at all the staff is the same. there are favoritism to the max. unfair pay you are only able to move up if you're part of the in crowd. unrealistic goals they were aware of system manipulation to skew the numbers to become harder to obtain and those who ""cheated"" got commission and the lower end reps that were given unreal numbers to compete with were reprimanded. you are treated like a replaceable child. pay is terrible and increases are almost none existent. its a high paced call center. they do have free food randomly in hopes that a slice of pizza and a candy bar will solve it all. i would never recommend this company as a call center to work at the branch is much better. i was told that there are 100 ppl lined up at the door waiting for my job...needless to say i left its a cesspool of inappropriate workplace relations and the stench of depression."
bad,"The most engineered by management organization I have encountered. If a direction is set, it must be applied, even if it is not the appropriate solution. For example, I dealt with a 3rd party app. It had an API for extracting data that was written in .net. Management had issued an edict that everything must be coded in Java. So I had one of the coders on my team write an app to extract data in Java. However since the API was in .net he needed something from .net to establish the hook to make it all work. When he approached management for an approval to get the MS tools, it was denied. Fortunately, we were able to get what we needed from an internal repository. We never told management anything other than it is now working and deployed. If we had, we would have been dinged heavily at appraisal time."
bad,Upper management will ask you to fire someone they don't like and if you don't you end up fired.  They choose favorites based on how much you kiss up to them and do as they tell you regardless if it is ethical or not.  Old Washington Mutual management are the worst.
bad,More jobs are exported to India. Management is very cost conscience (to the detriment of the business and employees). Career planning and opportunities are scarce.
bad,Worked pretty much open to close every day. Had a manager that would never back me up. Ended up leaving Chase. Not a good atmosphere to work in. Way to many expectations. Unattainable goals.
bad,It is not easy to rate this company as I always felt as if I was a number and not a person and that anyone could be replaced at any given time. The company appeared to be very much the type of company that if the person applying for a mortgage loan did not fit into a box that the loan could not be done.
bad,"work is very stressful, no help with fraud cases, or not enough help.  they have employees managing or doing managers job.  Management is not great, over worked, under pay"
bad,"Incompetent, uncaring, unhelpful management, unrealistic work goals. Very inflexible with work hours. Employees not given credit for accounts collected on."
bad,Management do you know where staff was half the time. They had people walking around and playing with nerf guns. A lot of things in this department move super slow and I can see why people  complain that their loans are close on time.
bad,Worst experience of my working career. I would never advise anyone to work for this very cold and non caring company.  There is no support for new hires that are left to figure out there duties as they go to work each day.
bad,Manager has autonomy. Employees concerns are not taken into consideration. No work-life balance. Manager could be really biased and yet no action would be taken.
bad,They act like they care about you but you are literally an employee number to them. There’s a reason they are always hiring!! The trainers were the best part. When you get out to the floor your fellow teammates treat you like you have the plague or something. Everything you do your manager basically tells you you’re not good enough...so they don’t have to give you a raise at the end of the year!
bad,"Hypocritical management: promised much; delivered little. Little to no opportunity to advance beyond a certain level. No incentives to remain. Company says it is ""customer obsessed"" but in reality is ""profit obsessed"" with little to no regard to its customers below a certain income level."
bad,"They will have you working over time like crazy and not place it on your time card for the day. They will add it to the next day, and have you come in later. If you were not feeling well, they wouldn't care and still make you come in to work or not let you go home."
bad,"Not a good place to work.  My team was spectacular but not given the credit deserved.  Expectation of service was A+, but acknowledgment for superb service was not given."
bad,"I've worked at JPMC for five years. I work at home to accommodate a disability. But since I work from home, I'm not eligible for promotion and have not received a pay increase for the past three years, in spite of the organization's insistence that they are great with inclusion. Pay is very poor compared to most other companies. Benefits are weak. Senior management cares only about bottom line. The company has become much less generous, even with the massive tax cut they were just handed by Congress. Stay away from this greedy corporation."
bad,"Managment don't care! Worst ever. Changed careers because of this place. Don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pay is good, but you're just another number. PERIOD."
bad,"Great people to work with very poor on perks advancing internally and asking for raises unless you are an external candidate.  organizational structure is a mess, CEO talks about other products without actually knowing the use for them, i.e. bitcoin."
bad,"I started working and the training was fairly extensive, but did not seem to be thorough enough. I did not feel that I was ready when I started to take calls."
bad,"It's a company that runs in black and white, and by the numbers. They don't use reason or get to know you as a person. They do not care about anything other than the bottom line (their money)."
bad,"The environment currently is not conducive to enhance talent that is currently there. When I began my tenure there was a strong emphasis on training, that has declined. It makes it difficult to truly service the clients in a productive and professional way. As a whole not the company but the management that currently oversees daily operations."
bad,"This was the most stressful place that I have ever worked. Management played favorites, I was an admin assistant for 12 loan officers, they were all very lazy and I did all of their work for them and they made 3 times the amount of money that I did. I was walked all over, I was scouted to work here and I was promised so many things and then I was laid off with about 500 people around the holidays"
bad,Would recommend if you want to have high blood pressure and loose you hair. Low pay and no room for advancement. Would not suggest working as a processor at this company to my worst enemy.
bad,"Management in certain portions of the bank is invested in ensuring that the status quo continues, even if it involves pervasive negligence and runaway costs. Dialogue is shut down and the poisonous culture punishes and chases out anyone that shines a light on illogical decisions and questions program efficacy. I've never seen a larger and more ridiculous practice of the blame game. Departments commonly playing blame hot potato at the expense of productivity, or even common sense, especially at the end of each courter and closing of the fiscal year. They espouse a set of values and work in a completely contrary manner. Good old boy culture run amok; costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars in poor technology infrastructure investment."
bad,"Unfortunately, if your are an Technologist in the USA, JPMorgan is a bad place to be.  The have had hiring freezes in North America for a few years and going on indefinitely.  5-10% of the North American workforce is laid off with their jobs directly going to low cost offshore countries.  All U.S. jobs held by employees who resigned are immediately off-shored, as part of their strategy to offshore as many jobs as possible through attrition and avoid paying severance packages.  U.S. technologists have had big bonus cuts, benefits reductions, and poorer work conditions forcing them to leave.  Find a better company if your in the US, especially in a high cost U.S. region."
bad,"Making pizzas"
bad,"The management says, ""do the right thing"" for the customer.  But just wants to get as many products sold.  I had a customer with four credit cards and the DM wanted us to get him another one.  Crazy."
bad,"Extremely long hours and very little in the way of work life balance. Some great team players, but also very much a dog eat dog environment."
bad,I will not say anything more than this is not a company that you want to work for. They don't care about the employees. Just the next buck.
bad,Poor work/life balance and Poor management. The company culture is individual based with no belief in Synergy or teamwork. Constant employee turnover with poor worker morale.
bad,"terrible company, terrible job culture, terrible work life balance. Benefits are ok, job advancement is non existent"
bad,"Survived over 8 years while most only lasted 3 months.  Pressure was on keeping customer calls and email responses short and quick.  All communication was monitored to ensure rep maintained professional behavior and that customer had no complaints."
bad,"Worst Management, worst pay and it is impossible to switch to a different department. If you work in retail banking and no matter how smart you are, they don't even consider you for an entry level role in investment banking and would rather hire from outside."
bad,"This is a very large successful company that has lost cite of their employees needs. JPMorgan Chase has training and flexible schedules, but once you are employed there are so many customers that, there are not enough employees to service them. "
bad,"I've worked in many mortgage related jobs, but never one that was so hostile to their staff. Micro manage was so ridiculous in this company - not to mention favortism.  Leads were sleeping with their staff - so obvious.  Leads and management were so arrogant, it was disgusting.  I laugh now learning of some of these peoples whereabouts as that site closed."
bad,"during training they will paint this place to be the best. They will be very friendly and warm to you. After training you will be on your own. they will constantly remind you that your calls will be listen to. If you answer 100 calls a day with no problems, you will never hear about how good you did but mess up once, you will hear it not only verbally but a write up. You will always work nervous and no support from management. Also, your peers will be recruited to listen to your calls then go to your manager to snitch on you. You will be sitting next to those peers with the fear that he/she will listen and go and tell on you. This place is awful, management suck."
bad,"Had a good Experience working in JP Morgan. "
bad,No training.  You can't ask your manager a question because they have no idea what you are supposed to be doing.  Your team members are overworked and will be mad at you for asking a question or trying to learn something.  Your manager will most likely be a convicted felon.  Managers cause the drama to get their teams to hate each other like a soap opera.  People are cut-throat.  They will run to the manager to tell on you for taking 3 bathroom breaks.  Everyone is miserable.  The pay was great but not worth the horrible environment.
bad,"I worked in recruiting in NYC at 1 CMP and left recently. What a joke this department is. The company overall is a good one but like anything else it depends on the area or team you are a part of. After taking months to interview me, at the last minute, they told me that they had no head count and had to hire me as a contractor/temp with medical benefits. I was told that’s how everyone starts and that they thought that they discussed that with me earlier, which they didn’t. Once I arrived, I realized everyone was told a similar BS story as almost everyone is a contractor. I was given a computer and a phone amongst a sea of new contractors that also had no clue how to do anything. There was no training, no direction or help. A person next to me told me you have to do everything for yourself when it comes to fixing your computer and figuring out the right way to do things. The job is more like an administrative clerk position that asks you to do some recruiting than an actual recruiting job. And if something goes wrong, other areas of human resources and certain recruiting managers are very quick to make you feel like a real idiot. They blame everything on the recruiting department. The worst thing is my recruiting manager didn’t go out of her way to defend us when we were unfairly criticized or blamed for others’ mistakes. This is the typical demeaning and fear-driven culture in this department. The recruiters are so overworked and treated like they are clerks. I was mislead about the workload and the administrative aspects of the position. All my coworkers complained about the"
bad,"Poorly managed, unrealistic expectations. No advancement opportunities."
bad,Typical fund accounting administration group. Poor use of technology. However the fund accounting group had some great people working there.
bad,"I worked here for 2.5 yrs. I was laid off for no fault of my own, the management is horrible, the training is even worse. They don't care about customers or employees just about making money. I was supposed to get a severance and didn't receive it they've done nothing but run around. They reinstated me after 2.5 yrs to have fingerprints bring up a 10 yr  old expunged charge and wants proof! Now I can't draw unemployment, they've cancelled my severance 2x in the system and I cannot start work the day I was supposed to begin. I think if you were to ask me if you should sign up  with Chase I'd say run fast and far."
bad,Expected superior results with out management support or directions...Drastically underpays employees but wants best in class.
bad,"This place is where ideas go to die.  Senior management is a bunch of know-nothings that are trying to hang on to the role they're in until they get to the next one they want.  Very, VERY, few impressive people in the way of professionals.  This is a place where B players think they're A players because they work with C and D players.  If you want a job that you can spend a career in and do next to nothing, this is the place for you."
bad,becoming JPM from Bear Sterns in 2008 was a hostile takeover...
bad,"I was fortunate to have worked with a handful of highly skilled and professional people while I was at Chase, but would not use these qualities to describe the company as a whole."
bad,"I worked in Credit Card Customer Service where literally every phone call is listened to & timed.  If you spend more than 3 minutes on a call then it goes down as a negative against you.  So many negatives results in an occurrence.  Three occurrences  & you are terminated.  Every day I had to sign an off time report on which I was required to note what time I was off the phone, the reason & what time I logged back on.  It didnt matter at all what the reason was.  The times had to be approved by another department otherwise you also got hit with an occurrence.  The bank didnt care at all what the weather was & where workers had to travel from.  I remember 3 ocaisions when there were blizzards thus creating immense traffic hazards.  The bank didnt care & required everyone to report to work.  Returning home was very hazardous with many workers being involved in traffic accidents. When 911 hit I reported to work only to discover that the office was closed.  No one bothered to call me irregardless of the fact that I had to travel 30 miles to & from. On another ocaision I exhibited all the signs & symptoms of a cardiac arrest even though I dod not have a cardiac history.  The nurse gave me Pepto Bismal saying that she was treating me for gerd which is acid which is interesting as I hadnt anything to eat that day, so how could I possibly have gerd?  It took a while for the nurse to realize that maybe I should be sent to hospital.  I remember that before the ambulance arrived she received a phone call from the floor manager asking whether I was coming back to work or whether I was going"
bad,It is full of corrupt and bad business management. I worked for less than 3 months because my branch manager concocted a lie with his district manager to have me terminated 6 days before my 3 month probation was completed. I received confirmation that his information was false and they are taking care of it in their own way but wont rehire me. Mainly because now I know what they do behind closed doors. I wouldn't recommend just because there is no security or integrity. Thank you for the worst experience in my life.
bad,"The organization may be fine to work for and with, however, the departments I worked in showed little signs of integrity, decency or mutual respect for its employees."
bad,"The culture is one of making money at all costs, only the bottom line matters. The company's line is to help customers but that is not the case in the mortgage banking side of company. If one it trying to refinance their home loan with the company they try their best to not work with you in any capacity and then on top of it try to get you into an even longer loan that you may have had before."
bad,A typical day consist of adapting to changes and learnig new processes in a short period of time. Very high expectation very low morale.
bad,"Managers not real helpful and the complete work environment is not good, moral is very low"
bad,Chase is still digesting all the banks they took over. They have tried to automate as much as possible however their systems do not interface which was very frustrating.
bad,"Chase was one of the best companies I had ever worked for. My colleagues and managers, Many of us still stay in touch; we were family, we worked hard and loved our jobs."
bad,"The management team need to do a better job with being fair and not forming bias.  Measure someone's work based on the work itself and not the interoffice politics.  High turnover rate due to the trainers that are unqualified, uncommunicative, and disorganized."
bad,"They just don’t care about you as a person at all."
bad,"Management is Bias, bias, bias. Not a good working experience for me, will be moving on to bigger and greater opportunities. Ask many questions  before accepting offer, never stop looking into ways to improve yourself and don't hesitate to accept any new opportunity if become available. Do what is best for you.  Good luck"
bad,"A lot of favoritism, clicks, never-ending gossip, lack of culture (specifically in all Bilingual depts) better suck it up big time so management can help you flex/change schedule, approve time off or get a decent annual performance review/rate increase. Resume/experience don't matter to move to other departments unless you know somebody."
bad,Endless ridiculous meetings without purpose  no technology budget  Management is only concerned about cutting costs  Senior management in Operations is not supportive
bad,"There is zero work/life balance. You could have a 10.5 hour shift with only a half hour break. There is no communication between management and staff. The turn over is constant. Customers even comment about another new face, and every time they come in someone has left. Not worth the stress."
bad,"I worked there for 7 years, which during people from outside the company were promoted and there were always constant changes in management. Company does not appreciate their employees."
bad,"Not sure what is is about the Elgin call center, but management there are very bitter. They think that because it took them 15+ years to get to a management position it should take others that long. I came in after being laid off from another financial institution where I was an assistant Vice President, I have an MBA and over 14 years at the time of management, banking, customer service experience. I took a position so I could get my foot in the door and move up, horrible decision!!!! It was confusing for the recruiters to understand why I took an entry level position, also they kept telling me that I could not move up to the positions I was applying for do to, too much of a jump in positions. Even though I was more than qualified, they would say that my experience was from somewhere else? That I need to put my time in at Chase, which was absolutely ridiculous, especially when the regional manager came from working on a train? How is that more relevant than someone with a financial background. I was passed up and shot down more times that I could count, through out my two years at Chase, I had two ""mentors"", I was in three organizations, I attended meet and greets, volunteered for extra assignments etc. That place was a joke. I do know from being in banking that not all places are the same, so I am open to working for Chase again, just not at that location."
bad,Very micro management! Bullying occurred in this kind of working industry. I was never been stressed ever in my entire life. The job description you signed up is different from what you will do in the actual.
bad,"There was disrespectful and undervalued staff,inequality,low morale , discouraging enthusiasm,promotion of wrong people,and hierarchy instead of autonomy in JP Morgan Chase Bangalore India"
bad,Not a place to work if you are interested in real collaboration with your co-workers.  Very stiff culture and poor management.  Upper Management changes constantly and how this plays on the employees makes zero difference.
bad,Chase is not a good company to work for. They do not care about their employees and they do not care nor do they take accountability for whom they do business with and how that effects their employees or their customers.
bad,I was working for Chase and I loved being a teller but depending where u work customers are totally disrespectful. The employees were racist and staff will lie on you to try to get you fired. HR was no help as I would call and all they would do is keep redirecting my calls. It’s not that bad jus make sure you chose a location with an environment that’s is culturally respectable towards you and for you. This is my truth and I’m sticking to it.
bad,"If you are lucky to have a strong (read Rude and Shrewd) boss who loves you, you will survive and possibly grow. Others are out of luck."
bad,At first it seems like a great company. Once you start working outside of training the expectations are ridiculously high and managers say they try to work with you but don't. Pay isn't that great for all the stuff they require you to do.
bad,very stressful environment. If anything happens at home you have to use your benefits to stay home. They're not considerate. I work 10 hr shifts so i get 3 days worth of sick days which is really only 24hrs (they count the days by 8hrs) so its not really fair since my shifts are 10 hrs. and even at that life happens there will be other times where you  really cant make it even with a doctors note they still hold you accountable for a write up.
bad,"During my brief time at JPMC, I quickly learned that it's a sweatshop atmosphere. You're watched every millisecond. Literally. Someone over your shoulder while you navigate their new proprietary system and clock time spent on projects. It boggles the mind why this new system was released so close to year-end whilst there were numerous technical issues to be sorted out. Someone a desk away constantly phoned the ""audit"" dept. to learn what the new hires are doing."
bad,Management does not support the employees. I would not recommend seeking employment at this company especially at the Chicago downtown location. Workplace culture is nonexistent.
bad,"Not enough support to balance out the negative ""coachings"" about past conversations with customer's."
bad,"Worked for over 13 years with the bank to realise that it was just a waste of time, all the 13 years I worked with them I failed to gain trust with them and was left stranded after all the years of service provided, one of the big six in structure, very small my heart, they have great investments in creating videos based on honesty and integrity but follow non,"
bad,The home lending department offers little in terms of career growth. There is nothing in place for employee retention and management has no resources at hand for career growth. This is not the place for an individual who is young in their career.
bad,The culture was very toxic. They promoted those with poor performance and ostracized myself and others for top performance. Managers gossip like they are in grade school.
bad,"Sadly what could have been a successful initiative is nothing but driven astray by incoherent management with childish priorities."
bad,There was no assigned work space we were setup in a storage room that turned out be a safety hazard because the doors did not allow for safe exit in case of emergency. Training was rushed and conducted by someone who had never worked in the Chase environment. The trainers information was examples of experiences at BofA.
bad,"Comp and benefits are great. Everything else is AWFUL! Everything is micromanaged, the workload is insane, you can't advance unless you're wiry the in crowd, etc."
bad,"I'm a people person and happy everyday, This job place has tried to have me change my personal self as far as going against what I believe in and how I was raised. I'm a strong person with a great work ethic."
bad,"Hands off management with no objective setting leaving you to define your own role and value to the company. "
bad,"I'm at the library trying to fill out applications regarding a new position for a new company, and I feel insulted that Indeed would even ask me about Chase. Trying to move on. I was there for 7 years. Trying to be positive here"
bad,"no job security, they want to move all the jobs to Mumbai. no room to grow within the company, they rarely update employees with update policies when suppose to, a lot of employees made mistakes because of upper management's error."
bad,Too much work for a days work for an individual. No time for real lunch or going to the rest room. More than 8 hours work day and no paid over time. No paid dinner or car service for late hours. Very manual work processing environment with under-staff employees. Over-worked employees. Salary didn't matter. Happiness & balance was more important.
bad,"I was a fraud investigator with First USA/Bank One/Chase. First USA and Bank One were wonderful companies to work for. When Chase bought us, they were horrible.  They micro-manage,  they let there older employees go and hire cheap labor, and they had no clue what fraud is!  Never Again!"
bad,No room for growth. Opportunities for promotion and advancement are more based on who you are friends with than on performance.  For this reason meetings become more about being friends with others than work.
bad,".JPMC has high turnover, and they must have significant on-boarding and training costs due to this constant turnover.  All who are talented leave after a year as they do not provide cost of living adjustments or bonuses to most employees. They emphasize automation, offshoring, low expenses, high volume, and poor quality."
bad,"a typical day at work is so stressful, but you can learn lots of things and they give you chance to do fit if you can find a TIME after your daily work load"
bad,In Chase bank i met great people! i feel as it was a learning experience. the environment there was always tension. you did your best and it was never good enough.
bad,"Metrics are unreasonable they are relentless - unrealistic. They have a New York mentality - not healthy. Hard bargainers for only the top performers, all others they can attitude. Totally subscribe to the survival of the fittest - which is has truth to it. If you can't fit those conditions, don't bother."
bad,"Very disappointing experience.  Manager (Director) was completely ""hands off"" and did not promote collaboration among reporting managers or enforce Company rules on ""bullies"".  Difficult employees were hired under my nose as favors to other Managers by my boss, which  caused disruptions and bullying on my team. "
bad,"I have never been surrounded by so many people with such a low integrity level. If you notice their tons of posted positions for this company, people get tire of the work environment."
bad,"Management is selected by default and really cares less about the employee on their team. The training is poor and employees are expected to know everything. Management lie to cover their tracks and does not take ownership. No encouragement given to the employee on the team from management. Upper management is fooled by what managers and telling them. upper management needs to follow up by confirming certain task is being completed and not just taking someone's word. A lot of people really dislike their manager , they have to suck it up and work. Because if not management will get rid of you if they find out you don't like them based on their poor management skills."
bad,It was a very stressful job we had to work long hours everyday.  Management was not good. No work balance.  I learned a lot but management was not good and understand
bad,"This organization is a sweat shop...stay away."
bad,"* I would not recommend working for this firm nor the management team. "
bad,"Long hours, mind numbing work. Felt guilty to leave the desk, even to go to the bathroom. "
bad,"Monitor your every move. If your gone 1 min over your break they are asking where you are. Micro management is not the best for the work environment, its not laid back."
bad,"This is a fast-paced work environment and stressful, but this is not the reason that I do not recommend working for this company.  I do not recommend this company due to the awful management and the extremely low morale in the office.  This is not a happy place to work."
bad,"Cubicles, people who have been working there for 20 years(no big raises), I made practically minimum wage. It was insane for the amount of work. Still GREAT experience. AMAZING MANAGEMENT"
bad,"A large volume of phone calls. "
bad,Upper management needs to wake up they are loosing a lot of good people becasue their middle management doesnt have a clue on how to keep their employees motivated and proud of the job they perform.   Stop threaten the employee's with termination and help build there careers
bad,JP Morgan is like a factory. It just churns out employees year on year. If you have managed in this firm you can manage anywhere. It makes you so thick skinned.
bad,"i dreaded going to work each day. management was terrible, employees were treated terrible, the job was terrible. the pay and benefits were great. employees didn't get along - it was a miserable 6 years there."
bad,"Management starting from the Exec. Director through his direct reporting management staff provides inconsistent messages delivering direction to achieve success.  "
bad,"I had an exceptional data entry skills even tho I did not have any experience. Since I did not socialize much because of my focus on my task than what's going on around me (I am also hard of hearing).  I lost my job due to people's personal opinion/feelings regarding the kind of person I am. The money was great but the environment needs improvement. I learned a lot and I don't regret this experience, it took me further up into the industry and I utilized those skills at a better job position. "
bad,"Quarterly layoffs for various reason regardless of your work quality. Management is either under qualified or have their own agenda."
bad,"boring training class very monotone very unpleasant "
bad,"21 years with company.No job security or loyalty. Company decides to re-locate departments or eliminate them and lay employees off. Went through this 4 different times.Upper management has little concern for entry/lower level personnel. Top priority is always reducing expences and raising stock price. Company lay offs NEVER include any offer to train existing employees to work in other areas of opportunity. A small group of seven figure income people decide the career fates of people who struggle to get by and they justify it as ""needs of the business"". We were just tools to accomplish a task...no different then the computers on our desk."
bad,"The job had good compensation, but employees were treated very poorly.  I saw at least 10 employees fired at my branch in less than a year.  The management team would sometimes make up reasons to fire people even if the reasons were not true."
bad,They discriminated and didn't follow policy.  I was new and had to have all of my transactions approved and the lead teller approved a transaction that shouldn't have been approved.  I was let go and the lead teller is still there.  How is that fair?  They discriminated because she had been there longer?
bad,"Very uncomfortable environment, No leadership, micro managed by seasons knowledgeable co workers. Office politic are sometimes racial motivated."
bad,Good company to work. Excellent benefits and time off.  Depends which department you work for.  Will to go back to work in there
bad,"I worked in this dept. for a very long time.  Upper Management made a change and ever since then, the dept has imploded.  Nobody is happy and they continue to cut pay.  I've taken over a 50% paycut in over the last 12 months.  Management does not care about the employee.  They laid off a bunch of sales reps only to rehire 6 months later.  The company is ran by people who have no business running it.  Good Luck if you decide to embark on a sales career at Chase."
bad,Customer service and the needs of the business. There is a huddle in the beginning of the day and then you help customers through out the day.
bad,I got hired for this position posted on this job board indeed. Went through the two weeks training to work weekends and passed the training. First two weeks working on the floor with the coaches i was one out of 3 that was let go due to low volume. I felt like i was one of the new employees being targeted due to fact i did make sum mistakes but so did everyone else that started the same time as me. I even had to fill out an error sheet when every else didnt. In all They will keep you depending on the work load. This is why this job position is always posted on here.
bad,"Typical day work a few hours go home, I learned a lot working there. The management use to be great. The people was great until they hired nothing but dumb ones that caused the most problems Chase ever had. Never was hard, the best part was the people I worked with it will never be the same place."
bad,"Managers will smile in your face and tell you one thing, then turn around and completely do something different. "
bad,"JP Morgan Chase came in 09/2009 to keep the doors closing from previous employer Washington Mutual.  Had a company of over 1,000 employees and laid off  350 employees in 01/2013 and then laid off another 400 in 03/2013 and I am in the last of the 1,000 my job will end in 2014 that is when the doors will close for all of us.  It has been a stressful 4 years with all kinds of rumors about when this company was going to come in and lay off and close the doors for good."
bad,Management forces you to harass people and sell them things they really don't need.  I was forced to lure people into accounts which ended up costing them in the long run.  Job was to pull customers from the lobby and upsell them into accounts.  Job sucked overall.  
bad,"chase is a company that still sadly believes in the 'good old boy system' meaning that unless youve been there 40yrs or are 'besties' with the management you will not go far in that company. nor will you succeed if you 'play by the rules' meaning actually following policy, they are quick to terminate employees who focus on doing things ethically, and by the law if that employee is not willing to cut corners to make their sales.  plain and simple.  they are high and mighty when it comes to saying that they are setting the standard, but quick to fall short when the standard is in question.  "
bad,"Job started off well, the Company acting like they were concerned about the well being of the employee, but later it showed that it was all about chase it the companies growth. they weren't concerned at all about thier employee's well being. Management never took the time to learn anything about the employee, fogetting that most of them were once analyst also. I believe Chase needs additional training on how to show compassion for management team. Employee perform better with corrective critisism rather then being beaten down, and made to feel less then, and being talked down to. AVP, and VP acting like there gods over us employees."
bad,It was great when it was wamu but the things that were promsed to us never happend there is not work life blance unless you can jump through lots of hoops and then there is still none.
bad,"As a Chase personal banker my main duty was to serve the client, to ensure a long term association to establish a well-balanced and deeper relationship. My duty was to keep in touch with the clients to ensure that all their banking needs were met. I was always ready to help the client when they came into the bank, in deciding to invest their money in deposits and withdrawal accounts. In addition, as a personal banker I had the duty to assist clients on different banking aspects as per their needs. Updated and upgraded the clients about new policies of the bank and help them get the most out of their relationship with Chase. I was required to have the knowledge about various functions of the bank to help the clients."
bad,I was hired on as a contractor in the Irving office on Beltline and when I got started I noticed they treated all contractors horribly. Piling us with other employees work that couldn't do their own jobs. The management had very bad attitudes and barely helped or answered questions.
bad,"A typical day is sitting at your day being micromanaged all day, taking calls. You cant say what you wan to say to a customer, everything is a script. your not allowed to be yourself. there is no room for growth.its all in who you know. But chase is great for your resume."
bad,"During my interview I was excited to learn that this company is transparent and is supportive of promotions within. This was so untrue. The HR practices are ridiculus, recruiters never respond to your questions. Hiring managers don't bother to give you honest feedback. Management is not aware of what will happen tomorrow and while they claim to be transparent in everything...this is the most conspiring company I have ever seen. Politics are ridiculus and there is no culture."

bad,"The CSA role at JP Morgan is a horrible job as the high turnover rate shows. CSAs are underpaid, overworked, and underappreciated. Middle management is petty, vindictive, and intolerant. Need I say more?"
bad,"Chase is the largest and cheapest company I have ever worked for. I have worked here for 4 years and it continuously keeps getting worse. No bonuses, no incentives, no catered food, no free ""chase"" swag/gear, no employee appreciation. Nothing. Everything this company does is for show. They invested Millions into renovating the Polaris building to show off to clients and investors but they cannot afford to pay ""the help"" a livable wage. Oh, and then they kicked out all of the lower class employees to a dirty, old, bed-bug infested building in Westerville so the upper class employees can all be together and benefit from the new building.The starting pay here is.. A JOKE.. it's not enough for a single person without children to live off, let alone the single parents here that work ungodly amounts of over-time just to make ends meet. Then, they only throw some loose change at us for year-end raises (which doesn't even cover the cost of living increase). I'm talking 0.45 cents for a TOP PERFORMER- and they get smaller each year. Annually, chase hosts a huge employee appreciation ""week"" with balloons and ""entertainment"" but in reality, only the salaried employees get to enjoy the festivities while the hourly ""help"" has to keep working and might, MIGHT, get an ice cream sandwich or peanut butter and jelly sandwich one day that week. Management is only here to control us to their benefit, and have NO desire help us succeed or grow or move on to better things. I've never worked with more incompetent and poorly trained leadership in my life. There are good areas to work (I've heard),"
bad,No loyalty at all to team  Constantly laying off  making you train India and Argentina then you no longer have a job   They a very disrespectful when they insult our intelligence    Every one is trying to leave or form some kind of coo    It’s all about short term gains when in the long run they spend more money     Nothing will change but beware
bad,"Chase as a company is a great place to work as far as benefits go. The management however, was not fair. Some managers do not know how to work the teller side and they do not help."
bad,"Worked at Banc One, Chase for over sixteen years.  Most of the managers (I had a different one every year) were awful.  I had five great managers over sixteen years, but they never stayed long. Working at Chase was like being in the “Hunger Games.” I was a National Achiever multiple times during my tenure at Chase.  As I got older I noticed that my sales credits were being given away."
bad,"Quality of work is good and that is the only pro."
bad,"Compensation is very good, however, you will pay a price in working with a brutal regime who are ruthless.   Employees are completely dispensable.  If you are over the age of 40, you should plan to leave as it’s a culture that values younger employees. "
bad,"Management was the reason I left. It was horrible, stressful, and I was sick to my stomach going to work every day. If you want to be micromanaged this is the place. (Long Gove branch)"
bad,"Enjoy working with customers & helping them solve problems."
bad,"Over worked and underpaid.  After working for the company for five years never got a promotion, no matter my efforts. The bank had lines through the door and in drive thru because I was the only teller on the teller line many times during the most busiest day of the week."
bad,"I am a person with a disability, multiple sclerosis to be specific with chronic migraines. I had both for several years before going to Chase. I only asked for basic accommodation like screen anti glare items. They were provided and I always met, mostly exceeded goals depending on the month. Once I had to take FMLA time and then go on short term disability for 2 months, everything changed. When I came back there not only was no time to ease back in, learn about changes, they also greeted me with my areas of shortcoming that occurred before I went on disability. Considering we had monthly meetings with our manager to discuss the previous month and I went on disability three days after my meeting for the previous month and I went on disability on the 8th, only worked one day before the 8th using FMLA, this was extreme discrimination. I continued to work, actually received a promotion due to they forced my manager into it because everything looked great from corporate, but my managers onsite continued to discriminate. Every month my numbers were subpar while my peers were being told they were doing great. I was constantly performing in the top 10 percent at this point. I kept a smile on my face but inside I started to unravel, added to this is my MS escalated and I was told by my Dr I needed to get out of there. The negative stress(there is positive stress in life) was having an effect on my health. Two years later I had to go on disability (during those 2 years I received 2 percent raises, my peers received 5-7 percent annual raises and when we talked could not believe I hadn't"
bad,I believe that Chase underpays for all the added things and changes they make. Its like a new Wells Fargo. They have you making calls between customers. Its no wonder employees cheated the system. I believe a pay raise should come in when you get loaded with more work.
bad,"the department I am in has little-to-no communication, no up-to-date department meetings of any departmental changes within the department, and it has extensive micro management and low morale, in addition to lunch breaks (which is okay) however, they want no talking and monitor when you go to the bathroom or get a cup of coffee; making an uncomfortable (hostile) work environment."
bad,The department I worked for made the employee responsible for the work and customer service of other offsite departments.  The workload was tremendous. I often did not take a lunch beak to attempt to keep up with the demanding workload.
bad,its not much to say just go and do your job and don't have any errors because you are doing customer life history on there credit. Other than that it work
bad,Company does not value experienced employees who have shown loyalty. Does not provide any assistance towards relocation other than facilitating the bare minimum paperwork.
bad,I used to like it before they got the Manager that they have. AJ is not a very good people person and doesn't treat people that does most the work very well. He does not respect his people that work under him.
bad,J.P. Morgan Chase was a job that I did not enjoy although it compensated well. The environment and the management that is there was not conducive to a healthy work atmosphere.
bad,"My experience with JP Morgan Chase was not good at all. I believe hard work goes unmerited. There were time when I saw an opportunity, and worked to obtain it, only to find that my team lead wanted the position. I've had team leads who would not adhere to my needs as far as assisting the customers."
bad,"They lied to us about schedule changes, and they lied when they said they would fix the schedules that were messed up during a shift bid, therefore all the new hires got stuck with terrible schedules."
bad,"Descent place to work in, not enough room for advancement, company should put managers through training that not only involves sales but also how to be respectful and treat employees fairly"
bad,"This firm used to be a beacon of excellence in the industry and cared for the development of their employees and compensating employees fairly for their work."
bad,"PROS:"
bad,I don't care for JP Morgan Chase at all. They have deceptive practices that encourage cut-throat and sometimes questionable business practices. They have a habit of lying to customers and employees as well.

bad,"I got fires from chase cause they said I exceeded my time to take off. I got hit by a drunk driver, totaled my car and had harsh injuries. I went back a week later just for them to lay me off."
bad,Branch Managers are incompetent when it comes to employee morale or employee engagement and very condescending in their behavior towards employees.
bad,"Daily duties include managing staff to adhere to policies and procedures, executing proper behaviors to provide great service, performing necessary tasks to make sure the branch is in compliance, coaching and training tellers and new hires. The most difficult part has been balancing work and personal life.  I feel like Chase does not provide that for management.  Branches are not properly staffed and it comes down to the managers to fill in for lack of bodies to the point where we are putting in 60 hours a week with no additional compensation.  And worse the pay for all they ask is really unreasonable.  We are not heard by management and when change is asked for we are ignored and are basically made to feel inadequate as if we are not doing enough,  We get burnt out and it affects our ability to perform our jobs at peak performance.I find that the longer I stay, the less I enjoy my job.  If we were treated fairly, with respect, not run into the ground, and better compensation, it may not be so bad."
bad,"I'd never work here again, worst work environment ever. They encourage racial discrimation against non hispanics and will bully you out!!!"
bad,The company had good benefits.  Company provided good working equipment.
bad,"Excellent multi-tasking abilities.  In-depth knowledge of conventional, government and federal lending regulations governing residential real estate lending. Demonstrated leadership, organizational, teamwork and customer service skills, strong written and verbal communications skills. Exceptional ability to analyze policies, procedures and guidelines in a way that maximizes productivity but protects the level of risk desired."
bad,Only wants to create income.  Mgt only cares about CYA and not about anything else.  Training of employes not good.
bad,Great benefits.  Management are not fair or value the work of employees. No balance between familly and work
bad,"They need to get the right leaders in place, create an effective plan of change, test it, implement it and make necessary changes as they go. Even working as a manager there nobody ever seemed to know the ""direction"" we were heading in. I had excellent rapport with my co-workers, and several of my direact managers, and nearly all employees would come to for advise on how to handle issues in a professional and tactful way. My fellow managers and even my managers would use me for human resources expertise when dealing with employe relation issues."
bad,Chase is a company that does not necessarily value its employees and does not appreciate quality employees. Chase often views employees only as a number and not value people for the work they do to make the company successful. Management staff is also not selected based on experience ad leadership rather who you know. The pay scale is also in need of updating and review.
bad,A typical day started with a meeting to grill everone over how much production from the day before and set unrealistic goals for the current day. They recruit quality people and get the most out of them in an unsustainable way.
bad,Horrible company to work for! They herd employees in and out like cattle!!!!
bad,I am a contrractor for this company. It is slowed pacced and would prefer a busier work environment.
bad,"My position was cut because they’re outsourcing jobs to the Philippines to save money (never mind that these new employees are not actually qualified and that the company bleeds money over incredibly stupid things like buying $1000+ video phones for 500+ people who never even make phone calls, moving employees’ desks several times per year which costs hundreds of dollars per move, etc). Upper management has no idea what they’re doing and are severely out-of-touch with the employees and processes they oversee. Too often, they roll out major changes that never seem to be adequately thought out, which is stressful to deal with. Half of the time, employees are left to scramble to find solutions to problems management creates. No upward mobility even for people who are driven, creative, and/or talented."
bad,"This company doesn’t have any job security, it provides no work life balance, wouldn’t advise anyone to seek employment here. The people try to befriend you only to tell your business to others and management. Your coworkers try to get you out the door so they can keep their jobs. A really devilish, backbiting environment. If employed, do not make a career out of it, stay to yourself and use it as a stepping stone. They hold no loyalties to you. Believe That!"
bad,My time at chase was meet with good and bad times great co workers who genuinely care for each other but management is really hard to deal with they will change ruled and blame it on s already flawed policy system everyone is afraid to speak in lue of losing there job chase has terrific benefits and pay but they all come at s very steep. (This is a brief description of what chase is about)
bad,"Worst Place to Work. Poor Management ,"
bad,"This was a very stressful job, partly because of management I had to deal with but also the hours the job required. I would never recommend any of my friends work for this company."
bad,"Management is very strict and  will treat you like a child there is one sell out manager to beware of mostly this person will rat you out for every little thing and they think that this will make you work harder but it only stresses you out, makes your performance low and creates a distrust and lowers office moral. There are no raises but they want you to work harder next year for a raise that you probably won't even get even after you have collected millions for the company, there are no bonuses either ... They make it hard for you to leave this department and your overall scorecard performance is based on if customers pay or not, customers will  lie and say that they are going to pay and dont and because of this you get a low score card and possibly let go from the company management will blame you even though they know low scorecards are a result of customers not paying  avoid this department at all cost it started off nice but new management came in and ruined it... don't do it you will regret it!"
bad,"Attention!!! Statistics PhDs should never come to JP Morgan!!! I am a PhD in stats and worked in some data science related team at JP Morgan. What are ridiculous:"
bad,Upper management stinks they backstab the managers. Market Directors make you think you have their support  When the only thing they do is to collect information about how you are running the branch and then they will use that information to  backstab you instead of helping you. They put so much pressure on the managers And  threat  you with your bonuses if you don’t hurry up and grow their business. Chase is a good company but is managed buy  greedy people  They only think about their bonus .
bad,"A typical day at chase is reviewing 100-130 calls per day. The work environment is fast paced and they are only driven by numbers  and scorecards. Scorecards can include attendance, surveys and more."
bad,Horrible infrastructure!!! They roadblock all attempts to be productive and don’t trust their developers!! Avoid at all costs. The tools in place are meant to reduce the actual work rather than ensure the work is actually done right.
bad,Typical day at work would be to come in in the morning log on to the dialer system and begin receiving your calls for auto collections as well as assisting interpreting Spanish calls
bad,"We are looking for a responsible Administrative Assistant to perform a variety of administrative and clerical tasks. Duties of the Administrative Assistant include providing support to our managers and employees, assisting in daily office needs and managing our company's general"
bad,Could not advance in career. Favouritism is very real. You are told on a daily basis that you are replaceable. You voice your concerns and you get called out in front  of people at meeting. Very hostile environment.
bad,Great opportunities for people willing to drive their own careers.  Must be willing to push and change jobs to take advantage of opportunities and become known across management for advancement.
bad,"The senior management in the mortgage lending and processing department is horrific. Everything is determined off a spreadsheet and only discussed on number based monthly numbers. Oddly enough, the determining factors of the processing position have nothing to do with sales based factors as we only assist the mortgage banker and underwriters. The job did not pay nearly enough for what loan processors cover and are required to know."
bad,"The single worst company I've ever worked for in terms of the quality of employees, politics, bureaucracy, arrogance, back stabbing. Just a truly putrid culture."
bad,"In the 3 years I worked at JP Morgan, I had 5 different managers. 2 were fairly good managers. 3 were awful. "
bad,The job was very close to my home.  This was a positive.  However there was high stress and minimal training.  Very high levels of micromanangement from upper level managers who should have hadd better things to do.
bad,No room for growth in my role. My current location is far from my home. The pay is low compared to all my responsibilities. The company no longer offers bonuses for my role as of 2017. Only Branch Managers receive bonuses.
bad,"Enjoyed the job performed, as it entailed court Motions for Reliefs from bankruptcy filings; and Proof of Claims.  Interacting with law firms all over the United States. Meeting bar dates and timeframes. Culture of the environment was to racially divided."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and attend to duties right away. Learned how to communicate well with various people. Environment became hostile because of few people in management and lack of ability to effectively stay organize and remove personal feelings from work environment. Hardest part of the job was people got fired for not asking questions they already know the answer to, people were fired for talking to coworkers when needed help, and people that were there for a while were fired so they would not be promoted. They did not want to spend the money on their employees. Most enjoyable part of the job communicating with co-workers and clients."
bad,"Got let go from JP Morgan Chase because of a Emergency Surgery during my training couldn't be helped but the management didn't think so, I had a chance to stay but I was told it was up to my manager but she thought I wasn't good enough to hold on to so I was terminated...."

bad,"Extremely high and Unrealistic expectations/deadlines, extremely stressful work environment, Management is totally unaware of managing people."
bad,"I have learnt a lot from the team . The company didn't support the professional growth or advancement in the career."
bad,A typical day at work was to come in early and get coffee.  Go to my cubicle put on my headset and punch in on the computer.  I learned I never want to work with mortgages ever again.  Co-workers were stress also.  The hardest part of the job was the job itself.  There were no enjoyable parts to this job.
bad,This was a great company with good benefits but management was unfair with all of its staff
bad,Cross selling to a level that is not ethical. Selling products and service to people who don't want or need them.
bad,Close all trust account leaving the bank.  We received the information from the local office and made sure all fees were paid then distributed the assets per the reason it was terminting.
bad,Management didn't seem to care. Speaking with a lot of angry clients
bad,"Chase is as horrible as their reputation is becoming. The breaks and lunch time is nice. I was there for a week as a new employee and was so excited because working in the mortgage industry, when you land a job at Chase, its a pretty big deal, anyway I came to chase from another company, one of the girls training us said that she finally became a full time employee of chase after 5 years of being there. I was stuck with a trainer that was doing a totally different job, I never got to even work at my own desk! I was never able to prove myself, they trained me for 5 days then told me I wasn't needed without any reason! For 3 days I sat with a trainer that wasn't even doing the same project,and the last 2 I finally got the proper training but as I said I wasn't even able to perform the job because they didn't need me."
bad,"You definitely don't want to consider working here if you are interested in your reputation as a loan officer or actually having a career in the mortgage industry. I find out my information from the wall street journal as to what the Chase mortgage dept is really up to. It definitely fits the way the company is acting. Right now the average ratio of loans to processors is 1 to 50. You can be the best loan officer in the world and fill the pipeline with quality loans, but you will beat your head against a wall closing them. It's your responsibility to keep the customer happy and get yourself a paycheck, while the company is actually trying to scale back and intentionally keep from closing loans. Right now, many loan officers aren't receiving paychecks for this reason. Instead of letting people go, Chase is hoping they quit and move on. In fact, many of the team meetings involve the manager hinting that maybe it's time to move on."
bad,"The typical work day was very frustrating.  Management did not know how to clear up reports and dependable on analysts to ""figure it out"" on their own.  Dealing with unbearable VP's made the days extremely frustrating."
bad,"My experince working at JPMChase was one of my worst experience. Management was horrible, was not helpful or words of encouragement. I felt i was being harrassed and pointed at everyday. I had called HR for help twice and still nothing was done."
bad,"Helped customers 8 hours a day, while dealing with incompetent management."
bad,"Absolutely no challenge and growth. Even if you'll finish everything and will have time to explore other opportunities, create presentations and conduct research, nobody will care (even if it'll pop up later, nobody even will remember that you've already done). You are a pair of hands, not a person. In some DCE teams, you can face absolutely demeaning workshops that are done only by a single person who is a favorite person of your boss. No reaction even if you propose something constructive and get support from other team members. Hypocrisy, lies and double standards all over the place. The most friendly person as you think is most likely the first who'll stab you in the back It's cool to have a line with ""JPMC"" in your resume, after that, just run from there, because you're wasting your time."
bad,"Depending on your job role, this can be the most stressful and awful place to work. I’m a banker and work in the branches. When I started as a teller it was great at my first branch, but moving branches so often, you have to get accustomed to the way the new branch works. They say onechase as in we’re all one team but that’s not the case. My branch manager is the worst human being I have ever met and that’s saying something. And then when there are two different code of conduct violations filed against her, HR does nothing to help. I honestly have never had such a bad experience working for a company like I have working for chase. Chase forces customers to do digital banking and for the bankers to basically force their clients to do digital, so then production and sales fall, but then will reprimand branches for their performance and production levels because they aren’t bringing in enough sales. It is the most stressful job you can possibly have and you’re constantly walking on eggshells thinking you will get fired for something minor. There is no job security whatsoever. Oh and bankers don’t get raises but then your branch manager will turn around and complain to you about how what we do effects their raises and bonuses. They will be in your business asking why your direct deposit isn’t going into your chase account, which you’d expect your account to be confidential like any other customer but that’s not the case"
bad,Expect to turn every interaction into a sales pitch.  You will spend a good portion of your day making phone calls to bring affluent customers to chase.
bad,"Great place to work but the management can be better.  The branch I worked at was extremely unprofessional, and unwelcoming. Overall Chase is a great place to work"
bad,Chase Auto is the worst place I've ever worked. A complete mess and management lies while smiling. Advancement is almost impossible and beyond frustrating. If you work hard they will screw you over and keep you down. NEVER work for Chase Auto!
bad,"no specific review to give.  It was a good company to work for ."
bad,"The environment is stressful, and I felt a little piece of my soul die every day I drove in to another 8 hours of watching talentless people get promoted because they knew how to kiss up, while talented techs and customer service people floundered because they weren't kissing up to the right people."
bad,"I’m a manager on duty and banker , been with chase for 3 years they do not care about you just the customers, when they offer me the manager on duty promotion I never got a raise just a Ridiculous goal that you have to achieve to get a bonus. Every end of the year I get just like .50 cents of a raise that’s it and on top of that I’m exceeds expectations that’s a + on grades . And that’s the only raise I get . Again do not work here get a job another bank or don’t get into banking"
bad,"Some good managers,great benefits. Meet great friends. I personally had a nice manager. Good entry level position but strict attendance policy"
bad,"I can't get anything done as a data scientist. This company is sitting on a mountain of data, and it's not accessible because they are very outdated with their systems and procedures."
bad,The company culture is fun dependent upon who you get to work with.  Onboarding process was exceptional.  Technology second to none.  In fact the only bad thing about my experience personally was my compliance officer.  He was a real jerk!  Other than that it was an alright place to work.

bad,not so good company rep.  management doesn't care about you.  the training program could be a bit better.  work life balance does not exist here
bad,Chase is known for over hiring and having a location on ever corner. So it's hard to make sale=commission. I was there for 2yrs and never had a great manager. I was laid off due to slow business and over staffed!!! Employees always being interrupted on lunches and breaks. Made you work split shifts when there was a meeting so they would t have to pay you OT! So you work 830-1230 come back at 330-730.
bad,Working at Chase is only for those who don't yet have a soul. You are trained and expected to legally steal from people who do not know what is best for them financially.
bad,"In the name of Female empowerment, the company has bias for resource and their opportunities. If you are working in IT in some departments, you are better off finding a job else where.."
bad,"This would be a better job its they weren't so rude , work was good the people ,""supervisor""were rude and not professional,  not to mention they have favorites and treat temps like garbage . Felt picked on it was more like a high school feeling than work , I liked working there,i did good but I guess they did not like my happy energetic hard working energy."
bad,Company has good benefits and a decent salary.  Various locations to work at. If necessary and openings available you are able to transfer to other locations
bad,I am a transgender and I was treated horribly their the worse job experience I have had thus far. poor management no where to grow for improvement or elevation it is like politics in the work place if you been their the longest you get a better schdule then the next person
bad,"A typical day at work for me is very early, would take rude calls until 10:15am, then take a break til 10:30. Then I would get back on the phone to take back to back calls to where I couldn't take a drink of water. Then I would take my lunch at 1:15-1:45, than back on the phones. I would say that I have learned a lot about banking since I've been there things that I didn't know. Management was better than I've had at any other company, but they would always give false empathetic because they were so used to giving it, I thought that it wasn't genuine. I didn't like the workplace culture, again I felt as though they cared about the customers more than they cared about there employees. I didn't like that when someone passed aways they barely gave us bereavement time off for a loved one that passed away. The hardest part of the job were dealing with disrespectful customers who couldn't keep up with there own bank accounts. The most enjoyable part about it was the cake we got for birthdays."
bad,"very unstable company to work for. never know when you walk in whether you will have a job the next day or not."
bad,They are only worried about the bottom dollar. The benefits are good but the compensation is terrible in relationship to the amount of info you must know on a daily basis.
bad,"very very busy, policy and procedures change everyday. They do have good benifits with full pay for fmla. Eveything is electronic . Take too long for promotions."
bad,Lots of great employees. Management was great. No job security and there was a lot of pressure to perform or fear of being laid off.
bad,This company does what it's states it will do. Overall good company to work for. Co-workers are very hard working people and very honest.
bad,"Environnement souvent agressif; bcp de pression. Ne convient pas à un équilibre professionel et familial. Les urgences sont, la plupart du temps, mal gérées et à la dernière minute."
bad,"Starting salary is wonderful, at $11/hour, you can't go wrong. They will even increase the amount dependent on your past work experience. "
bad,"Job security, mobility and relocation opportunities are prominent at Chase."
bad,The company's outsourcing program is the only stable thing going on there. You are bound to lose your job at any giving time.
bad,Salary is low management is unprofessional bonus is given on an average then you can be laid off. Human Resources department is fair. Chase should remove scorecard method this method is very stressful causing employees emotional health deficiencies.
bad,"Stressful working environment, management expected both quantity and quality with unrealistic deadlines.  Management painted a picture of a very positive and nurturing work environment, however, working environment was negative and stressful."
bad,Productive and a fun work place. Celebrate monthly birthdays and celebrate all holidays. Once a month they play bingo. Every October they would have a pumpkin carving contest.
bad,"Fraud Specialist,"
bad,"Under paid, Low compensation scale,,,much administrative paper work"
bad,"This is strictly in regards to the Retail Chase, branches! Absolutely horrible experience and would never recommend to anyone a job at the branch.  Chase has the best benefits and paid time off but working at the branch you are completely unsupported and they are closing more than half the branches in this area! No room for growth whatsoever"
bad,"Poor Management, the management constantly critizes employees."
bad,"No support and micro management , good vacation time you work like a slave however i would not recommend to my worst enemy so i wish you luck when applying"
bad,Not a great work environment. Very cut throat and stressful objectives to hit. A good old boys network that was not a positive place to be involved with.
bad,i was in auto finance and it was very stressful and really not in tack and they wanted you to fix everything and it was very fast pace and i hated it very much
bad,"Processed mortgages, I don't have much of a review as I have not worked there in some time but I was trained well and would have stayed had i not been included in a layoff."
bad,Chase is a typical call center for credit card service geared to people internationally that usually feel entitled in some way. Management generally is more concerned with stats and numbers than customer care. for people that can follow strict direction at the expense of others its a great place to work.
bad,Meh. It was alright. Good pto but an entry level job is still total exploitation of the proletariat. Managers fish for bad calls if they don’t like you.
bad,It was the time before the complete Washington Mutual/JP Morgan Chase Merger. They gave us millions files and files of mishandled files from WM in NYC and had to process sopoenas on a deadline without any order ith the files.
bad,No feedback either negative or positive from supervisors regarding your work. No having feedback lead to a false sense that you were being productive.
bad,"Chase was horrible place to work."
bad,"I would only go and work at this establishment if it was the last place to work on the planet, seriously. It provided me with very little, only how not to behave as a human or as an employer."
bad,Working with JP Morgan Chase was a roller coaster the hardest part of the job was dealing with the micromanagement. The culture is not a healthy one that you can see yourself being successful.
bad,"Large bank with very little concern for employees, even retail management has no say in what goes on.  They will say anything to get you hired with no regard for follow through."
bad,Sales driven on a product that doesn't really work. Years ago is was very unorginaized in the call center but things could be different and last I know the call center closed
bad,zero job security and the hours are horrendous. The management does not effectively manage. The culture is of blame rather than problem solving. the benefits were great and I wish that I could have kept them.
bad,"I would not prefer this job to anyone.  Management is terrible.  Any mistake you make they takes notes and use it against you, but anything good you do is forgotten."
bad,Company does not compensate well for experience held and this company hires based off of who you know and not what a person knows or has experience in.
bad,"management do not care about growth and development of employees, people are treated as a number, no appreciation for work done, too much favorism"
bad,"a typical day at work: obtain mortgage files, took out supplies, turn computer on and begin working, what i learned: the difference between and active file and inactive file, a he loan, prime loan, prime credit, he credit, a carrington loan, how to separate them, where to place them, how to label them and the different systems in where i could locate a mortgage loan."
bad,Banking isn't what is used to me. They are moving more towards faceless transactions. As anything in banking moving up takes a lot of time. Unless you have a good supervisor it wont happen.
bad,has been good and fun to wrk with games everyday. we also get free lunch every end of month. it was nice wrking with co-workers.hart part was to keep up with my customers.
bad,"arrive and count money"
bad,"promotion is rare, hardly any raise. hard work is not appreciated. employees being let go for no reason"
bad,"I work in the  houtson contact center, there are several different departments to work in"
bad,tough work environment and only good for individuals whole enjoy call center environments.
bad,"Same as the Attorney Unit, the Attorney Unit is actually the department under JP Morgan."
bad,"I love my job, but due to company re-structure I was forced to look for another job."
bad,this job was tedious and very demanding they didnt work with you personal life at all
bad,Conduct customer name list screening against US Treasury SDN list and other foreign goverment sanctions lists.
bad,overall review is that this was a great company to work for..I learned more about 3rd party vendors as related to banks and what roles and guidelines they were to follow. overall I would rate them as a 8 out of 10..due to the fact that contract was from (6) to permanent...
bad,"I'm a people person and enjoy working on projects where I'm interacting with various business lines, enabling me to learn, build and foster relationships and be effective in successfully delivering a project."
bad,Company had been closed and sold several times and jobs are often cut.
bad,production was very detail which kept me alert in all aspects
bad,The average work day was good. Not too many bumps in the road. The past year was a challenge as the line of business changed to loan origination. Worked 12 to 14 hour shifts and little reward came out of working the long hours. Management went home and individuals worked very late. The most enjoyable part of the job was my peers.
bad,"A typical day was filled with the trying to find out where data was and how it was stored.  I had no support from management.  Instead, I had  to ask geographically dispersed coworkers for help."
bad,"This is one of the worst place I have ever work. If you like to be micro managed than this is for you. If you want a manager who will never back you up go for it. I was there 6 years, manager's come and go and for over a year we didn't even have a manager. The current manager is your and wants all her employee's to be younger than her. They are her puppets. If you have your own opinion you should keep it to yourself. As for the District Manager he is as phony as they come. Watch your back if you take a position."
bad,"My job duties were  data entry, scanning, sorting and assisting my team when needed. Ive t learned the importance of accuracy and the ablility to multi-task in a office setting. I  love my co-workers, eveyone in my department were graet teamplayers and always made sure eveything was done within the appropriate time. The part of the job that I hated most was the closing of my department and my job being eliminated and shipped overseas. The company always recognize you performance with great incenitives and awards. Surely missed JP Morgan Chase."
bad,not a good company to work for. my time there was terrible I don't wish to get into details of my time there.
bad,"in January of 2001 I gave up a lucurative career as a contractor to take a position in Tampa. Eighteen months later after closing my company and dropping the insurance that I had as a contractor, I was laid off. At the time I was told that 85% of those laid off were re-hired by the company. As an Adabas/Natural software professional I with a degree in Information Systems and many years experience with Cobol, JPM would not consider me for a Cobol position for which I needed to learn CICS. Another thing was that the individual in personnel could see out her window when I went to lunch and would only return my calls during my lunch hour. After being laid off I learned about JPM's effort in getting the number of H-1B visas increased which I believe ultimately led to my being laid off. As a result of their unwillingness to provide me the small amount of time that it would have take me to learn CICS, I wound up having to sell my home and many of the possessions that I had aquired over eighteen years in IT, and was out of work for two years. They also indulge in coerceion to get employees to say that they agree with the ethics of JPM and other of JMP's managerial practices."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the work life in my company is the free life.
bad,JP Morgan Chase-Arlington TX. Auto Finance Rep 2/09-3/10
bad,no comment - it did not work out. i am looking for a job in the culinary field not the mortgage field
bad,"1. Collected credit card payments"
bad,"Processing night batches for loan review and approvals"
bad,Perks are it’s a nice building with many amenities. The job itself is repetitive and you literally can’t get an interview unless you know someone. Chase is not the place.
bad,"I promise to be better in all angagments, creative, collaborative and sociable with others, i will respect the time of work, this will be the best first company i work for,"
bad,"Very Toxic, and unhealthy environment. I was very unhappy working in the bank. Cut throat employees, and dishonest boss..  I was so happy when the department closed, and had peace."
bad,This company is a huge company that does not treat every employee equally.  It would be a great place to work if we just liked the pay checks.  Management was not the great and employee did not care about the customers.
bad,"it is your typical retail bank experience, sometimes busy other times not. Always learned something new everyday. Hardest part about the job was wanting to move up with the company so bad and getting told no after applying for ten different positions with in the bank. I left jp morgan chase heart broken because i really loved the company but the company never did anything for me to move up, after getting more experience with another bank and re applying for other positions with chase, jp morgan still does not want to do anything to help me move forward with the company. So if you are looking for a job with the opportunity to move forward as time goes by, i am not sure if Jp morgan is the right company for you. I felt taken for granted. : ("
bad,"lots of information and procedures without good training. lot's of work for low pay. costumers without previous information about their loan, escrow and many important information. they are only  interesting in make the closing and do not provide all the information about the loan to the costumer."
bad,"Grat clmoany to work for, I loved the benefits and people. Great management and people to work with. I lived the support Inrecubes frim management and everything"
bad,Enjoyed working at JP Morgan. Like the daily challenge..Had many large projects. Have moved many traders.
bad,"To obtain a position within an organization, offering both a challenging and financially rewarding career opportunities, utilizing sixteen and half years of work experience. I feel that with my experience I would be an asset to any company. I enjoy working, I get along with co-workers, I make working fun and to help others to get through there day, and a good place  to work."
bad,i was a jr proc. i learned alot here as well it was a temp job..but enjoyable
bad,"Great company to work for. I had some of the best benefits and everyone at the job was very friendly, I go along great with the managers. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with customer's and analyzing accounts."
bad,"Unless your male, white and have a military or fraternity connect this is not the company for you. There is no opportunity for advancement unless you are male. Women and minorities are all second class. Very bad employee moral  in Texas locations."
bad,"Nothing to get excitied about,, JP Morgan is not the end of the world i have prior experience before JP Morgan, such as ADP (automactic Data Process. skilled base,I have a Degree AAS Business ADMIN, I als have Military Comm Spec. I think  That JP Morgan needs my Leadership and Developement Skills And let me make JP Morgan Shine I enjoyed the time i spent under contract through a TEMP Service., You Come to work You Learn you make a day out of it."
bad,"A company that has no consistency.  Managers love to micromanage their employees. Even after a myriad of lawsuits, many managers continue to violate employee rights for breaks ,lunch schedules, discrimination, and the list goes on. The firm does not value their employees let alone their growth and professional development. Employees are underpaid and sadly underappreciated. Lack of leadership mixed with a bad culture and poor Management who is disloyal and unreliable. It is very difficult to have a work/life balance. . Not a lot of career advancement opportunities. Management will pick and choose who they like and don’t like in order to promote within the company. The firm emphasizes on the Code of Conduct -yet management breaks every policy/rule/and procedure."
bad,Although I did not enjoy my time at JPM nor would I recommend anyone to work there...the fund accounting experience did help me land the job I left the bank for.
bad,Horrible atmosphere. Team leads don't know what they are doing.  The company tried team building but didn't work.  The leads had their favorites and would gossip about other employees. Very unprofessional.
bad,"They suffer from the classic fallacy that if you don't make the bank money, then you're useless...until they get hit with fines.  Newark suffers from the worst management I've ever seen in the military or the civilian world.  Nepotism and numbers are the name of the game (and numbers are secondary).  HR is worthless as are taking issues to VPs or Ed's.  The senior leaders are calcified in there roles and they don't care about you or your career."
bad,Managers had numbers to meet and that's all that mattered. Took time off to help wife when child born. Used vacation and got written up because not at work to meet numbers for the month. off for 2 weeks for child birth. Manager refused to acknowledge approved time off.
bad,"JP Morgan Chase has a terrible work culture, worse management, and very little incentive outside of commission to do right by the customer. "
bad,I learned sales is very key to helping clients. Main focus is to find something they can use to benefit clients daily life with online banking or credit card to ease the financial strain.
bad,"I was transferred from a role that i had completely rebuilt and had the remit that i was to continue to support.  Then i had more work added to my new role, with none of my old responsibilities taken away.  I thought that because I was doing 2 jobs, I would have job security?  My job was eliminated shortly thereafter, despite the fact that I had become the only SME for 2 positions, and then i was expected to teach half a dozen new associates what I knew.  My manager was never informed of my position elimination, because the decision was made by a bunch of managers whom i had never met and who made the decision arbitrarily."
bad,"This is was a company that was very concerned about the profits and not about the associates. When I first started this was a great job, but the room for advancement was slipping away due to job cutbacks."
bad,"Worked as Ex. Admin. Assistant for first 2 years, then was transferred to lower mgr as a Loan Support staff. "
bad,Overall training was good. When it came to schedules all but 3 were offered decent schedules. Once on the floor you have to juggle incoming calls with outbound calls to verify or update missing applicant information.
bad,"Management was constantly expecting more more more.  Within the job working 2nd shift there were time constraints because of time differences in the locations we were working the loans in. "
bad,A typical day at work involved providing quality & efficient service to every customer by learning & understanding each customers unique financial situation. I learned how to better proactively understand each customer on a personal & business level. Management was always open to suggestion on how to better facilitate the branch & provide the best work enviroment for everyone. My co-workers were very knowledgeable & friendly. The hardest part of my job was the lack of income. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things every day & meeting new people.
bad,"I went into this company with great aspiration, however, was let down. I have always believed in the old saying that if you have nothing good to say, do not say anything."
bad,"A typical day involved entering data pertaining to immigration applications sent to JP Morgan Chase by the US Citizenship and Immigration Service. During training, we were told the position would be full-time with mandatory overtime. However, not only did the overtime never materialize, but the position wasn't even full-time. The most hours I received in a single week was 39, and that only happened once. Layoffs began almost immediately after the assignment began. I weathered many waves of layoffs, presumably because of my typing speed and high rate of accuracy, and by the time the assignment ended, there were only about a dozen of us left in the data entry department. The hardest part of the job was never knowing how long the day would last or how many hours I would get in a given week. The most enjoyable part of the job was that when it was busy, which was rare, I could focus on my work and the day would pass quickly."
bad,"Company itself is not bad to work for unfortunately its so huge that you get lost, also lots of politcs and management do not care about you as an individual. Working remote at least one day from home is fround upon and they do not treat people with respect. You only get ahead if they like you personally not but how hard you work. Most recently the company has been laying off a ton of people across the board in NYC and NJ locations without regard due to relocation strategy and they do not even give employees a decent severance package. Management is  terrible in this company with no sense of direction specially in corporate technology space."
bad,"Chase employees are simply a number and not treated like human beings.  They talk about their bonus program, but very few people are eligible due to their stringent requirements.  Salaries are below average.  Management is horrible.  Again, Chase employees are numbers NOT human beings."
bad,Less favoritism among certain managers. Not enough emphasis on employee individuality. Poor promotion and low salary practices. Training was not as thorough as it needed to be. Managers spent too much time playing games during training
bad,"Low level managers puch down employees with higher education level they do not allow you to grow."
bad,"Average age there is probably around 47-50."
bad,I worked for the company over 18 years combine and to see the change with the day to day process was heart breaking. As a manager they want you to do everything from being a over paid teller to entry level banker.
bad,If they do not like you they transfer you out and tell you at the last minute. Hard to take bathroom breaks. Told to wait. 30 min lunch and no breaks.
bad,"When I first started at Chase it was a great place to work, learning and chances for advancement we're available.  I rose from computer Operator to Network systems for mainframe, given opportunities for education and challenges thru my career.  Once the merger with Bank One my career turned into a job, No more education, daily threats from managers.  Paper work increased to get any changes completed and too much over watch.  After 22 years I was happy to be laid off, it felt like an 800 pound gorilla was lifted off my back."
bad,Often terrible management the lowest pay structure in the banking industry Frontline managers are extremely bad it's a good opportunity for someone just needing a job.
bad,the compay is a who knows who and the only way for advancement is to suck up to higher ups and if you dont talk to the right people you wont advance far
bad,"Promises of advancement. Constantly hire people from outside to fill positions you are trying for. "
bad,"Your a Number, Not a person. Stack of papers every day on your desk and little room for growth and knowledge gain. Okay place to start a career simply for the name."
bad,The company is filled with bureaucracy and glass ceilings. They keep promotions on a bait and switch hook for you year after year and you never get what you’ve worked for after all the time you’ve invested
bad,"Worst bank I ever worked for. Management is terrible. Management talked about goals for the company only, never about the employee. There were employees waiting for advancement for years without any support."
bad,"Work life balance goes for a toss"
bad,Horribly stressful collections job. I would not recommend this company to anybody that I know. Horrible hours and horrible pay. No real room for advancement.
bad,Unacceptable goals. Upper management makes uninformed decisions. Moral is terrible. Agents try so hard to hit unobtainable goals and expectations. There are no current policies and procedures in some departments.
bad,Talking on the phone with bankers to assist with customers credit card accounts. Not easy talking to bankers who do not follow the rules of the company.
bad,"Management doesn't see you as a person, you are simply a method or means to keep the facility functioning. They don't care about your home life or what you are hoping to accomplish."
bad,"I don't recommend it.They don't care about employees, They don't care about anything but the bottom line. Ive been treated like trash and gone to HR on more than one occasion. I don't recommend it."
bad,"I worked at Chase for 3 months."
bad,This particular LOB is completely lacking in communication within departments/groups. A typical day includes continuous disruption in productivity due to system and application issues. Processes are constantly changing with no significant improvements. Fraternization is not discreet between managers and subordinates. Issues and concerns while encouraged to be brought to the forefront are not addressed or resolved. Slackers advance in pay and position while those who actually work will be held back.
bad,This is a great place to get your foot in the door but mobility and advancement are subjective.  Salaries are also subjective.
bad,"Terrible management, typical finance mentality, expected to be the first in, last out, to show face. Management (first time managers) was ill prepared to actually manage others and teach. There was no standardization of expectations, no measurable goals, just a lot of criticism and no actual constructive feedback. However, I learned a tremendous amount while working there, which has opened many doors. JP morgan employs some of the smartest people around, but discourages independent thought of any kind. Most enjoyable thing was lunch time."
bad,"You put in all this work, and you are not appreciated for it. I improved many processes and saved the company thousands of dollars in productivity and efficiency, and increased the strength of controls, but I saw NOTHING in my raise or bonus. The name is good on your resume but do not stay more than 2 years if you are young and to grow in your career."
bad,If you are looking to struggle with no support or instruction with no proper training then this might be the job for you!
bad,"The focus of management is on what you had done wrong not on what you have accomplished for company's bottom line."
bad,Nice place to work with helpful people. Busy environment that also included fun at times which made the days go by fast. Co-workers were nice.
bad,"worked 60 plus hours a week, low pay and minimum training.  Learned a lot and was able to move up quickly.  Job security is an issue"
bad,"This company was good some time back. But recently after having multiple management changes, it sucks to work here. They don't care about their employees at all. All of people I know of are looking for jobs elsewhere. Now a days only people who are good with office politics are surviving. I hope Jamie keeps a check on people working under him. I used to like working here a lot. I hope this company gets back to its original values."
bad,this job is a good place to work but not many areas to advance. the opportunity to mov into something greater is very difficult to do within the company
bad,"good job, great people, but long hours and low work/life balance. direction of product roadmaps changed constantly and its a tough place to work."
bad,I liked this job it was easy but contingent on productivity.
bad,"No typical day with position.  Varied daily, which was nice. Challenging work environment,  significant downsizings and numerous management changes during my time with the organization."
bad,"Poor work life balance. Be ready to roll play your phone calls and asked for your numbers all day long. If you have one bad month of numbers, also be ready to defend yourself. Most of all, do not ever get sick. You are better off going to work and spreading it to all."
bad,Stressful work environment. Management is unresponsive to employee concerns.
bad,I have learned that there is no team at Chase. Management is terrible and you are only a number.
bad,"Typical work day busy and ever changing."
bad,"I have been told that a 100 pipeline was the norm three years ago . A Sweat Shop, Mortgage Processing , Downers Grove, IL Just Don't Believe Me apply and find out"
bad,A typical day at JP Morgan chase is to push the work out so that we will not be in front log. I have learn differnt areas at chase and I know that I am a very flexable person that can get the job done right. My Co-workers are nice people that I get along with. The hardest thing about Chase is meeting your productivty when you move to different areas.
bad,my supervisor is knowledgeable and it management is very poor
bad,"would never go back into the financial area.Management was awful and it was never about how good your work was, more about who u knew"
bad,Cover yourself and be careful. Overworked and underpaid. Many people have had to kiss up for advancement and sometimes hardwork isnt rewarded
bad,sadly the company only cares about sales. i had my manager tell me to not speak to clients because they had no money and are a time suck. that is just wrong and it was the mother of one of my surgeons.
bad,Management is poor. Salaries are not competitive. Company keeps reducing incentives for its employees. The benefits are average. Chase offers some perks.
bad,I took FMLA and because my husband was dying I couldn't return after 6 months and after 4 years of employment I was terminated. Top producer in my dept.
bad,"Made some great friends but overall you feel like a cog in the wheel that is easily replaceable by upper-management. I was there for a few years and it was awful at the end; almost everyone left. The health benefits aren't very good, incentives aren't great but they're better than other banks. I wouldn't work there again and I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,The work is easy call volume is high but the worst part of working there is basically you have to kiss a lot of butt to keep your job or for career advancement they tell you it’s based on performance but it’s really not it’s who you know and who likes you. Plus the metrics keep changing.
bad,"This is a cattle call. They hire as many people as they can because they know at the end of three months they will go from 80 new hires, to 15, if they are lucky. They micromanage to such a degree it creates an extremely stressful environment."
bad,They cut your hours without notice and say they'll let you go to other branches to get your hours that's a lie. They work with who they wanna work with upper management puts so much stress on the branch managers they tend to take it out on their employees. The computers never work properly it's always something you can never just come in and do your job you have to be tech support as well. I can't type anything else it has a limit.
bad,They watch your every move like a hawk. It's a very stressful place to work. They stand beside your desk and watch you work. It's creepy. There is also alot of office politics going on.
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"Not a great place to work.  The benefits ate good but the pay is not.  Culture is non existent and the treatment of trans employees was subpar at best.  Also,  the opportunities for advancement was limited."
bad,"They claim having an open door policy and have a place where you can send feedback about anything. They've improved it because before if you said anything they would escalated it till someone convinced you that you're wrong. Now they just say ""thank you for your feedback"" and not much changes. If you have a complaint directly with manager they make you think you're not a team player. Employee morale is on the floor since they keep eliminating positions. They don't lay you off but make sure you understand your position doesn't exist anymore and tell you that if you resign the position is completely eliminated. I've been trying to go into a position I really want in banking but management just says that ""that's not within our 'line of business' and you can only apply and see if you're lucky"". It is more who you know and not what you know. My current manager instead of promoting employees wants you to stay put so he/she can be more comfortable. Not every manager is like this thou."
bad,Great time working there until a lot of unfortunate events continued to happen. No longer took pride in working in such a bad company. They don't care much about their employees.
bad,it was ok to work at JPMorgan. no room for advancement and getting laid off 2 times not very secure job. would like to have a more secure job and more pay
bad,"J P Morgan chase is global company"
bad,There are major challenges with low employee morale in particular areas in Chase due to low priority of work life balance and employee award/recognition.  Management working to implement support/training to mitigate these challenges.
bad,"The company and culture is flawed along with their technology for credit card processing.  "
bad,"Never enough staffing for an office that open 6 days week.  In addition, exempt employees (managers) would have to work from 8:00am - 6:30pm M-F and on Saturdays a shorter period."
bad,"My manager was horrible! Once he transferred to the new District, he basically got rid of most of the managers and replaced them with his old District."
bad,JPMorgan is a big company and it feels like a big company. I always felt like a number when I worked there and didn't feel like there was any room for work/life balance.
bad,"There are days when it is very stressful, chaotic. Technology needs some serious improvements as well as current processes, lack of lean processes overall. Lots of duplication , non- productive efforts along the way which has negative impact on customers. Employees are nice."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with.   The manager and Supervisors had favorites and always gave them the advantage.  As a Team Leader seeing this was very disturbing because I know how hard some of them worked.  Good people are leaving and senior management does not care.  I am happy that I no longer am part of that.
bad,"Management was horrible, the department broke laws left and right, I took a pay cut of over $30,000 just to transfer, they took away my title and my vacation. I ended up leaving because they wanted me to find reasons to fire my employees on FMLA."
bad,"A typical day of work working for retail came with the basics. Assisting clients, checking calendar, securing appointments and a lot of phone time to solicit new clients for new business."
bad,"Has a very low salary, always say you can write your own paycheck. Too many stipulations on compensation package. No work life balance, work extra time and have to shorten the next work day shift"
bad,"some good benefits but overall the collections dept is not a place anyone should work , didn't help me when I was struggling.  the company as a whole is good just not that dept"
bad,A typical day was stressful as management was too laid back and did not hold all staff accountable.  The manager was young and favored younger workers.
bad,"When being courted by the upper leadership I was offered a lot of promises that they never lived up to regarding my schedule. Current leadership is ineffective. They lack the knowledge of the day to day operations of the representatives they manage. Managers don't take any interest in developing associates to assist in finding best placement for their abilities. I didn't find the company to take much stock in work/life balance. Overall, just dissatisfied with my experience."
bad,The quality of management at the company is poor and unprofessional. Growth opportunity is almost impossible and pay compensation could use improvement.
bad,Toxic working environment with long term employees at each others throat and everyone trying find ways to throw everyone under the bus even if it was fabricated.  Some employees trying to manage other people and the Manager would allow it.  There was no structure.  They had all of us doing the work of 6 people because they shrunk the department to a skeleten crew.
bad,"typical day at work jump into auditing reports work is not always available "
bad,The managers are completely inept. They are known to put shuffle managers from other departments and these managers have no idea what their subordinates actually do or what their work actually entails. Then they proceed to make changes just for the sake of making changes. Awful.
bad,"Expected more from a large company. Horrible management! The hours were inconsistent, manager took all weekends off. When it would be busy, we would have no manager."
bad,"Demonstrated attitude of success and enthusiasm, ability to communicate with Realtors and home owner at all levels of an organization. the ability to complete dash board of 80 or more files"
bad,"This job varies from day to day, it can be very stressful and other days it can be very rewarding when you are doing what is best for customers.  You never know what to expect when you walk into work each day"
bad,"I enjoy helping customer's but the management is not knowledgeable "
bad,"Not a great place to work:"
bad,Little to no room for self-directed thought when managing a project.  Processes are set in place with NO possibility to make changes to existing procedures.
bad,"JP Morgan Chase would have been a fine organization if it were not for the leadership that were in place. The lack of forethought into grooming individuals to move forward is apparent. Additionally, everything is extremely rigid which prevents an acceptable work/life balance. In this environment, at least in my experience, you must absolutely put work first. To do otherwise, even if allowed, will result in a write up or verbal warning. "
bad,Too much work to meet deadlines. I worked 60-70 hours every week and still couldn't keep up or meet goals. There isn't any work/life balance. Management doesn't care that you work all night or all weekend - they just want you to meet deadlines. Don't work there...you will regret it!
bad,Didn't had a good working experience over here. No motivation to employees and very less onsite opportunity. Work culture is not that great. Didn't enjoy my stay over here
bad,A typical day of work consisted of taking  inbound calls for the fraud prevention department. I learned that fraud happens in many different ways. The hardest part of the job for me were the hours that I was scheduled to work.
bad,"They are more concerned with the amount of calls handled per day than how the calls you do take are handled. They accelerate the training to get you out there faster and then when you have questions you ask your manager and are told to ""figure out a way to speed up your calls""."
bad,"Everything at chase is based on a score card which is on a sliding scale, your rank is based on the top specialists percentage. I maintain a high score card which is great unfortunately for my peers that aren't so good at collecting, They are left behind a pushed aside even though many of them would be much better in another department. collections is a very difficult job."
bad,"A typical day at JPMorgan can be very busy at times, jobs are supposed to be done on a timely basis. Work long hours. Work closely with your co-workers and managers. You can do overtime if necessary but most of the time your Manager would like you to do overtime."
bad,Work life balance is limited. Cultural expectation that you work during vacations. A lot of double standards and code of conduct violations that are reported and overlooked.
bad,"uties included assisting customer who were calling in to report fraud on their bank account, filing the claims for the fraudulent transactions and assisting and instructing customer on information on how to avoid further fraud."
bad,Co-workers were very helpful and best part of working at JPMorgan Chase. Expectations by management were not realistic or sustainable. Management led from their offices and were rarely seen on the floor interacting with front line employees.
bad,"Toxic work environment 1111 Fannin St. Houston, TX"
bad,"You can advance in the job."
bad,"Management would constantly make promises regarding benefits package but never put anything in writing so that when confronted about anything that was ensured, they would very quickly backtrack.  Constantly changing review platforms which made the organization and work efficiency suffer."
bad,It takes years to move up. I find it laughable that their are bankers that haven't been promoted in 10 years. pay is horrible
bad,Loved working for Chase.  You knew exactly what was expected of you and could strive to meet and exceed challenges daily.
bad,Complete dedication to the company is necessary for advancement. If you are not able to dedicate extra time to the company you will find yourself becoming frustrated and overwhelmed.
bad,"Unpleasant working conditions"
bad,Management is looking for you to fail instead of helping to succeed.  They think they are helping but only want the people they want to help to succeed as by the recent number of people who are leaving the company voluntarily.
bad,"I worked for this company for about a year management was horrible except for one Manager ! however I was no longer under him. "
bad,Chase is/has went thru alot of investigations due to poor collection practices.  Poor customer reputation.  I removed myself from such a reckless environment
bad,"Micro managing at its best. Company has great ideas and is getting better at its customer service but growing too fast to sustain all of its promises. Big area for improvement with their employee satisfaction. Despite their preaching about work life balance forget about work life balance. The best part of the job was making a difference in the financial lives of customers. The hardest part was having a personal goal for advancement for yourself, hitting the numbers they require to entertain possibility and then have middle management decide it is not in their best interest."
bad,"You will be under appreciated, over worked, and continually treated as a cog in a machine with no benefits.  This is coming from someone who was at the top of the department.  Chase looks great from the customer side, but is horrible internally."
bad,State Auto has gone down in the years as it use to have an A1 rating it has fallen off tremendously. There is now a lot of competition in the insurance industry. Overall it was a great company for the first 3 years I was employed. They gave out quarterly bonuses and we as employees were recognized on a regular for our good work.
bad,customer support specialist receive and make inbound calls to card members that have fallen past due and try to make them pay past due balances.
bad,My experience was with Bank One mainly. I don't know if it would be fair to rate Chase. I do know they were big on working non standard work weeks and hours which I'm not fond of.
bad,"I'm an overworked Senior Loan Processor looking for change in my environment. My typical day starts out with checking my emails along with my voice mails, and responding back to our internal/external customers. "
bad,"The left hand didnt know what the right was doing.  If you didnt go to lunch with the right people, there were no advancement opportunities.  A lot of people in positions they are not remotely qualified for."
bad,"no comment, I was always told if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all"
bad,very unorganized
bad,Remittance processor
bad,It seem mediocre people pushed out the great people due to their insecurities.
bad,"I have never worked in the banking industry, and my experience here was not the greatest."
bad,Primarily hire contractors. Disorganized company. Managers move from job to job very often. Very little work balance. Most employees appear to be very unhappy working here.
bad,"Chase is always changing... good or bad. Management is a JOKE. Experienced A LOT of turnover at this job. I really don't understand how a BANK messes up on several of their employees pay checks and cant fix it until MAYBE the next month. And you have to stay on top of everyone for things to get done... or you're just out of luck. That's on the telephone banking side, though."
bad,"Notified customers when service was completed and accepted payments, answered customer's telephone, mail and in-person inquiries.Opened new accounts and sold banking products. Maintained bank reports and customer data up to date."
bad,Very sad because the management is horrible and no one knows what they are doin they are messing with peoples lively hood
bad,"While I enjoy the co-workers in the Bank, Management as a whole is horrible and the pay and hours are not desireable."
bad,"Assisting customers with day to day needs of account maintenance. I've enhanced my customer service skills, and learned some management skills. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everyone on the same page to complete the branch goal for the day. The most enjoyable was being to see the smile on my customer's face when their situation has been turn around."
bad,"outsource jobs too much. wonderful co-workers. love money too much at the expense of their employees,"
bad,Year end reviews are usually unfair and bias. Some developers have been stagnate which causes office politics to run rampant. Finance tech is usually hindered by regulations.
bad,"Job provided a significant amount of employee work arrangements such as remote/WFH, Mobility & involvement.  However overall compensation was lacking."
bad,Chase is all about super production and numbers.  It is very stressful because you have enough work for 3 people. It is also stressful because you never know when you will get laid off. There is no loyalty.
bad,"Inconsistent income, cut throat “dog eat dog” culture.  Management  had no conception of leadership.  Dealing with insecure micro management who didn’t care about clients needs. ..just bloodthirsty for getting the clients money and hitting numbers,  most enjoyable part was when I left"
bad,I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE!.. The management is never on the same page and they misinform their employees just to blame you for them not giving correct information for you to do your job correctly!.. Also there is a lot of favoritism for people that have been there for a long time no matter if they are doing the job correctly or not. I feel this is a job for someone just starting out in the workforce and can't get anything else. So if you do work here don't stay for a long time.
bad,The company is a very respected company with a great growth system. The bank is nationally known and has helped several families with their banking needs.
bad,"Although the last manager I worked with had good leadership skills, the majority of the managers were self absorbed and manipulative. Coworkers worked in silos trying to figure out how to undercut and out do each other."
bad,Working at chase is definitely an experience. This is all I am saying.  I don’t need to write anything more. I do my job and go home to my loving family.
bad,Your work/life balance and enjoyment of your team will vary greatly with your Senior Manager.  Too much hiring from outside when a Senior Manger from outside comes in.  Crony-ism can be rampant.
bad,I would not recommend this company because you are nothing more than a number on a spreadsheet.  There is no personal regard for employees as humans.  Too focused on numbers and how much they can squeeze out of an employee with no regard for the person.
bad,"Who you know sums it up. Incompetence is rewarded with promotion if you know someone. Statistical metrics run the show, and cheating the system and lying to customers produce good numbers, resulting in the false appearance of good work, which will get you in a position for promotion if you are buddies with the right manager - especially if you are in a category of people the left loves to tout. CORRUPT"
bad,Management is petty. Coworkers talk about each other all day. It’s no teamwork. It’s sales oriented and everyone is fighting to be on top and they will do whatever it takes. You have to kiss up to management to get promotions. It’s suppose to be diverse but it’s not.  If u are a good liar and have nothing to lose u would do great there.
bad,I would never work there again hours change nd days off very intolerable of others and they will fire you for stats quickly.  The manager over the dept. was always changing things without notice. No job security at all and they use your training time as part of your stats which can cause you to be fired rather quickly. They give lots of paid time off but good luck using It
bad,"Stressful, and it's all about who you know not how hard you work. A lot of favoritism, and management just push numbers but are clueless most of the time. They avoid taking a call when asked to talk to a supervisor."
bad,"Although the job was contacted, the environment was not very warm. People who worked there were there for a very long time some been working there since high school other their first job ever. No one seems happy at what they do. They are just doing the job because that's all they know. Like robots"
bad,"I think that your overall experience at Chase will depend on what organization you end up in. I have not had an extremely good experience with Chase in terms of management, transparency and development. However, your experience could be totally different."
bad,"I loved my job at chase but i dont feel they were understanding of me helping my family when emergancy situations happened. I have family i take care of and when they need me, i felt that because i wasnt there i didnt care about my job, i did but also i care about not losing close family members. If even through a probation period they could understand i would have felt better about working there. since that wasnt the case i was let go. oh well i will find something better."
bad,"Inexperienced middle management / poor leadership"
bad,Highly stressful workplace. Not compensated for all the additional duties you must perform. Management states sky is the limit for bonuses but does not want to increase hourly wage.
bad,Absolutely no growth opportunity regardless of your yearly ratings ! Management is not supportive. Negotiate everything upfront before joining this company!!
bad,"You are only as good as your last success and it better have been this week."
bad,"Unfortunately, the company does not offer much loyalty.  There were many layoffs during my time there and they were indiscriminate.  The compensation was below average for the industry and the bonus structure was never outlined."
bad,Worked there almost a decade... hated most of it. Constantly changing the sales payout so you work harder and harder each year to make the same money or less. Not friendly to mothers... I was told I was no longer being considered for management after returning from maternity leave. Had a personal leave that was not approved for no explained reason and was not paid my maternity leave due to discriminatory reasons.
bad,"Not enough resources compared to work load. Constant change in project objectives, unclear project goals and direction. Non standard compensation and inadequate recognition."
bad,"I am not sure if this is the norm, or if I just got in with a bad manager. But the micro-managing is overbearing and ridiculous. From the lack of ability to work from home to the submission of weekly reports to justify my work activity, to the monitoring of active minutes at a terminal. This is by far the worst contract experience I have had. It is very clear that the management and team I am with are anti-contractor. I would never recommend working for JPMchase to any contractor."
bad,The job itself was great but the department lacked leadership and management was very disconnected from employees and the team leads are on power trips.
bad,I had a great position under a terrible manager. I should have left years before I did because it was too hard to get promoted to another department. I ended up getting blessed with a lay off.
bad,"coworkers were good people. Had a great time  Good experience."
bad,"This company has no interest in you as a person, but only what you can bring them and how much of it. You are not appreciated only drilled to produce."
bad,"This BPO provides good compensation packages, medical insurance provisions, good employee care. The only problem is management, which is I think typical in BPO."
bad,Very behind in the brokerage industry. Lack of leadership mixed with a bad culture. Not a lot of career advancement opportunities. Not what i was expecting when I arrived.
bad,Passive aggressive and cliquish. You had to be in the in-group to get a bonus and raise or promotion. Extreme 'brown-nosing' vs. actual work being done.
bad,"the levels of management did not provide a streamlined management.  I did not feel supported or ad a clear pathway to career advancement. I had my manager request personal information regarding my medical leave, and asked questions that are illegal."
bad,"There seem to be a lot of lay offs. Personally, I am a veteran and not only have I seen several rounds of lay offs occur every year, they do not seem to care if someone is a veteran. For a large company that touts them selves for veteran support, I think the only thing they care about is if you are a vet then they can add one more to their ""veterans hired list""."
bad,"Not an enjoyable situation, extremely stressful and the energy was negative. Everyone feared something, the loss of the job a disgruntled customer or a vicious supervisor. Not Good!"
bad,"To my surprise we were clearing cases with known wrong data, but ""we follow the directions given""."
bad,My experience may have been due to a difficult manager.  The company knew that they were changing the structure and moving the fund accounting operations to another city.  So management purposely gave employees bad reviews so that they would leave and and not have to pay them serverence.
bad,Call center environment.  Management does not take well to new ideas. Good people that need to be in better roles.  Management does not take kindly to employees that are better performers and threats to their managerial role.
bad,"Chase was one of the worst places I ever worked.  Branch environment was not stable.  Leadership micromanaged people is did not value the workforce as people.  Very demeaning Leadership.  Operations needed much overall of properly processing, underwriting loans and very seldom ever closed on time.  Much strain on the customer and realtor partners."
bad,This was my first experience on the sell side. I am surprised about how much people care more about CYA than being productive. People will actively work against projects if it means they are exposed to project risk.
bad,I can only speak from my experience and I can honestly say that the management team made the job experience for me horrible. I also did not like the hidden fees I had to make sense to customers.
bad,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend at the branch level. Branch and District Managers are only interested in your sales quota every month without any other regard for your experience or all other activities performed during the day, believe me, they are a lot! Worked here for over 8 yrs and only got a raise once less than .25 cents/hr! Yes 25 cents. My compensation increase because I increased my sales production. However, this is not sustainable in all locations as they cram too many bankers to each one location."
bad,Well at my branch it was fast paced I experienced slow response from manager for overrides or customer issues. Often stayed overtime however they let you come in later next day or use it for lunch periods (ABSOLUTELY NO OVERTIME). Plus the pay is too low and having to wait biweekly for it was absolutely difficult.
bad,Bureaucratic and rude . No training. Exceptions are unreal .Dominating managers .                                                                  No support
bad,"Chase just doesn't care about employees and it is a constant revolving door with unstable schedule changing on the fly.  Difficult to use vacation days and many unnecessary restrictions of all kinds... It is a job and pays for a while but 1.5 years at the bank, I was the longest standing employee."
bad,"I believe banks should only hire Personal Bankers internally for those tellers who most deserve it."
bad,Would often have to work on the weekends.  Worked 10-12 hours a day. No time for lunch. Management was chauvinistic. Workplace did not favor females and HR was clueless about the disparity in the workplace. Management was unchecked and had free reign to do as they wanted.
bad,Poor Leadership from Regional Managers down. No work/life balance. Too many hours not enough pay. In order to get ahead in the company you had to suck up to Managers. Real leaders and producers did not get proper credit
bad,Office politics every where. They promote mobility but does not reinforce it. They have talent reassignment but will not help you transfer to another LOB.
bad,The salary package is very competitive compared to the rest of the companies that I have applied. Due to the number of volume of work there is a lot to be learned.
bad,"not ethical"
bad,"I felt like I was safe in my position, given that I had gone almost  1 year without having any income errors and very few quality errors, but in the end none of that mattered.  I was part of their most recent round of lay offs."
bad,Management is not flexible nor looking out for your best interest.  there is communication disconnect from what Senior Management tell the masses and what your supervisor tells you.
bad,"No safety for women workers"
bad,"I did not have an great experience in this position, due to management and the department has a high turn over rate. The pressure of working in the department did not allow employees to have productive work day."
bad,"I worked in the call center and when I first started it was an amazing place to work.  However you are constantly changing managers, and the new head honcho there nobody cares for her.  She makes you feel like nothing but a number!!!"
bad,"This is not a great place for an IT career. Absolutely no consideration made for employees.  Management is horrible. Mediocre pay, very little opportunity, no security.."
bad,"In the time that I was employed by Chase, they handicap parking spots increased drastically. The work environment became so stressful, people began passing out at their desks.  They even had to keep an ambulance stationed near the job site in the event someone had a stroke, heart attack or fainted. They are consistently laying people off and cutting back staff but still pushing the high demands of the workload on fewer and fewer people. The people who work for there are most awesome and do their best to rally together to get the job done but the high level of stress and pressure from management keeps morale very low."
bad,"I worked there 3 years and planned on giving notice. A friend i thought let my supervisor know I received an offer so when I came in management was waiting. Not only did my last check only have 56 hrs should have been 80. They claimed I owed vacation so they took out 31 hours vacation at 18 an hour and my hourly pay was 15.35 an hour. I called hr and they claimed management put in exactly how they wanted my last check handled. "
bad,A typical work day consisted of morning meetings and daily plans. I had new training every month that was repeated and an overall ucomfortable work space
bad,Managers show a lot of favoritism and do not try to hide it. People who know nothing about the departments are put in charge. It is worse in the corporate office. We are grossly under paid.
bad,It's an okay job. You're on your feet all shift and walking the length of the machine but I wouldn't consider it strenous.  The issue is the mandatory overtime. You won't even be informed of having to work your off days until the day before your off day.  At one point employees work 184 straight days.
bad,JPMC heavily depend on offshore to get cheap labors! Especially GTI department outsourcing most of their work in India.Like me most of our colleague in Chase feels job not secure at all.
bad,"Raises were almost never given. Management was great. Don't expect your hard work to get noticed, they'll bypass it. Time off is also very hard to get, they rarely say yes to going on vacation or needing time to leave early, etc."
bad,"Unsure if this is something that is true in every market for Washington State, the leadership at all levels was poor. There was little or no direction or development of staff. The District Managers that I worked for both had ZERO interest in work/life balance for me as an employee."
bad,I really wish I didn't have to do these reviews every time I changed my resume this is getting nerve racking!  This place was cool for a while however if you work in the city of Detroit they makes things very hard.
bad,The turnover rate is ridiculous. You would sometimes be assigned a new manager every other month so advancing is extremely difficult.
bad,"Low pay, management shows very little respect for employees. Can only advance if you know someone.  Healthcare is not good.  If you are not a favorite you are treated poorly."
bad,"If you're looking for a job where your manager is going to be down your throat all day everyday, then pick chase. This company, in my opinion, is just after profit and doesn't look after it's employees. Tellers are barely above minimum and bankers are basically just over worked salesmen."
bad,"By the name it's really a huge company, but once you have entered in JPM you can clearly feels that big name is just a name but not very good for your career aspirations."
bad,"The company changed so much from the time I was a banker to my promotion to Small Business Banker. The management became so overbearing and not people centered. The culture had a huge shift from overstaffed branches overflowing with bankers, to skeleton branches with one banker, one teller, and one manager, everything else was replaced by machines. Most management is interested in keeping their own jobs secure that development reached a screeching halt. There is a high turn around rate and making new friends is fun but then they are gone. Many roles are being eliminated and replaced by machines our are outsourced to overseas. Sales associated are more of a number with a dollar sign attached to them, so its dehumanizing and there is a constant push for more sales and your incentive is your ability to keep your seat. Its sad to see how much the culture of this company has changed over the past 4 years. The craze for bankers is over and now its skeleton branches with the least amount of employees possible. Its sad to see a company force their employees to encourage customers to use machines that are intended to eventually permanently replace them. They pay well and offer a great incentive program,  so you can earn a decent living, but forget your dignity or human treatment you are a number and the more big money you bring in the more change they throw at you. Most branch employees haven't seen a raise in over 3 years but they have seen less hours and staff."
bad,the objectibves were not cleared on how to accomplish daily or long term tasks.  The company is a great but the team i worked with needs a lot of great leathership.  To many very long days and weekends.
bad,"poor training and management, minimal room for advancement, salaries below industry standard...decent benefits and other perks, decent benefits and location."
bad,"The company as a whole is good, however, my particular location was not interested in process inprovements or enhancements."
bad,"I enjoyed the collaboration I received from neighboring branches in the market.The health benefits are great. They talk about letting you advance in the company, but when it comes to taking you out of the branch and putting you in training it is months before that happens. Managers are not held accountable for much, since the Market Manager has so many branches to watch over many branch managers take advantage of the autonomy. Branches talk about work/life balance but provide none. You work past branch hours and most managers do not allow breaks outside of your lunch break. Overall, I like the company but they need to pay more attention to the employees at the branch level and hold managers more accountable for poor practices that can potentially inhibit customers and bring employee satisfaction down."
bad,"NA-nothing to comment, was promoted quickly and moved out of the project to another project within the same company who did not offer much more than the previous"
bad,"I worked for this company for only 6 months and most of that time was spent trying to find another job. Came into the position with high expectations, the interview went well but after 1st week there i realized all the hoop-la was just smoke and mirrors! The work environment at this facility is stress full and a little intimidating.  If you don't lick management's tail, they brand you as an outsider and you get treated unfairly. Coworkers will shun you if you do not join their clicks and surprisingly, I found managers and supervisors of this facility to be the  most disappointing in their behavior because of the way they often seemed to encourage bullying and unprofessional attitudes toward low key employees. "
bad,"I worked for chase for 3.5 yrs, two as a teller, almost two as a banker. The first 3.2 years were with one manager, the last .3 with a different. Your manager determines your overall experience, regardless of coworkers. All jobs are going to have irritating coworkers, but your manager sets the happiness bar. The first was amazing, the second was an ex-car salesman, the run of the mill manager at chase. life was rough the last quarter, hence, two week notice that is turning into more of a one week notice. great experience when it comes to learning about life, corporate structures and how people make money terrible if you would like to enjoy a life outside of work. just realizing i have no friends after being too tired to do things for the last three years..."
bad,Employee friendly work environment where the work moral is on a high and advancement opportunities are available. Employee events were held frequently. Work environment where all internal Lines of Business work together to achieve one goal.
bad,Upper management meddles too much in employees day to day work and this breeds a culture of fear as a motivator rather than incentives and positive reinforcement.
bad,"Chase Manhattan Bank was a great place to work, which valued work life balance and a diversely qualified workforce.  After merging with JPMorgan, the company adopted more draconian HR policies.  After merging with BankOne, the company lost its soul.  The CEO values profits above all else, and appears not to care about paying regulatory fines."
bad,The culture of the company is indicated as positive and giving a balanced life.  Senior management does seem to want this to happen but the reliance on the lower level managers to truly make this a part of the job and work/life balance falls very short of the mark.
bad,"Honestly, the worst leadership I have dealt with up to this point in my life. Zero accountability. Org is constantly changing allowing team leaders and lower management to fly under the radar."
bad,"Horrible culture in the department I am currently working, too many college students, lack of skills from management who just don't care if you burn out or not.  No work or life balance and high turnover."
bad,rather not comment. increasingly stressful to work and produce and work at a high level. management will change your number . Co workers are back stabers
bad,Overtime hours to meet over promised Budgets. Management lacks direction and very poor project planning. No room for professional growth
bad,Standard day was printing Rates make sure everyone had copies - Sand by the door and attack the clients as soon as they walk in. Herassment of the client would begin as soon as the client stepped into the branch.
bad,"Chase has come a long way since merging with Bank One but during all the evolving and changes that make Chase the mega giant they are today something has been lost. There used to be a sense of loyalty and appreciation for the employees that have made Chase what it is today. We were always told ""because of you, Chase is an industry leader"".Thats nice to know but little comfort when you get close to or over your 20 year mark you become a target for management to move you out by any means so new employees can be brought in who know nothing about the accounts or customers. If you are looking at working and laying it on the line keep low and maybe you will fly below radar. Good luck !"
bad,this was the worse job i ever had. unless you have a high tolerance for bs i would not suggest you work here
bad,"Pressure, pressure, pressure.  Criticism, Criticism and more Criticism.  Belittling maneuvers, based on favoritism, not on work ethics.  Great co-workers, but all stressed out due to management. There was no enjoyable part of this job except when 5:00PM arrived."
bad,"chase is a very stressful place to work the employees are not treated as if they are appreciated, management sucks, benefits have become worst over the years there is no room for growth within the company if you don't know anyone in management already. the pay is not adequate."
bad,"Commission structure changes constantly with no warnings. Incompetent processing and fullfilment teams create delays and makes practically impossible to be competitive against smaller lenders or mortgage brokers. Management team is disorganized and in most cases unavailable when needed. Poor training and poor communication of the changes in industry regulations and internal overlays. "
bad,"Was with JP morgan for three years many things I learned during my stay, but as those where the initial days learned who the banking industries work and who to deal with people around you. My learning at JP has helped me a lot In my current company"
bad,Need more structred in the mortgage operations side of Chase.
bad,"I worked really had with JPMorgan Chase, the level of ethical code was questionable since the first year of employment the stress level and demands were so high that there was a lot of turn over and anger.  However thru reevaluation of middle and upper management came to pass, the atmosphere and environment became a lot more tolerable."
bad,"Chase was a great place to work and gain experience for future job experiences and such. The company makes advancement difficult for current employees and would much rather hire someone off the street with no experience then promote within with someone that already has experience. If one was hired internally to another department that paid more, the internal employee transferring into the position was paid less than an employee being hired off the street. The benefits are terrible, the health care program is brutal and ends up costing the employee more out of pocket then coverage. Balancing work and social life was difficult at times because the mortgage business was booming so everything was based on numbers and not so much your family. Management is questionable and lacks training/professionalism as they would load up their workers under them even if they were caught up and ready to go for the day; they would end up being stuck cleaning up everyone elses work staying hours later than they anticipated. Policy changed on almost a daily basis and we were held responsible for it for work that was completed months prior to the change. Overall, it was a job to gain the experience needed to move onto a better position and a job to get by."
bad,A typical workday would be filled with things you have done wrong and how the company is cutting hours or changing things to save the company money. The company would not pay more than a 3% raise each year which was nothing.
bad,"As the summary says, not a good place to work. The pay was okay, but the commission structure was flawed and management was not helpful at all. Very stressful and cut throat work environment. No job security what so ever, turnover rate was about 60%."
bad,"I wotked for a temp agency which is usually how you are brought in for the lockbox dept."
bad,Good company...job just was not for me. The call center aspect is not for everyone.  I am just not a sedentary person. The hardest part of the job was sitting in the same position for ten hours a day listening to people complain about interest charges.
bad,Chase has some real problems especially in their mortgage loan department.  Very unorganized and management is oblivious to the problems.  They just hide in their offices in Columbus and ignore the problems that are going on in the bank branches and the mortgage department. It can take up to 6 months to close a loan and by then the customers are very angry and upset. The loan officer is left to the wolves to deal with the issues.
bad,My experience at Chase as a top producer is that management constantly pushes employees to work OT to meet production needs yet focuses solely on how coworkers interact rather than work performance. Gender bias is in practice and Sr. management does not monitor Departmental Head Managers unprofessional behavior. Document everything to avoid slander.
bad,"good  company , found  jobs  there  not secure , management  not  knowledgeable , great  co workers"
bad,"Great team members, sub-par management and lacking ethics."
bad,"- changes in policy/procedures on a daily basis"
bad,Worked with customers to provide retail banking products.  The co-workers were great.  Manager was unsure of her skills so this person would micromanage and provide poor leadership.  
bad,"Heartbeat in a seat, never recieved coaching opportunities, always had overtime avaliable, managers were never around to support"
bad,"I worked for chase for close to 2 years at the call center in Arlington, TX. I hated it. Very stressful & the pay was not worth it. We're taught to treat the low income customers like nothing, while the customers with high balance get treated like Kings & Queens. the only thing great about the job were the benefits. The managers were horrible. the only way to move up is if you knew someone. "
bad,"A typical work day at Chase as an personal banker would be determined by customer traffic. Some days were busy; paydays for example, and some days you wouldn't see 5 people. Your success is determined by sitting in front of as many people you can, and basically uncovering everything about there finances within five minutes of meeting them. This required great rapport building in order to gain trust. Upon uncovering, it is your job to get them to bring all of their assets over to Chase including loans, mortgages and investments. You receive compensation for products that you are able to offer; accounts, credit cards, investments,etc."
bad,the chase bank the I worked at had to much favortism and much kiss a___. I had many managers in the years I worked there but the managers I had R N and M can not remember is last name . they were great managers . talk to the people that have had them.
bad,"Typical day starts with a daily team huddle. I learned how to cash flow deals. Management is constantly changing. The co-workers are are great, I loved my team. The hardest part of the job was payout plan. The most enjoyable part was working with the clients directly and managing my schedule."
bad,"The organization is set up in a way that management is always changing. It is easy to advance, even when the employee is not necessarily ready for the new role."
bad,Days went by very quickly (read hectic).
bad,The compensation does not meet the workload and the work/life balance does not exist.
bad,"this company has ""so-called"" values that puts bankers in many ackward situations, training dictates one thing managers dictate another and being ethical goes out of the window just to hit your monthly numbers, pay is great but too much stress, it isnt worth it"
bad,A good company that focuses on customers and increasing revenue while maintaing loyalty.
bad,"Very number oriented company, not much for service. No employee feedback, not a great place to stay."
bad,"Benefits and compensation fluxuate annually as what is ""good' for the Bank - do not care about there employees. Management controls and utilize retribution practices like Chicago Politicans...which they are..beware!"
bad,"Initially, I was excited when I was hired by JP Morgan Chase. It is a nice, large and somewhat stable company in this economy. I was quickly disappointed after only a few weeks. Both management and regular employees don't seem to know what is going on from one moment to the next. We are literally told one thing on Monday morning and by the afternoon it has changed. Several people in my training class were hired for one position but thrown into another position and expected to perform. I felt dejected and insulted by, in my opinion, a demotion in my job. My overall experience so far is not what I expected; however, in this economy I am grateful to have a job that provides solid benefits and a decent, yet slightly below average salary for the market."
bad,"Politics is all.Compensation belowaverage. Managemet is reactive, and hopelessly inept. ? The political climate means experience, and education are moot. Iroutinely saw MBA's passed over while a""popular(not high performer) was promoted. It is management b yintimadation is seen ,as effective and powerful.Belonging to the club"" is prized above all else, Are you good at politics? Are youwilling to dedicate part of each and every day too it? Can you attend EVERY party, wedding, and graduation?"
bad,"Worked in the Active Bankruptcy Dept.  From the start, I knew I could never work there for very long.  Poor Management, terrible supervision, ...tried to stay but couldn't stand it."
bad,"They have a program that allows you to operate as a manager, without manager compensation or stability. It is a rigorous program often flipping around your hours and schedule with little to no warning. After being pushed to the limits and tested harder than most in this program, you are then moved backwards to a customer service agent again with little to no opportunity to actually become management. Used more to fill in when they are short staffed on management, but not treated as one of the management team."
bad,"This job turned out to be an overall bad experience. It caused me to become cynical and untrusting of team leaders and supervisors. They abruptly changed my schedule, giving no options"
bad,"If you know the right people you will do well, but if you try and help the environment get better and you are not one of them, you are just a number and there is no job security. You will work your butt off and there is NO work / balance and minimal compensation."
bad,Ranking is unfair .. managers do the bare minimum and are allowed to get away with just about anything . They have an unfair system and lie about everything .
bad,"The firm wants to be so diverse, they do not always ensure the best and most knowledgeable candidate is hired. Thereby, passing over the best candidate in order to just be diverse."
bad,"Was very stressful, micromanaging and had no job security and low pay. Management never has your back. Its more individual work than collaborative. Unable to move up."
bad,They are not family oriented unless your family is just a pet and they love drama. Like for your to gossip on the team and talk about others downfalls.
bad,"I was struck by how difficult getting used to the Chase culture and how much always being ""on-brand"" and ""available"" would take a toll. The compensation and advancement opportunities could be good, but it's definitely a trade-off."
bad,"Location Location Location "
bad,"The team I worked on is a bit strange, more than hundreds of backlog bugs didn't get fixed, manager and the supposed lead has no clue what is in scope. They assign bug fixes to contractors, if you fix a highly visible bug, manager is not very happy because he would feel embarrassed to not been able to fix it for eight months. So you don't get reward instead get verbal abuse. At least six people work on an application which is supposed to be well understood, but the lead at close end to inform this and that piece is missing, and what they do is to push to contractors, without any more info or support, because no documentation and former workers already left. They have frequent meetings, with manager absent or work from home fix appliances or at training, and other employees remote work for more than a week at other country. Poor team, low skills."
bad,"work independently"
bad,"I was very happy with JPMC my first 10 years.  My contributions were recognized, my employee ratings were high.  When my position was eliminated, I transferred to a different department.  Midway through my 2+ years in this new role, my responsibilities changed and unbeknownst to me, the service model changed and 50% of operations were moving off shore.  I feel my 2018 year end review was not fair and consistent with my performance and was only for justifying my job elimination.  No help from my manager.  JPMC won’t consider me for another position because of this one rating."
bad,Management is horrible at my current branch. Manager over Works employees. Very condescending towards tellers and bankers. Makes work stressful for everyone else working there.
bad,I honestly say I have hated this company since I started. I worked in compliance. There was no structure for learning the position. You have to just learn it as best you can own your own
bad,"Disorganized senior leadership with conflicting goals & objectives. Significant disagreements on priorities and how to define requirements. Based on that failure to execute and change successfully, many folks leave the oppressive environment."
bad,The culture is much like high school so a great place for young people working their first real job because they have nothing to compare it to. For someone who has been in the work place this is not a great fit. You see early on things that shouldn’t be allowed. This job definitely needs a union present!
bad,"Pay was not the best, offered more when leaving...why not pay what you are worth to begin with?  Manager was good. Internal operations support was absolutely THE worst."
bad,"working at Chase credit underwriting was a very challenging position. Very high call volume and decisions were made on the spot. The call center was fairly new and so were the management team. Policy and Procedures were always being changed, then a few months later would go back to the old way."
bad,"Chase is a decent brand name when it comes to big banks but their managers micro manage like no one’s business. Everything, and I mean everything is monitored. They even go in a snoop around your email! All they worry about is graphs and numbers on an excel sheet. Some manages are actual humans and get along great with their team. Others don’t. One of the main reasons someone leaves a company is because of management. Benefits were okay but a bit pricey if you have a family. Most co workers are nice people, but to reiterate from another review, it is very white male and female dominated. Team is not something that is strong either. Internal partners don’t work well with each other. “Not my problem” attitude."
bad,"The environment was quiet and productive overall, favorite part of my job were the customers! Management and DM played favorites, and there was little advancement in my line of work. Good place to start but not enough challenging fulfilled work. Too sales oriented, and phony interactions."
bad,"Firm seeks to save money for big boys and share holders, resulting in jobs leaving overseas.  Do more with less. Medical plans are expensive. Not fun!"
bad,Good for entry level experience. Not good for long term career goals. Jon was wonder from '06 through '12. After 2012 they acquired a lot of business professionals from other companies and they destroyed the family oriented culture.
bad,If you are at a slow branch it will be very difficult to meet their sales goals. They expect you to make calls all day and get appointments from which you are expected to make sales. The majority of the branches are short staff so you will more than likely be asked to do other people's jobs and still meet your own goals. The commission is the best part of working at Chase. It's one of the banks pays better when it comes to commission. But remember commison is taxed at 40%  so you have to be a very good sales person to work here because their base pay is very low.
bad,"If you have no life, go ahead and apply.  You will be worked until you drop.  There is no leadership and everyone is looking out for themselves.  This place is for single people who are willing to work 7 days a week."
bad,"Poorly managed, they like to promote mobility but are not willing to promote from within. They only will allowed lateral move for same salary but more responsibilities. No raises and less than1% bonus. Salaries are below cost of living. They eliminate the jobs but HR cannot answer questions as to the exit process. Packages are at manager discretion"
bad,"Do not work here at least in the auto finance department. Constant change in policy, score card metrics, and management teams makes it difficult to work. Morale got poor around there with in the last year due to the changes and being slammed about metrics, which are out of our control. Poor systems that only work some of the time. Hr Will not have your back if you make a legitimate complaint and will take forever to review your complaints. They used to have really nice holiday celebrations and really appreciate their employees, but it is not that way no more. Co-workers are ok for the most part, but some will lie about you , gossip about you, or make fun of you or your health conditions, sad part is it did not used to be this way. It used to be a great company, but not anymore. They talk about getting to advance and learn other departments, but then there is no action to the words."
bad,An entry level position with little to no room for advancement and an almost constant change in management which leads to extreme turnover issues directly related to new management's desire to promote their own people.
bad,"If you're one of the club members, you're in. Otherwise you can waste you're entire energy and a whole lot of years moving only sideways. Management gets promoted based on how hard they crack the whip. Brains are not required. Neither is the spine. Leave those two at home and you'll be in heaven."
bad,"JPMorgan Chase does not care about American jobs or American workers.  This is a multi-trillion dollar company that has more than enough money to pay American workers, but chooses not to.  They prefer outsourcing to Manila and using unnecessary automation."
bad,"I can't rate JPMC overall because I haven't worked in every LOB within JPMC to be far. However, in my LOB it's very toxic and a lot of threating, bullying, manipulation, and false hope."
bad,"From the time that I started training with this company I was concerned about the leadership. I witnessed the managers gossiping about the trainees, drinking alcohol extensively in front of the trainees and just being belligerent in class. I stuck it out and reported it to the head of our department but witnessed no corrective action. There are employees who report to a direct family member which is supposed to be against company policy. They just don't seem to have it together."
bad,OK Place to work - very busy work environment.  Lots of multi-tasking.  Good team environment.  No day is typical.   Heavy travel domestic and international. Heavy calendaring.
bad,We were constantly short-staffed because so many people walked out or quit. Worked under mandatory 10-15 hours of overtime for months. That made for a very tired and irritable crew.
bad,"JP Morgan in San Francisco was not a pleasant environment to work in.   Upper Management was not supportive, and they treated everyone like they did something wrong.  The moral was about as low as I have ever seen, and would not recommend working there."
bad,"Even the managers encourage work and life balances, however it just stays on paper. The reality is most people are working long hours. and the upper managers only care for themselves. no company loyalty exists."
bad,"my opinion, I had a hard time coping up with work"
bad,I was let go because of the housing crisis and was not att all happy with all of the cuts that were made over and over again. I do have to say that the training was awesome
bad,"This company continually gets grants from the state to hire people but continually lays off. There is no structure to rehire and the atmosphere is one of a ""CLICK"""
bad,"Lowest paying bank in the financial service industry"
bad,Poor Management with no vision or guidance to make 180 degree turns every two years to meet business strategies. Lower level employees were not encouraged to participate in the changes.
bad,I worked for chase for 6 years and I felt singled out and targeted in my last role. I wouldn't recommend the department that I was working in but the company overall is good place to work.
bad,"I entered the corporate banking world after freelancing for 15 yrs, and my experience with working in that environment was absolutely stressful. ;You are only a team asset as long as you maintain perceived value. If you fly under the radar, you can expect to work there for many years, but if your ambitious and fall into the spotlight, your success can cost you your job. Its very common within JPMorgan that other departments or other Silos hostilely take over another department or project, which in many cases such as mine, you are left without a job."
bad,NYC views the Columbus office as incompetent.  There is a large pay disparity between management and line employees.  It's a big company and you can get lost
bad,Nothing good to say about company.  If I have nothing good to say about a company.  I will say nothing.  I sure it has some merit with being one of the largest banks.
bad,It is a very stressful place to work with very poor Job Work/Life Balance. I would not recommend working at Chase unless you have some very strong leads within the company. I was told many times by both management and my fellow co-workers that my job advancement would not depend on what I knew but who I knew. I watched this play out over and over again during my tenure at Chase.
bad,"Poor leadership"
bad,"I’ve learned an endless amount of experience in working at Chase. Unfortunately, the last two years have become very cut throat with the improving economy. That is great for our country, however, default is definitely not the area to work in."
bad,You are only a number at Chase. The main goal in the company is to reach numbers for shareholders and you need to know that going into the position. You can make good money there though.
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job: Collaboration amongst teammates"
bad,They are constantly moving you around to suit their needs.  If you request to move they tell you no because they need you in the position they put you in whether you like it or not.
bad,J P Morgan is a very well reputed Bank. It has several reporting regions which makes a typical day at work very interesting and challenging as there are several stakeholders you report to. The organisation is great in terms of diversity.
bad,"I would come into work around 6am and start working my files.  Other employees would come in, but rarely would people interact with each other.  Management primarily only spoke with each other and only addressed the team when information needed to be relayed.  "
bad,The management team changed to the East coast.  Most jobs were moved to the East.  No opportunity for growth in Arizona for this job.  Compensation is far below average in the area.
bad,Extremely stressful. Constant turnover. Unrealistic sales goals and pressure. No way to communicate upward employee concerns. You accept things as they were are you were asked to leave
bad,"Although JP Morgan provides an abundance of jobs in the area, there is a reason for this, as everyone looks to leave the firm as soon as possible. Once your year is up in your position, I would say at least 70% of the employees look to mover to another area. The availability of open positions is due to employees constantly moving. Most areas are not really concerned with your mobility, even the top performers."
bad,"JP Morgan may be a great company to work for, but my immediate manager was arrogant, unqualified, and lacked any real sense of leadership. My manager was the primary reason I resigned from JP Morgan."
bad,"Compliance can be a rewarding career at JP Morgan Chase, but management is generally disconnected from employee morale and is not reactive to employee work-life needs."
bad,"They pay $10,000 less then other credit card companies  in  the are for the same job. "
bad,"A typical day at work consist of meeting client and providing banking advice. We educate client on the products and services provided by Chase bank. I've learned about retirement and investments. I also learned about presenting client with options that are suitable for the client. The culture at Chase is mixed. One one hand we are preached to embrace our individuality, but forced to wear uniforms with the company logo plastered all over our chest.  However Chase does provide great resources to complete our task."
bad,"It got to the point where I'd get a migraine before almost every shift. They were accommodating to my needing to go to school, but the pay is not enough for the emotionally and mentally draining job. It's very difficult to advance with the type of standards they set for being able to get a different position. Their criteria for performance is also very hypocritical."
bad,"Stressful, long hours, hard work, not great management and very cut throat, it can be fairly sociable. all teams seem to be different depending in what field yo work. Pay is very good but you do have to work hard for it"
bad,"I dont know about other departments, but mine (auto-finance) is very unorganized and stressful.  The managers dont care about you and you are disposable. Not recommending this place to anyone I know that I looking for work."
bad,"A typical day at the Belleville JPMC Lockbox consists of an early start time, absolutely no communication between co-workers, a management team that is only concerned with keeping you quiet and very little else. Calling off even a few times gets you branded as someone to get fired or let go. Management speaks down to and about the contingent workers with little regard, they're seen as disposable. Don't get your hopes up to be hired by JPMC through this job."
bad,"micro management, work culture not diverse. no accountability on managers behalf. parking is far , potential to get robbed due to location of office. A great stepping stone"
bad,Salaries are not the current area averages.  Tends to close offices and out source jobs over seas.  Working environment is pleasant but management is not transparent.
bad,the training was very vague and not to your job description so you were very lost. no one was willing to help you and always seemed cold and annoyed when you did ask for help as a new person. I always felt my every move was being watched as if they wanted a reason to get rid of me and other temp workers. no one really did their job they just put it off onto someone else to work. it was a contract job and I was more than happy when the contract expired.
bad,"Job Stability is very low as they are always looking to cut back, and there is no opportunity for growth/promotion within the company. They do not care about what you know it is more of who you know. There is definitely favoritism more so than other companies that I worked for."
bad,"Management is a joke. Unless you are liked or in the protected class, you are on your own. 3 years there I saw and heard alot.  If you speak up to do the right thing you will be punished."
bad,A reliable job but isn't the best at promoting within or giving raises for all the work that is given to be perform in such a tight time frame. Rather give employees more titles with same pay versus promoting.
bad,Constant Management changes lead to incredible inefficiencies. The firm is way behind the competition and management doesn't seem to care about winning.
bad,"hard to move ahead, internal mobility is not good. some positions are a reasonable work load, some are not as with any large organization. Expect to be pigeonholed and have work piled on you until you are unable to get it all done and then receive a poor rating in your review along with no raise and no bonus."
bad,"Advancement slow"
bad,"I was on the help desk for merchants in Canada for the credit/debit card terminals. the job was terrible, getting help was like pulling teeth and room for advancement was like trying to find a needle in a haystack."
bad,too much is based off seniority instead of actual talent.you can meet some really awesome people. management is so so but when there is too many bad apples it can go bad quick.
bad,Much has been written on the toxic and morally corrupt culture before. The only favourable reviews I see tend to be from those with only limited experience and time with the company and I suspect many are Grad's and Apprentices' who see a more 'sanitised' version of the company whereas I have over 9 years with the company.
bad,"Working for this company has it pitfalls one of the dept, Default serving for more that 5 years, has been a waste of time, with there office politics and favoritism,   let's there most more talented employee's leave,  that has lead to the most negative work experience."
bad,"Started great but moved to the numbers game of 12 minute resolution times and extreme micromanaging."
bad,The longer you work there the less you make. New hires will always start out at more then what the tenured employees are getting paid. The call center can become very stressful and you must be able to take customers insults like a grain of salt. Customers can be very mean when it comes to money.
bad,"• Review client credit score and history"
bad,"I've researched and talked with numerous individuals in the JP Morgan and Chase sides of the company.  Opportunities within the ""one company"" are not available with full access for both sectors employees.  I was even informed by a hiring manager that she had no idea that internal openings and career development programs like internships were not being provided to employees in consumer banking(Chase), that meet all the requirements for the programs."
bad,I would take incoming calls from clients purchasing a new vehicle. I would make sure all stipulations were met before setting customers paperwork up in a branch or by mail
bad,JP Morgan is a great company that enjoys a corporate structure and potential longevity. There are various positions available at all times and something for everyone.
bad,"Poor communication and management skills. You have managers standing over you talking, having temper trantrums on employees. No respect for one another."
bad,"Chase is and has always been a very tough environment to work in. Long hours, no accountability and constant fear of layoffs make this a very challenging climate."
bad,"Maintain high security, confidential, accuracy, professional , quiet, responsible, data entry over 3,000 customer edit per day. Dependable, edits accounts, proficient 10-key strokes, etc."
bad,"business needs are the most important part, no open doors policy, no balance of business and family, 0.0 opportunity to grow, no competitive salaries."
bad,Always busy and never recognized for achievements. Only criticized for failures. Long hours and expected to do 6 peoples jobs
bad,"Heavy mid- senior management turn-over in technology caused by an attitude of hire from the outside than promote within.  Department CTOs lifespan is just a few years and when a new one comes in, the first step is to remove their first and second level of management, with 'friends & family'.  If you are not part of the that clique, expect poor reviews, bonuses, and ultimately elimination. This causes poor deliverables, decreased productivity, and a management outlook on the next job verses providing good client support "
bad,"They pay great but there is ""0"" work life balance. Management should focus on their employees and employee satisfaction. Layoffs are frequent."
bad,Not really a place where you can advance. Worked at the lockbox center in Charlotte NC. Treated like elementary school kids.
bad,"If you don't mind working 60 hours a week, this jobs for you. Great staffs just not enough staff. You will learn alot about customer service and employee development."
bad,"Really short breaks and no place for advancement in the company, no pay as job given to process. no parking space . really bad management of people and no help to move up in the company ."
bad,Worked for this bank for 12 years and when my performance started to suffer due to depression I was let go and denied unemployment.  This company clearly doesn't  take certain aspects of your life into consideration nor do they value your loyalty.  The coworkers were great unless they were good friends with management.
bad,"If you are looking for a stable environment in the financial industry, this is the place to go. If you are looking for meritocracy, you might want to try elsewhere as priority is given much to the race spelt in the subject header."
bad,"No comments other than environment can be stressful and demanding, high expectations for minimal pay.  No additional comments to add at this time..."
bad,Chase has great benefits and strive to please customers but lack that same drive when it comes to their employees! There is not a real opportunity for advancement even though there are so many areas to advance in.
bad,"This was not the worst place I've worked, but the hours were horrible, and the lack of opportunity for advancement was horrible, there are agents who have been in the same area for 10-20 years without chance at advancing. The pay they offer is a slap in the face, and not worth the time or effort unless your desperate for a job. Management lagged with their responsibility to effectively support their staff."
bad,"I have been with the company for over 13 years. The pay is excellent, however the culture is very negative. Manage by fear was is the motto of this company. My co-workers are the only things that make the job tolerable. Looking for a better opportunity with an upbeat culture and with the possibility of advancement based on performance."
bad,"bad management, bad pay, owner is never there and wants you to do everything without training. yells and doesnt have a system, everything is done and figured out on a daily basis."
bad,Compensation is lacking compared to the competitor's. No flexibility after paid time off is used; absenteeism is grounds for dismissal.
bad,Helped me gain some experience to move on to the my next better opportunity but this is not a place you want to work long term.  They don't care about the well being of their employees or their clients...just whatever it takes to boost the bottom line.
bad,"Chase claims to be an understanding and family-oriented employer. However, they are not. Their attendance policies are only convenient for them as employers, and unfair to the phone specialists. Sick time is provided, however any employee working on the phones will be punished for using it per their policies for sick time usage.  It is not as simple to advance in the company. A hard working employee can put their heart and soul into everything they do for Chase (i.e., daily job, projects, extra curricular, volunteering, etc.), but when they apply for an internal, lateral position, it's unlikely they'll be promoted. "
bad,"fun place to work. management is supportive of the ones they like, decent amount of red tape and politics, best part of the job was working along side colleagues"
bad,"After about 10+ years with this company, I'm beginning to think the cons outweigh the pros.  The benefits are great and there are several mobility opportunities but the somewhat negative culture seems to permeate throughout the organization.  There also seems to be a trend across lines of business (especially within the Technology towers) of Sr. managers not really knowing what they're doing and clearly having obtained their positions more through their networking contacts vs. actual ability and having worked their way into the positions they hold."
bad,All of my customer service skills are what they are today thanks to working here and having to challenge myself to think outside the box to help customers
bad,Networking is crucial if you are looking for a carrer. Work with you manager or seek a mentor to assist you with your carrer goals.
bad,Chase has become a horrible work place with zero possibilities of moving up the ladder. Teller are no longer needed so dont even apply for a teller position. They depend on technology to do all the work.
bad,The department I was in was highly unorganized and unfairly managed. Who you knew and your popularity was valued more than diligence and honesty.
bad,A typical day at work was to ensure that customers were contacted in order to setup repayment schedules for delinquent credit card payments. I learned the various programs that were there to assists customers in order to get there lives back on track financially.
bad,"Excessive procedures and systems, in comparison to other private banks, as well as lots of unproductive time spent reading hundreds of unnecessary emails in unorganized mailing lists every day as well as mandatory participation in unnecessary meetings that serve no useful purpose each week. Many hours of mandatory internal online training every month also rob productivity. In my 15 years in banking, I have never seen such an organization."
bad,They train well and make sure you have some knowledge. It's not relaxed. Management has crazy expectations of how to handle phone calls. Your basically trained on how to get customers very upset by inconveniencing them and then try to de-escalate calls. I always left work feeling very stressed.
bad,"Managers threaten in order to get you to meet expectations. I had 2 days of training, and HR knew I had no Mortgage Operations Experience."
bad,The training program I would say is great.  My manager lied to me in the beginning.  Before I transferred my U4 over I was told I would get a promising branch and  as soon as I signed the papers they changed it to different low class branches.  Stay away from this Company.  Bunch of liars.  Very dis heartened from this company.  They don't pay well either.  I should have taken them to court.
bad,"I moved to this company because it had international presence and was told there was lots of room for growth and advancement."
bad,"JPMorgan Chase is a very large Financial institution with employees worldwide. I worked in Columbus OH in IT.  The company had over 10,000 employees at that location. JPMChase's facilities were top notch with an on-sight Starbucks, a dry cleaners and two large cafeterias. The company brags about upward mobility, however, management execution of helping the employees with career changes is not executed very well,"
bad,Chase is in the process of off shoring the QA department I work for
bad,"•	Built relationships proactively with customers in person and by phone and provided them with products and services to meet their changing financial needs"
bad,The job is pretty mindless and I would like to be challenged more to problem solve.
bad,Prior to the J.P. Morgan and Washington Mutual merge this (Washington Mutual) was a great company with great opportunities for growth but now it sucks! The company is expanding too fast and the policies are starting to suck...management sucks as well and they don't know what they are doing...seeking other employment.
bad,"When I first started with Chase I had great group of managers and support staff, unfortunately our district manager decided that change was a good thing.  I have seen 7 different bankers come in and out of my location alone in the past 2 years.  This influences branch moral and makes it increasingly difficult to successfully do our jobs. The right manager makes all the difference. They have also continually raised expectations and lowered incentives."
bad,"a typical day at work - busy with BAU"
bad,Not very supportive & rewarding working environment with too much politics.
bad,A typical day as a Mortgage Banker at Chase has changed a lot over the past year. The industry is changing and regulations are making refinancing of properties more difficult than ever before. Most top tier customers have already taken advantage of historical low interest rates. My day consists of taking phone calls from inbound warm leads and cold calling outbound leads to originate new mortgage loans. In between calls I am responding to customer and operation emails as well as making sure there are no outstanding documents needed from the customer in order to complete the transaction. I have learned how to sell benefit to customer as well as customizing specific products to fit the consumer needs. With guidelines constantly changing I have also learned that one person cannot know everything and there is nothing wrong with leaning on teammates for answers as well as assisting them when they have questions as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with constantly changing federal regulations. Eligibility requirements can change at a moments notice and I must be prepared to adapt on the fly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. I love my teammates and they make coming to the work enjoyable.
bad,a typical day at work with inconsistent guidelines and work ethic. As well as difficult management.
bad,"The work is such that you will have no life. It requires 14-15 hours of work, on maximum number of days, if not all, especially the Mumbai location. "
bad,"hierarchical, jump through a lot of hoops to get job done. a lot of resources at your disposal."
bad,"During both the training and while on-the job learning materials were outdated. Majority of new policies and procedures were not taught but exposed with peer to peer experience. Management was never available to coach and team meetings were often cancelled. In the three years working with the Chase I had 5 different managers, to which none was helpful. Management often micromanaged employees without recognition regardless of stat rate or awards granted and, played favoritism to their buddies. It was also impossible to request time off even if you had the allotted hours for vacation, sick, etc. It was my paycheck and co-workers that got me through day to day. During the process I saw many good hard working people leave. I could go on and on with details... Instead save yourself the time and trouble in working for a company that does that not support their employees."
bad,Worked with some great colleagues and established lifelong networks even with a very unstable and disorganized department.
bad,"A work day is hectic and there is no downtime at all."
bad,great pay. management was too naïve and not understanding of the needs of the team. Wasn't a good motivator nor did the management care for his employees. looked to much at numbers and charts.
bad,Very relaxed environment but can become boring and repetitive.
bad,What I learned was I should have taken a different job. I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,I learned a great deal about team work. I enjoyed the dynamic and fast paced environment. My typical day consisted of juggling multiple tasks and various groups in need of constant information updates. 
bad,"•Refer files to outside council for Motion for Relief"
bad,Chase claims room for growth and opportunities to advance but it is all a gimmick. It all depends on who you know to get you up the ladder and not how hard you work.
bad,"it was good while it lasted - they laid us off and did not call us back, parking downtown stinks but everything els was ok"
bad,Collection on credits cards
bad, Customer Service
bad,System always crashes and its slow and does not always work properly when it is not crashing.
bad,Hectic work.
bad,"The best thing about working as a banker for Chase is the customers I have gotten to know and build relationships with. The company is very numbers based instead of people-based when it comes to its employees. They pay based on production of its bankers, but at the same time stress customer service as its most important goal. While I was providing top quality customer service, I was never getting paid like those bankers were in Manhattan. I learned how to speak and build a connection with many diferent types of people with differing background, beliefs, and economic standings."
bad,"I was employed by JPMorgan Chase right after the merger with Bank One at their Polaris headquarters in Columbus, OH. To state that the purchasing department, let alone the whole company, was a mess is an understatement. Turf wars, culture clashes, little to no managerial direction were the orders of the day. To this day I still don't know why they hired me or what it was that I should have been doing. What I was told that I was being hired on for was to help merge the 2 seperate purchasing departments into 1 cohesive unit. I was never allowed to do this because their was really no one in charge to give direction on exactly how it was that this was to be accomplished. It was basically figure it out for yourself which is fine except there were 3 other people with the same job title and mandate as I had. Again, this is Ok if someone was given the resposnibility to lead so we all were on the same page. No such person existed and that pretty much left the 4 of us to fend for ourselves. If you have read Lord of the Flies then you can figure out what did and more importantly, what didn't happen. It was not a pretty picture. The staff had no idea who to listen to nor which direction to go in so they pretty much did what they always did meaning the former Bank One employees continued to function as if they were working for Bank One and the JPM people (who looked down their noses at the Bank One people) did whatever they had always done. Non-functional doesn't even begin to describe it. Talking to employees from other areas of the bank it was pretty much the same story. Now this was 7"
bad,"Chase wasn't a bad place to work. The pay was ok for part time, but the home work balance isn't that great. Also management wasn't that great where I was located."
bad,"I worked at JPMC for 5.5 years in call center. Managers have their favs, if you're not one of them better be careful. Difficult to get time off approved. Seniority means nothing, good work means nothing. Management will defend a horrible customer before defending their own."
bad,Working at Chase was a good customer service learning experience. I had some opportunities for forward moving in the company. There were also numerous times to be able to change your schedule.
bad,Much is needed from the top down for changes to take place. Management unwilling to become examples for leadership behaviors that exemplify the mission and vision of the organization. Many bullies for leaders with HR's awareness and blessings. The culture must change in order to reveal the true potential and strength of the organization.
bad,I worked at chase for 12 years and was impressed at how well they covered up theirs mistakes. They always blamed everyone else and never looked themselves in the mirror. The time that made changes were Always too late
bad,"Great pay and benefits but has corrupt upper management that acts with impunity.  HR does not discipline managers for wrongdoing and the culture is rife with retaliation.  "
bad,... but they take all they can get out of you 8n return.  Most managers have extremely poor skills in terms of leadership and dont really care about their employees
bad,Empty promises were made. 5 % match does not start until the end of year 2. I was not disclosed compensation changes after being promoted. I was lied to about a raise.
bad,"the group that hired me was being downsized almost from the moment they hired me. redundancy with other groups, unclear responsibilities, rube goldberg-like bunch of systems being cobbled together... just too wooley."
bad,"poor management , limited growth opportunities, very political.  However, ot based more in the team leader vs the organization as a whole. People often over busy with the work below thier professional level"
bad,I found the job in a call center very taxing and unrewarding for one hoping to advance in both salary and opportunity.  The job was as a cog in a wheel with many more cogs ready to replace you.
bad,promotion is based on popularity and is management likes you not really based on merits i like the benefits given to the employees salary is low compared to similar companies
bad,"A company who puts their customer above all others, geared towards the bottom line, invested in producing more opportunities for the firm and its partners/investors, and making more money each growing year."
bad,If you want to move up make sure to focus your energy on kissing up to your manager and district manager. By doing so they’ll overlook your numbers and flaws and consider you promotion material
bad,Not enough time for training will go on the floor confused. They really dont like when you ask for help. Management is not that great or director. Very depressing work environment. Then could get fired for doing something wrong. Customer will curse you out and degrade you and you will have to tolerate it. No schedule flexibility but pay is great and good benefits.
bad,Was their a short time so its hard to really give a review of this company. But the other employees I was hired on with are a good bunch of people who were fun to work with.
bad,There was no where for growth. It was a day in day out boring experience. The leaders and supervisors were not friendly or inviting. Not the best job I've had.
bad,Very diverse environment with a lot of learning ability with the appropriate trainers. Depending on your culture you can go far with chase Or nowhere at all.
bad,"Exception Processing"
bad,Jp Morgan Chase has great benefits for part time employees. High pressure for very little pay and defently very stressful. Upper management not very proactive
bad,"Understaffing seems to be a common theme at the branches. If you can handle cold calling customers and lines out the door, it gives you the opportunity to earn as much as you want with bonuses."
bad,"No work life balance and if you don’t look the part of what Chase Bank wants they find a way to fire you.  You are treated as guilty until you prove your innocence.  HR will call and try to put words into your mouth before you write your statement.  DM tells you to loose weight behind a closed door, and when you report it, you suddenly start getting investigated.  Even when you work all over for them and put in way more hours than required on salary.  Training program was good, but upper management and HR were crooked."
bad,Your not rewarded by your work.  People are given promotions based upon who they know.  Employees are “targeted” for lay-off if they have ever been on STD.
bad,Not the best place to work for in terms of management. Not honest and fair to the employees. Too much BS and favorites that there is no leader and lots of favorites rather than creating team  work.
bad,"Change is inevitable but the workplace culture has shifted for the worse and created a toxic work environment. The people are generally friendly, but it's an environment that never makes you feel like you are doing enough or will ever do well."
bad,"Before starting at Chase I worked for a company that allowed individuality, a very relaxed dress code and really thrived on the employees being able to do whatever was necessary (with in reason of course) to help the customer base. They had a very fun culture that was work hard but play hard too. And, the employees weren't chained (practically) to their desks. My experience at Chase was the exact opposite. And, try as I might I was never really comfortable working there. Everything from the dress code (which is business casual so, really not bad) to the way you were forced to interact with the customer, was a difficult adjustment for me. If you are someone who either likes or, at least doesn't mind following all policy and procedure to the letter without any variance even though there may be a different way to go about it; don't mind asking permission to do just about everything, and don't mind short breaks/lunch with a tedious work load then Chase is a okay place to work."
bad,"Work balance, culture, and a lot of micro management.  Expect a lot from workers base salary not good and you are capped on what you could make so you could not make as  much they say."
bad,"I worked for Chase a few weeks in training. Right from the door I saw the favoritism and lack of professionalism. The trainer had a personal issue with me no matter how professional and pleasant I was. You have to go through a panel process in order to keep the job which was misleading consider the trainer called out a lot of days and left no direction for the SMES left to run the class. I have to say they did a better job than her and was fair  to everyone. "
bad,"Let's play a game - who is your boss today?  "
bad,"Regulatory fines are regarded as a normal cost of doing business."
bad,JP Morgan Chase is decent company. I wouldn't recommend them unless you plan to stay in the financial industry for the rest of your career. Great benefits but terrible pay and career advancement.
bad,Chase is over all good to work for to gain entry level experience. One will need to gain outside work knowledge to advance into different lines of business.
bad,My job description was to recruit and build my area which ran from Lewis County to Pierce County.  A lot of interviewing and job offers.  Workplace culture was very fast pace.  I enjoyed the staff that I was able to recruit.
bad,All companies are good companies but it all depends on who you work for. I was in the retail banking so they try to squeeze everything out of you. Smart bank but not the best place to work for
bad,"Unless you are a manager or a higher up, in general, you have no future here and no stability. If you are a teller or banker this job should be looked at as temporary. The hours are ridiculous and you do not get paid for half of what you do. I loved my branch and location because of my coworkers and community, if not for that I wouldn't have stayed a month."
bad,My days were very monotonous.  I didn't receive much help from leadership and whenever I did ask for help I was made to feel stupid.  I have been successful at many mortgage sales positions but not so much chase.
bad,"-Expected to close 16 tickets a day"
bad,It was a great place to work until new management came in then everything went downhill from there....................................................
bad,"I am just a contractor, not sure why I have to fill out this section of the form, I worked there yes, its a good environment yes, the people are good yes"
bad,"Chase is not a company I would advise somebody to go work for, they pay rate is the lowest for employees that been there for a long time, new hires make more money than employees for years."
bad,"JP Morgan Chase does not believe in providing employees pay increases. They will only pay out bonuses. Additionally, JPMC is a very bureaucratic organization."
bad,"Good environment.  Nice coworkers Fair pay Good Benefits Long hours Weekends.      would return in a different role Good systems "
bad,"Some of the people were nice, but I found that most people were racist, as a contract worker they don't treat you very nicely. My last project was in IB and I had to record everything I did and give time spent working on something."
bad,JPMorgan chase is a good company to work for but the base salaries are very low.  Therefore you are stressed to sell products and put up numbers.  And one upset client can kill your incentives with a bad rating.  It's an unfair situation especially when you go out of your way and do things right.
bad,Working for this company was terrible. The employees did not work together instead were cut throat. I appreciate the opportunity but will not recommend this job.
bad,it is a diverse place to work at where you will find people from all the parts of the world. but at the same time it leads in grouping of people from same origins.
bad,"I wa previous with washington mutual before the buyout from chase. once their people came in and took over, people were getting laid off or let go cause they no longer needed us"
bad,Core-Philosophy driven. Team-focused with an emphasis on quality and performance. Attention to word-economic challenges and outsourcing opportunities.
bad,"They have a rating system... Every department has to have a LOW Meets, whether or not there is one.  So they pick someone and manage them out.  HORRIBLE"
bad,Didn't work for too long. Not so great compensation. Too much of politics. Slogging. Couldn't spend a long time here. Brand name works otherwise there's nothing special about this company
bad,"I was a Business Card Credit Analyst who worked in ""The Warehouse"" in Wilmington DE.  It was a converted garage with obnoxious ventilation, heating and lighting issues. What do you store in a warehouse? "
bad,It was good to understand how to navigate in such a big company with a set hierarchy and lots of functions and projects. Better place to work after experience.
bad,strict and too many conflicts of interest with personal life.  Work life experience is not there and schedule is always changing... Having licenses with Chase means you aren't able to manage your own finances as needed.
bad,"The pay and benefits (including 3 weeks of paid vacation time) were outstanding; however, the expectation that ""mistakes cannot be made"" leads to a huge turnover rate. You are scored on metrics you have little to no control over. If you value job security, look elsewhere. You are just ""a body to man the phones"" here and they have no problem replacing you."
bad,"What was once a productive, well managed environment shifted to a factory-like setting with micro-management by inexperience managers.  Employee turnover rate in the past two years was high especially in technology.  Full time staff was replaced with consultants.   There was no respect for employees at any level, and especially for those that gave many years of commendable service.  Many were pushed to retire, quit, or transfer to another area of the firm. No advancement for staff that had tenor and a solid work performance in the area."
bad,Everyday was extremely busy and not enough staff to help with the customer needs. Too much is expected of the employees and the compensation does not make up for the demands.
bad,"The expectation is that you manage several projects concurrently of varying complexity for multiple clients with the project process and lifecycle conducted either via telepresence or in person within the structure of a project log. I would say that this can be a good thing for personal development and exposure but personal targets and work assigned can lead to a very siloed, individual approach to the workload and too little emphasis being placed on a team ethos. In my experience on occasion some individual managers only appear to be concerned or take an interest when issues arise so that they can deflect issues or criticism raised onto another team. The best aspect of the job is the client approval and the associated sense of satisfaction you get on the successful implementation of an assigned piece of work."
bad,"Nepotism is rife in this company so don't even bother with results. Their goal is to get you in at the lowest possible price point, work you hard and then expect you to leave after a few years when you're burnt out. That being said, Chase does look good on the Resume, but it's still not worth it."
bad,"A company that continues to do more with less regardless of how well the firm does."
bad,Losing staff with no replacements made me work 6 days per week close to 60 hours every week with no acknowledgement for a job well done.   Never felt appreciated by management.
bad,"This is a dead end career. So many young people don't ever enter banks because of ATMs, and apps.Its an uphill climb when the only people who walk in are regular customers who are maxed out on services."
bad,Management was always changing.  They expected you to do things that were not required of you. Was not willing to change work schedule for you to do things for your family.
bad,When needing managers there are never around always in meetings when asking for help managers are really rude rarely helps. Company needs to hire new managers because the ones they have now do not care about their team members
bad,"I would not recommend working for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s Private Bank as an analyst in any capacity. Senior management does not care about the employees starting off their careers. As an entry level analyst, you will normally work 12 hour days minimum and be verbally berated on a daily basis. For example, I would be at my seat at 6am and often leave around 8pm.  If you are a person that can handle a toxic work environment, little work life balance and an unsupportive management team, then this role may suit you well."
bad,my manager at the time did not have good communicator and not a leader just a boss. Christine Hill my next AVP she did a great job helping developing my skills
bad,The work experience at JP Morgan for the most part has been an enjoyable experience.  The culture is diverse.  The management staff has made for a cohesive work environment.  A typical work day is very fast paced and demanding.  Overall working at JP Morgan has been a great experience.
bad,"Chase is a negative work environment."
bad,"overall good company, nice work place,  supervisor over micro managed , team goals met with good hard working team , location was great , overall nice place to work"
bad,"They like to promote from outside the company, to people that have 0 knowledge on the field. They end up hiring their friends instead. Forget about meeting metrics, they just write you a bad review and toss you like an old bag."
bad,"I enjoy a fast paced environment and this job did not offer that. Way too political, and too much standing around. Nothing was ever really accomplished."
bad,"competitive and cut throat work place. Many managers are not focused on coaching employees, nor helping improve experience for employees as well as for customers. Work here as a a last resort."
bad,JPMorgan Chase was a fair job to work for fun environment nice facilities opportunity to meet new great people also opportunities for advancement bonus opportunity somewhat competitive pay
bad,We were the liasons between the under writers and the customers applying for loans on their homes or co-ops.  It was very fast paced and very intricate as there was certain paperwork that was needed as soon as possible in order for the loan to be approved .
bad,"* Very aggressive deadlines for every project"
bad,Jp Morgan is a good employer except sometimes they expect some pèople to work very long hours so the work life balance is not great. some people dont see famioy enough
bad,Poor managment. Office politics. They will tell you that you need to be transferred to another LOB because of business decision(talent reassignment) and will not help you get another job on other LOB.
bad,"I was only there for a short time as a contractor, the salary was low,"
bad,"Every time the Supervisors came into the office from out of town was it was to layoff team members. This happened 3 times in 2017. We were told we were looked as just numbers by our Executive Director, this has proven to be true. Most team members have a different job title each year due to having to look for a new job since their last position was eliminated or outsourced."
bad,This job was collecting of past due vehicle loans.  We were a third party loan servicing company.  The job was in a calling center environment.  It was a stressful job at times.
bad,Take the headline with a grain of salt..remember you're not on Wall Street..YOURE IN A RETAIL keyword RETAIL environment. You do learn a lot on the fly.
bad,"Management operates with the thought process of we are beholden to the shareholders and nothing but the bottom line ever matters.  "
bad,"There are a lot of good people there. However, the executive leadership is all about the bottom line. It can be a very stressful and cut-throat environment. Culture can be toxic depending on your team. I was in operations. Layoffs year after year, executives who come in with no knowledge of the line of business they are in, and they only focus on how to get more productivity out of each person. I would not recommend Chase."
bad,"management made decisions based solely on benefits of the company, they only talk the talk, not walk the walk.  employees are disposable and not treated as valuable assets."
bad,"layoffs every quarter and high stress level, environemnt is hit and miss depending on what dept you work in. No job security and depending on the day you may layed off."
bad,Not a good place to work for your self esteem or to bolster your feelings of competency. Management does not have the time to focus on team building or training.
bad,"Great way to learn the business, but terrible if you have aspirations of having a life that doesn't revolve around work. It's a true call center job, so you're married to your desk and phone."
bad,"Meetings with various remote teams and Software Development"
bad,JPMorgan Chase was undergoing a lot of changes.  I had three different managers in the span of 18 months.  The team lacked a vision and the pay was extremely low.  No room for growth.
bad,My manager at JP Morgan Chase was a complete nut. I left after just one month. But the atmosphere there seemed ok. I would go back if I was offered another assignment there.
bad,"Culture is changing, margins in banking getting tighter, doing more with less (and more junior) employees. Not a bad place to start a career, but limited growth as you get more senior. This is true with many financial services companies."
bad,"Be on time, keep every time off, leave, sick time on note. Managers leaving back an forth. Computer savy is a plus old computers and broken..........."
bad,"My Current manger does not have the skill set to be in his position, as a result his decisions have made working harder as he micro-manage everything."
bad,"I am unhappy with its work culture as well as management who hardly knows or bother to know anything, But good part is, it's tests set by j.p.morgan as an organisations as well as events are good."
bad,Great technology. Great products. Poor management.  Zero work life balance.  Cost cutting and culture that was detrimental to a happy work environment.
bad,"If you are looking for a part-time job and you need to get your foot in for experience, this may be a good start. The compensation is poor and commissions declined significantly over time. You must follow scripts and processes set up by corporate and upper management. Feedback and innovative ideas on how to get things done are not welcome much."
bad,The security side of JPMS has been taken over by the bank.  I would not recommend this company to a potential financial advisor or any supporting role.
bad,There is not really any work life balance. The salary is low though the incentives are really good. However you could be stuck in the same postion for years without advancement.
bad,"I did temp work here. I have never seen a company dispose of good people as this one. It is a constant dismantle of departments and moving people around. I had a good experience as a temp, but not an environment I would choose to stay in."
bad,Used to be great.   Culture has changed.   2 Trillion dollar company preaches work life balance but does not exist.  Still very proud to have accomplished so much there.
bad,"Overall a good company to work for. Holidays etc. I had the pleasure of meeting a lot of new people that we very friendly. The location was not too far from my home at the time,"
bad,My direct manager is very good. Everyone above them is out of touch with the position and treats everyone like they are expendable. They don't pay enough in the positive and mobility to other departments is sometimes blocked by managers. Can't speak for all departments but this one is set up for failure and has a poor culture.
bad,A generous company but they want their pound of flesh. Work culture is very London-like. Good canteens and tennis courts on-site. Job security is an issue.
bad,"The company offers competitive salaries and benefits, but at a huge cost. It is very hard to progress in the company when the Managing Directors or Executive Directors who approve promotions and bonuses are based in the US."
bad,The work place culture left a little something to be desired. The hours of operation were not compatible with the pay rate. The management was often unprofessional and the HR was company based so many of the HR representatives and  management were long time associates and friends. Over all I would have to say that this was the least professional financial institution that I have been employed with.
bad,Basically they provide survival work to an army of data entry people.  The management was clannish and could be overbearing.  There were a lot of arbitrary rules.
bad,"sales practices and micro management is insane, cold outbound calls weekly and the product of what JPM is offering is raked with fees and serves very little purpose for the client, hard to sale to even a dumb investor"
bad,"JPMC is okay for some departments but other departments are very toxic. During my time there, job/work life balance was in a bad shape. Management was shaky and very strict."
bad,It's fine for anyone looking for quick work to do to pay bills until something better comes along. It's up to the individual to decide for his/herself.
bad,"As a temporary employee I've enjoyed the experience of working in a business casual work environment. But when you have a company that is the product of what happen when you have the left hand who don't know what the right hand doing because that hand is on a blind person who's leading another blind person; then you got a serious problem with your company. "
bad,"Job work balance is not good.  A lot is expected. Overtime was expected, however, they would only offer 5 hours a week, but expected 10 - 15 hours of additional work each week."
bad,"There was no direction or sense of urgency. New employees felt lost in the shuffle. Once acclimated, I realized that tenured employees were equally uninformed and insecure."
bad,management does not help if you need there assistance you are pretty much on your own. the co workers are friendly and help as much as they can. I don't recommend working from this company
bad,"Typical Corporate American Finance Environment. "
bad,"Their presence in India is huge and bifurcated into various departments."
bad,"Since it is a large company you have long hours, salary increases are far between. Benefits are good compare to other companies. Job security and advancement are low."
bad,"Too focused on cutting costs, resulting in short term quick wins that are eroding depth and talent. Difficult to have ""work / life"" balance. Mobility at senior levels is difficult in middle or back office support areas."
bad,"Answer credit card customer phone calls, assist with identifying customer needs and providing feature of their credit cards."
bad,Meet very interesting people  loved working in safe deposit spent 16 years there and was on the board of safe deposit assoc for Illinois learned a lot about the legality after death
bad,"changing atmosphere,does not trade and carry product mix that at one time was available. concentrated more on collection of managed money and did not give you the freedom to create A FINANCIAL PLAN TO FIT AN INDIVIDUAL"
bad,"Typical day at work: "
bad,"I have heard wonderful things about other Chase branches but the one I worked at was awful.  I was criticized for the clothing I wore, which was given to me by them.  Other students would study at their stations but if you are reading an actual book it's not cool.  Just wasn't the place for me, not enough motivation."
bad,"A co worker who worked for the bank for over 30 years was treated with disrespect and was given every opportunity to fail so that she can be fired.   The expectations to make commissions or incentives at the end of the year are almost impossible unless you are in New York City, but they sell you upfront that your possibility to meet incentives are those that bankers in New York City or in an affluent market can meet.   They only want affluent customers and do not care about the small rural communities.   For Spanish speaking individuals they will put you in South Tucson to generate business or Spanish speaking customers where it takes 3 times the work to  close a loan and most likely there will not be a a Spanish speaking processor who can help."
bad,It really comes down to who your manager is. If they have drank the koolaid and is a robot it's gonna be a nightmare. But if they are a normal person with reasonable goals it will be a much better work place.
bad,This job is so laid back. I enjoyed working there and meeting the people that work there.... It's really hard to get on permanently there and their benefits suck before hired on.
bad,"Overall it isn't a very pleasant place to work. Too many people and the company infastructure which might appear organized to the outsider, is very scattered."
bad,"•	Responsible for the administration and daily operation of the bank."
bad,Work life balance does not seem to be taken into consideration.  Hours are erratic and expectations are unrealistic.  Not much room for advancement without a degree
bad,i wouldnt go back i think it was a great stepping ladder but not a environment i would like to grow in and not very stable to wear i had to work worrying if i will be here tomorrow. The hardest part of being in this job field at chase was feeling secure
bad,"This company is very innovative. And as I once enjoyed working for them, I feel that my talents are not appreciated. Lots of politics."
bad,Not a bad place to learn about how corporate thinks and treats retail in the field employees. All in all not for everyone.
bad,"At first, I thought working at chase would be the best thing that ever happened to me, ironically it was the exact opposite. The management of chase could really care less about their employees. "
bad,"I didn't enjoy the experience. I was sexually harassed by investors as well as employees. I also learned a lot while maintaining a ""simple"" position."
bad,"It's a zoo! Too many chiefs not enough foot soldiers. First experience in the corporate world, too many inflated chests huffing hot air."
bad,"there is no room for advancement, no balance of work to life, management is inconsistant, there have been recent cutbacks of employee's"
bad,Overworked with little to no appreciation.Culture is very numbers driven with no consideration for the actual material being demanded.
bad,The people are great to work with.  I learned to work on different machines that I did not know about. The shifts are okay. Had to work on the weekends.
bad,"I resigned because I felt like I was just a number. Even after being one of few consist top performers. There was constant change and inconveniences to the employees. No recognition from managers, instead, we had to recognize our peers that he competing against for a bonus."
bad,"My employment at JP Morgan Chase was only a temporary position, in response to mortgage crisis; therefore I cannot give a review from an employee standpoint.  Working as  temporary employee was satisfactory experience, the hourly pay rate was good."
bad,If you have thin skin Chase bank may not be for you. They are very demanding and do not care about a work life balance. Managers have a very unrealistic view of the hours you're supposed to work. It is a company that will train you better then any other financial firm out there. They have the best products and by far the best technology. However I think it's time Chase puts some money in base salaries and employees. Always losing great employees to other companies because of low base salaries and lack of work/home balance.
bad,"I was employed for 35 years with JPMorgan.  31 good years and 34 very stressful years.  "
bad,"Still trying to get the kinks out! Systems are put in place and were not ready, testing issues were not found or will not be corrected any time soon."
bad,Sr Management turnover was great.  There 5 years had 6 different Senior Managers in department.   VP level was inadequate.  Human Resource manager a nightmare.
bad,"Too many changes in organizational messaging. Focuses change on a weekly basis. Heavily pushing customers to digitally adopt systems and products to take them out of the branch, however make the bankers outbound call these same customers to invite them back in the branch. Only care about affluent clients with higher balances. Spend lots of time commending how much technology improvements they make but in reality that same technology does not perform its basic functions adequately. Back office support is very spotty with information, most of the time gives incorrect answers to policy questions. Upper management makes poor decisions when it comes to promotions and general branch operations. Slowly making branch staffing scarce which makes day to day functions near impossible to complete. Branch employees do the best they can with what they have daily, but to other management appears that they get nothing done. They are lucky that branches stay open and employees do not walk out. No yearly salary increases, with ever diminishing ""incentive"" payouts making it harder to reach bonuses monthly. Needing to produce more for less payout. Not a competitive salary in surrounding industry."
bad,"The work culture is not nice and it does not motivate you to perform better though they offer other type of facilties like transport and food,"
bad,"Good company to work for but due to automation my Assistant Manger position was eliminated company wide."
bad,"Working at Chase has been a slow slide downhill for my morale and happiness.  The people that have come in to the organization in the last 3-5 years have consistently brought in people with less knowledge than the staff already in the teams and ignored the direction of the experts for Managing by the current industry trends.  Developers are brought in to be widgets, easily replaceable."
bad,"No proper training was given to be successful in this role."
bad,"The job didn't have mobility and was not very interesting.  Decent pay and hours, but this varied.  Good benefits and ok people."
bad,"Everything in my particular Line of Business (Treasury Securities) is very micromanaged. We have a ""production sheet"" what we have to account for literally every single minute of our day and what we were doing and how much we produced. Very hectic work environment. Not regular hours. If there is not much work people are sent home or told not to come to work the next day. If there is a lot of work people are asked to stay past their scheduled 8 hours, and then send home later on in the week - robbing them of the overtime.Management does not consult with employees before procedure changes, they just do what they think will make the process faster, which 9/10 times makes the process more cumbersome and unnecessarily difficult and slow. Absolutely no room for advancement, and good/hard work is very rarely acknowledged. Lots of favoritism, and no way for employees to complain and see change."
bad,"This was mainly a call center environment that wasn't always employee friendly.  Because of the high turn over rate, their wasn't a relationship between management and employee. Although, I enjoyed working with such a diverse group of people, which in turned me to gain more experience in core group involvement."
bad,"I answered between 80-100 inbound calls per day to process retirement plan loans, withdrawals, and rebalances.  The starting salary was 33,000 per year and never went up much after that."
bad,"My days are always interesting - let's just say - no two are the same.  I have learned to deliver superior work products, even with the always present distractions that an office environment breeds.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I proactively address potential risk issues, and that gives me a measure of satisfaction, knowingly that I always escalate accordingly."
bad,"Be prepared to get brainwashed into thinking it's the best company in the world to work for; work crazy hours, worry about sales, customer service scores, no staff, employee scores, audits, no support from your managers. As long as you brown nose and treat your team like garbage you will get promoted up. Incentive plan is a joke and do not plan on getting a real merit increase because only the CEO gets a 74% raise. They are trying to cuts expenses, I mean people."
bad,"This may not be true for all departments as I know others who are happy at JPMC. However, where I work there is a cult-like mentality where senior leadership is venerated and there is no leeway for asking questions or challenging the way things are done."
bad,unqualified managers who have no business being in their current positions
bad,Management pushed too much.  Not appreciated. End of shift had no meaning.
bad,"Id rather not say. its a horrible company."
bad,Not much to say but the job was not as described to me i n the interview.
bad,"A typical day is analyzing Insurance policies of condos and co-ops for loan approval. This includes submitting reports, obtaining financials from the Home Owners Associations, and calling Insurance companies for additional documents. Management was poor. Co-workers were difficult, lots of internal conflict. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the internal conflict. The best part of this job was learning to interpret complex insurance policies and financials."
bad,"ok place to work"
bad,"Long hours, relatively low pay, non-existent HR dept"
bad,working with associates and processing customers accounts
bad,"fun atmosphere"
bad,The culture has change to add more pressure to the employees.
bad,"I complete my work in 3-4 hours.  I've asked for additional project work that is behind schedule, but I'm told that since I'm not on the project team, I'm not allowed to help.  If I arrive at work at 7am, I'm expected to say until 5pm.  Lunch time is frowned upon.  If you must eat, you should do it at your desk and continue working.  Not allowed to leave early if you work through your lunch.  Advancement opportunities are limited.  They only allow lateral moves.  If you get lucky and accept a job at a higher pay grade, like moving from a 601 to a 602, you WILL NOT receive the pay raise that goes with it.  The only way to make more money is to leave the firm and then come back after a year or so.  Everyone knows it too.  It's part of the company culture."
bad,"Loved the job, Constant change was good.  The only downfall was the looking over your shoulder regarding when you would be laid off."
bad,"admin duties, Phonecalls were far a few between, My Co-Worker a i Go on fine. Not for someone like me. I need to be kept busy."
bad,"Constant incoming phone calls. Was told the position was to assist Chase bankers with credit cards but received customer service department overflow calls. Random issues that I wasnt comfortable answering. On the job education, basically. Learn as you go. Hard to get assistance when needed on the floor."
bad,"Decent place for supervisors just starting out."
bad,"Since the team is continuously understaffed there is a constant pressure to work overtime to cover the 7 day a week shifts.  Management is not supportive and/or aware of all team's duties.  Co-workers have no work ethics and spend most of their time engaging in personal activities, surfing web, watching youTube, etc. The most challenging part of the job is trying to keep up with all the changing while attempting to manage the current backlog. The most enjoyable part of my job is the end of my shift."
bad,"Opportunities for lateral moves, not what would be considered a promotion.  The raises, if you get one, are a joke.  The management is nice, but if you go to them with a concern you are left feeling like they used talk offs or scripts as if we were a customer. There is nothing I enjoy about the job except the pay.  Horrible morale."
bad,"Chase didn't have any idea how to run a business. They are totally lost.  The floor motto was ""WELL AT LEAST WE ARE GETTING PAID"". Because we couldn't accomplish anything."
bad,"started of as a banker, moved up to licensed relationship banker, then to small business specialist.  However, all included the same pay base.  I learned how to sell that's about it; be prepared to work with co-workers that do not know Great Britain and England are the same thing LOL. "
bad,"J P Morgan Chase is a good place to work, however, if they can improve their interoffice software and too many layers of managers to go to"
bad,Great company to work for. I like what I do and very flexible with technologies that I choose. Great visibility.
bad,"I enjoyed chase. I learned a great deal, about the business. Management was great, and coworkers were wonderful. A typical work day come in contact the borrower to gather requested documentation, underwrite the will, so that a approval could be provided then get the borrower prepped and ready for closing with the Title company."
bad,"Shifts are unfair and long, but does create 3 days off. You learn Chase way to discern credit and judgmentally decision. Management is horrible as too many chiefs not enough Indians. Co-works and pay keep you in your seat. Hardest part is staying motivated to come in day after day and most enjoyable part is when it's time to go."
bad,"Clock in at 8:00 and leave at 5:00pm (Overtime offered only during busy season)"
bad,"great co-workers and team atmosphere"
bad,"Compensation is Great!"
bad,"Job security is poor, whether a new employee or an employee of 10 years or more."
bad,I wouldn't work for this organization again. Chase is ruled by red tape and is like working for the government. Stifling polices and unimaginative leadership.nI'm not a fan at all...
bad,Chase is a large company with many pros and cons as most places. There is not much room for advancement if you aren't part of the in crowd. It was nice when I first started but now seems to be about who you know regardless of your excellent performance. There are a lot of racially motivated issues also. 
bad,"if you are looking for a job that has no advancement and will put a road block every time you try, chase is the bank for you."
bad,Complex job responsibilities with a great deal of independent work and expectations.
bad,"Not sure if much has changed but aside from gaining valuable experience, office politics and disrespect was rampant. At the beginning, it was very exciting and there did appear to be a lot of opportunity for growth and development. As time progressed, more and more was expected to the point of absurdly long hours (14-16 hour days) and lack of support. I expected long hours every now and then but what I was consistently doing was ridiculous. I learned to trust very few co-workers / subordinates and witnessed a couple back-stab my manager. One of them was well connected to a more senior manager. They were originally placed to oversee and advise on operational improvements but instead managed to cause employee turn-over rate to explode. The last year that I was there, over 50% of the department left for various reasons. I eventually left as well... followed by 3 others within 2 months."
bad,Management did not support loan processors or provide on going training.
bad,"Not the best working place, crazy schedule, a lot of obligations and not nearly making as much as one should at this bank."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Helping them plan for the future or dealing with every day life was a pleasure.
bad,"I enjoyed my stay at the company until the last few months when we ""reorganized"". After that I was literally thrown out of my position. I had a great team in the beginning but it self destructed in the end for me due to attitutes of the new administration. A great repoire with my co-workers as we had the team attitute approach. There was no hard part of the job except keeping track of my duties with the built in time clock system. The department had a quantity over quality approach and did not, in my opinion take a customer care approach to any transactions need by the customer."
bad,A typical day in retail sales was to arrive 30 minutes before scheduled time and leave past schedule times. It was always a hassle to schedule doctor's appointments because management was so stringent and strict even if your request was 2 weeks before appointment. Benefits were great if you got a chance to use them.
bad,Chase does not pay Head Tellers enough. Head Tellers & Tellers are the backbone of every branch and they receive horrible bonuses. The managers doesn't know as much as the Tellers or the ABM.
bad,"job duties too related to pushing products customers did not ask for, want, or need"
bad,would never recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"If you need job, Chase will hire you. But beware that you won't feel as though you are working at a prestigious bank, but at a chop shop for financial products. Expect to be working with college Grads and maybe even High school grads as well. The managers talk down to you like they would their own children. Other than that, the money is good and the days aren't too long."
bad,Can only be very vague due to company reprisal. In-bound call center pending on the day from 30 to 100 calls per rep on the floor. Complete retirement plan (401k and/or pension) transactions accurately per participant request providing basic plan information and disclosures. Review in-process requests and explain need for any missing information or documentation required to complete request.
bad,"I was a Personal Banker for Chase and the job was nothing like described in the interview. The atmosphere is extremely micro-managed. Even if you're doing a great job, they look over your shoulder and expect more, more, more."
bad,I worked in IT for GTI for roughly 5 years. During that time I saw good people laid off and replaced by student visas even if the current employee was a loyal and strong one. Truly a sweat shop. The review process is always looking for higher performance but comp increases do not reflect accomplishments.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some interesting people.
bad,Had mandatory weekends and long hours everyday 7am-7pm. The moment a mistake ( from being overworked) was made I felt like the company didn't support me or search for more details. I gave a lot to this company at the expense of my family and happiness. I worked 12 hour days 5 days of out a 6 day work week. I love my tellers and bankers and would have love to retire with this company but not at the cost of selling my soul to it.
bad,"It’s difficult to make a decent salary if you stay long term with the company. Sadly, Chase pays external hires more than those who’ve been there for years. Salaries are dastardly low and raises are minuscule. You’re lucky to get a 3% raise for exceeding expectations. Even promotions get you about 3% and they are typically given during annual review time so there is no desire to level set."
bad,"Very poor work culture. Just not for me, could be someone elses cup of tea. Good potential money, my heart just wasn't in it and that's totally okay with me."
bad,I was laid off after working for Chase for 5 years. My performance was excellent according to my yearly performance reviews and all my work was sent overseas.
bad,JPMC has some good and bad points.  It also depends on your department you are in.  Some of these Director’s and Manager’s need some social skills training and some need to learn how to manage their employees a little better and stop playing favoritism.  I left the company because it had changed drastically.  I was over worked and underpaid.
bad,Working for chase paid decently but there was so many inconsistencies from policy and procedures to different LOB working together to solve an issue or take responsibility for an issue.
bad,"Chase retail branches are an alright place to work because the other people you're in the branch with can be enjoyable people to work with. But, the corporate culture is stressful and overly competitive, especially given the difficulty of being the primary client interfacing division in the company."
bad,Management is tone deaf.  They say all the things they are supposed to say but their actions speak more loudly.  Work-life balance is a mere concept to be trotted out during 'rah-rah' sessions and then summarily ignored.  Staff input is selectively sought and often ignored.  Management only wants your opinion when it's the same as theirs.  Staff generally just keep their opinions and insights to themselves because it is potentially harmful to openly express disagreement.  To disagree is to be branded as a non-team player.  Not a great experience by any measure.
bad,"Was told that I could work toward being a banker and after a year wasnt any progress made.  Was transferred to a new branch where I was not treated fairly and terminated unjustly fit a minor infraction.  No support from my second branch location, no write ups or suspensions,  just discarded."
bad,Horrible place to work just good benefit. It is a toxic environment warps your mind and gives people a lot of anxiety just working there. Turnover is extremely high and not worth it. The only thing you learn  is interpersonal skills but you do not learn anything else.
bad,Base salary does not adjust with the cost of living.  Commission is constantly being modified to a lower overall pay out.  There is little chance of promotion from within.
bad,"I was hired to be a relationship banker. I was told I had to acquire my Series 6 license and would have up to 3 opportunities to pass the exam. However, I only took the exam once and was immediately terminated. There was no second or third opportunity. I was blatantly lied to."
bad,"Stressful environment"
bad,"Chase is a big corporation that hasn't stopped to evaluate their workforce - they simply change the metrics and you have to adapt or get left behind, they tend to start new projects without a clear focus leading to the belief that the folks in the management position just inherited their role"
bad,"The work, for the most part, was fine, when we were allowed to our own devices. Unfortunately, most of the systems and procedures are tired and outdated full of inefficiencies. Managers push for production routinely, however, do not take into account what actually needs to be done. Instead of fixing the issues, they pushed the people. Routinely, treated like children, we were monitored like a hawk on up to five different systems. Obviously, some people need this incentive to work. However, those who did take the job seriously experienced extreme micromanagement that made it unbearable."
bad,Upper management is always changing and changing how things are done. They take their time to make things right for employees.  The managers do not recognize hard working employees.
bad,"When hired as an LTOS(Lead Teller Operation Specialist) I was excited for the career growth opportunities as well as the culture and pay, however I was immediately let down by the lack of growth opportunities, the management, and the people I worked with. The LTOS basically does what an assistant manager did, however, the pay is significantly cut. Chase purposefully removed the assistant manager role so they can get away with paying people less. The work environment also became hostile due to the manager and coworkers already having a bad relationship with each other. Everyday you come into the branch at 8:30 and you could not leave until after 6:00pm, they keep the doors open 10 minutes after 6 for last minute customers. They got rid of many tellers and use atm machines instead. Many customers were upset that we only could have two tellers and that they had to make appointments with bankers to get help instead of walking in. The customers also were difficult to deal with due to their high demands. I was responsible for audits, scheduling, balancing drawers, opening the store and handling issues while manager was away. This job is stressful and high demanding, but the pay off was not worth it."
bad,"The culture does not encourage diversity or diverse ideas. To be successful, you must fit a certain mold. The company encourages discrimination to women, especially to women that have taken maternity leave or do not fit the typically male mold."
bad,"I worked there as an administrative assistant and dealt with a very diverse group of individuals.  I had the opportunist to learn a lot of administrative task while in this position. "
bad,"If you want to get things done, you won't like it here. The bureaucracy is out of control.  Too many different systems to request permission or software or anything else that is needed to develop software. Career advancement is through cronyism."
bad,I worked in my position about 1 year before it was outsourced over seas. This happened a lot at the company.  They did not care about their employees as much as the bottom line.
bad,"You must enjoy bureaucracy, red tape, coloring within the lines, following orders, not questioning leadership, and being a button pusher to enjoy working in any role at this company."
bad,"My time at Chase was not a happy time. The culture in the mortgage division was very stressful, the management was not interested in the well-being of its employees."
bad,Tellers are becoming obsolete so they train you to push something that is going to take your job away. They don't pay tellers very well and push sales highly.
bad,A typical large organization in which employees are treated as  replaceable resources. Good compensation and benefits but little work satisfaction. Basically the movie Office Space but at a bank. Technology employees now use shared desks with no personal items.
bad,"Job pays very well, however, bad phone calls occurred frequently with customers cursing you out or threatening your life, and management does not care about you."
bad,"Most people are simply a number. Other than the fact that you have access to very good benefits, the company does not pay or offer much in salary even to management."
bad,Relatively mindless and repetitive work if you work on the operations side of the business and not in sales/investments. Job security and benefits are a perk but all in all do not have many other positives to list about the culture
bad,"JP Morgan as a whole is a very reputable organisation which was i privileged to work with for about a year, within two departments. The most interesting part of the one of the roles is the flexibility of working from home but there was no work life balance as i used to work round the clock  both at home and in the office. Being my first time working for JP Morgan, it didn't leave a good impression as the general consensus is that the organisation is more concerned about the work than their staffs."
bad,Chase provides no job security. Very cutthroat working environment. I  would not recommend them as an employer. The experience is something if your into banking.
bad,The Retail side is a factory with new staff hitting the branches every 3 months. This is due to high turnover rates at the branches to meet the quotas. Company does not promote divisional transfers. Cut throat process to secure client base.
bad,"If you'd like to work at an adult daycare, this would be the place. The company itself is good but in this particular environment it was obvious employees are just numbers on a chart and the treatment was subpar."
bad,"Entire time at company, it's a clique...who you know will get you ahead and if you play their game - you might succeed or if it backfires, watch out, you might get called in.  Management has a chip on their shoulder about some people and makes it difficult for them on purpose working there - seen it and experienced it.  What seemed to happen near the end, Management when does something wrong, nothing happens as they place the blame on their staff.  Depending on where you get placed in the company, you can love or hate it.  I loved it until got moved to other departments to learn more about the company, then started to dread it."
bad,"The staff is horrible, the managers aren’t leaders at all, plus they share anything you tell them in confidence  with other managers/co-workers. Nothing is private between yourself and the managers. The call center environment is shady and the floor is usually not busy which leaves a lot of open time for people to stand around at others desk gossiping instead of cubing. Hard work does not get you acknowledge nor does it leads to career growth opportunities as they promise. Let’s nust say Loyalty and honest is not Chase strong suit nor customer focus."
bad,Great training program and decent pay.  Alot of customer interaction and competitive co-workers.  Great name to have on your resume but very numbers driven.
bad,"the day would start with daily status call: what's the status, what's the progress, what are the blockers. then work itself. quite often you would get ""trainings"" on diversity, on how to treat customers, how to guard banking ""secrets"", on development standards for disabled people etc etc etc. lot's of meetings too. some days i'd have like 6 hours of meetings almost uninterrupted. you can't really learn there anything except their business specific routines. for software development they use the same boring corporate stack: J2EE, oracle database, Spring. some groups use python. but that's about it. everything is tightly regulated. there is a lot of hierarchy. every little step needs to be coordinated with multiple managers. overall there are lot's of people on each campus I worked in. lines to coffee machines, lines to cafeteria, lines to bathrooms... currently they are moving to so called ""collaborative culture"" where everyone sits at the long table, 3 feet per person. meetings by the wall. at the times it's hard focus there. also they constantly fire and hire people in drones. doesn't seem like job security is there."
bad,Working at JPM was not a good fit for me.  I had applied for an internal position and felt the communication was poor when it came to follow up after applying.
bad,"The benefits were good, the compensation could have been better. Poor management, was laid off twice."
bad,people they choose to advance on a personal basis not job performance or knowledge basis. nice people and company overall just with thee was more fairness.
bad,"The best thing about this company is the benefits.  However, they do not honor loyalty and do not foster growth.  You are rewarded more for being cut throat than being a team player."
bad,"productive, but overall stressful place to work, im not sure why this is relevant to the community.  The culture is overload of information.  Please accept the information that I have given."
bad,Chase is a very fast paced call center that is sales driven and results expected company. I'm not sure they always have the customers best interests at heart.
bad,No one ever recognized peoples hard work and dedication.  Management didn't care about the employees.  The only nice thing about working there was a guarantee that Sundays were off.
bad,"people love to kiss up too much here and are pretty fake. unfortunate for what is clearly a successful company, even with the pay starting out great there seems to be nowhere to move up to as well"
bad,"Working at chase we did inbound and outbound calling. Setting up payment arrangements for customers, payment plans, etc. We were required to get a certain amount per week/month. When customers would call back, they wouldn't get to speak to the same person, so you wouldn't get credit for the payment."
bad,"Chase is a great company and has great products and services.  The compensation plans are constantly being reduced, typical in this line of work.  Chase offers great support to its bankers via phone and my direct managers have all been great.  The overall management seems to want to change things, just for the sake of change and it seems like there is a lot of change at the top and they all want to make their mark."
bad,"Very controlled environment.  Managers were terrible and on your back all the time.  Unfair as to scheduling.  Benefits were good, but pay was very little."
bad,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with and had many great managers over the years. However, the culture is such that it is like all large companies, it's who you know and not exactly what you know that will move you forward. In addition, there is not enough support to be able to move up. I ended up being forced out after 20 years of service."
bad,just an average job and not the greatest leadership.  figure your own path out and dont expect anyone to push you out; they will have no problem stringing you along for opportunities that dont exist.
bad,"Stressfull place to work, employee's always on leave due to managment, no floor or team meetings. Cross training is highly recomended. On a positive note the benefits are great!"
bad,The learning experience is great. The pay is not comparable to job description requirements. I was asked to be a vault/business teller but did not get a pay raise.
bad,"good pay, all people aspect very much behind other industries.  too many institutionalized (been there too long) that infects the culture and success of new staff causing the carousel of turnover."
bad,"I was never sure of my actual job. I was moved around about 10 times with new assignments and new management each time. About 1/2 of my managers were very competent and cared greatly about the company and the job we did. "
bad,Liked being able to assist inbound if they were getting too busy. Had a translator to assist with understanding what customer is trying to  say.Going back oner again with customer to ensure  they understood what was going to happen.
bad,Decided tax breaks were ending and needed to move to another location did not fully review the aspect of costing 5000 people in a small town their jobs
bad,A typical day was in front of customers all day advising them with all of their banking needs.  The banking industry is not what it once was.  Being in retail banking is now like being in consumer retail like at a convenient store.
bad,"Very cut throat and very numbers oriented. Managers will Micromanage you every bit of the day when you're doing mundane tasks. It's not a career nor should be. Customers are the worst as well, dealing with issues that can't be solved (I.E. Refunding something that happened 2 years ago) yet they yell and sit in your office until you do something."
bad,"got ISTQB Certification as was asked to be done mandatory."
bad,The day started early although not all together.  Stayed late to speak on none work topics.  The wasn't the worst considering the rate. I took away that it's the highest stress programming development in the industry.
bad,Citrix Support team was all over the place and management was really bad. Location wasn't great either... Poor management and overwhelmed team of Engineers.
bad,"My experience with JPM is they does not value employees."
bad,"Supporting local applications that are regulatory in nature and interfacing with regional applications."
bad,"Internal candidates are not given the opportunity to advance. Only lateral moves are allowed.  HR will say no ""out of cycle"" promotions or raises. It seems only friends can advance. Managers know who get the job before interviews were given."
bad,"It was a place where, I felt more like a number then a person. Work and life balance was impossible. Hours are way too long."
bad,"Management is useless. "
bad,"I worked there for a yr and some change. I was told i would be promoted to full time at my branch with in 6 months once a teller left or was promoted.  this never occurred instead they hired two part time tellers for 20 hrs.  Management weren't very knowledgeable about policy, procedures and operations."
bad,"they do not recognize you for the hard work you put in or the amount you do when other employees leave.  You end up with a huge workload and get no credit!  My first 3 reviews were awesome and the longer I was there; the more I did.  The last 2 years received ""poor"" ratings for being swamped with work overload.  Again, was doing more work than ever, by myself and with no one supporting me.  Often carried the team administrative duties on my own, trained new people, was told I cared too much ~ then my team was relocated out of state - go figure!  Do not work for JPMorgan Chase!!!"
bad,"While the networking activities are enjoyable the messaging does not filter down to it's management team."
bad,Good company to work for but business ethics and career mobility is lacking in some areas. The need for management training needs to be required and well as better business management.
bad,"Not uncommon to take over one hundred calls in a day. Overtime is usually available four to five times a week."
bad,Paymentech was a great place to work until the CEO passed away and Chase started placing their people into executive positions within the company. They destroyed the culture we all valued and made us all just a nameless number. Then the layoffs started coming. The people that still remain there(those who haven't quit or been laid off)  are all miserable. Morale is low. I would never work for JP Morgan Chase again.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the employees.  They really cared about the customers and about their performance.
bad,"Very eager to work for the company prior to getting offered a position and  was disappointed soon after to find that it didn't live up to its professional reputation. There is so much beaucracy behind promoting employees that it leaves little to no hope for someone to advance in their career.  I was hired for a position but the company overstated their need for so many new hires that it wasn't enough work to go around. My day to day job was amended due to the volume decrease. After a year, I was told by management to apply for an opening for a position that I thought I already filled. My pay or title never changed when my day to day activity was amended, so needless to say I was confused. Questioning management for the sudden need for me to ""quietly hurry and apply"" tactic was dismissed with ""oh its for HR purposes"". Needless to say after that  I was completely turned off with the company all together and  have been seeking employment outside for the past 2 yesrs."
bad,At this employer being threatened by termination is a regular thing. upper management is rude and not personable. bad job security
bad,"Fun place to work if you have no family. Hours do not allow for children or a home life."
bad,I've worked for the bank for almost 14 years and have had the same title for 11 of those years.  It is a large bank with lots of opportunities for lateral moves but it seems quite impossible to move up to a different job grade.
bad,"I didn't really mind this job. There were the perks of working all types of shifts (mortgage branch is open 24 hours a day) and I got to work with the same people as my position wasn't customer-interactive. I got to cross-train a lot in my department. "
bad,Learned day to day fuctions within the banking idustry that allow banks to efficiently run day to day functions to keep and manage money.
bad,"Hard-work, long hours for low compensation. Likes to hire young, bright college graduates and pay them a low salary, then works them hard. After they terminate you for any reason, they don't even offer you a compensation package (unless you are an executive) while you are looking for your next job."
bad,"There is an extreme amount of knowledge at JLL. "
bad,"You work and you play."
bad,Poor management coupled with a limited and highly biased proprietary investment platform make this a difficult place to advise clients and invest their wealth.
bad,"A typical work day is confusing most of the time. Nothing is ever the same and there are always changes being made every five minutes seems like. Seems as if there is confusion among managers as well, because you can never go to management and get the same answer from two managers that are on the same team. My coworkers are great people to work with and are always caring and willing to help when allowed to. The hardest part of this job is not know if you will have a job when you come in the next day due to so many changes daily and so much confusions going on. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers that I have and my coworkers."
bad,"There was More work pressure"
bad,New staff brought new ideas to the table. I would say that I was able to sharpen my selling ability with this position. I would not recommend this job to future applicants
bad,"I personally didn't like the take over and how it was handled at my branch, because they fired everyone working for Washington mutual, but i heard that wasn't everywhere. But I did love the job and management before that. Just don't let them fire you without paper work!"
bad,"Chase has a very good compensation structure and benefits are as good as they can be (getting worse all the time, as are all companies).  Extremely high pressure and workload volumes are extremely high.  In the organization I worked in, it was very much an ""emperor has no clothes"" story, as the upper management wanted one-way communication only.  Tools that are 'blessed' by the management are forced upon the staff without regard to whether they meet the criteria to effectively do the job or not.  When flaws are highlighted by the staff with existing tools you are labeled a 'mal content' and pulled aside by management and lectured about not making the management look bad.  Unfortunately, this was not the environment when I began working there, but has evolved since that time to where it is now."
bad,"The managers are mostly overworked, not knowledgeable (hired because they know someone, not based on merits) and under staffed unable to help further careers of their employees. many find that the constant stress and lack of results to be not worth the pay, and constant unfulfilled promise of pay increase, and further training to advance your career unsatisfactory."
bad,The atmosphere was great. I really liked the lunch lady she was nice.
bad,"As a manager, all I did during the day is attend meetings and work on reports.  It was so bad that I rarely had anytime to coach and develop my employees or respond to emails appropriately.  Upper management would not implement great suggestions presented by supervisors and staff.  Changes took place everyday and the processes that were implemented didn't always make sense. No life outside of work.  To keep up, you had to work long hours on weekends."
bad,Banks acquire other banks so nothing is ever stable. You never knew if you were in the next round of layoffs.
bad,"Writing market color, executing trades across the fixed income asset class with a particular focus on interest rate derivatives. Developing tools to help with market visibility, derivative pricing, and client marketing material"
bad,Chase was a great company. the employees gossiped a lot. i had to look for a better opportunity
bad,"Even after working my way up and out of inbound phone services, jobs were frequently outsourced overseas.  No room for promotions.  All job changes were lateral and not always of your choosing."
bad,Has been a great job for me while I have been attending school. Banking is just not for me. I am anticipating to start my career in film and multimedia.
bad,"Everything was done at my desk.  People were too used to technology to connect.  I really did not like that I the overall culture of the company was to work, meet via teleconference, and get the work done all without moving from your desk."
bad,"the branches are divided into several types of bankers. all with a supposed different role. Yet, when is comes to the real day to day operations those roles tend to overlap and there is managing as to how this could be cleared up. Everyone is out for themselves and the management is only looking for production no matter how you get it it. No, matter how hard you work to make business happen you are never recognized for the efforts."
bad,"Good experience in whole, allowing me to perform based on my knowledge in the mortgage business.  Management was a challenge in that the managers were not expected to understand the function of their group.  Most difficult part of my job was the constant challenge of working within an environment of friction between co-workers and management.  The constant involvement of HR was unlike any I had ever experienced before.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting resolution to problem files and seeing them move to the next phase of our goal.  I learned a life lesson of not becoming involved with my co-workers and finding pleasure in my own individual accomplishments."
bad,"Typical day at work starts with getting the branch open under dual control in the morning, deactivating the main vault, getting the tellers cash box out and buying money from the cash vault. Having a brief morning huddle to motivate the them. I learned to only have loyalty to yourself. My co-workers were okay sometimes. Management need training on dealing with employees, they are horrible and lack training. Hardest part of the job is sometimes you work 60 hours a week but you only get paid for working 40 hours because assistant managers and branch managers are exempt. Most enjoyable part of the job was the wonderful customers I met who became like family and my days off from work."
bad,Very numbers driven. Inconsiderate of workers. Good benefits
bad,JPMorgan Chase managers are ill equipped to manage fairly and objectively.
bad,"I worked my butt off. 60 hour weeks, I was productive and made great relationships with our sales team. I changed manager 3 times in the year and half i was there. My last manager was not qualified to manager people and she did not handle herself as a manager should. Chase managers play favorites and I would have a really hard time going back to work for them."
bad,Setting up accts for major businesses using several types of software.  Spoke to client only when neccesary.  Lots of data entry
bad,What I have learned to do at work is to enjoy the moment. Not to rush through the things that I am doing. Paying attention to detail is what helps me make better decision and helps me balance at the end of the day.
bad,"I learned in this Customer Service Banking environment Chase does not have the ""employees back"". "
bad,"- take calls, help families save their home by performing a variety of tasks by running financial information to see which option would be best fit."
bad,"Co workers are great, management needs improvement,  extremely difficult to get a promotion or an increase in salary"
bad,"Make as much money as you can while you are there. Consistently check your pay to ensure they are paying your properly, because you will lose out on money due to poor time keeping and payroll errors. And they term/layoff people at the drop of a hat. It does not matter how good you are. I have seen people in leaders club, who was national award winners, be laid off."
bad,"I am a professional and have learned all internal systems."
bad,Great benefits and decent job security. Very low opportunity for advancement if you start as a teller.
bad,Not much to look forward to when going into work. Same job duty performed each day and not much variation in tasks.
bad,In early 2013 JPMorgan Chase decided to relocate some jobs to Texas and one of those happen to be mine unfortunately. The growth for advancement was great.
bad,"I am a Mortgage Banker. I am one of several Mortgage Bankers whose position is being eliminated on November, 4th 2013,."
bad,"Back to Back calls "
bad,"I worked at one of the busier branches in this area and was the main teller on the front line. So every day was filled with activity. Handling customer transactions, handling money, etc. It was always interesting dealing with all of the different personalities of the customers We had alot of regulars that I developed a relationship with. I never stopped learning ways to do things easier and faster while maintaining accuracy. The staff was everchanging and I became quite close with most of them for as long as we were together and still keep in touch with some. I had opportunity to work with a couple of managers that were best in class but for the most part the management was probably among the worst that I have ever worked for. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the negativity of the management while being a positive influence on the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was ""making the day"" of the customers I had the pleasure of providing service to."
bad,"Micro management, too many managers, high pressure sales, lack of appreciation of you and the customer, and you will be forgotten. I worked for WAMU and then applied at Chase in 2011. Worked for 2 years and was a huge fan of the product but not the management. I lead my branch in customer service, was told by my hiring manager and regional manager that I was ""a keeper"" and that "" I display characteristics that cannot be taught."" That being said, they liked me so much that when the PB position wasn't working out for me (I was at a cut throat branch, mind you I came in with 10+ years of proven sales success) they allowed me to step down to a teller position with my same pay rate of $17.31 an hour. This was after not getting a fair chance. After 2 months in the position they told me I had to take 5 consecutive days off per federal regulations, so I did. I also had multiple weeks of training and was out of the office more than I was there. My supervisor criticized me for production that month and began to say that, ""I don't think you have what it takes."" Are you kidding me? I was gone for more than half the month and her answer, ""some of my best months were when I was on vacation... Unbelievable. I was also criticized for respecting a client that was a cameraman for the NFL that had to fly from OC to Seattle for the next days football game. I was familiar with the schedule and as a seasoned sales professional I know there is a time and a place for a sales pitch. No matter what I said to that guy, his thoughts were on the game and meeting his flight that was leaving in 3 hours. According"
bad,"Chase offers great benefits for singles and/or families. The work hours depend on your position with the firm. The management is average. Chase Bank wants you to sell every product they offer, which is understandable, however they don't want to pay you for your hard work."
bad,A typical day at work was opening mail. Management was decent and i truly did enjoy working for Chase.
bad,"My job for the day was trying to get people to sign up for a chase credit card. We was suppose to assign 10 people a day. The hardest part is trying to get 10 people to sign up in a day (6 hours). The reason why this was a difficult task because people didn't want to hear what you have to say and their not intrested in either signing up with a credit card or with Chase Bank. Within 2 weeks if you did not meet expectations getting 10 people to sign up in 6 hours, you was fired."
bad,I've learned a lot about finance and everything that has to do with banking which I can utilize through my personal life as well as my career. It is difficult to advance in Chase because everything is based on favoritism versus work ethic. The managers are always on a power trip and lack interpersonal skills.
bad,Change is great but when your hard earned pay increase are affected it takes a toll on your work and personal life.
bad,Opened and sorted and processed the mail and keying information into the system. Learned to meet deadlines and to see how other lockboxes operated. Management was not professional. Co-workers were agreeable and friendly. The hardest part of the job was when work was slow. The most enjoyable part was knowing that deadlines had been met by the end of the day.
bad,Job seems to focus more on the sales portion of the job instead of the customer service. Your calls are timed which make it extremely hard to help customer who dont understand
bad,"• 3 week training of the Verizon Wireless company, policy, and devices."
bad,"Horrible management that makes you feel like a preschooler learning shapes... Yes, it's that bad."
bad,My time at Chase was a challenge. The lack of process and disorganized management made it very difficult to stay ahead of projects. From day to day things would change and questioning the status quo was frown upon. I might work at chase again in a different department but I would recommend commercial card.
bad,"Initially it was a great place to work and the job itself was great, but the position changed to more of a sales environment. Management no longer cared about employees often saying in so many words “if this job is not the job for you then you can exit”. This is the 2nd year in a row that they have laid off several Commercial Bank Relationship Managers around the holidays!"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers from myriad industries, whether it be developing new solutions, testing and helping them to streamline their business processes.  Management constantly looks for ways to cut costs, but they aren't willing to pursue new ideas that would generate new revenue and allow employees to move into more dynamic jobs.  The work place culture was friendly, but the need to watch your back was always present."
bad,"The employees don't care about the work, which is reinforced by management. I worked in a compliance role and the level of complacency was unprecedented from my previous career history. The managers only resolve problems to make themselves look good in front of peers and management. Little care is displayed on making efforts for efficiency or driving change. A truly horrible experience."
bad,Good name to have on your resume. Good cross-section of society encountered in the office and other business dealings. Flexible when you need time off.
bad,"No room to grow, no incentive to move up. I was maxed out at $67k, my boss made $67k, his boss made $67k. Raises and bonuses went away when Chase purchased WAMU."
bad,"Chase is very diverse in their culture, and that's to their credit.  Their insurance and general employment benefits (paid time off) are incredibly competitive.  I often joked that their amazing benefits was the primary reason I worked there.  The hiring of management needs significant work.  I had probably 10 managers in my entire career at Chase, and I would say out of those 10 maybe 3 really great ones.  They tend to hire managers with prior management experience, but they've forgotten that if you weren't good at the position in the first place you shouldn't give them another opportunity.  An assessment or review of their prior employees would really help.  Also, there is VERY LITTLE if any at all room for advancement.  You have to know the right people and if you don't, you're staying put.  You can work harder than your entire team and still not get promoted.  I would say that it's a good company to work for - but don't expect to get very far."
bad,"Great place to acquire more responsibilities fairly quickly. Helpful people, although takes time to get to know all the different departments due to the size of the company."
bad,"I loved being a Teller until that position was eliminated and replaced with the ""Associate Banker"" role. This role added loads of extra work with not enough added compensation. With this role, we have added tasks to ""make up for"" the time we would have spent helping customers but because customers refuse the technology, we have twice as much work. The job has become extremely stressful and no one cares, whatsoever."
bad,"Es trabajar con niños que repiten lo que dicen sus papas en la cena. Ambiente laboral pesimo, todos se creen los reyes de la verdad y hablan faltandole el respeto a minorias y distintos grupos sociales."
bad,"I worked a global banking transaction job that involved working phones on tight deadlines. You had to be accurate in your accounting or you could expose large sums of money to legal claims, but you were also buried in work. I saw many people break, and those that had been there a while showed visible wear."
bad,"Poor management. Things take a very long time to get into motion in this firm, likely due to all the red tape and politics. "
bad,"The company-wide benefits are great, and generally the work environment is fine.  Managers are not trained in Management Skills well or the tasks their teams are doing and spend too much time in meetings.  I had to train my managers how to do my job.  There was no collaboration in my department, and any different opinion was considered dissent."
bad,"if you want to waste your life, go ahead. I was doing EXCELLENT on points and pvcs, my manger just not want me to get small business training, and he keep telling me that he mistakes the training date or whatsoever,  people who hired after me ( who has friends in chase upper level, who always late,) becomes everything, and what am I now? a piece junk to this great company. So, let me ask you something? do you know people in chase? like business manager or region manger? if you do, go apply for it! great company for YOU!. if you don't? ha, GOOD LUCK!"
bad,"Chase was a good experience.  The management wasn't the best as a team.  A couple managers were good people, respectful and professional and effective.  Others were not.  Staff was friendly overall.  The culture of the company is very white male and female dominated.  Staff is aware of the culture and does behave accordingly.  A typical day is routine sales and service as a banker.  I learned a lot about bank branch and product operations, sales, underwriting, and security.  There is a distinction of how employees are treated based on race and gender.  The worst part of the job is cold calling from the same customer list each week.  The most enjoyable, is helping customers when they need it."
bad,"Fun enviroment, with opportunity to grow. Every one was really nice to me. I worked as a bank teller. Got to meet new people ever day. What I hated most was the low pay"
bad,"There have been many changes since I started.  The first two years were ok.  Then they went Agile and required us to be what the termed as T-shaped.  That placed alot of demand on us.   Also, the tools and services that provide their developers with are bad."
bad,"Company wants p/t employees so they can avoid paying benefits. The lower tier employees are pushed to physical and mental limits, many of whom quit or get fired."
bad,I only worked at J.P. Morgan for 2 months as a consultant before they let me go so I'm not very happy with them right now. But a nice looking place with professional people.
bad,"Work is purely metrics driven, there is little or no professional development opportunity or chances for job expansion.  Never praise for a job well done."
bad,"i worked as an intern at the company for 6 months. during those 6 months i was a transaction processor in the foreign exchange department. things started off rough for me because i had obtained my internship through a school called year up that didn't require me to have credentials as high as others working around me. i got there and immediately felt like i was in competition with my own coworkers, the people who are supposed to be most helpful and inviting. on my very first day i will never forget how rude and short some of the workers were when my manager walked me around the department and introduced me to everyone. during that time, having received my first impression of the department, i realized this place was not for me and would more than likely test my patience and faith. whilst maintaining my internship at the company i rarely had check-ins from my manager and felt as though she would throw me onto others to relieve herself of her own responsibility. i trained myself to remember processes and functions most of the time, as i did not have a manager that was actively a part of my success and well-being. you would think she would be very in-tune with my progress as i had come into the company with little banking experience. the people there were prejudiced including the higher-ups, and were more focused on the success of the Caucasian employees. i didn't feel comfortable going to work all the time because of the attitudes and vibes the staff gave off to me as if i was there to 'steal their job'. not recommended to enter this company as a newcomer to the banking industry."
bad,"Commission based."
bad,Culture has shifted over the last few years focusing on trying to save as much money as possible as opposed to developing employees for the betterment of the company.
bad,"Company is all about money. If you're not selling something and working like slave then you are not valued. Management is awful. All they care about is their bottom line and kissing upper management's behind. Also, if your manager doesn't like you then watch out because they will try to find any reason to get rid of you. "
bad,"great place to work and learn and interact with very senior Mgmt since been a Product owner."
bad,"First let me start by saying Chase offers great benefits and most of the people that you work with are friendly. But Chase treats its tellers like second class second class citizens when if I can be honest it is one of the toughest position in the branch itself. We have to provide excellent customer service and maintain our composer when customers treat you with disrespect. As a teller, you are now hired at a minimum of  20hrs per week and they will never move you up from that. Today, 20hrs is not enough to be able to pay your rent and bills. As a college student the branch wasn't willing to work with the schedules we provided and put restrictions on when we were able to get classes. Again for working only 20hrs this does not seem fair or worth going through all that trouble. I really enjoy working at Chase but I cannot maintain myself with 20hrs a week."
bad,"I worked at the Chase Call Center for about 3 years, and we were constantly told there were plenty of opportunities for advancement. Ultimately, when positions opened up, they picked people who sucked up to management, not the ones who genuinely showed interest and put in the hard work. This made it really frustrating and hard to advance, and became one of the main reasons I left the company. The pay and benefits are decent, but they overwork you. If you're bilingual, be prepared to take double the amount of calls. If you end up moving to another department or specialty queue, be prepared to be used as back-up for frontline specialists. In my last position as a business specialist I would take calls from four different queues every day. The job itself becomes monotonous and can be depressing at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was my colleagues. We became like a big family and I found it easy to relate to everyone there. We would occasionally have team potlucks and meetings which was nice."
bad,I didn't like the culture. Too many managers who wanted to kiss up and kick down. I had 5 different managers in my time there and only two were very good at their job.
bad,"Good job on paper, not the best for work life balance. Must like doing the same thing, in the same walls, everyday. "
bad,"The job is lackluster, I worked at the Wiseman call center in San Antonio, TX. The call center itself was kind of depressing. Not a lot of community engagement or team member activities to keep the little worker ants from going insane."
bad,"This company has constant small layoffs just before they must publish earnings reports.  There is very little stability in an environment like this. My management did not want to lay me off as I was a top producer that had been approved for a promotion and a raise, but had no choice due to the overarching layoff calendar which included half of my team.  It is hard to feel loyalty to a company that lays off people so frequently."
bad,"A normal large-corporate company. Many processes and not much room for creativity. If you like structure, this would be a good match. Not sure about advancement opportunities."
bad,Never knew if you would have a job the next day because of the high turn over. Position get out sourced frequently. I enjoyed working for the company I loved my position I was just mainly concerned about being laid off in which I was.
bad,"i really did not like working here. i felt trapped and smothered at all time with the micromanagement. i understand it is a call center, but this is a stressful job and i need moments to breathe and make it through the day."
bad,A very stressful environment where people are looked at as a number. Expected to work 7 days per week/ Work life balance is not a priority. Hardest part of job was being looked at as a number on paper.
bad,"The company would cut down the commission structure every year...whatever you were good at selling they would cut it out. There's some people there who are not qualified to be financial advisors or private client bankers but they promote the wrong people. It is a cut throat and stressful culture so be careful. The benefits were nice and there is a lot of paid time off. The job in itself you do have to be on the phones a lot. You have to take advantage of the opportunities and be a self motivator. However, the clients that you meet might meet with another banker and there is always conflict."
bad,"I would not recommend this company, long days and very stressful, and that is in a group that is highly desired in the company, i have heard other groups are even worse"
bad,I enjoyed working for this company.  We worked an 8 hour shift and their were day that we know the time we came in but didn't had a set time to end the shift. Because we had deadline that had to be meet.  Since I worked in the payroll department.
bad,"Management is not qualified to manage.  I have had 2 managers that have been bullies.  They do not listen or take advice of others.  They are demanding and your best will never be enough.  Hard work is not acknowledged.  The things that are done right are not acknowledged. Most people work through their lunches, and this seems to be an okay work environment.  More work just keeps getting piled on and when you say something, it is ignored and your are penalized for your workload overload.  Lack of respect from managers and HR policies are not properly followed."
bad,We were required to pull people from the line to help them with their transactions. The goal was to find opportunity to gain more of their business. However this often resulted in frustration and anger when they would see the people who were behind them in line leave while I was still getting their deposit or withdrawal processed.
bad,"Great place for freshers to get a feel of the corporate culture but make it a point to switch out in max 2-3 years"
bad,Once you stay within this company longer than 2 years you are able to notice the ins and outs of corporate America at its finest. Although management positions are visibly stressful if able to create a good team of workers their lives could be made so much easier. Especially since many managers impose multiple projects for their employees to deal with at once. More so than required by their job titles. Initiative with all employers is a positive trait but once you are seen for your ability to multitask it becomes clear to management who will be a huge support for the work place therefore creating a sense of pressure similar to that of working for your life in a manner of speaking. This company retains its employees mostly due to the benefits offered and depending on the employee the location in which they are employed to. Otherwise their turnover can be visibly affected due to its poor management starting with the Corporate managers which then showcases multiple examples of sexist behaviors and favoritism among management and their subordinates. If JPMORGAN Chase were to truly focus and care about the employees day to day life and not just about the profit at the end of each quarter it could truly take the business to a whole other level
bad,The management of this facility was not qualified to run the business. There were advancement made for personal favors provided to the management.  There were many long days and a very demanding work environment
bad,"I worked in the technology area and while there are areas of excellence, in the main I was very surprised about how far behind in thinking and tool availability they were."
bad,"this is not of Apex systems but of JP Morgan Chase."
bad,"I've enjoyed the interaction with customers a lot, but the office politics were terrible ....unfortunately the outsourcing of many of the customer service jobs was even more awful!"
bad,"email and do independent computer work for majority of the day. a few brief meetings. a lot of independence and tight deadlines, high expectations. not a lot of hope for upward mobility."
bad,Digital focus and hindrance on being with a company that is eliminating positions.  Great culture and loved the work environment but was fearful for future security
bad,"Friends go way back in this place and culture barrier to external candidates is the most difficult part of the job.  There is a lot of training material available that you can do on your own time.  Unrealistic expectations and cold atmosphere of tight lipped environment.  Stay quiet, the cameras are on."
bad,The management team allows for you to get your work done. The employees are friendly and willing to assist. The company is very large and sometimes the development doesn't happen.
bad,"Working in the branch sucks. They expect you to stay late or come early with zero notice but it's a problem if you have an emergency to attend to. There is no opportunity for advancement unless you want to be a branch manager and then you're just a scape goat for the district manager. It's just one big blame game anytime something goes wrong and there is no winner. No really cares about the problems of the customers OR employees. Everyone is just trying not to get fired. Also the pay plan shrinks every year, pretty soon we'll all be working 3 jobs."
bad,"This is about HYD location for ops teams only. A company with extreme success in client service doesn't have much focus on employee management. Unfriendly management, strict rules, regular O.T. without additional pay. Improper headcount management. Non professional promotion policy (it's more of manager recommendation in nature)."
bad,"JP Morgan chase  was a nice place to work but being 23 at the time, I felt that chase was very out dated in age and their ways of working. I felt very out of place and I felt has if I had to do things the out dated way. "
bad,"I worked in the merchant services sales department for 5 years."
bad,"unfair ending closing the company not letting workers"
bad,KPI driven with manager's who display corporate arrogance. Open cubicle work environment. Great training by company and the benefits are really great as well.
bad,It's a high pressure environment but a lot will depend on the personality of your manager. You will have the opportunity to meet a wide variety of people but expect to put in a full workday + more in to your main job. It can be disheartening and thankless at times but the best thing to do is to learn from the experience and move on.  Members of teams with managers overseas are generally depressed.
bad,"Long work hours"
bad,I am looking for a management position that offers better work/life balance combined with a professional structure and the chance of career mobility.
bad,"Very stressful environment.  The customers don't stress you out; the management does.  You get monitored on every call and if you don't use the right phrase, you get a policy and procedure error.  One error gets you a performance improvement plan.  Two errors gets you a written warning,  Three errors in a 2 month period and you're out.  It would be easy to avoid if they didn't keep changing policy consistently.  And there's no easy way to look up policy.  They don't have it in a nice neat little book that you can reference.  It's every where on the intranet and connected to several links.  If you don't memorize it, you're out.  Good luck.  Everyone is always on a PIP!"
bad,A typical corporate world that does not value their employees.  It's all about the bottom line.  I am being eliminated due to corporate restructuring.  Other employees in less demanding roles are being kept.
bad,I am not surrounded by motivated folks and that in turn has a direct effect on my motivation. Management has a selfish outlook and every tactical move and decision is made in their own best interest.This is a very bureaucratic work environment.
bad,"It was a job, noting really more to add about it. Liked the people however management wasnt really supportive of the staff"
bad,"Best and most enjoyable party of my job is the Camaraderie of my coworkers/team. Hardest part is the turnover seeing, seeing hard workers pushed out for younger personnel."
bad,"Former employee. Very difficult and unreasonable environment to be productive.  Overall the stress of a production work role was unbelievably overwhelming at times.  Horrible morale. The company does not care about their employees AT ALL. I truly believe Chase only cares about making money and does not give any thought about the company culture or treating their employees like human beings. If you are a parent, do not work here.  If you care about yourself or your sanity, do not work here."
bad,"Had an operations role. Middle management was out of touch with what really mattered. JPM knows they're JPM and as a result will never be short of recent college grads and therefore pay below market average. Bonuses were laughable - 1.5-2% and thats if you got a high performance rating. Overtime pay was a plus."
bad,The environment is extremely unprofessional. There is the potential to make good money but it depends on the branch and the type of manager you have. If you have a good manager you will like it if not you will be forced out.
bad,"I would describe this place as a chicken slaughter house."
bad,"Overall not too bad. Pleasant atmosphere. Like any other financial companies. If management likes you, you will get ahead."
bad,Some of the management and co workers make it hard to enjoy your work place. On the bright side they pay well. Depending on who's team you own will determines the work environment.
bad,"Employees from junior positions to senior management levels are so insecure of their jobs and are craving for bigger bonuses.  It results in cut-throat environment.  People are ultra-sensitive of their jobs that's why they would always pass the blame on others like a musical chair until the music stops on the person who has the best work ethics.  Projects are supposed to be a collaborative and easy to facilitate but it becomes complicated because there are people who are incompetent and do not have the right skills and brains to provide and define their business requirements but their defense mechanism is to be mean and unreasonable to the project team. Instead of giving in to their limitations, and cooperate and seek help from true subject matter experts so projects can be completed smoothly without adding stress to employees, they pretend to be knowledgeable even if everybody knows they do not know their product and processes well.  Good pay & benefits but be prepared to stress out yourself on unreasonable behavior of people you work with vertically and horizontally."
bad,I've learned a lot with Chase bank....it gave me the skill set that prepared my future advancement in banking. It gave me advantage with fundamental selling skills that was primative to other bank cultures.
bad,"Bad Pay, No Growth within the company. A lot of laid off. They manipulate you to take courses and training but at the end they are just playing around with you and hire someone from out side of the company."
bad,"both times that i worked at chase and JPMChase were great projects with great colleagues.  days were full but not overbearing, education and advancement are encouraged i even moved from unix systems admin to storage systems admin during my first time at chase"
bad,JPMorgan Chase requires a lot of work hours to manage their large pipeline. The company tends to expand and contract with the residential market which makes employment with their firm volatile.
bad,The heading says it all.  Management is over worked and have a high stress of running a branch with minimal staff and high goals.
bad,"It's an ok place to work, I just wish I would have read the reviews first before starting to work for them. It's stressful at times and mainly the stress comes from management and not the customers."
bad,"It is a sales and not service driven environment. It seems like a good place to work, but it does not allow for flexibility to attend school or commit to evening sports or clubs. They pay you enough to string you along, but don't develop their personnel into management or partners."
bad,The pay is good but no care or consideration given to employees.  There is no sense of 'team' as we are unable to bond with our team or individual co-workers.  Training is too long at six weeks especially when they dwell on information that is a small part of the overall function.
bad,There is no corporate culture here to speak of. No team comraderie and a lousy training program which does not prepare one for their job.
bad,"Very fast pace, interact with client, solving problem with client regard their accounts, reach out to client with assist of new & update account promotion help increase sell of banking product. I worked for two Vice President Officer assistance. Use time management at all time. The hardest part of the job was leaving my work at work.  You feel like your client are your friend, were I feel good about what I do."
bad,"The company is too large. there is not enough staff for the size of the environment +250k users. There are quite a few manager who have never been to a management class, and although they may be an expert in the product they are managing, they have no clue on how to manage people."
bad,Chase has GREAT employee benefits and compensation.  Their scheduling system makes it difficult for families.  This is not a typical 9-5 Monday-Saturday banking system.  Scheduling depends on previous years highs and lows.  Do not expect the same schedule every week.
bad,"Offer paid job training, pay for required licenses. It is a sales position with the focus on customer service."
bad,"Chase benefits are the best benefits I have ever had. Call center is extremely stressful and requires strenuous time management, customer service, and interactions with management."
bad,"Compensation is good, vacation time is good, benefits are decent.  Many employees forfeit vacation days, work/life balance still seems to be an obstacle for the managerial staff to maintain."
bad,"good company, great culture, easy to climb up corporate ladder"
bad,minimum work/life balance for associates; just like every other company
bad,"Very chaotic system.  The Consumer Direct department grew beyond upper managements capabilities to properly over see operations.  Most of the daily stress involved was due to incompetence of lower level management.  We were told to do things one day, then find out the next day that information was wrong.  "
bad,"Monday thru Friday,"
bad,Chase took a chance on me back in 2010 having zero management experience and groomed me into the manager I am today.  My work day is full of surprises and I never know what the day will bring me.  I can have a plan for the day but as soon as the doors open new issues come up and I have to put my previous tasks on hold to handle time sensitive issues.  Chase has taught me how to multi-task with the best of them and the best part of this position is that every day brings new challenges and allows me to grow as an employee as well as manager.
bad,There is not much to offer the associates for development or advancement opportunities. Repetitive work coupled with low pay creates a low drive for associates to think outside the box for improvement.  Managers are more like baby sitters rather than managers that interact and look to develop the associates.
bad,"Reviewed and analyzed financial documentation received from customers(i.e. paystubs, bank statements, tax returns,etc) Worked very close with other employees for questions and opinions.  I enjoyed learning how to operate different systems within the department."
bad,"Chase Bank is the worst company. You cant move up in the company unless your part of the management click. They treat you like a slave with making calls and setting appointments. It is highly micro-managed. If you like planning your day every hour every day, this is the place for you."
bad,"understaffed, high turnover, unsupportive co workers, no work/life balance, too many hours, too many projects on top of regular job"
bad,"Fair compensation, but poor management and no room to move up to management for most lawyers."
bad,"Chase the company is a great place to work. If you are able to work for them, learn, and ask a lot of question. And always be willing to help out."
bad,"A typical day consist of operating and troubleshooting printers machines and cleaning."
bad,"I like working for banks, and big banks have one thing in common and that's ""too large to accomplish on time"" projects. That's my JPMC experience."
bad,"Each employee works under a strict blanket guideline"
bad,Great company to work for.  The employees are great to work with.  The atmosphere is very laid back.
bad,"Pipeline of loans to underwrite daily. Supported branches. Underwriitng files adding conditions or clearing conditions to get loans to funding. Layers of products and guidelines need to be followed, which makes the job difficult. Limitations within the systems used are aggrevating. Various levels of work arounds need to be followed to execute the job properly becuase of the system limitiations. Mid level managers were not flexible or supportive in understanding work life and family life balance. Enjoyed the training program. Real thorough and rigorous. The training staff was incredible."
bad,"Working as a personal banker for me was enjoyable, i was able to work with many different types of clients, and learn from all my interactions. I felt good about helping people set up their lives financially and maybe play small part in their happiness when they could save, buy a home, open a new business account, or just offer them a credit card that might improve their credit."
bad,"Team moved 8 times in less than a year, 5 different managers in same time period. Low pay , high expectations."
bad,the upper management does not know what the lower management is doing.  the lower management needs to take management classes and how to be a more effective manager.  JP Morgan has also moved departments to different states to get lower tax breaks .  The remaining employees are wishing that the chatsworth site be shut down.  That is how bad their management and HR is doing.
bad,"Sadly, I don't think there is a way to write this review without identifying myself and although the low ratings came from certain frustrations I had, I still wouldn't change a thing about my experiences. I was a part of a small team of ten from the three major lines of business within the firm. There are four people from Retail Banking, three from Credit Card Services, and I was a part of a three person team from Home Lending. While I did help with less intensive inquiries from the other two lines of business, my main focus was aiding borrowers, internal partners, and authorized vendors or 3rd parties with direct or indirect inquiries through Social Media. I really loved the work and what it meant to be a part of something that was helping the firm to advance into a new medium and a new way to communicate and help our customers as well as help manage the brand's reputation."
bad,Difficult place to succeed as politics and nepotism rule the culture.
bad,"Huntington main is not the branch to work for. Management is never on the same page and they pick"
bad,"Aggressively prepare all loan types (FHA, Conventional, HARP, and Full Doc) for preliminary underwriting approvals."
bad,"Management more bent on opening accounts and not building relationships with customers. I learned that in my next banking job that it should always be a 2 sided interview(they are interviewing me however i am interviewing the employer as well for similar traits, ideas and direction. The hardest part of the job was working with a manager that was not open to change either from upper management or associates. The most enjoyable part of my job was listening to customers and providing solutions to their everyday and future financial goals."
bad,Wasn't what I expected. I've worked for larger companies with less red tape.
bad,Learned what happens with loans after the foreclosure process is complete. I am a full-time contractor so I do not currently have benefits nor opportunity for advancement. The location is great and the people are even better. Layed back atmosphere.
bad,"Awesome company to work for. Just a few departments have horrible leadership which effects the floor specifially in San Antonio, Texas Fraud HotLine."
bad,Make too many changes not consistent. Not enough work space I was always looking for a desk to sit and begin working for the day. Some of the management is ok others need help with being professional and fair.
bad,Management was not always good. Company expected more than practical output from people. Culture was poor. Constant ways to save money cost more in the long run. Employee appreciation was poor. A real downgrade when Bank One was bought out by Chase.
bad,Management flaws. Employees last to know about any important news
bad,"This company has the right work life values in their creed however they do not practice it. The employees are consistently overworked and if you are a Chaseworks employee as I was, there is no reward for loyalty."
bad,"For the majority of the 7 years I was at Chase, I struggled.  First, it was with meeting the high production standards.  With my second job, I enjoyed at first and did well.  Then new management came in and my job changed. I struggled with the changes and received little coaching from management.   Management decided to bring someone in at a hire level for my job and eventually my job was eliminated."
bad,"Like most jobs the people tend to make it worth being around. There is a weird corporate feeling here. My direct supervisor was a spot of concern and slow growth of my group. It could really be a great place but he made it a place to hate to get up and go to. Constant finger pointing, horrible training and pitting people and the group against each other. "
bad,"Easy to learn the various job functions in the different depts.  However, the site has poor management/communication skills-upper management and management in general lacks effective communication between depts. and employees.  Workplace culture is all about the numbers-meeting quota.  Because it is productivity driven, overtime is typical on most days."
bad,"Manager very greedy for bonus, fired 3 tellers including myself instead of managing as a team she just fired who she thought was keeping her from getting her bonus. Had no patience whatsoever. New at her position, less then a year being a manager. Summerdale/Lincoln branch, Chicago,Illinois."
bad,It was a temporary job but overall good place to work. Didn't like how they paid us for all the work we did this was a very stressful job sometimes it could get hectic but I had a job to do.
bad,If you don’t mind shoving financial “solutions” down people’s throats and getting yelled at when you are declined this is the place for you. Managers are pushy and general/regional managers are worse. They put pressure for sales goals into the managers which trickles down to employees. This is not a conducive practice for a friendly work environment.
bad,A typical day at work would be mega calls from disgruntled customers. The management at Chase was okay. The workplace culture was okay. The hardest part of the job was too much scripting as was expected to follow a script to avoid negative coaching. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers.
bad,AVG place to work nothing special company in my opinion is changing they don't take care of the client like they did in the past SORRY for my opinion.
bad,Would constantly move good bankers around for no reason. All levels of management played favorites and would promote unqualified representatives to branch manager.
bad,"Its not a bad company to work for but I think they are becoming a micromanaged company and I personally don't like the micromanaging, they want to set times for you to make calls and take you off the floor but then you lose the commission that comes through the door, it hurts your pockets and their base pay is not too good compared to other banks. Some branches have a lot of foot traffic but others don't and they set expectations for calls not knowing the foot traffic they have thus causing inconvenience for customers waiting in the lobby then they ask why they are getting bad customer reviews, because there is no staffing!"
bad,"Pay was really good, but some managers, and HR was horrible. Most people there were great, but some would stab you in the back (most were female) if you weren't careful."
bad,".Managing ten (10) plus Team Managers and assist in operational oversight for customer service business function that consists of 100 + team members. Coach, counsel and develop direct and indirect employees. Have extensive knowledge of audits, risk, and operational management concepts to ensure all employees understand and deliver a positive impact of policy and procedural changes. Responsible for identifying and conveying potential problem areas, resolving complex issues, coordinating and overseeing projects and its accountability for budget management, ensuring all assigned areas are adequately staffed and all personnel are appropriately trained and developed"
bad,"My work experience was not a good one."
bad,This firm has grown too big to keep pace with the growing career culture for an individual and red tape bureaucracy has eaten  away the motivation and progression to work.
bad,"I was a temporary Helpdesk Technician working in a Call Center in Columbus, Ohio involved in taking calls and troubleshooting 12000 workers having problems working at J. P. Morgan CHASE."
bad,"I have never worked in a job that has been so stressful. Calls were back to back so you take about 100+ calls a day with little to no time off the phones.  Like you cannot even breath most days. And if a call drops in the middle you literally have another one right on top. Half the facility is on leave (for stress and depression) so you are constantly covering other departments calls or they move departments to other sites without hiring enough people to cover the transition."
bad,Was not happy. Cutthroat place to work. Great for a recent college grad with no family. Tuff to prospect for new clients because of the amount of service existing clients require.
bad,"I gained alot of experience at Chase, but toward the end, there was lay off after lay off. Early on I enjoyed working there, but then it became very stressful and working every single weekend."
bad,Compensation inadequate.  Lack of work/life balance.  My division shut down but my last manager was excellent and flexible but that is not the culture.
bad,"After major organizational change in June, management failed to reassure local staff consistency in corporate policy and transparency. At first seems to have many procedures, but actually there is no SOP or guidebook for individual business unit, and most of the time may result in disorientation or deep frustration. Too much time is wasted on bureaucracy and unnecessary ""process"" on different systems. The firm will need structural changes to retain abled staff."
bad,helped customers with banking transactions.  Balanced cash drawer and vault daily. Shipped and received cash shipments twice weekly.  Learned pretty good customer service skills.
bad,"Everything depends on who you are and who you know.   Now I understand this is typical of most places and life is all about networking.  But here, expectations are different when you are a worker you are expected to perform but if you are not a ""worker"" you are not held to the same expectations."
bad,"Days are spent answering calls for inbound call center. Hours are pretty straight: 8 hour work day, 1 hour lunch. Work is not overly complicated. Zero room for advancement. If you are okay settling for a role, the Mortgage department is for you."
bad,"boring, repetitive, not much advancement, team bonding was good, learned system quickly, learned about fraud, reading people,  candy, cash handling, referring to get debit or credit cards"
bad,"I have worked with Chase for 6 years. It can sometimes become stressful because of management and constant layoffs. Other than that, I enjoy working for the company."
bad,"I've worked for Chase for 6 years, and I make less money now than I did when I started. I have had no demotions. I'm on time and use vacation or other approved times for my days off. I've improved my skill set, been placed in leadership roles, and have good reviews from my managers. With all of that, the best this company can do, is give less than $1 raise a year. We receive no bonuses. They keep eliminating jobs, increasing our work load, making our review process more strenuous, but refuse to offer decent pay. This is a good place to come if you are just entering the job market fresh out of college, but I highly suggest after a year or 2 to find work with another company."
bad,There are many opportunities. You make the best of it to either be a job or a career for you. Some people absolutely love coming to work. Its truly the environment of each department that will either help motivate you or leave you to motivate yourself.
bad,"In JPMorgan from day one there is work allocation. There is no knowledge or training provided for work."
bad,"Backend KPO unit"
bad,My time working for JP Morgan Chase was very informative for me. I was able to gain more knowledge on process and procedures. I loved the 2 week training classes that were provided. I just wish management didn't play favorites.
bad,You will never feel any sense of security hear. If you work in Wilmington and your not part of the 'clique' you will be expendable. People in leadership roles have a very inflated opinion of themselves. You're expendable.
bad,"Large company with (theoretically) many opportunities for advancement; however, the majority of movement occurs based on those who are well known. Great benefits are available such as insurance, vacation, pension, and 401k. Long hours are required in most positions and high stress is usually a by product. The people make the company enjoyable and most management teams attempt to support their employees."
bad,"That was one of the worst places that I worked for. If I had question, there was nobody to ask. Once you got the hang of the job it was easy. It was very hard to always be attached to your phone."
bad,This metric driven culture is extremely combative and they encourage people to do what it takes to get ahead.  Collaboration was not the norm as upper management had 1 focus: grow grow grow.
bad,"The department I worked for did not focus on investor relations; rather, it focused on metrics. Agents were encouraged to keep conversations with clients short, as each call was timed. An agent was penalized if a call with a client exceeded a certain amount of time, which as I recall was around seven minutes. It was preferable, it seemed, to have a client call back as many times as necessary to receive full service and support for their particular concern."
bad,"Poor progression, 10-12 hour days expected as norm, repeat promises of promotion from management who then either leave or make excuses as to why it is not possible. "
bad,"Learned that there was a lot of change and hard to keep up with. Every small thing was scrutinized no matter how well the performance. When it comes to taking time off for personal things, it is very hard to do for situations when ""life happens"". Being sick is also something else that was no tolerated. Being sick, you cannot take the sick time or else it is an occurrence but if you go to work sick, you are not allowed time off the phone to go be sick in the bathroom. You are expected to be there no matter what the circumstance. The managers, although nice, were not very helpful when it comes to personal stats. It took an entire year for someone to point out that stats needed to be fixed, well after the time frame for a new employee to set in bad habits.otherwise, managers practiced favoritism when it came to discipline between employees for the same issue. Otherwise, depending on which team you get set on, the customers are snotty and rude more often than you are warned about in training and virtually impossible to please. The senior employees do not take into consideration that the newer employees have the most recent training and may have a information for them as well. Older employees are not acceptable to newer employees."
bad,Good work life balance. Great benefits. Company culture is average. Not a lot of room for professional growth and advancement. Industry as a whole is experiencing a lot of changes and is not beneficial for most employees.
bad,I was not comfortable with work environment. Longs works are demanding. Not relevant of my expertise and not as per the expectations.  People are good but stick to their work most of the time. No other activities involved in work place
bad,"I worked for Chase for 3 years and I was able to advance very quickly, but my pay was never what it should have been for the amount of work was asked of me. Asking for a raise would have been shot down immediately and the management at Chase is set up to only care about themselves. They act like they want to further your career but really only care about your performance because it directly effects their paycheck. A typical day is usually jam packed with an abundance of activities to keep you busy, none of which are actually part of your job title. Your co-workers are often the best part of the job because Chase really wants a team to be effective and efficient. Management styles vary immensely and you can always find someone else who is willing to do what you want. I liked working for Chase because the benefits were awesome, but I never liked my job in semi-management because the company will take advantage of you. They don't give you the title, nor the pay of management, but ask you to complete managerial tasks on the daily"
bad,"After 17 years, I had one annual review where my supervisor said I just ""met"" expectations.  All other reviews received Over 16+ years were highly favorable and I was considered to exceed expectations.  Just prior to receiving this average review, I had been out on an approved medical leave of absence for 6 months.  When I returned I was really struggling to get back into the work flow.  I told the supervisor many times that I was struggling and needed some training on things that had changed during my leave. I never received any help and as a result i did not received a high rating on my annual review. Shortly after my review, I was advised that they needed to reduce the number of people in my current role and based on the last review period, I was being laid off as my peers work performance was rated higher than mine. I had been through so many changes and challenges with this company over 17 years. I never expected one mediocre review would cost me my position. In the end, I was just a number and all that I had done and accomplished was irrelevant."
bad,"Very hard to share objective review as information  is based on circumstantial  events during employment and changes around LOB."
bad,"Branch Manager duties include:"
bad,A great place to get started in the IT field.  A friendly environment with supportive people.  The politics can be overwhelming but is manageable.  You will experience great personal and professional growth.
bad,"Fair compensation, benefits, paid time off, and decent job security.  But everything is micromanaged, all employees are treated like a number instead of a person, and no one enjoys the work environment."
bad,"If you are looking to acquire hard skills great place to learn and leave. No space for opportunity or growth."
bad,"I learned a lot when I was at JPM. However, it's who you know...not what you know. Management is ok... again it's who you eventually align yourself with that matters. Some managers are really good while others are a perfect example of sociopaths in the work place."
bad,"big company. great pay. great benefits. "
bad,"be very careful what group you get into and make sure you have a good rapport with your boss."
bad,Didn't like the call center environment.  Management was okay as long as you applied yourself and requested more responsibility.
bad,I experience was probably one of the worst of every job I had.  First when I came back from training after having the memorize 17 chapters pf chase and federal laws...my manager separated me from my co workers and left me by myself which made me very nervous. Then customers were rude to me because they didnt want me as an african american to handle their money. I literally had customer walk away from my line and go to someone the were familiar with. Made me feel terrible. Last I was making careless mistakes and they were not being corrected by management until one day my draw was extremely short because of something I did wrong and then two weeks later they fired me..within those two weeks I was not allowed behind teller windows and until this stay I still dont know what I did wrong to learn from it. Smh I hope everyone experience is different from mines because I would never recommend anyone to work to the particular branch where I worked.
bad,No career mobility in Production. Staff is always trying to throw workers under the bus.
bad,"Daily operations and compliance and ensuring regulations are being followed. Preformed Branch Manager duties in his absence. Responsibilities also included motivating, coaching, training and developing with documentation so that it would assist with annual and semi-annual performance review.  Directed morning huddles to ensure the plan for the day with focus on the customer experience. Daily reviewing of signature cards and assisting with account openings."
bad,"During the time of Feb 2014 to May 2014."
bad,"The office environment can be pleasant, however, that heavily depends on the team you work on. Certain teams work non-stop and they expect you to stay very late, people even come in on the weekends. I have seen that many times – and find that absurd for an executive assistant. If you decide to stop working those long hours they will look for excuses to let you go and you have no warning, even if you are already working 50+ hours. Management is lacking in their communication skills and the turnaround period for assistants is very high. Overall I was not impressed with JP Morgan."
bad,I SONYMA mortgages and refreshed my knowledge of FHA guidelines
bad,"During my time with JPMorgan Chase I came to learn quickly from co workers that my time there may not be as pleasant as thought to be. During the first few months things ran smoothly but soon began to learn that management wasn't very ideal. I had three different managers during the two years there and only one seem confident and fit for the job to lead, motivate, and support its employees. Making it seem leaderships skills in the company may not of been as a priority."
bad,helping customers in a fast paced environment with all their banking needs.
bad,There's no place for advancement or job growth! Health benefits and vactions are great.
bad,"A typical day at chase is really joyful mostly because of the customers. Great customers will make any branch joyful, and especially being able to make the customer experience great. What I learned during my employment with chase is that, customers are what matter the most, when I first started there chase was all about numbers but they were loosing a lot of valuable customers because of their bad customer service. What I did gain from chase is new friendship, something like a family, with great people. The hardest part of the job is when my old manager left and then we go the worst manager ever, who tore the branch apart. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and helping them leave satisified and the family that I gained from there."
bad,"JP Morgan Chase is a very fast-paced environment undergoing a company-wide transformation, which is affording individuals the opportunity to expand their skill set and advance in their career"
bad,Chase is good in the sense that it has benefits like insurance and 401k but don't expect much room for growth. They do not help you advance at all.
bad,"JP Morgan Chase has everything it takes to be a great employer.  The company offers competitive salary, a decent benefits package, thorough training programs, and a positive tone in all communications sent from upper management.  However, there I witnessed a breakdown at the lower management level that made working for Chase bank unpredictable and unpleasant for most employees."
bad,"Despite a great work schedule, compensation plans do not justify the amount of work put in. Regular pay changes occur, typically created to sound good however never benefit the employee. As a mortgage banker I took a large paycut soon after getting hired going into 2014 and was told I could no longer work overtime. This is after establishing myself as one of the higher producers. I am already stuck looking for a new job. Constant threat of layoffs and restrictions."
bad,"We were advised in November that they were closing the call centre in March. They helped with job fairs, severance, benefits opportunities, time off for interviews, and were great to help us all get new jobs and upgrade our skills."
bad,"The pay is good and pension/401k are great.  Changes made since volume has slowed down are so drastic it's as if they're trying to push employees out the door.  Those changes being - No longer allow flex schedule or work from home.  Eagerness to let employees go after minor mistakes also seems to support this."
bad,"The work is good here, so are the perks.However one can lose out on work-life balance."
bad,"Given the right co-workers I enjoyed being at work, but the actual work was pretty mind numbing and the actual work changed from day to day depending on whether or not we were told what to expect. Changes in HOW to do the task started off as infrequent meetings then turned into constant discussions amongst ourselves and sometimes with supervisors on what to do. It became clear that no one really knew the exact rules on how to do the job right."
bad,My co-workers were great hard-working and honest. I enjoyed enacting with all the different customer's that came into the bank.
bad,When I were an employer at chase bank. My hours were from 7am-3:30pm Friday- Tuesday. I learned alot at chase bank. I learned how to process deposits before deadline. I also learned how to follow instructions for each document. The hardest part of the job were not to get any errors. I really enjoy opening mail and processing on time and be able to wake up every morning to go to work.
bad,Working at chase gave me a chance to work with peoples money and I quickly realized it was not for me.Management was fine coworks were fine too.The hardest part of my day was working with money all day not feeling like I am making a diff in peoples lives.
bad,"I always had to check my emails, if i wasnt there a lot of things wouldnt get done. I had 8 to 10 processors who counted on me to get their stuff done so they could finish their loans. I was everyone's right hand girl. I loved that i was so busy and everyone counted on me, but then again that also was a downfall, if i got sick and couldnt make it to work i would fall behind fast because of how much they demand from me."
bad,"I worked for Chase for many years. I was a proud and loyal employee. I put in my time, took positions that were asked of me, and cancelled many vacations because the ""needed"" me. I recently left because my district manager asked for my resignation because I stood up to her and did not cancel my approved scheduled vacation. Chase has great benefits, and if you are willing to give up your personal life, is a great company. They also have a lot of members in management that are clueless. They make very bad hiring decisions because they hire people that will do exactly what they say, personal and professional."
bad,"Depends on the team, but a lot of politics which is somewhat standard for big companies like this. Personal preference for work environment but many find that this culture creates a stressful work environment and unnecessary anxiety."
bad,The market expansion they are doing is a hot mess in many areas. Very unorganized and unprofessional. Be prepared to do alot of work for little recognition. ALOT of favoritism/sexism. Management is laughable. Ask alot of questions if you're going to apply. Talk to others. Be very vocal about your personal goals within any branch role. If you have a degree I suggest you not even apply to market expansion role unless you just really love sales. Be as patient as you possible can and NETWORK. No one will respect you if you just show up to work and do your job. You must FINESSE
bad,Chase pays well and has excellent benefits. They have a diverse culture. Demands and goals are high and not easily achieved. They are behind as far technology goes however are trying to advance but sacrificing jobs while doing it. . Management shows favoritism
bad,"I feel that the company doesn't truly set you up for being successful and then once you are actually on the phone taking calls your so confused, because it has been a while since you been on the computer to even remember the little you learned from the classroom setting. Theirs no real live examples in training, you could not take any of their material home with you to study with, and you can only and I mean only access the material from your work computer. This leaves you no time to look over things because you have to be taking calls your entire shift. They have an extremely bad software application for customers who wants a Home Equity line of credit and the list goes on and on. If you do not meet a certain level of leads within training when you are in the bullpen, you will not have to worry about graduating, because they will have your potential manager fire you instead. They have grounds to do so anytime within those three months before you officially be on your actual team and call yourself a Chase employee. Never will I ever come back to this company! Go Luck"
bad,I really liked my job at chase till one day I was told no more GTI workers in Chicago.     Was told I did not meet the “location strategy”.  6 years and then bye bye.  Not sure why they decided this.  Stuck at associate level with no chance for advancement.  Bonuses for GTI also small.  No openings in Chicago in any departments with my skills.  So going off to another role outside chase.  They loose I gain since others pay more.
bad,"Lots of opportunity to learn but the work life balance is lacking. Expectation is to work 50-60 hours per week. The pay is very good for most, but it comes with a price. Life away from home!!! Politics at a large company is to be expected, but it's sometimes take priority and prevents free thinkers and thinking outside the box or challenging the status quo with innovation."
bad,"This is one of the largest banks in the world.  You get to put that your resume.  Tons of bureaucracy, old school hierarchy, but you'll have the opportunity to learn whatever you want to put in outside of work!"
bad,"Not a very friendly Company to work for, the current management was not stable enough to continue to have a great culture to be around. Management didn't follow thru on anything"
bad,If you can handle a lot and I meant a lot of stress it's ok. But they like to throw a lot of things at toh at once and the day it's not enough to finish. But they dont care.
bad,I have nothing whatsoever to say about this company.  I am not interested in providing feedback regarding this company.  I have absolutely nothing at all to say.
bad,Chase provides a good package of benefits and the salary is competitive. The problem with the company is that you get stuck where you are needed and they really don't care about your aspirations. They are so competitive within their sites that if you are a top performer you will never leave either your department and your position.
bad,"Worked in the investment bank.  Compensation is good, but the culture is very old school and degrading.  There are a lot of egos and a clear lack of respect from many in management positions."
bad,Terrific company. Leaving because of job elimination. ..................................................................................................................learned reporting techniques. excel...time management.  Lots of independent projects.  Never the same tasks on daily basis.  People are friendly....lots of volunteer opportunities.  Community focused.
bad,"Chase offers great training to anyone new to the industry.  You will develop your sales skills and product knowledge fairly quickly.  To me, it lacks in areas of personal touch or management.  The idea of having multiple conference calls as an effective tool to grow your business only has an impact if the calls have anything helpful to say. Instead it seems they have calls to just have them.  "
bad,"Very stressful work environment, training opportunities very limited. Work environment group centered not team oriented.  Difficult to balance personal and work demands."
bad,"Not all branches are cut from the same cloth and there are locations that are fine to work in.  However, too often one will find themselves faced with an entitled, dictatorial manager that has little regard for you or your work needs."
bad,"- Your only a number and they have no issues with making that clear."
bad,I was not trained properly and was transferred to another department after 6 months which I believe was due to performance directly related to the poor training I was given. I have never worked in a professional setting with such informal disorganized training. I was often ignored by managements who treated their job as a social gathering. I am an ex military family man so I did not participate in happy hour after work I went to work to do a job. The hours and benefits were good but the lower level managers made it seem like a high school. I am not sure how they still have jobs the management was so poor and unprofessional.
bad,"Managers here are underqualified, nice, but do not know what they're doing. Incredibly frustrating. Massive organization, this lends to confusion in work responsibilities."
bad,"I very much enjoyed working with my employees, they were always eager to learn to ensure incentives and a healthy competition with their co-workers. I also really liked that I got close with my colleagues because we could count on one-another for help, managing each other's teams when one of us was out of the office, and the general support of each other's success. The hardest part of the job was micro-managing people. While it was a call center, it was rather difficult from a morale perspective, to hold employees accountable for every single minute they're not on the phone."
bad,Overall people are nice but the cultural is in regulatory shock and afraid to grow.  It feels like the joy of working is not existent and the happiest times are around 4pm when you start to pack up for the day.
bad,Went through 5 managers and 2 district managers in 3 1\2 years. Was salary and overworked constantly due to management changes. They do have an excellent benefits program.
bad,"They love documentation and have templates galore. Only problem is that the documents I was given to refer to were little more than templates. This technical debt is going to bite them eventually."
bad,Co-workers made this a fun place to work besides them I will not miss this place. There is not opportunity for advancement if your just now starting you will pretty much be a part-time 20 hour  employee. Managers promise advancement but almost 2 years later still on development plan. Managers are focused on their personal job security.
bad,The job is not hard but you have to  maintain the call criteria within a certain time. they listen to each call for coaching purposes and are very diligent in letting you know what needs to be improved but they do it extremely tactfully and its a learning aid. Its only meant  to help.
bad,The manager I worked with was not very warm and had no time to work with associates.  As a contract worker you are highly expendable and you don't get paid for holidays or days off.
bad,"Compliance turned the position into the ""Land of No-you-can't""...Coupled with lack of local supervisory motivation to accomplish the goals we had set."
bad,Ok company. Great benefits but management sucks.  Its hard to move up in company and there are too many politics. Wish they could have invested money and allowed the team to gain certifications during the time of employment there.
bad,"Chase has a lot of benefit like 16 week maternity leave, 3 weeks paid vacation, and sick time. Chase also has other benefit like employee discount and health care. Retirement pension and 401 K."
bad,good coworkers good people good programs bad attendance culture. micro managing never succeeds happiness. If the attendance policy was a little more flexible this company would have a better rating.
bad,"Benefits are the ONLY reason I haven't left this company. Mangers nor departments are ever consistent. People who meet goal are also treated like those who don't, sad."
bad,"all employees need to be given the tools to successes and should be treated equal.Innovative, if you are a new employee to the the organization you are expected to know every thing and they do not train you on every thing, which makes it difficult for some that does not catch on fast to learn, plus first selection of vacation days are always given to the people that have been with the company the longest, so if you are new, you will never have time off with your family on the holidays"
bad,"Company says all of the right things, but practice is not consistent with what it preaches. Horrible managers that are promoted based on time and not ability."
bad,Job was great management did not fight for me when accused of something they know I would never do just sat quietly and let me lose my job.
bad,"As the ABM I was responsible for all operations of my branch and the employees knowledge and practice of said operations. On any given day I performed transactions for customers as well as problem solved any and all issues customers might have. My responsibilities were to make sure all employees were scheduled properly, monitored attendance, instruct and teach policy and procedures, supply guidance and override transactions that exceeded limits. I also ordered supplies and maintained stock for all work items within the branch, kept track of Profit and Loss numbers posted monthly. In the absence of the branch manager I was also responsible his duties on any given day. Opened and closed the branch, made sure all security procedures were followed and AML/Compliance rules and regulations were in effect and followed daily."
bad,"Get to learn a lot and worked on lot of new technologies. Lot of weekend work management dont care how hard you work, no comp offs."
bad,A typical day consisted of helping customers complete their transactions and also developing relationships with them. The hardest part of the job was to deal with angry customers.
bad,"They have a lot of layoffs.This is all I have to say, The hardest part as when you put in for a short term disability after having surgery and you get a call that you are laid off.."
bad,i work within wealth management but unfortunately i work inside a branch. you will get called on to do things for the bank that are outside of your LOB and will essentially take away from the work you are there to do.
bad,typical day at work review case load.  working to development management skills need to reach my set goals. enjoy learn and teach from co worker.
bad,"If you want to learn how to manage your career like a pro, there are a TON of ladder climbers in this organization constantly positioning themselves for advancement. Watch and learn."
bad,fun place to work although the ppl are loud there is not much security to keep the people quiet around their booths
bad,"Chase is everything the Wamu adds of the past would accuse them of being.  A very stodgy bank, focused on on the customer but on keeping costs down and profits high."
bad,"Started work by pulling reports and QC sample sizes to be assigned to team members. I learned how to write, edit and use procedures to QC others. I basically worked on my own compiling QC Audit reports and presented them to my manager on a weekly basis, was present for monthly procedure meetings reporting trends. "
bad,"A typical day at work included checking the risk queue for potential fraudulent activity occurring on customer's debit cards. This would entail validating purchases as being legit, or deeming the purchases as being fraud and blocking the customer's card. After the first hour of work, the phones were live for outbound/inbound calls. There was an immense amount of calls per day (roughly 90), all dealing with reporting fraud, or verifying purchases as being legit and unblocking previously blocked cards."
bad,Learned a lot from JP Morgan Chase Bank. Good work life balance. Good culture values.
bad,"I worked there for only a couple months, but realized the dysfunctional processes they have there. No accountability, repeatative work that was already completed. The reasoning for that is due to lack of system technology that did not communicate with each other. I was lucky enough to have a manager that new the business, however when opinions were asked on how to make the process better, it was just a waste of time. Needless to say I left a company I was with for, for 6 years for the money they were offering. It was definitely not worth it."
bad,"As a Modification Junior Underwriter, the pay starts off great but sometimes you take the stress at home; worrying about if the Home Owner is going to get foreclosed on. Medical Benefits are one of the best I had in years. Getting paid every 2 weeks is great. Management and business units have high expectations of their employees with sometimes unreasonable deadlines and closings. Advancement within departments or other departments is obtainable but the HR process in knowing if you have the job or not can take up to 1-2 months. Having a position in most departments requires minimal requirements and mostly a high school degree with minimum 1 year in Customer Service/Mortgage Banking. Work/Life Balance; there is not much there because you are constantly mentally and physically bringing the work with you. There are no culture values. Everything is about making numbers versus quality."
bad,The work is tedious and there’s a huge disparity between what tellers and bankers make compared to management. Branch managers make nearly double what their employees do yet they do less work. Health benefits and paid time off are better than average (low deductibles and 3 weeks vacation from day 1) but it doesn’t really make up for the abysmal pay and “customer is always right” mindset that allows people to walk all over you
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years , The benefits are great , the environment is laid back , Call center and the management is very laid back until you make a mistake, there are metrics and call monitors that could jeopardize your career , make a mistake and you could be out, a lot of employees has taken stress leave because of the metrics, not a career for everyone,"
bad,I enjoyed working there. Everyone in the mailroom were very friendly and willing to help out. It was a temporary position so I only worked during peak times.
bad,I’m a hard worker And I’m a team player I love helping people out when there need it and it a good place to work at u mean new people everyday it was a good  experience to work at chase bank
bad,"I was newly diagnosed a terminal illness and my world became a mess of fmla requests, approvals, denials, appeals and so on and so forth. If management had taken time to look at the human and not numbers, April would have been my 13th year working at JP Morgan Chase."
bad,It was an ok experience working for Chase to say the least. It’s great to have them on your resume and the customer service skills that are attained will be very useful in the future.
bad,"It deponents on which location you work at,deal with different kinds of customer could be stressful. Also short staffs and poor management are around in this workplace."
bad,"I worked for this company for 5 years , The benefits are great , the environment is laid back , Call center and the management is very laid back until you make a mistake, there are metrics and call monitors that could jeopardize your career , make a mistake and you could be out, a lot of employees has taken stress leave because of the metrics, not a career for everyone,"
bad,"The offices are open planned and very loud. People are constantly on phone calls. The training and encouraged culture seems very false and “American”. I did not find the work interesting or fulfilling. The trend I could see in those teams around me were 50% those who were there 10+ years and 50% new hires. The amount of job openings, the hundreds of graduates and interns they take shows they have a high turnover of people. It truly depends on what suits you best but this jobs not for me."
bad,"It's a great company but many of my peers were not so great. Also, outside we had a lot of homeless people selling items and it would be smelly. The customers were very rude"
bad,"super stressful, super high paced, good for temporary work if you just need $. However, the potential of growth in this company seems high but I could not make it that far."
bad,"I would never work for this company again but as always it depends who your manager is. There is no work life balance, they removed work mobiles and expect you to have everything on your personal device."
bad,"Due to being one of the largest companies, there are plenty of opportunities for growth within and coaching available along the way via management. Good company for someone just getting into the business."
bad,If you go through temp agency they treat you like nothing. Not organized and a lot of back stabbing people there.  The overnight supervisor is terrible.
bad,"The were very good in doing things for disaster areas, sending financial assistance. They also did a blood drive every 3 or  months, but some departments would pay you to donate and some departments make you go on your own time"
bad,Great company to work for with high standards and great customer service. Highly educated team.  Supportive managers and great culture. Really enjoying working such environment.
bad,"I was happy with this job while working in Dallas closing the finished product per client. The hardship came when my choice to relocate to the new facility consisted of 4 hours of travel, working 10 hour days 3 days a week. When I switched positions is when negativity began."
bad,"A great place to get a jump start on a career in financial sale industry."
bad,"I had the world's best manager, but the company is the problem.  Company does not care about employees.  Pay cut were given to many people that I know.  Several of my former coworkers were fired for ridiculous reasons.  I left before that could happen!"
bad,"No room for movement, dull role, don't work to develop talent. The management is not good. Compared to other banks they don't pay well at all and they do not retain their people."
bad,"Dress code is relaxed compared to some places. Chase does not pay well for anyone with long term experience, and all bonuses and incentives were taken away, making the pay even worse."
bad,"Very Hectic busy schedules, very strong controls"
bad,"My team leader was really unprofessional and unfair. You make less than average person in that job. Definitely make you overwork with too much stress. Only good thing is, the name looks great on resume."
bad,"I would receive calls and answer questions about a customers account, anything they needed to know."
bad,"Typical corporate america work. Expect to do your work, meet the standard and act polite. Don't complain or ask too many probing questions. Build relationships..that's the ticket."
bad,"Typical day at work is roughly 10 hours and if you do not work the requested overtime you are constantly called out in team meetings for your lack of dedication. There is no work/home life balance. Pay is good, but lower than that of others in the industry while constantly having more items added to the already lengthy job duties."
bad,Main focus is satisfying the customer. Learning and understanding the products and pay close attention to the information you are providing if you are unsure get assistance dont provide wrong information. The direct managers are pretty good because the see the day to day task its the ones that sit in the big offices that seem to not care. The hardestpart of the job is constanst change that not everyone knows about at the same time. The most enjoyable is the people around you and the fact that you are able to help someone in need.
bad,"Work/Life balance = Little to none."
bad,"I work at JP Morgan seasonal under Manpower. I feel they need to work on getting better leaders, their are only a few. They also need to work on treating adults like adults sometimes. I am starting to feel that JP Morgan is not organize far as their work flow. I go to JP Morgan to work and might not get to work. They also make a lot of mistake with our work pay, sometimes they pay me a Clerical worker salary when I am a Data Entry worker."
bad,Good place to work with lots of opportunity and career growth at the same time ample trainings to keep you updated with latest technology trends. Tremendous experience
bad,"Very boring job. You sit all day and cannot make tying mistakes. You enter sensitive information from one form to another. The hardest part of the job is all the sitting, unless that is something you like."
bad,"didn't appreciate employees, spoke to employees as if she was in the street. She was always at her desk watching others while she did nothing but shop online."
bad,"The downtown office was a great location, that allowed for convenient public transportations options.  I also enjoyed being in downtown Phoenix atmosphere."
bad,I learned the ins and outs of banking. They never gave significant raises even though I was constantly praised for my customer services abilities.
bad,I enjoyed working here but it's easy to disappear in the crowd. It's was a solid job and I thought it was a great start to my career but i didn't want to be there long term.
bad,"This is very fast paced customer service call center. Must have a great outgoing personality, dont mind customers being rude. Be polite, and ask supervisor if help needed. If you have young kids or family, not the job for you."
bad,A typical day here consisted of making calls to my sales reps to see how much inventory we have on hand to sell. How the workload is administered and the quota for the next month.
bad,I was laid off by this company and given the opportunity to move with no pay or time to find an apartment. I felt that I was only left to take severance. i was without a full time job for over 2 years. I felt no loyalty and was completely disheveled at that time in life.
bad,"JP Morgan was a learning experience into the Government for me, and how banks manage accounts for them. My dept handled corp cards for various government agencies."
bad,"Proven experience in training, reporting, auditing and process improvement.  Recognized for exhibiting integrity, interpersonal communication skills, self-motivated and energetic, and consistently achieving high levels of productivity in a dynamic work environment."
bad,"A typical day at work: average 11 hours"
bad,"Typical day at work involved performing proof and reconciliation, financial analysis and accounting. Co-workers were not very supportive and very detrimental to personal growth."
bad,This position will soon be obsolete because of the new technology rolling out and with tellers and ABM loosing their positions its only a matter of time when they have to let go of the tellers
bad,"I learned to use the shopping cart method at Chase, where I take all the good and leave the bad behind. Very cut throat at times, But overall, great training."
bad,"Excellent physical working conditions.  Relatively poor management.  Poor chances of advancement.  lack of concrete objectives and inability to review management.  This results in poor communications between management and staff.  This was surprising to me, based on the communications from the executive suite and the expressed goals of the firm."
bad,Large bank environment who did not value mortgages or its employees.  Mortgage was secondary to other parts of the organization.  Environment was harsh to employees.
bad,"Solid part time job for anyone who is still in school."
bad,"My time at Chase was spent by doing the exact same thing every day , all day, every 7 minutes.  Also I had to be taking phone calls from auto dealers though out the day.  Auto dealers can be very condescending, rude and sometimes hostile."
bad,No management support for employees.  No flexibility in outreach to the community with regard to bringing in business.  Could not close loans due to antiquated loan processing and management inflexibility.
bad,Researching inquiries within various departments as needed.  Constantly changing workflow and meetings with management.  Family oriented co-workers who are social and work as a Team.  Difference in time zones is a challenge.  Providing customers with a positive response to their questions.
bad,Always focused on employees! Management worked one on one with you often! Plenty of room for advancement. Unfortunately they have began to outsource to other countries and closing locations in the states.
bad,"Co-workers are nice.  Vacations were denied if additional work was expected to come in, even though a vacation was approved months earlier"
bad,"A strong work ethic is encouraged "
bad,Hard company to work for. They expect a lot with low compensation. Very difficult to move ahead. Chaotic and constantly changing atmosphere.
bad,It's an ok place to work if you love sitting down all day. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. I like how the break schedule is set up.
bad,Get to interact with other employees.  Take lunch breaks together.  Clock in on time and get to leave early.  May not have to work on the weekends.
bad,Very nice company to work for; team work and independent responsibilities.
bad,Management really pushes you to the limit. Definitely not recommended.
bad,I was selling a lot of phones and rasp. you will advance only if you sell a lot and add rasp with batteries other than that you won't make it far. Was fun but the company isn't the same anymore
bad,"Great Culture, however this site has opened and closed at least once or twice."
bad,"This is a huge organization with lots of learning opportunities, but tends to be very compartmentalized."
bad,The most important part of this job was timing. Every part of the position had a evaluation.
bad,Hi performance and multi-tasking a must. Great Customer Service is the key to profitability.  Ability to be a team player is also an important attribute to success.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to help someone when they need it and the best part is closing a transaction knowing that you have put your customer in a better financial position that they are pleased with.
bad,"High-intensity environment. Senior management and regulatory demands. Requires strong individuals with drive and determination."
bad,"	Setting up targets and goals for the process – setting and maintaining targets for the process.  "
bad,Corporate with very little room to excel or advance. Promote those that are not qualified and do very little to retain quality talent.
bad,Go in get my boxes of accounts that need to be processed and enter the information into the account
bad,"Great short term job.  Pays higher than competitors for a reason, so people are less inclined to leave when other opportunities arise.  You would think this is a good thing until you learn that the company has no stability in the mortgage division, and has almost no opportunity to move within the firm if you are on a higher tier of salary."
bad,"Learned a great deal about every facet of banking, asset management, and credit/capital advisory"
bad,"Senior staff members lack training in; personal connection, company culture, career advancements, minority recognition."
bad,A typical day was very long and streesful at this job.I learned that i adjust well to strees and challenges.Mangement at this Company was very munipulative and was not willing to help employees that they did not befriend.The hardest part of my JOB WAS how fast things would change literally from minute to minute something could change that fast.The most enjoyable part of the job was going home then being laid off I hated the job with a strong passion.
bad,As a corporate credit card fraud analyst you are in a call center environment.  Each day you are attached to your phone while reviewing credit card activity day in and day out.  The training was great and my co workers a great help in learning about fraudulent activity.
bad,"•a typical work day is typical"
bad,"I learned how to process a loan from start to finish."
bad,"I was a loan officer at Chase who covered several branches in midtown NYC. My daily tasks were to cover the branch clients mortgage needs, reach outside the branch to find new business and manage my current pipeline."
bad,"On a typical day I read all the emails in my inbox, attend daily huddle."
bad,Tough work environment.  Typically ask for the impossible.  Top down do pressures.
bad,"I got laid off, jobs were outsourced to India. I was trained for the position and then told that my department was being outsourced within the year."
bad,"The intellectual capital at JPM is great, but the work environement is very demanding wih long hours."
bad,"The department was charged with attempting to collect 30,000 previously a charged off accounts with balances between $500 and around $50,000, some of which had not seen any activity for five or more years.  Over a long period of time, the company instructed me and hundreds of other employees in my area to engage in illegal behavior in connection with collecting delinquent accounts. They have since been cited for these practices by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and have been or will be fined, and have also lost a number of lawsuits and class actions involving the same practices. Managers were under such pressure to produce results that they were willing to say and try anything--direct threats, snooping, contests that were won by chance rather than by effort or skill, weird feedback to try to get employees to work harder, even though expected answer rate from phone calls was only 2 percent, and was actually about .3 percent, making opportunities quite scarce."
bad,in a year and a half I experienced a major change in co workers as well as management. upper management has brought the work environment from extremely poor to bearable.
bad,"Friendly environment to work with, working from home facility."
bad,"a typical day is doing data entry for, for this department, and indexing the cases for court orders .Learning lots of information about different levy's that we process. some of the coworkers are great. learning all the legal things  is the hardest part of this position. learning different things about the position this this is a temp assignment  I cant do everything .there are some things we wont learn     "
bad,"If you like sales and competing with other workers to meet your sales goals, then this is the job for you. I enjoyed my position as a Small Business Banker, and co-workers. I think JPMorgan Chase is a great company to work for, its too sad that it hires less than qualified individuals to manage their branches. "
bad,No work life balance. You work through your lunch you are just a number and management is horrible. 
bad,I learned that it does not matter if you have 100% on your quality because this company only cares about quantity. They will get rid of you if your even a tid bit behind their high quantity marks.
bad,Very large corporate bank with lots of room for advancement. Very diverse working enviroment.
bad,would be at work few minutes before the time i was due to start. i would pull up all the systems i needed for the day so that at the time i was due to start i was able to get right to work. if there was something i needed to tell management i would try to do so before i started that day or i would try on my breaks. if that did not work for some reason i would send an email. the hardest part of my job was to make the goal that they set for everyone. we all had the same goal. it was some times way to high to make asit was are to get the customer to do what they have to do to save there home. the enjoyable part of my job was that if i needed help i worked with a great team that was willing to help me with on the job and out of work as well.
bad,the department I'm in is extremely disorganized. The left hand doesn't know what that right hand is doing most of the time. Policies and procedures in place could be beneficial.
bad,"I liked Chase but some of the management should not be in the position. Very difficult to work for high turn over rate, the management team had their favorites if you were not one you would be let go."
bad,Their Management team is to be desired / If you are thinking on having a career with JP Morgan Chase / document every detail / Keep a Journal
bad,The pay was good when I started but then they become less generous. Be prepared to teach yourself everything because there's no direct set of procedures and  you're in it for yourself. The managers say they'll help you but never do. Clients can also be annoying and follow up constantly. Also they MICRO MANAGE HARD so be prepared !
bad,Is a good job except if do not get good surveys from customers is 90% of your score card. You get fired. Or warning letters also very unprofessional team leaders. Call quality personal not very well trained.
bad,"Teller is high turn over rate position within the company. Low job security, a lot of tellers got fired for unfair reasons in chase. They could hired you within 2 week, and fired you immediately once they thought you have performed lower than their expectation. Commission is jok for teller position in chase. Average commission for per teller could be around 10-35 dollar per month. So don’t ever expect the job could provide a good commission."
bad,"There's lots of downtime because of online banking. Usually customers come from business's to deposit cash or customers come in for ""Certified checks"" (money orders or cashier checks). It is a good job for someone that doesn't mind having downtime and making a decent wage. Making your way up in the company is definitely possible and is highly encouraged!"
bad,"Good reputation and deal flow"
bad,Not thrilled with management.Getting over worked and stressful. Didn't feel like I worked at the right branch. Dissapointed
bad,"Great company to work for with many internal opportunities. Ability to relocate with many locations across the US. Good medical benefits and 401K, great employee discounts."
bad,Professional atmosphere and very good workers. Very fast paced
bad,Cuthroat organization which pits employees against each other
bad,They help who they want within the company. So unfair. It's ok to work there but if you want to move around in the company good luck. It's who you know when it comes to this.
bad,"Good Management is very scarce. A lot of ""shady"" business. They don't care about their employees. Only money."
bad,"I face challenges in my domain on a daily basis . This is the most enjoyable part of my job. "
bad,"8.30 to 6.30"
bad,"You will experience longevity in a company."
bad,"I was responsible for reviewing a loan document. I really enjoyed servicing on this department, worked with great management staff, that helped me grow and develop as a employee also build close relationships with all my fellow co-workers, the most enjoyable part was everything i learned about underwriting loan. Overall Chase is an excellent place to work."
bad,A typical day at work would be the bankers out in the lobby and trying to sit down with all the clients that come in. I learned how to review a customers profile and determine if there are any problems on their account. My co workers were fun to work with. Management was difficult because of our location. The hardest part of the job was setting up appointments. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
bad,"I enjoyed working there and I got most of management experience working there. I worked in many different areas at Chase. "
bad,"This job was great at first, but over time a lot of promises became empty - extremely bad staffing issues never got better - cutting departments and promising to hire more people - never happened. This became extremely frustrating and made work miserable on a daily basis."
bad,"Just not the right place to build your career, great company overall but do not look at jpmchase as the company to grow and build your career. Unless you’re looking to be stuck in one position for 4 Years ."
bad,"Very stressful. Customers calling in and Cursing at you from day one. "
bad,"I have always state proudly that I work for chase. Although the name is well known and adored by many the workers encounter different types of experience depending on location.  Favoritism, friendship, and unequal pay rates is what I have encountered. While the old employees don't get a pay raise the new employees who know absolutely nothing about the company and the jobs gets paid more. In my case I sometimes end up doing the managers job because they don't want to do the job or just are nowhere to be found. I had sole custody or vaults and Atms and assisted the bankers and managed the tellers. All this and I am still getting a lower rate than the new girl who just started and is already on vacation."
bad,"Really enjoyed the role when I first started, but quickly became a very political place to work and very cliquey. Soon became disillusioned with the company"
bad,"A typical day usually starts with a morning huddle and what the plan of action is for the day. I learned that it takes a great leader to manage the branch and make it successful. The workplace culture isn't bad, i feel it is a more relaxed environment compared to the previous bank I worked at before. The hardest part was the hours."
bad,Great pay. You can advance fairly quickly to different departments and go to different states. The benefits are amazing and telling people you work there make s them look at you with more respect...with that said....the companies lack of coordination between departments and your lack of empowerment will sap the soul from you quickly. If you are a free spirited outspoken person don't even waste your time.
bad,"Typical day at Chase, is long and very tiring, very busy and can be stressful, Your on the phones from the time you log in to the time you log out, what you get out of it is structure, you learn to handle a situation fast and effectively and held accountable for everything you do.Everyone is unique in there own way, managers can be nice and easy to work for or hard and mean, it depends on you, on how well you handle the stress. You do the best you can do in every situation and everything else will fall into place.  The satisfaction I got was knowing that I did everything in my power for the customer, their satisfaction was always my priority with keeping the company in mind. Chase is not for everyone, something to really think about."
bad,"Loved the branch and my job. Worked as a teller, all the way to RB, SBS, and MOD. Was let go after 10 years based on credit. Was the number one banker in the district for 2014. Never had any right ups or anything. Always worked hard and anytime they needed me. Put everything into my job. Very upset that I was just let go based on credit, because I went through a divorce 3 years ago. Even gave them my divorce papers showing he was ordered to pay the bills."
bad,I enjoy the people I work with. Some days are better than others. Not a bad place to work at. The first of the month is very busy.
bad,A lot of work people are great but as in all organizations some are not.
bad,"Didn’t really like The job at all , could have way better management and it just was not for me. I’m looking for something way better than where I worked at"
bad,Helping and training staff to move up. Making the customer happy with product and services . It was hard to get told every day that you store sucked and getting talked down at. I want a company where they support you and help you grow
bad,Good work life balance. Timely bonuses. Decent chances of career progression. Good exposure to the company business and its lines of businesses.
bad,"Cutting corners with outdated technology and refusing to hire more needed employees, it's clear they have a bottom line that keeps getting lower. The people are nice, the job isn't too awful, but sometimes it leads to nowhere slowly. They're stingy with raises and their metrics are wacky and unreachable."
bad,"There would be some days that were very long and stressful, but  a great company to learn and advance within 6 months. Some management needed a little bit more training, but most of the management I came into contact with were ok.  The co-workers were great people to work with. Compensation and benefits were great but could have been a little bit more affordable. Overall it was a great place to work."
bad,"Part of EMEA Connect direct team in which we need to look into all the EMEA application servers and work with application owner or customers on various enhancement, new file transmission. We also need to work with production support team on production issue and resolved them within team frame and provide RCA and permanent solution for the issues."
bad,"Every day receiving call from customers to wire transfer, adjusting or correcting amount and sender error All the time to kept cool with customer to satisfy them for our service. Very diversity with co worker specially customer and the most is too much calls each day"
bad,Nice team and work culture. free food on some days . Management is very cooperative. Most enjoyable part of work is working in a team. You can express your views anytime.
bad,"Really busy day there commercial businesses"
bad,"I enjoyed working at CHASE. Especially working with my co-workers, we all were a team and like family. I enjoyed talking and waiting on the clients, also. Some of them were like family to me, too, because we would talk about our kids and vacations, too. The hardest part of the day for me was having to stand on my feet all day.  I learned that if a task had to be completed, we all had to pitch in and work as a team, no matter what differences we had."
bad,"While working at JPMORGAN Chase I had to manage a number of different task within the branch. From reloading and monitoring the ATM machines, cash handling foreign currency and maintaining business vaults. Although, this position had a number of serious responsibilities confidentiality was a must to keep."
bad,Productive and fun workplace with ping pong table in cafeteria
good,"Deposits, Withdrawals, Cashing Checks, Loan Payments, Cash Advances,Coin Exchange, Purchases, Balancing Draw and Bank Vault, Product Explanation, the hardest part of this job was get used to doing money transfers"
good,The best thing about this job was onsite daycare the paid time off and the events when they fed you. This job is very stressful and you’re not important.
good,"Worked in collections: would contact clients regarding past due mortgage payments and would make arrangements for payments."
good,Working for JP Morgan Chase you are given a lot of responsibilities you are to be audited frequently to see if you are in compliance with the government standard and regulations within.
good,"cashing and depositing checks or cash into accounts"
good,The job a was great but it was a temporary position a typical day at work was about  45-50 calls a day and about 75 tickets my coworkers were great and were also team players the hardest part of the job was when my hours changed
good,"I managed all records retention according to reugulations by the SEC auditors as well as internal and external to maintain compliance with federal laws. All research was handled through my department, Quality checked before signing out any records."
good,I worked as a Banker at Chase.  It was good name recognition but nothing else.  Pay was subpar and dependent on you selling your customers.  Chase was very proactive about selling to their customers.
good,bad work life balance and minimal opportunity to be promoted from within despite making numbers and hitting certain metrics and management is confused and often knows less than seasoned bankers
good,"It was a contract job that was presented as a full time opportunity which was never the case.  Low pay with no chance of advancement, but it server it's purpose and paid the bills until I found something better"
good,best thing is the benefits I was able to have my needed surgery without paying any out of pocket cost that was great but they say you have job security but you really do not
good,It's a financial company I cannot comment on this company. Everyone has their own opinion. Interview and see if you have the opportunity to work for Chase and observe for yourself.
good,My clients were great...management was not..I liked most of my coworkers and the job had satisfactory health benefits
good,"Working at JPM was always stressful, management is manipulative and uncaring.They only care about themselves and what benefits them."
good,"On a typical day our branch was very busy, I would help about 150-200 customers a day. I was able to utilize my multi tasking skill daily. I learned how to be courteous while also being professional, and patient. Over all I believe I improved some valuable skills that I will forever  utilize."
good,"poor management"
good,Loved working for this company. This company was bought out by bank of new york mellon
good,"Please understand that my experience with Chase is within the mortgage vertical and probably doesn't reflect the other verticals they have. I would imagine there is a major difference because this was bought from various banks like WAMU. "
good,"Nothing more needs to be said, here. This company has lost its core values and is no longer concerned about its consumer base and the impact of its poor programs."
good,"It was fun working with the employees, but too much stress and too much micro manage"
good,"technical functionality are not good, good place to gain knowledge ."
good,"I',m a fast learner use to be SME at chase and eager to learn. I love working with my co workers I learn from them and they learn from me the most important part of the job helping borrowers get into there house"
good,JP Morgan Chase was a great place to work with excellent benefits. The building I worked in was not managed well and a lot of toxic people were allowed to remain their because they did their job well this includes managers. However the work environment went toxic and hostile.
good,a lot of the full time positions are being outsourced or temps are being brought in to cover the positions. they say they are about the customers  experience but they are all about the numbers calls need to be under 3 minutes or the scorecard will be bad and you can be fired for that.
good,Managers are ill equipped to cultivate an employees career. They have an old school mentality and cannot make the leap to team leadership and managing people.
good,Very good place to work. Happy lucky.thank you.please give me luck.prosperity ....health and happiness........please for my kids. I look forward to the future.
good,Extremely cut throat and the upper management have no clue on how to promote well being in the workplace.Minorities are not respected at all.  Life and work balance is non existant.
good,"Decent pay and benefits. Very micromanaged culture, zero creativity or desire to innovate. Internal mobility is non-existent; firm prefers to hire from the outside."
good,The hardest part of my job at the time was the inconsistency in the upper management.  The procedures were followed in different ways depending on which manager you were under.
good,"There is no leadership in this organization. Please do not show up for work, are late, do not do daily tasks, and there is no accountability. Management does not fix this and gives the extra work to those few who are there daily and have a good work ethic. Letting those ""entitled"" people get away with this."
good,"If you are an external applicant, you will receive better pay and be hired into a higher title. Promotions are few and far between. There are constant managerial changes."
good,JP Morgan is like an Financial institution wherein I have commuted for 13 years as a student. My journey with this company had lot of peaks and valleys memories wherein I have learned new things and met new people with different culture and thought process.
good,Worst managers and pay ever. Your hard work goes unappreciated. You have to brown nose to get what you want. It depends on who you work for. If your manager doesn’t support you you are screwed.
good,"Mortgage business is horrible.  Management is bad and doesn’t care about employees, no help with career progression or improving your performance.  People will step on you to get ahead."
good,A typical day at chase begins with me checking my tray of mail for miss sorted mail and processing the mail on the Opex Machines. I have to make sure to process at least two trays a night.
good,"the job has you working the moment you get to your desk, you are processing batches of checks until its time to go, there is little to no breaks and you are easily replaced if you feel like you cant handle the work."
good,The environment was very rigid. Employee culture was stress out most of the time. Job security was very unstable. Advancement was for those who were in direct personal relationship with department supervisors.
good,if you work in the sales department you are required to make 1 sale an hour but management Is always stressing you to make more management is never happy
good,"My work involves the process of receiving mail from the post office, counting and opening. "
good,"Its Ok, you can become just a number. You may need the corporate hierarchy to help you along the way. Otherwise its a rotating door."
good,Troubleshooting and multitasking while training new hires and assisting users with questions on all different types of help desk tickets
good,"my coworkers were fun to work with and most enjoyable part of the job. management - hardest part of the job.  i learnt a lot of things, especially how to cope with stress"
good,Management says they want to have people advance internally. This is not necessarily the case. Make sure you are a suck up
good,I spent 2 years at this job slavingand trying to myself to upper management for career advancement just for them to wipe out my entire branch on what later was ruled out as wrongful termination. They do not pay well enough for the amount of stress that the job brings on. Not to mention the ABM's make less than the bankers but their jobs are more tedious and stressful.
good,"A typical workday consisted of getting calls from clients for their banking needs."
good,"My department can be stressful at times.  A lot of focus is put on blaming people instead of taking ownership of duty.  Chase has a reputation for being one of the top leading financial instutions in the nation.  Because of this, their efforts to retain employees are minimal. The number of people who want to work here outweigh the open positions.  Its very similar to the supply and demand analogy.  The supply is high but the demand is low.  With that kind of ratio, the organization will have the upper hand and will demonstrate it with compensation."
good,The opportunities that are placed in front of you at this particular call center are amazing. It teaches you about every aspect of mortgage. However the way that your superiors conduct themselves is a bit disturbing and it starts to affect everyone's job.
good,This use to be a great place to work but the upper management was changed and they are turning the place into a call center that is all about numbers. They could care less about the employees or clients. Chase allows one person in upper management to come in and change all the rules and job funtions with no one checking up on the person making all the changes. I will say the pay is very good but I am still looking for another job b/c I wasn't hired for a call center which we are becoming. So sad indeed!!!
good,"Branch manager walks around paranoid looking to find someone doing something wrong. No one is allowed to have small talk conversations or a relationships. Very hostile environment,"
good,"Long hour poor work life balance. Managers always laying off teams.  Managers always cutting jobs and adding more responsibility's.  No job security.  Work hard not smart corporate culture. "
good,"Management is only interested in making themselves look good to their peers and those above so they get promoted for all the work their employees put in for them. They don't care about your career or you as a person, only a stepping stone for themselves!"
good,"I was told I would be promoted until it was discovered I was pregnant. It would have been inconvenient for me to take three months of paid leave off, which is a good benefit, and leave a new branch manager with out an assistant manager."
good,Six months assignment with Chase Credit Card Services. This was right before the move of the business to Delaware. This was a time of change for the company and it was reflected in the way management carried out the mission.
good,There was no opportunity for advancement.  I was there 6 years and still was in an entry level position even though my skills far outweighed management.
good,It's a cutthroat world out there for banking.  If you don't want to do sales and push for quotas do not work here.  They are all about meeting sales goals and don't care about customers for the most part.  If you're not bringing in big money they couldn't care less about you.
good,"Great place to be as an entry level job candidate. The CADP program grooms recent college grads to be proficient in Excel, PPT, etc. Go into this type of role with a solid understanding of where you want to go. If you don't have a plan, you're planning to fail."
good,It all depends on the district that you work at. Managers only care about themselves.  No raise in 6 years. Points for incentives keep going down every year.
good,I enjoy working with 1 out of 50 managers they always routing management. Coworkers was ok. The pay wasnt enough u had to do fifty jobs and get paid for one
good,"Great Starter Job, No career advancment,stressful work environment, Poor Management, Everchanging corporate structure. No organization because of the continued changing members of management."
good,"bad bad bad management"
good,"It's very difficult to have a life/work balance."
good,"JP Morgan has alot to offer in terms of learning but work life balance is not good. it is expected that 10 hours plus is normal."
good,Loss mitigation has been very stressful at Chase. So much so that my Doctor put me on temporary disability no becoming long term and probably permanent disability. I am yet to meet with the Employee Union representative at Chase so if you have their contact info. please let me know.
good,"Management is very cut throat and does not like to promote or train to help be successful. Always looking to reprimand and replace. They do have mandatory training, but management is not knowledgeable and does not help with growth and your success."
good,Chase could be a good place to work.  They have a lot of positions and the ability to move up.  Just have to find a good mentor. The only negative thing is too many clicks depending what sector you work for some are more professional than others.
good,While working at First Convenience bank I was able to learn the basics in banking. This company did not really offer any job advancement. There was not enough work life balance since this financial institution was open 7 days a week.
good,my job with this bank was temporary so I am not able to provide a useful review on this company. overall it was a great bank to work for where you can advance.
good,I honestly do not wish to rate the company but if I must. I was not the best providing advancement in the company. Affer five years of working there I was still a customer service rep not even Senior
good,I admire each position I had at Chase formerly Washington Mutual. The training is very educational. Co-workers were nice and made great friends throughout the years. Not too much room for growth but I know that the company now has now changed that approach.
good,"It seems that management on up is about micro managing until they can find a gotcha moment and terminate you to bring in younger, less knowledgeable employees only to repeat the same vicious cycle."
good,"My review must only be viewed on the basis that while I subbed at other short-staffed branches occasionally, I only ever worked in one branch.  "
good,Great work place with available management. production based position. Lots of available training tools to help you develop. Huge company so plenty of politics but expected with this type of industry. The most enjoyable part of the job are the ever changing projects and responsibilities'. The company decided to reorganize and not invest so much resources in Jacksonville.
good,Great benefits and paid time off but the banker role has become more and more difficult to earn monthly incentive's and the expectations/regulations placed are coming under more and more scrutiny.  Salaries are well below what other Banks are paying their employees and every year seems to get worse and the expectations get higher.
good,"benefits are great, management are all about numbers! its a call center so you are micro managed, the pay is low starting at 12.00 they will move you around to different department however you will not get a raise."
good,Work Live Balance is very limited and almost impossible. Management needs improvement among other upgrades. High turnover rate.
good,"Job security at Chase is great, and it's a great overall company and will not be going anywhere."
good,"JP Morgan Chase started out as a great place to work. However, after a while management became more restrictive on certain policies. Work from home was taken away,a manager had to be on duty if anyone was working overtime, no desks for anyone, and a lot of attrition. To make things worse the company decided to layoff 150 people in compliance operations in Delaware. Could be a great place to work if senior management knew what they were doing."
good,"What I  learned while working at chase is that I did not know anything about the banking industry. The banking process is complex. The Ach, ECC process in more complex than what the consumer may know.  The back-end of banking  process is all about codes and numbers to convert transactions and view transactional reports. Banking is than using the debit card with visible black strip on the back of the card."
good,"Large company with the impersonal corporate culture.  Management is hamstrung by fears of losing their jobs, thus the negative aspects of the culture never seems to change."
good,Chase is not what you think it is.  They care less about their employees and more about their bonuses and where their next vacation will be.
good,"Always on time, take calls all day with time management and professional solving issues and accepting payments. Talk with co-workers if there is time in between calls. To be in one place for 8.00 a day in a cubic. To see my co-workers each day."
good,"You just a number to them. If you cant produce a certain amount of accounts, credit cards, etc you are always looked down upon. You are then replaced by another teller. This job is good if your looking for something short term."
good,"Started out as a great job but with multiple changes to the management, it quickly went downhill."
good,busy very high level stressed. not enough staff.  management did what that were old. co-workers professional. hardest part knowing what time you come in but not knowing when you go home. also not being family friendly.
good,"This unit is solely focused on profit and loss as if it was fighting for it's survival which really doesn't jibe with the vast resources the company has at its disposal.  This might be good news for shareholders but not so good if you are a client or an employee."
good,"The company is reputable and the employees are hard working, but the management thinks they are dictators! No room for advancement either and low pay."
good,Mon- sat.
good,If you like to be micromanaged and have the same thing said at meetings every day then this job is for you
good,"I learned that in corporate America, it's definitely about who you know. I did enjoy getting to work with different people from all aspects of life and engaging in a small part of their lives."
good,"Home Lending is large and disorganized: duplication of efforts, lack of project management methodology and no process improvement. Inexperienced individuals placed in positions not qualified for. Management did not consider employee feedback."
good,The best part of my job was my coworkers and being located in downtown brooklyn near many activities.
good,"very little help at work place, training was not given the first few weeks cause the branch had no manager for months"
good,"Job seems promising when hired but a little different when you get there. There are a lot of rules, which is understandable. The only way to really advance is to know someone higher up and kiss up. If you are hired as a Chaseworks Associate, don't expect to be promoted. That seems to be rare. Expect to work overtime and expect the least amount of communication from management unless you do something wrong. Then you never hear the end of it."
good,Management has no direction and is clueless. Company is trying to focus on customer service to differentiate from competition but has zero focus for its employees. Employees are treated with no respect and are second class citizens.
good,"Call center environment. Hardcore collections, stressful environment."
good,"Layoffs almost every other month, even while posting profits. More focused on lowering headcount or moving jobs abroad than lowering costs thru effective Projects."
good,Management is not engaged with their employees.  Unhealthy culture.  I do want to believe it is only my department because I do believe Chase is a great organization but the leadership I have worked with is very disappointing.
good,I got laid off last year was advice if i cane back in 6 month i get same pay that was a lie they cut my pay. The department i work in now is very unhealthy.
good,"When I started the company with Bank One, it was a great place to work.  Then the ""BIG"" company took over and things changed for the worse.  The hours are crazy, most employees work more than the mangers do, which is terrible.  There is no time to do anything but Chase.  No time for family activities, until the spring it on you that they are cutting hours because ""its the way of the times and banking is changing""."
good,"- Consistency is important"
good,I know I was an asset. I worked long hours even on weekends but I felt no appreciation. The pay was subpar. I did like that they try to reposition you if you are about to get laid off.
good,"The people there are great  I really enjoy my co-workers and management as individuals but there is a hug lack of organization and communication in the home lending department. The technology is DAS based and super outdated. None of the technologies talk to each other and things are constantly breaking and not working. So much of my time is spent doing tedious work since our systems are old and do not speak to each other. In this day and age and with a company that is so large much of my work should be automated. The work environment isn't good either turn over is high and I don't feel i have job security. You can really feel the stress from management asking for more and moving KPI's to a higher goal to make up for how understaffed we are. In addition management doesn't do a good job of building its employees up to see a long term future in chase, or to let employees know what going on big picture with the company or the department. It is very obvious that the position i am in is a bean counting position and nothing more. It is very disappointing I felt like chase would be a career move not a job stepping stone."
good,"Management is mediocre, and policies are not enforced. Work environment is extremely stressful, and the monetary compensation is less than sufficient."
good,"Zero promotion opportunities. They provide training, but it leads to no advancement opportunities. I was passed up for a few lateral opportunities with less qualified candidates."
good,The call center atmosphere was stressful. They would listen to our phone calls and be consistently critical of our time spent on the phone with customers rather than the good customer service provided to the customers.
good,A typical day at work involved resolving breaks and doing adhoc projects.  Work/promotion really depended on your manager.  Overall not a bad place to work.
good,Worked on the workforce Management team and on several occassions disrespected by supervisor. Supervisor used profanity on several occassions notified HR and nothing done except supervisor gave lack luster apology only to continue disrespectful behavior towards me and co worker. Spoke to me in a condescending tone in several occassions. Negative environment dreaded working here. Glad I left.
good,Don’t bother ! Find another financial institution for you . The only advancement is for “ upper management “ or the CEO who by the way spews his money and fortune in front of employees! Not right
good,"The productivity is very straight forward when your at work, work. all work very little play, and Job/career growth is dependent on who you are buddies with."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is an amazing company to work for however, due to managers being under pressure from upper management there is no job security. There is no room for any errors."
good,"Overall the company appears to be a good place to work. But, sometimes management can halt your growth and cripple your chances for advancement. You are required to work overtime that may stop you from spending time with your family after hours. We are down to a skeleton crew after unexpected lay offs again, and the remaining workers are being over worked and under paid."
good,"Career advancement was impossible dead "
good,"The workload was moderate to heavy and management expectations were based on goals that were set, based on unrealistic situations. "
good,"This is a great company to work for, the Georgia market is horrible to work for. Other than that the work environment is what you make it. The Benefits are great but they can fluctuate based on performance."
good,It was a challenging work environment. You were able to develop interpersonal skills and computer skills.The various jobs available provided ample opportunity to branch out.
good,In the midst of being in training after turning down an alternate opportunity. We were told the actual department was closing and on top of that we did not have enough time at the company to be transferred to a different department.  bad experience
good,"The hours were long, 10 hour days every day with an hour lunch. It was hard to find time to be with family or do anything outside of work because you had to be there from 8:30am-6:30pm."
good,I didn't enjoy working for Chase.The environment was very stressful and management was not supportive.  It was very hard to advance within the organization and  Key positions were given to individuals hired from outside of the organization.
good,"Chase was not the best company to work for. It may have just been the particular branch I worked in but the managers had no compassion. They could have been a little more flexible, they lost a great asset to their company."
good,Average at best. Management is ok. Can do better at managing span of control. Pay is average at best. Advancement is there with hard work. A lot of change at a slow rate.
good,JP Morgan Chase is the worst company I have ever worked for.  They treat you like a slave and pay you very little.  The managers are looking out for themselves and are not interested in helping their employees advance.
good,"Promotions, bonuses, and your reputation within the firm are are dictated by the reviews you receive throughout the year. And if your manager doesn't want to advocate for you (because you are of value to him or her, and their success), there goes your chances of being promoted. What they tell you when you're interviewing, or talking about the perks of the job, is that a realistic goal for advancement as an analyst is 2 years. This gives you at least one full year of reviews under your belt. What they DON'T tell you...is that the company only allots a set amount of promotions eligible depending on the line of business you work. What does that mean? Well in a nutshell, let's say that you have done everything right, and had amazing reviews, and believe you are promotion eligible. You think you're a shoe in. BUT, there could be someone from the previous year that DIDN'T get a promotion, with an extra year under his or her belt, and had the same reviews as you, would more than likely get the nod. This doesn't ALWAYS happen, but its typical office bureaucratic behavior."
good,"The Environment is awesome for Senior Management and Shareholder returns, however terrible for lower level employees. No respect from clients nor management just a very challenging work environment."
good,It's a place of great potential for someone looking fo a career in Finance.  Especially if titles are important to you.  You definitely need to network within the firm.  You have a better chance at advancement.
good,"The hours were great. Everything else was not...... Very poor management, and no advancement opportunity. Very good job for anybody looking for steady hours."
good,"The company itself overall is good, but unfortunately they do not have good management. Within the same department there are many inconsistencies and favoritism. It could be managed much better, if they would only listen to what the employees are saying."
good,A typical day was stressful and fast paced. Goals were unrealistic. The hardest part of the job was dealing with corrupt leadership and  the mismanagement of resources.
good,"There are lots of paper work we need to follow before commencing any work."
good,while this is not the worst copany to work for over the last few years the changes the company has made have left there long term employees flapping in the wind as to what there roles there hours and schedules are or will become not to mention the salaries and raises or lack there of.
good,Demanding Environment with unnecessary complexity.. Getting things done can be daunting at times and technology tends to take a back seat to the pre existing demands of this huge infrastructure
good,The company lays off way too much and does not have work life balance. Your family is not important to Chase. If you are sick you will go to work anyway to not be reprimanded.
good,"The salary is very low.  The pressure to sell checking accounts, credit cards and other banking products is daily.  The pressure on branch managers from their district managers is immense, so the pressure runs downhill to the bankers and tellers."
good,Some groups get the joy of having their own development departments.  This is great unless you are in that department where your title is chosen specifically so that they can pay you for less than the work actually required of you.  The amount of work that always needs to be done is so massive that calendars are book three years in advance.  This could easily be corrected if more employees would be hired but there is never approval for new positions.  This causes the existing development team to be forced to work 80+ hours a week just to maintain the current systems.
good,"I enjoy the benefits, but the option to advance is at a minimum.   Training is beneficial, and you have the opportunity to ask questions.  Difficult to have a work and life balance."
good,I worked for Chase for 27 years before being laid off in May of 2016 due to outsourcing.  When I started my career at Chase it was called Mother Chase but no more. During that time Chase showed a concern for it's employees and their families. Once the current CEO took over it become apparent that making money was all they were concerned about. Outsourcing become the norm. The last 4 years I received no raises at all. Not even 1% and the work environment become difficult to say the least.
good,Wasn't the most interesting jobs Ive had in fact it was pretty boring. I was responsible for making sure all numbers and info was correct and accurate on all clients forms. Also responsible for verify the authenticity on their payment.
good,They're focused more on their customers than keeping healthy happy employees. All job roles and functions are constantly changing I've learned to adapt quickly.
good,"Very stressful job and they treat you like a 2 year old. Their value statements were too cheezy!"
good,If you're seriously wanting to be in the bank industry then Chase is a good place to start. They have incredible products and services which are great for the consumer. My only gripe about them as an employer is they are slow to promote you.
good,The staff struggles to meet unreasonable deadlines with workloads that are way above forecast. Other sites have to lend a hand to the Phoenix site to help accomplish targets.
good,"Fast paced environment. Lots of change daily. The department was very new, so it make sense that there were still a few items that needed to be ironed out a bit."
good,Difficult working hours for technology and a lot of nights and early mornings because of global locations. Overall good
good,"sales driven environment, very strict, employees are easily let go. very busy, hectic, and you can achieve your goals and it will never be enough. If you are not liked by management they will let you go for stupid reason without a warning first. a lot of favoritism"
good,"Dealing with inbound technical calls, billing statement inquires, deposit information, general account inquiries."
good,"JPMC is one of the greatest firms in America, but if you're not above a certain management/VP level, be ready to starve!  Salaries are lacking and the compensation fails to meet the recruiters and managers initial statements and or promises to get you IN.  Understand, once your in don't expect much.  As many long time employees tell me, ""this once WAS a good firm.""  Very Sad environment and getting worse."
good,"Managed 61 sites: 58 retail bank branches; 1 new build; 2 High rise Admin.  Average of 5-7 days per month for site visits in L.A, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties.  Great collaboration with my retail site managers & staff.  Support staff was over-burdened, including my admin asst, and the Route Engineers had limited abilities."
good,"Ultimately, we come to work to make a living - everything else (work environment, manager, etc.) is secondary. Chase does a poor job of paying its employees a living wage and what they are worth."
good,The management that was there was more worried about their love lives with the employees than actually worried about the employees that wanted to work and more throughout the company.
good,"Lots of red tape, lots of politics, lots of lay-offs.  How enjoyable your job is really depends on what manager you get.  There is a lot of opportunity for advancement and lateral movements within the company."
good,I loved my job and hadn't lots of fun meeting new people and helping them but did not enjoy the way management mirco-managed everyone.
good,"If you like doing the exact same task for 8+ hours a day everyday in an uncomfortably warm and bleak environment, then this job is for you. Strict hours unless you are a student and succeed in convincing management to let you adjust your hours but sacrifice the ability to get a full shift in. Co-workers were nice, but very cliquey. The hardest part was getting through the shift. The most enjoyable part was leaving for the day."
good,"A typical day working on the Private bank trading floor was exciting and fast paced. ."
good,"This was a temporary job. This job is pure data entry, which can be boring or relaxing, depending on your mood and personality.  Because we dealt with confidential information, the job site is run a little like a prison and has the look of a factory.  Management is less considerate of employees than at most of my jobs, and they use a complex system of behavioral engineering on their regular employees.  But once you get used to the environment, keying, as I said, can be relaxing and enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining your keystroke speed. They want only the fastest and most accurate."
good,Great company to work for excellent benefits. Looking to work there for twenty more years to come will let all my qualified friends know about this company.
good,"Great products, however not the best with their associates.  Overworked, underpaid, etc.  "
good,"Working for JPMorgan had its rewards but was very challenging.  Middle management is firmly indoctrinated with the MBA 101 philosophy that understanding what your team does is a detriment to managing the team.  This means the senior tech people spend an inordinate amount of time backfilling this lack of knowledge so middle management can read prepared statements that they do not understand.  This can be very frustrating when it is 30% of a 70 hour a week workload, especially when it does not provide any practical purpose.  Beyond the backfilling was also a continual addition of redundant processes that were not useful. "
good,"I worked here as a personal banker and I hated it. You're pretty much a door greeter who has to bring every customer who walks into the bank to do a transaction with the teller, over to your desk and you have to sell them something."
good,"Big box bank, all about corporate and making money. Great programs for associates though, benefits are good, and tenure is available."
good,"*Start date immediate"
good,"average. big company, leadership/management needs to be transparent. very fast paced, needs to hire more people so employees are not doing jobs of at least two people, long hours"
good,"I talk 75-100 calls a day in regards to mortgage, I have learned a great deal about how having a mortgage can be difficult at times. My co-workers are awesome people, and really want to help and do better in life. the hardest part of my job, is knowing it is not secure, and you have little to no chance of progressing out of the call center. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you can really help resolve a issue that the customer is having, along with helping them understand how their mortgage works."
good,"great benefits package."
good,I will never work for J.P.Morgan again.  There is no room for advancement even though it is promised.
good,"able to do work on things that I wanted but management seemed powerless to advance me, so I went to another part of the bank"
good,was my first proffessional job that I learned alot from in such a short amount of time.
good,Management wasn't receptive to the employees that they manage.
good,"Great company to work for.  In my 15 years at this Company, I worked for different attorneys and lawyers."
good,Chase is a Fortune 500 mortgage corporation that provides great benefits for its employess and their families. Chase definitly provides its emplaoyees with the knowledge needed to be a successful homeowner and financially responsible
good,"- Great for Resume"
good,Great for learning about retirement plans but positions open up with certain people already decided upon. Turn over has slowed few stay past 1.5 years
good,No advancement opportunity. Very oppressive work environment for minorities.
good,Many changes to the depts structure. Lack of team lead assistance.
good,"I worked for chase for about 4 and a half years. I am grateful for the experiance that I have had at chase,however I thought that I would make it a career at chase. I was recently laid off because of my performance, with that being said I was top 17% out of 482 mortgage bankers accross the board, so I'm having a hard time understanding why I was laid off. The company was a good cmpany to work for all thought I would say that the was a little to much micro managing. I am a very hard worker wh came in early and stayed late, never called off unless absolutely necesary.I thinks chase has bigger problems that go far beyond me, like having to pay 13 billion dollars for bad loans. I am however greatful for the opportunity that I was given to be a part of such a big company, but it's time to move on."
good,"This job has increased my interpersonal skills, and ability to work and aid others. I have been given the opportunity to be a part of various special projects."
good,Very little  training opportunity if you do not already have industry experience dont expect additional formal training.
good,I would arrive early everyday begin to work on my files assigned to me and pick up additional work through out the day. After my regular schedule was completed I would have additional work to complete at home on average 3-5 hours every night and also on the weekends.
good,"High risk trading, wheeling and dealing. The hardest part are the long work hours with out an end in sight."
good,"co-worker's were great.  Working and helping clients with their business needs were enjoyable and hardest part of work was Management being overbearing."
good,"I am a loan processor who is under compensated for the duties I perform. There is almost no work/life balance as I am told I am required to work 50 plus hours when volume is high. When volume is low, Chase trims the fat and starts laying employees off in the mortgage division. Chase executives only care about turning a profit and not the employees that get them there. "
good,"A typical day at work starts out by our morning huddles, the purpose of these morning huddles is to motivate the staff and inform them of any new products, trends and goals for the week and/or day. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help our customers when dealing with difficult situations such as trust (due to death in the family) helping them understand how a home loan works etc. Being a Vice President Branch Manager and going thru the extensive 5 months training I learned plenty, my biggest takeaway was the process of self discovery, instead of telling or asking an employee to do a task you self discover them to realize what task needs to be done in order to satisfy our customers needs and or meet branch goals."
good,The hardest part was trying to make sure everything was accurate and done by the end of the shift
good,"In the banking industries Chase is the Juggernaught. If not only forces the employees, but makes them force the clients into accounts and products that are not right what the client needs or wants."
good,"People can be unhelpful, too busy to get their work done. Rude, condescending."
good,Wonderful environment for growing and learning. Team projects and international experience.
good,Managed 10+ collectors
good,Very political. Adequate training is not provided to management. Expectations are not communicated. Systems have not been revised or updated. Internal systems are flawed. Interacting with customers are the most gratifying experiences and providing them best resolutions and assistance to their concerns.
good,Worked with a wonderful team and great co-workers however company laid off. Department divided and sent to another state and overseas.
good,The lunch area is amazing....all the employees sleep with each other so working there is like attending a real live soap opera....christmas parties rock!
good,"Do not interact with others on a daily basis. Mostly computer work. Not an open environment, and management are stuck on outdated systems."
good,At Chase you could work a 60 hour work week because they require a part of management team there at all times.
good,"Chase Bank is part of JPM whom desires to be the best of the financial industry. Chase's goal and how they reach them are little to do with the employees and how they are treated. They are striving to exceed customer service, while sacrificing the employees. Mismanagement at the retail side is high, with unrealistic goals in mind, while other departments outside of retail are calm and relaxed. It's a solid company outside the retail and solid company to own. Customers need to be aware of the sales pressure and tehniques via employees. Training is minimal, while keeping up with the compliance is difficult. The is little to no regard for outside appointments or activities. Very little culture within the corporation, except a desire to succeed. Compensation is good and they don't overload with bankers as many branches and tellers are limited. All are focused to grow the profit and loss statement, even at employees cost."
good,The hedge fund division of JP Morgan takes care of the post trade activities. It has recently upgraded it's software. Integrating the same in the process of onboarding new and existing client has led to exponential growth to me and my team as whole.
good,.Great for younger generation looking for experience. Ability to transfer to other areas to learn is good if college educated and had been part of the intern process.
good,Advancement only available if they like you and not based on experience and ability to do the job. Very difficult to get a raise so negotiate your pay in the beginning cause everything is a lateral move.
good,"My experience here is different than most others and I would not feel comfortable disclosing the rationale behind my departure publicly. What I will share, is that poor management and being tasked with performing their responsibilities without any formal compensation was a big factor in said departure."
good,Long days and not enough appreciation.  Your manager shapes your experience at the company as you all well know.  Not a fan of management.  Work culture is okay.
good,"Large bank with good product offering and generally good management. "
good,"Just very poor management selection, very poor experience when new management came in. District manager helped protect horrible manager, that was giving everyone a horrible experience."
good,Great place to get acquainted with customer service and adapting to needs of diverse clientele. Great place to incorporate technology with banking needs
good,Not the most optimal workplace environment. There was lots of crunch and high turnover. Layoffs are common every couple of quarters. There was very little room to advance in the company.
good,"Great name to have on your resume, move on before burnout"
good,"A typical day for me consists of working 8:30am-6:15pm throughout the week and Saturdays 8:30am-2:15pm. Every morning, employees are supposed to meet to discuss customer experience and other useless, repetitive info, which frequently includes employees roleplaying, which Chase seems to love. Despite Chase pushing technology and insisting customers do everything online, bankers are required to call several customers every day to try to convince them they should come in to ""review [their] accounts"" to then bait'n'switch into pushing loans and/or investments on them. I've got to call the same customers over and over again for this purpose, even if they've already said they're not interested.  Even when customers come in to do something as simple as order checks, bankers are supposed to ask them a ton of financial questions to, once again, push products and services. The computers bankers are given are outdated and frequently freeze, lag, etc, and for some reason, bankers' phones aren't able to have voicemail, so I never know if I've missed a customer's call.  Several times each day, I am required to call the support hotline for issues which can't be resolved in the branch. Hold/wait times on this hotline are increasingly awful (up to 15 minutes) and the vast majority of phone reps are located overseas and difficult to understand. There are constant policy changes and online/in-person training courses/quizzes to be taken, which covers the same topics again and again. Because of the push for online banking, allotted branch employee hours are always decreasing, which means when an"
good,"Constant pursuit of technology to take the place of people. Chase is very focused on innovation and ways for customers to do their banking with the utilization of computers and other forms of A.I. -- there expectation of their employees is that of robots and they're slowly, but surely replacing them with actual robots."
good,good internal mobility and opportunity to be part of global initiatives. very political environment with an individualistic culture. this can change from team to team and location
good,Chase does not pay enough and the hours are not great. Pay raises are only a few cents a year. You only get a 30 minute break. This isn't your average 9-5 bank job. Sometimes you are working from 8:30- 6:00pm with only a 30 minute lunch break.
good,Wish that the management was better. Working for this company you don't really get any raise. The atmosphere is very negative and poor job culture. Lack of mentoring and support towards employees.
good,"I was a mortgage loan processor. At first I loved working at Chase, everything about it! As years passed they kept changing, trying to reinvent the Department. As a result I noticed managers being run over by higher ups and the trickle down effect of unrealistic demands hit all of us. "
good,I am grateful for the 22 years Chase has employed me.  And the advancement and learning opportunities.   And the chances to learn in many new areas...
good,"Senior management sends out culture emails, but managers are not held to these standards. Very smart individuals but culture definitely needs work to be more inclusive of all."
good,Typical call center work. No room for advancement unless you were close to upper management. We did receive a monthly bonus. They do have a very high turnover rate
good,"Chase is a good company for college students/ high school students. The pay does not match today’s living expenses. After your probation period you do receive full benefits, paid vacation, and sick time."
good,"This is a dream company unless you’ll get hired in claims department where I worked for more than two years. This is a company where you want to stay because they provide great benefits and retirement package but not if you’ll get hired in Claims. There is no clear procedure and the information they give to their agent varies from one another that causes errors and at the end of the day the agent will suffer big time. I don’t want say too much about the negative experience about claims department because there’s a lot, but overall this company in general is really great. If the recruiter offer you to work with fraud claims. Decline it! If they offer you to work with other department, go ahead and take the offer right away."
good,employees are overworked you can see that when you walk into a branch. they have managers doing everything they are not provided with sufficient staff to do daily work. all they care about is the numbers  and making and keeping those stockholders happy.
good,"no work life balance, worked over 60 hours most weeks was never allowed to take my vacation time and was reprimanded if sick time was ever used. Difficult to want to go to work"
good,"Analyzed spending patterns of corporate card users."
good,Management is horrible lie to your face and very rude has no people person skills. Chase is a good company to work for just depends on the department your in and the management your under
good,"Chase is a great place to work if you’re beginning a career in banking. There is room for growth if you’re starting out as a teller. If you’re a licensed banker you don’t have much room for advancement and the base salary is very low. There’s a lot of politics. Management uses employees to do their job, handling customer complaints and  revising emails/documents. Most managers do not hold a college degree and hinder employees from furthering their education or promoting within the company. Some managers are lazy, incapable of doing their job and hardly spends time in the branch."
good,a Good company to work for. good benefits. I like the group I work for. Very busy - work long hours most of the time. group was relocated several times - talks that it will relocate again in near future. my commute is very long - looking to find something closer to home.
good,"I do not care for the company, they promote any person, most of the supervisors have no formal training and are incompetent , i was hired for a particular department were i was off the phones, but ended up being moved to another department were i was taking calls. Due to the department being over staffed, it was a secret held from the employees until the last minute. No one had answers as to why they moved the employees and why particular people were chosen"
good,Not great environment- People say for reason to stay employed-  Company not employee concerned.    CEO does good job for the company but non caring for employees.
good,I was only part time so i didn't get a chance to experment with a lot. I would of like to have gotten hired on permited so i wouldve had a full time position and could have a career that i still could have been at the people were nice i didn't like the sheift i was on but other than that it was a good comany to work for it taught me a lote
good,"Unless you are on the DM's ""favorites"" list, you are overworked, underappreciated/recognized, micromanaged and receive no support when you actually need it. The ""favorites"" do not meet goals, leave branch unattended and have employee complaints but if you are a favorite, you're safe."
good,"In my current role as an AML-KYC Onboarding Officer in the private bank, (Polaris location, Ohio) the typical work days are 8-9 hours. The current management is terrible. Very inconsistent and objectives are never clear. With strict timelines on account openings and constantly changing procedures, it causes for a very stressful environment. There is not a lot of room for advancement either. I have been in this role for more than 18 months and I have seen countless team leads leave to take other ""lateral"" roles within the company or have left the company altogether. The same can be said for the turnover amongst the onboarding officers, it is very high."
good,"Imagine sitting in a cube farm all day, every day, pushing the same buttons. At the same time, you overhear meetings about how your job will soon be outsourced to India or the Philipines. Fun!"
good,"There are ups and downs as in any work environment.  Strength and depth of management team is suspect.  Many decisions appear to be made within the context of self-preservation/power as opposed to merit.  However, good culture and good people that work hard and believe in the team mentality."
good,Chase was a fun place to work. I wished I was afforded the opportunity to get a full time position and a higher hourly rate. I enjoy working in the banking industry.
good,"just a position, not a career. a typical day involved a team meeting which was usually negative. the hardest part was meeting the numbers of files reviewed. the most enjoyable part was my team members."
good,"If you're up for this type of atmosphere, you will do well.  If you possess any small molecules of humanity and/or empathy and display this in your professional behavior, be ready to be torn to shreds."
good,Management often out of touch with employees. Terrible working conditions from such a prestigious firm. Advancement basically non existent in certain departments.
good,"Unchallenging rote job. Pay isn’t very good. No bonus. Negligible raise. No personal time. You really don’t learn anything about finance, markets, sales, or thinking. You are watched all the time. Everything is monitored- everywhere"
good,It took some serious time to get on-boarded and start work. The culture is very corporate and politically correct. The cost of benefits goes up or down pay period to pay period depending on how much you earn. So if you get overtime JP Morgan uses that as an excuse to increase your insurance premiums on top the higher taxes that result from OT.  The culture is very much one of playing the game to get ahead. I would not recommend working at JP Morgan if you have a problem with unfair policies directed at pay and political games.
good,"The pay was ok enough, if you're into overtime it's well compensated."
good,"Not enough Staff, seems like we are always short tellers. management could improve,  management doesn't help.  Overall the company is good and cares for the employees,"
good,"poor systems for processing loans, Management only cares about their bonus'. Never being able to tell the truth to a client about why their mortgage loan is taking so long."
good,"The work hours are way too long, there's no work/life balance."
good,"Stressful, long days, poor management, lack of career movement.Poor pay for the revenue you bring in................................................................"
good,"•	Review and analyze underlying data gathered to assess reasonable cause to escalate an alert to Investigations or to clear. "
good,My experience was good. Long hours and short staffed often. Good pay if you work the hours. Hard to advance and low raises. Need to come in high with your salary.
good,"I am sick with cancer and they're trying to fire me. I also had a crazy manager that tried choking a fellow employee and screamed at employees in front of customers, but she still works there somehow. Chase doesn't take care of their employees, the second you aren't benefiting them- you become disposable."
good,Employees are treated as if working in a factory line. No appreciation for good workers and managers show favoritism. A lot of prejudice managers working here. Minorities are treated different from other workers.
good,"place could use an overhaul, very antiquated in regards to leadership and technology systems, low pay commensurate to industry competitors, poor recognition and bonus/incentives system"
good,"The department has a relaxed environment and gives one autonomy to work at your own speed.  However, there is very little room for advancement. Advancement is dictated by favoritism rather than quantitative measures. Quantity is valued more than quality here. It takes many people more than a few years to move up, and once you do, there is a strict hierarchy that must be followed . Although, the work load is spread out, it can be hard to reach production goals due to lack of work in the queues. This fact is not taken into account with your monthly assessment although management will express to you that it is."
good,"I was on standby, jobs were issued By Global resources."
good,"A typical day at work involves you having to explain to your manager why unrealistic expectations for the team haven't been met. The firm as a whole is great, but my team was terrible."
good,management does not support team members and there is major issues with the way they reward workers and pay workers. People that are not as good at the job are paid much more just because they have been with the company longer and in order to increase your salary to a respectable level you need to leave the company
good,All I did daily was scan & file.  Boring job with no room for advancement.  Job was eventually outsourced to another part of the country.  Easy job to do.
good,"The key to advancement is networking. Its not what you know, it's who you know. Thus, advancement within dept most times takes place when the position is left vacant."
good,"Chase is far ahead of other financial institutions in respect to their  technology , This helps in the customer satisfaction aspect. Chase can accommodate the customer request due to their technology."
good,Chase believes people are just numbers to make the company more money.  No regard to how the person's life is or what is necessary to make them happy at work.  This is the worst company to work for.
good,I feel chase is a wonderful company a long as you have the right job and fit. Management are bunch of misfits that have no clue on how to be managers in a company culture. Do you research first before wasting your time
good,"At Chase the technology is amazing and very consistent, however the culture has a lot to be desired. They are down sizing branches and the clients have felt the impact. There is room for advancement if you work hard."
good,All depending on the volume the workday could be smooth or it could be hectic you just have to remain focused and keep up the productivity. Make sure you look over your work because quality is key.
good,"My experience at JP Morgan Chase was one in which an incompetent pair of managers set me up to fail, in which the culture is cutthroat, and departments discourage cooperation across department lines, or even within the same team (despite protestations to value teamwork)"
good,"Log into system . Work files. Management    don't know the position. Hardest part working at chase they promote there friends. Most enjoyable was 7in short sales,"
good,It is okay. The workplace is not fun but it is a job. Frequently we are givn something to do ans then tells us not to anymore. It is frustrating but not a big deal.
good,"The company is OK, very big and in need of better development opportunities.  The only issue that I have had during my employment with JPMorgan was that my manager lacked any management skills and when brought up to senior management, they did not do anything about it - but rather allow top performing employees leave."
good,"You are expected 12 hours to work "
good,"Worked six days a week. Started out as a temporary position. After three years, I was still temp. Started off on third shift. Moved to first shift. Kept asking to learn more. Was content with my keyboard and my mp3 player."
good,"Very dynamic place, management is supportive of new ideas. Great place to learn. My job taught me people management and provide me ample opportunities to polish my technical skills. Since we work on a complex integrated enterprise system, sometimes, you have to step back and take a look at the big picture to solve tough problems."
good,"I enjoyed working for Chase. there was a lot of room for growth. a lot of good benefits. the hardest part of working there were the work politics, and the management was very poor, the managers could have used more professionalism training"
good,"A lot of talk about job advancement, as I stayed stucked with high meets scores every quarter. Culture was just not that great. 30 min lunches never seemed doable based on location."
good,Not happy in this environment. Received very poor training and then unrealistic expectations. Turnover is high and job is very stressful. Great pay but not worth the constant worry and stress. Not appreciated
good,"The team which i worked with had long working hours, becoming difficult to maintain work-life balance."
good,"JPM AM is a big organisation. It will provide lots of international exposure. Responsibility will be increased for the right person. If you are up for a challenge, not afraid of working extensive hours (07:00 - 21:00) and are willing to be flexible (to work weekends) to get the job done, then this is the company for you."
good,"Hours are constantly changing. Expectations are a little unrealistic. atmosphere not great to work in, dust is everywhere and in certain areas don't have windows. the job is easy enough to do in all different areas even with guidelines are constantly changing."
good,"Although J.P. Morgan Chase overall is a decent company to work for, the various subdivisions are poorly managed.  A lot of the managers have a lack of understanding how to promote a work environment that is a place where employees look forward to coming to as opposed to just being a place that is dreaded.  Very low morale in terms of the work cultire."
good,"worked there for 17 years, thought I would retire there.  loved the company.  did not like how the CEO and BOD ran things.  great if you know banking"
good,"Was a leader but company would not help me advance in the branch network since downsizing"
good,"Heavy phone activity, non stop sometimes, management is tough. Favoritism very high and you have to be in the ""in crowd"" or ""liked"" by management in order to progress or move up. Trainer at I had liked to bully people and favoritism very present.  Employee engagement was good, but felt it was to make up for long hours and stress levels."
good,This is an unfair place of employment. There is no room for advancement unless you are in with the right people. I have been here for 4 and a half years and have gotten one raise after proving my ability time after time of a measly 10 cents. The management is a joke.
good,Analytics is very innovative.  There was something new to learn.  I enjoyed working with data people. Work from home is not very frequent.  Promotions were rare.
good,"The most enjoyable part about working for Chase is it is a team oriented environment.  Employees care for one another and have no problem with showing appreciation for each other. When I leave I will miss my colleagues, but I will not miss working for the company."
good,I enjoyed the free drinks but other than that I cant say anything exciting. Management lack amenities and communication with employees
good,Really have not enjoyed my time with them. The firm does not support the development of the mission. Feel that they support it only in name.
good,"While working for JP Morgan Chase I learned alot about the company, I learned alot about the Mortgage industry and met some really awesome people.  I am thankful for the time that I was employed with the company."
good,"Everyone has different experiences with companies,  I feel as if networking plays an important role in advancement as opposed to actually having skill."
good,"This is a high stress, face paced role."
good,Chase Bank provides the best training in the industry. They give you all the tools that you will need to excel in your current role.
good,Good place to work; ok company culture; good management; fair room for advancement; excellent co-workers; learned the value of communicating effectively
good,"They try to force you out and not able to help when ask"
good,"The corporation is a giant.  It is successful and employs a large number of individuals in Columbus, Ohio.  However, the Financial industry is volatile, and reflects in the amount of layoffs."
good,"main thing you do is acquire customers. open bank accounts, open credit cards, open investments, make phone calls, open brokerage accounts, open business account. managers push you to perform, don't really care about your life. it a sale job in banking."
good,"The branch I worked at had a remote drive up; totally detached from the rest of the branch. Most days I had to work there and I felt very isolated. But I did get very attached to the customers."
good,"Overall, its a great brand and company to have on your resume, but the culture and is not great. Extremely long hours and no work life balance."
good,"The work location is great and centrally located for employees who utilize I-90. Amenities include: Café, free parking, and paid training."
good,"Chase is a great company, and one of the best banks in my opinion as far as customer service and products. Working for Chase, on the retail banking end, was a decent experience at first, but then they decided to drastically cut incentives/bonuses. Chase pays their employees a lot less than their competitors. They have expectations, but there's not a lot to motivate you money-wise."
good,You have to know someone within the company to advance and if you don't and want to advance it will take so much time. they will lose good employees instead of offering them advancement.
good,"Good to start a career. Not too good for career advancement. Not very helpful with making internal movement. Also, not helpful for job re-location."
good,I enjoyed working with the people at the firm and the knowledge I gained from the job was great.  I now have a strong analytical skill base.
good,Stable employer and environment. Diverse employees with great benefits. Ability to grow depends heavily on abilities direct management more so than actual performance.
good,"Les journées de travail sont longues mais l'environnement et les collègues rendent l'ambiance sympathique. Les opportunités de développement sont présentes mais souvent réservées à une certaines partie des employés."
good,There is a mass amount of technology here and all has to be spread around the globe.  Working in this environment we are able to apply updates/upgrades to thousands of users at once.
good,Too many Chiefs. Okay company just have a lot of changes going on. I am not about to write an essay to post my resume. Chase is a temp agency job that has tooooooo many temps.
good,"Was forced by upper management to make toxic loans look more profitable than they actually were.  "
good,"This job is great for a college student. Chase do not pay well and depending on management, it could be a great company to move up in."
good,"Hardest place to be new because no one really wants to help you.  Employees are not appreciated and raises are pathetic, if you're even lucky enough to receive one."
good,"nice place to work on a as needed basis, confidential secured, good work hours. Good data entry experience.  good place to work if ever offered a permanent position"
good,"Daily review of pipeline, organize prior loans for review."
good,"Meeting new people everyday, learned the behind the scene of how a bank runs learned how to process payments, deposits, withdrawals"
good,"Overall the work was not bad, however the management at times seemed like they did not know what they were doing, training lacked immensely, and there was a lot of silent stress. Happy im out of there."
good,"I had a position that could have me on a call at 5:00 AM and another at 10:00 PM, while in the office during the day.  I had some great managers and some not so great.  Some were ""just get the job done""  wherever you were working from.  I had a couple that were micro-managers wondering where you were even if you went for a cup of coffee."
good,"no comments at this time, don't have very good memories from this company and don't wont to share anything about it."
good,"Great company to work for, but it needs some "
good,Constantly changing. You never know what is going to happen next. Management expects a lot with very little to go off of. Individuality is not appreciated.
good,The company from what I have been exposed to seems very bureaucratic.
good,I collaborate closely with various team members on sprints lasting 4 weeks to deliver new functionality to internal banking customers.
good,"I worked at Chase for four years and went to a work in the credit card division where you answered phones and questions from card holders, file disputes and resolved issues related to card members credit card accounts.  The hardest part was determining the right course of action to take when card member call in to dispute a charge on their account.  The best part was being able to resolve issues."
good,A typical work day I report to work and start out by walking the floor to say good morning to the staff.  Afterward I go to my computer to answer any email with pressing matter or upcoming deliverables. Once emails are caught up I start reconciling all of the reports and addressing any issues with production.
good,This company has its ups and downs. Like any other job it has its days.
good,"Co-workers are good people, I have formed great relationships."
good,"Great reputation, work with many talented people, epitomizes office politics"
good,"Moved jobs for IT to India and gave very stressful environment to workers they kept with outstanding reviews , lowered pay and gave much more responsibilities"
good,This is a job. Your day to day life will be spent sitting in front of a computer and filling in forms online for fraud claims. There isn't much to the job other than taking calls and filling in form.
good,A typical day at Chase was very busy but informative. There was a different position learned every year. My co workers we pleasant how ever work and home life was very difficult . Being mostly commission based required long work hours.
good,"-Review collateral files daily"
good,Chase has terrific benefits but their commission plan is not so good.  It has changed for the worse in the past year which makes it harder to make any money.  They also don't offer great programs/products.  In my area we need USDA and special incentives which Chase doesn't have.
good,Chase will struggle in the New Business area of Home Lending as it lacks the ability to look outside the box and provide the necessary support to the Loan Officers. Support staff during high volume times was inadequate to maintain the volume of production.
good,"Multi layered firm with banking, brokerage, investment banking,"
good,"I can see a lot of younger companies taking them on from the technology perspective. They have some good developers, just not enough of them."
good,"at the beginning the mangers were understanding and helpful the atmosphere was one were you could work long hours and be okay with it i had not stress the getting to know the customers improving my customer service skills and learning about banking was beautiful i want to learn as much as possible "
good,"Management suspect,employees not always promoted on merit."
good,"A typical day at work was to run my morning Pipeline and see who needed to be call during the day to supply customer with status on their loan applications. I would then see what loans came out of underwriting and what emails that I received that contained conditions. "
good,"This company is strong.  There are plenty of opportunities to move from one department to another.  Lateral moves are plentiful.  However, the majority of the employees are gaining experience, so that they can move up a pay grade.  I have worked for this bank for over 6 years and I have only seen one promotion in my unit.  Only one member actually moved up in pay grade.  In the 6 years, I would approximate nearly 40 - 50 lateral moves among employees."
good,"Typical work day would include checking your email and replying back to the emails. Then start working on tickets within your queue, if certain tickets where the end user is located in UK try and resolve those first or put on turn-over for the Singapore team. After that resolve the oldest ticket within your queue. I then would start putting comments/steps I've taken to the final resolution process and close out that ticket or escalating the ticket to a higher level of support; Either way, the ticket MUST be documented carefully and make sure you put in every detail to make it easier for the next tech just incase you needed to escalate that ticket or what not up to you. Thanks again. The goal that our team leads want us to be focusing on is closing out a minimum of 20 tickets a day. While resolving tickets within my own queue, I can also pick up a ticket from the ""Team's Queue,"" but make sure I am picking the oldest tickets first."
good,"Company always focuses on quantity of the work a resource can delver but not on quality. No work life balance, no benefits and works on dark ages technology."
good,"Consulting firm. Low rates, minimal benefits, no paid vacation."
good,"Co workers are cut throat, which can really get under your skin. It's hard getting used to working almost every Saturday of the year. But on the up side, having a day off during the week comes in handy when make doctor appointments, etc."
good,Chase has such a high turn over rate that you never know who your manager is and you are kept in the dark on all office ongoings.
good,Working with others and learning a lot. Loved My customers .
good,What I liked about working at Chase is that you are given as much room to grow and opportunity to improve your skills as you are willing to handle. My advice would be to pursue every opportunity aggressively and stand out amongst your peers. Your hard work will be recognized. Just don't expect to be rewarded much for it. They treat their employees like stock trades. They will buy and sell you whenever it suits them and it's all just business.
good,A typical day in Underwriting involves working through an queue or pipeline of loans that contain accounts I daily pull. I utilize one of our systems that houses any documents related to the individual loan and I began searching through it to see if I have all of the documents I need to work the loan or if I need to submit back to the liason in order to obtain the proper documents. Once all documents are received I begin calculating customer income to see if I will be able to modify the loan. This position in particular has definitely hightened my analytical skills as well as my attention to detail. I work in an environment where I for the most part manage myself so interactions with managers are usually on a question and answering basis. I do enjoy the people that I work with. It's important to have a good team around you. The hardest part of my job is that it's stop and go. At any time upper management may need to know the status of a loan and it has to be answered almost immediately which alot of times causes me to stop in the middle of working another loan to find the answer. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am able to help homeowners who are going through hardships.
good,"A typical day in this position is reviewing accounts for inaccuracies before reporting and requesting corrections if needed after the information has been reported. Reviewing procedures, attending meetings.Hardest part of the job is anticipating the process changes."
good,"Extremely boring, no room for advancement. The only way to make good money is to kill yourself out working overtime. It's a job, but definitely not a career."
good,"I was promoted to a Quality Specialist from being a Team Lead. The skills as a team lead help me research more thoroughly as a Quality Specialist. Errors are reported on a daily basis and it was my job to see how the error happened, correct it and create a write up for the employee who caused the error. If it was a system error then a report was created detailing the issue that IT would need to correct."
good,"I ran Brooklyn, Staten Island, Westchester and Fairfield counties. We did a great job - I loved it there. I oversaw all facets of production. I was sad to leave, but market conditions caused the reduction of the mortgage division."
good,"a typical day at chase was busy on a consistent basis. customers came in all day to deposit or even to say hi. i learned in my 4 years working there how to have more patience and smile more. as management was easy going and easy to get along with. the hardest part of my time there was not being able to help customers with issues at times. most enjoyable part of the job was knowing all of my customers by name, learning about their lives and building lasting friendships."
good,Everything is fine with Chase. I have no complaints and I enjoy working there.
good,"If you are a 'pedigreed' college grad - look for red carpet, otherwise expect long hours and with frustration due to the maze of acquisitions, limited investment in tools critical for work completion and your normal level of corporate politics for a firm this size."
good,Resolve moderately complex customer inquiries and manager escalated issues.
good,"A typical day at JPMorgan the mortgage department would consist of making contacts with 200-500 customer a day, educating customer on all options available to them on defaulted mortgage loans. I learned about all the federal regulations and guidelines for the mortgage industry and loss mitigations process."
good,Enjoy the change a d have met quite of few nice people along the way.
good,"My whole working experience at JPMorgan Chase was one that taught me a lot. What I thought to be a professional corporate environment, turned out to be a huge high school."
good,Not to take things to the heart...some managers are there to help and some of them are not-its and ok place to work
good,"A day at Chase was pretty good. You had goals and if you hit them you got paid more if not you didn't. I became a licensed banker through Chase and learned enough to get recruited by other banks. management was outstanding and also allowed me to learn directly from them, which eventually made me a better manager of my time and colleagues. The hard part was taking my series seven test. The most enjoyable was learning to work with the public daily."
good,"a typical work day was to review mortgage files, order missing docs, print copies when necessary and prepare files to be mailed after processing. Learning was a good/bad experience. Good in that I learned how to do the work, but sad for the people that the reason why the work had to be done. Home foreclosures is not a pretty thing whether regardless of the economy, or living above ones means. Associates were helpful and we all worked as a team. I would rate management fair. The hardest part of the job in the beginning was finding the right slots to place the correct envelope in...there were a lot of sub names and so forth. But, after getting beyond that, the whole process of my duties were enjoyable. It was different."
good,Very productive strict workplace. A typical day at work required inbound calls. I learned how to become a lot more organized.
good,JP Morgan is all about the money. They treat you like dirt and expect you to take it. Remember it is all about the money.
good,Our day started with phones calls to homeowners to see what can be done to help them keep their home. I must say that working for a mortgage company has help me understand know how to buy a new home and what i need in order to make my life a success. The hardest part about the job was convincing the homeowners that they can get help but it was accomplished. I believe that i had fun the most with the co-workers because we motivated each other to hit our goals.
good,Good Co to start a career has got good brand name. But most of night shift
good,"A company working in customer service, great benefits. No regard for you as a person, guidelines some what rigid."
good,"Management is supportive of your learning progress"
good,"Your attitude determines your experience at JPM. It can be fun, but it can also be very stressful and challenging. It's a very long and hard process to get promoted - your career will not move fast here. Better to leave and return for promotions. Depending on the team you are assigned to, your experience may be great and it could be horrible. Training in classroom for bird's eye view of information is very good, but training on your assigned team is probably not much so you may not feel that you're contributing much to the group, which can be discouraging. Salaries for the same position are all over the place. Sometimes new to the workforce employees make more money than experienced mid-level employees. Lay offs are common several times within the year."
good,There are opportunities for growth and more than 10 departments within the Stone Oak site and more at the Wiseman location. This provides an opportunity to apply elsewhere with time.
good,"I invested everything in my career at Chase. Really big ""talk"" about how thing's are going to change on issues that matter to employees. Some thing did change and some things didn't change. The biggest issue for me was no compensation for top performers. If I was a CEO I would have received a bonus big "
good,I feel the company needs to be honest. i have not had a good experience with Chase. They are sneaky with their approach and decision making and i feel some of the leadership needs to be changed.
good,"JPMC is a massive place that has pockets of good culture but is mostly a bunch of people working as hard as the can to keep the place going.  Lots of unproductive ungrounded political discussions, witch hunts overall moral"
good,"loved my team and customers, they were the reasons for my going in daily. You never know what challenges your day will bring, but with the right team and manager support, everything would work it self out. Terrible company politics. your immediate supervisor expects the management teams to do their jobs!"
good,"My plans, when I started at Chase was to work in customer service for only a couple years and then move up in the company.  Every time I applied for a position outside of the call center and even within, there was always some reason they felt I was not qualified.   I have a BBA in accounting and most times was more qualified for management than my managers were.  I got fed up with being pigeon holed in one position so I resigned after 15 years."
good,"It is a decent organisation. A very large organisation with metrics structure can overwhelm people at the beginning. The culture of the organization is entirely dependant on the business leader that one works with. The firm overall has employee friendly policies in place, although not the best pay master."
good,"The company at this size doesn't know what the right hand is doing while the left hand is hard at work. There is very little collaboration from teams they are all working to get a piece of the pie and this is rewarded. Lots of changes are coming, but those changes are going to take a couple of years to unfold and they are unwilling to adopt open source. They want to build everything on their own, which is pretty cool, but leads to many issues and for those reading this the biggest downside is mobility out of the company. They use JPMC tools so if you aren't careful you will find yourself stating you know how to use tools that aren't used anywhere else. "
good,"More of legacy applications to maintain, a lot of coordination is required from US resulting in challenging and dealing with time zones. Benefits nd perks are good but bad work life balance"
good,"- Political environment"
good,Although JPM pays well most managers could care less about work/life balance or mental health. In my experience the managers at JPM would rather stress a couple employees than hire more staff. The managers ive known have been very aggressive and conniving...theyre praised for that type of behavior form the assoc level to the ed level.
good,"Working as a teller is terrible. You do all the work for everyone else and get treated the worst by the customers. They raised the starting pay for tellers but it isn't enough. Tellers used to get commissions on referrals and that was taken away. Tellers were given a lot more responsibilities and are now called ""associate bankers"" but received no raise. Management sucked."
good,"Management was not business  appropriate. Branch manager had favorable coworkers and treated them with more flexibility, better lunch times, treated with respect, and did not berate them in front of others."
good,"Working in the branch is tough! You're there for long hours and it can be very stressful when dealing with upset customers all day. Management loves to micro-manage and doesn't really care about their employees sanity or work-life balance, their main concern is making sure that the customer is happy with the service provided. As a result, happy customers are more likely to rate their experience with top scores which will make the branch look good. "
good,Good for entry level folks.  Experienced folks beware. Extremely political environment with low pay and long hours. Plenty of layoffs to cut cost instead of investing in keeping experienced resources
good,The rules changed constantly. The customer had more power than management.  Management place too much importance the customer surveys; even when you did everything right on the call. Usually the customer was made at Chase and not at the rep
good,"I worked there for 7 years. I always had great reviews, excellent customer service, I was very clean and organized. Cared about our customers and their needs. Then I walk into work one day with all my personal belongings put together and was told I was being let go."
good,"*wide variety in work days"
good,"Chase does have fun activities to do when they are celebrating different achievements, but overall the workplace is pretty intense when it comes to making your boss look good because of your hard work"
good,The management team definitely needs some reconstruction. When management is failing then the employees within are not set up to succeed. For how much the CEO and managers make in salary below employees should be compensated more
good,"Management is out to protect themselves...the term CYA (cover your A..) is the key term used by management. Bottom line driven, instead of caring for it's employees."
good,"Log into the phones, take calls, notate accounts, weekly meetings. The work is easy, some of the managers are great, there is one that can be very rude and unprofessional upper management knows about it but doesn't care too much. The clients are nice when things are going smoothly. a lot of miscommunication in all areas of our department which can be frustrating at times."
good,Felt like I was in jail working at JP Morgan. They monitor your every move. None of the managers were helpful to me or my colleagues as far as helping to advance our careers.
good,"My job was fairly easy , help my customers who I loved."
good,"A potential candidate may want to shadow the department and ask questions that will positively impact his/her understanding of the team.  The company has outstanding benefits.  However, to utilize them without being indirectly labeled please select the appropriate department."
good,"The Local Team worked well together and I enjoyed them, but corporate spent too much time worrying about the small things and no focusing on building relationships with clients.  Too much time looking at everything under the microscope and not looking at the big picture.  Very stressful and relieved to not be there now."
good,"Highly professional company with strong values."
good,The company as a whole was a pretty good company to work for but the particular mgmt at branch was difficult to work with. Very inconsiderate of personal life.
good,No room for growth unless you kissing butt. Plain and simple. Great pay but very stressful. The shifts are long and management is rude... They do not care for their employees
good,"Paid time off.  Not paid enough for the actual job that is being asked to perform. Everything outside of moving on to supervise, if that is even what you want, is a lateral move and I don't believe that is fair. Most of the supervisors had little to no people skills and upper management didn't care at all."
good,"My experience on the retail side was poor.  Employees were treated poorly with little to no opportunity for advancement.  "
good,I was with the company over 9 years & felt like I was treated as just another number and not taken into consideration for the time & dedication I gave the company during my time with them.
good,It's fine working there - until budget cuts and re-orgs happen and then they cut large populations of their workforce with no notice. You come in one day and walked out an hour later along with 1/3 of workforce. ComEd and AT&T will give people 3 months notice and help them find something internal.
good,Understand the production requirements for the department you are applying for.   Understand and know the management you will be working under.  Ask for for what changes within the department you will be working within.
good,I worked in the student loan department and we knew it wasn't going to last.  As things started to wind down more people were downsized.  It was an OK place to work.
good,Chase was a fast paced environment. Management sucked and on many occasions I regularly had to work during my lunch period any time the branch experienced a rush so it would not impact customer service feedback on wait times.
good,"Cut throat environment,  managers are pressed to have employees meet goals or supervisors and managers get d"
good,"You are constantly watched on video cameras and every key stroke is reviewed before you can send an email, even personal messages."
good,"I learned a lot working with Chase. They believe promoting from within.  The work environment was stressful at times. Great benefits."
good,"A typical work day is very redundant. Same old. Different day. You are scheduled to work at odd times. My schedule is basically an inconsistent mess for when full time employees are on vacation. I still have yet to understand why I was passed up on 3 separate occasions for a full time spot, that were filled with people who left shortly after being in the position! I'm over working at Chase and being treated like a number, a peasant, worthless. Anyway. Hopefully something better happens for me soon, I'm a great person and tired of bending over backwards for this place that doesn't appreciate me."
good,"There is nothing nice to say. No respect for people, everybody overworked and not treated nicely. Continuous reduction of benefits for employees while delivering record profits."
good,"Chase has a great opportunity to deliver on a great culture and place to work, however, its goals related to having Diversity in the workplace is overwhelmingly holding the financial institution from being a great place to work. Chase is so focused on Diversity it is passing up qualified, and honestly much better qualified candidates, for leadership roles where management does not have the ability to effectively lead their team lacking experience in the job role.  As an example, it is difficult for a branch manager to be a leader and motivator of the team they manage if they never have been in the role of their employees.  This happens all to frequently at Chase and it is a flaw that needs to be addressed."
good,Compensation plan is good. Leadership is understanding and motivational. They are down to earth and understand the business that we work in. Highly competitive .
good,"Great CEO and senior management, but overall culture has become too corporate in recent years with limited mobility opportunities due to ""location strategy."""
good,"I worked different floors and different positions in the building. They preach diversity, but they are not diversed. They play favortism and have they're groups, personality types, ages, races, genders, skin tones, etc that they want there to keep there jobs and if you don't meet that description as a being you are terminated like they did me at both floors. I was a threat to them clearly. I wouldn't recommend this job to someone relatable to me a master class being."
good,"very segmented firm and it's difficult to move across the silos of business, its a giant firm but bigger is not always better for the employee, lots of turn over, training may get you ready to go elsewhere but not to stay."
good,"work long hours and not much compensation.  after working 10yrs never really got promoted, hard to find new positions within the company.  excelled at my job, I was the best banker in my office"
good,"To be completely honest, the job itself was nice and easy. However, the management were horrible. The higher VP employers treated the employees like we were just another employee number. Never did I feel like the management once strive to help the employees find career advancement or act like they care about how we feel with how the job is functioning. "
good,"Poor management. Has favoritism, one of the tellers, there was no day she wasn't crying because of unsensitive supervisor/ lead teller. I don't wanna work with that kind of environment so I decided to quit,"
good,"Great company name recognition with a deep line up of products and services.  Very little focus placed on human capital, nobody is irreplaceable and they insure that you are well aware of that.  Too many layers of managers that are clueless meeting room fillers."
good,"Processing daily banking transactions.and reviewing customers profile on bank system.I learned the in's and out's of banking policy and procedures how to handle customers and there needs.by"
good,Workplace culture was  pretty nonexistant.  Management often required the tellers and relationship bankers to get as many customer s walking into the branch at the relationship bankers desk which often backfired from the bank's intended goal.
good,"when you are working for a large corporation, we as employees forget that they are just that... A Large Corporation! They have a mission statement that may not fit with your beliefs exactly, but take your time there as a learning experience to move you into your chosen career path. I learned a lot my time there, but I would change the feeling of the ""your job is on the line"" mentality instilled by mid-level management."
good,"At Chase its about who you know, not what you know and if you are good in your area be prepared to be blocked from advancing.  Chase doesn't make sure the employees come first, the pay is below average  When you have been somewhere 10 years and only make $19.00 hr and this is with you passing your yearly...you can tell that they are not paying as they should."
good,"My experience at Chase was less than perfect and aside from it not being a job in my preferred field, it was never fun or stimulating to work there. Management was horrible and unsympathetic to work place problems."
good,"Compensation for the duties are not balance. Trained in multiple skilled with no compensation of pay until after a year. When the hired on you are told their will be a raise within 6 months  , but the raise actually does not come until 12 months.  Long hours , opportunity for overtime when available and with manager discretion."
good,Great starting point for analyst program. Global company and many business areas to gain exposure in. Advancements not clear but its been too long to say.
good,"I had the opportunity to develop a recognition program for default services for coworkers accomplishments, birthdays, anniversaries, and special announcements"
good,"The company is very by the book, which is good. They however make high producing sales reps into managers, which is not always a good idea. They have very poor management and the employees are not always treated fairly. The benefits are EXCELLENT, some of the best I've ever seen. They also offer alot of online training. The downfall was I did not receive a pay increase nor was I able to post out during the entire time I was there. They had a hiring freeze with an unknown ETA."
good,"Margin dept. management didn't want to help advance employees careers, and told you so. Not allow to take career advancing exams, long hours no reward"
good,"My close too 10 year tenor at chase was awesome and met a lot of great people and I enjoyed my employment there, I would love to work their again if the opportunity presents itself."
good,"I found my time at JPM Chase very enlightening.  I am a better version of myself because of my time and the relationships that were built at JPM Chase.  There are many positive things and also probably equally negative things I can point out.  But what is life without contrast.  The more contrast, the more we know who we want to become and what we want out of life.  It's all good."
good,the managers get bored and begin fault finding to create situation that require them to act upon. Overall it can be cool if the manager relax and trust who they hire. if they were personable then they would have to be so skeptical about productivity
good,Great place to start out if needing an hourly job.  Definitely recommended to search for higher paying and better work/life balance positions elsewhere.
good,"Our work was farmed out to Philippines. We trained the staff there to take over our jobs."
good,"Management teach practices of being transparent, open minded and collaborative. In most cases they do no practice these teachings. Very political heavy environment."
good,Its a good place to work.  When I was there I didn't enjoy the job position that I had.  When I would apply elsewhere I didn't know what the salary was or any other information unless they hired you for the job.  A lot of the time they would call it a lateral move.
good,"Low salary, capped commissions for licensed banker position.  Management happy keeping bankers from promotions, leaving a tiered hierarchy with some bankers paid more and keeping things status quo."
good,"Great people"
good,"Department orientation program not given to new employees"
good,"The management was poor. Hours were infrequent. Did not take the time needed to train properly. Favoritism within management, especially when giving out hours and promotions."
good,"Take Supervisor calls, and solve complaints and problems and answer peer questions and assist. Log all complaints and following with customers when needed"
good,Big bank culture some times the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  Very big on diversity and off shoring work to reduce expenses and drive profitability across the firm.  This is very positive for shareholders.
good,"This was the best job until I began to work under a man that would do any and everything to ensure his success with the company, even it meant taking credit for others work, or falsely placing people on corrective action, he even went so far as to denying someone a chance to interview in another position when they attempted to leave his team"
good,"Unfortunately, the environment at JPMC has become one of uninspired complacency.  We have gone from a company of exited and dedicated employees to one of hirelings just getting through the day. The creativity and passion that once embodied the fast paced culture of an exciting workplace has been diminished to the point of passivity. "
good,Working in the bank had good exposure to customers and practice providing great customer service. Enjoyed working with the staff that were in the small location I was placed in .
good,"The benefits and pay were above average. The job was very cut throat. It took 3 months for them to get me a computer after continuously bringing it up everyday and explaining to them that I did not have a computer therefore didn't know what meetings were being scheduled and was not able to receive or respond to emails. During my mid-year it was used against me that they did not have a proper on boarding process and missed meetings and emails do to my lack of a computer. The people I worked with on the credit card side were willing to throw each other under the bus and were not willing to focus on resolving issues, but would spend an entire 1 hour meeting focusing on who to blame for an issue."
good,"Technology very slow and outdated.  Comp is good. "
good,My time here wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible either. I had great co-workers who were helpful. The job itself was quite easy. The management though was terrible. They didn't want to help out their employees advance. I just didn't feel supported here.
good,"Management were clock punchers, do as little as possible until you are replaced. You will be replaced, your job will be relocated to Texas, you will be laid off. Your job will come back and they will hire you for less than you were making."
good,"Your production and quality are tracked not for anything incentive-based, just to decide who should be laid off. High turnover of employees as well as managers. Work procedures are slow to be updated and employees are penalized for following them with errors against their quality score. Lack of available work inevitably hurts production numbers. Employees who cheat and assign work to themselves are held up as examples to strive for. Managers side with other teams instead of their own. Micromanaging is the management philosophy at all levels."
good,"advanced in the bank under some great managers. unfortunately, when you work for the wrong boss, it ruins the entire experience and stunts growth. great bank, just need to hope you work for the right person"
good,very competitive work environment.  long hours with limited work life or family life balance.  If management likes you you will advance upwards quickly.
good,Mid Level Management are not adept at people skills.  They need to review the skill sets of management level opportunities. Be ready to work unlimited hours with no positive feedback from management
good,"While working at my current employment, I have realized I am ready to work in an environment where I can contribute more to my employer and location  is closer to home. There are constant projects, reports, and researches but there is a lack of job security and job location is too far."
good,Employess work very hard and there are no recommedation of the hard work. Chase is very high demanding and dont give enough proud in their employess. Daily responsibilities are repeat.
good,The company has great compensation and benefits but struggle with finding good market directors that actually care about their employees.  No real room for advancement and never any support from upper management.
good,"workplace culture is fast paced,  can be stressful, and numbers oriented with a focus on quality. "
good,Mismanagement was apparent. Shifting was impossible to adapt with. They do not concern much about your personal life. Too hard to get your leaves approve and team leads have poor leadership skills
good,"Chase has always been a good place to work; good people work there, the pay and benefits are ok, and there is a decent amount of opportunity. What I have started seeing the last several years is a diminishing amount of team culture and training support."
good,For a temporary job there isn't an issue with Chase. That said there were times where I felt we were understaffed and over utilized. Occasionally being the only one working in certain areas of the branch proved to be both overwhelming and stressful.
good,"Expected to work many weekends/late nights. Pay was decent. Many mangers in tech teams do not have experience in newer technology stacks and frameworks, leading to many poor decisions."
good,Worked almost every night and every weekend sometime going to 2am in the morning and expected to be in the office the following morning.  Management did not care about family or personal life including on weekends.  Was required to work every weekend.
good,We had a lot of fun competitions for performance.  managers were kind of not qualified and had no EQ. Chase worries more about the business need than the employee needs
good,Priorities are not building quality software just to get the job done. Similar to 'good enough to government work. The management do not provide the tool need to be a professional in this industry.
good,"It a very large company almost like multiple small companies operating together. So working from One group to Other is almost like switching jobs."
good,"You really have to work up until the last cent. I've been with the company for quite some time and it came to a point that I had to file my resignation because my manager has been asking me to do overtime 4-5 hours in a day. I'm really passionate with what I do and I work so hard however, I can no longer bear with the stress."
good,They do not care about their employees at all. No job or security or advancement unless you kiss butt. Machines were old and out of order. I will never go back.
good,"Great benefits. The 401K as well as medical and dental benefits are great as well as reasonable. The pay is terrible. I have been employed as a personal banker and I have received one pay raise in 5 years."
good,"The more you provide the more you're expected to. They also keep you in the dark as much as they can until they pop the ""we're closing down this department of 300 people, bc we're outsourcing your jobs to India and the Philippines"" meeting."
good,"Learning opportunites are abundant across teams."
good,Nice place to work & learn multiple latest technologies. Good motivation from the management team to learn & contribute towards the projects. Good Place
good,They offer a lot of lateral job positions that would be good for your internal resume but does not pay. Mostly everyone averages a 10 cent raise per year.
good,i really dont know how to judge but still i have to do it  .working wise good no much scope for learning u have to engage with some work else no point...
good,Hopefully new management is running it. The spot was a great spot but the direct management was not up to par. The spot was interesting and valuable. I learned a lot in the role.
good,You will find yourself doing work that is not justifiable by the pay as a Teller at Chase Bank. The management at my branch barely steps in to offer any help. There is not much to enjoy about this job.
good,"See previous review submitted.  All required information was provided a few minutes ago.  At the time I worked there, Chase was focused on sales only, not customer service."
good,"I found my experience at JP Morgan in Client Services rather uninspiring.  It appeared that the training for the role is haphazard in terms of coaching new associates.  In addition, there was a somewhat pervasive individualist mentality among associates.  I am only basing this review on the department I worked, not the company as a whole."
good,The work itself was not challenging. Not having management support or leadership is what made me leave. The inconsistency on policies and the favoritism that was clearly shown was difficult.
good,"Great place to learn about financial services. Great place to pick up work experience in different lines of business. Growth can be limited in certain markets and overall company culture should improve and emphasize retention of good employees,."
good,"A typical work day within my last position was challenging. This was one of the reasons for choosing to work in the KYC Department. I learned about Anti - Money Laundering and how to recognize suspicious activity. Throughout the duration, work began to slow as some days we had no work to conduct. Management could have been a little more knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was my research and narratives were all subject to audit, and their findings would all be subjective. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you had a hand in recognizing  and possibly stopping illegal activity."
good,Management changes a lot and they don't interact with their employees well. The environment is negative and stressful. It is a challenging job and there is always opportunity to put your own input in to better the flow of the work.
good,"Poor, there was upper management issues of a personal nature that were dealing with direct line reports that are against company policy,"
good,"very diverse place to work loved working here but no structure constant management change always use temps rarely highers permanent positions,jobs pretty straight forward if you know your stuff"
good,"Good place to work at, with excellent compensation benefits."
good,"Rigid - partly due to heavy regulations.  ""Location Stategy"" inflexible and intolerant of good employees' personal needs.  More focused on putting bodies in specific locations globally.  Many good, long-term employees forced out as a result."
good,"A typical day at work: monotonous'"
good,positive environment to work in. Staff was pretty decent and honest. laid back management great benefits. customers were really appreciated and satisfied with sevices
good,I am currently in the market seeking a new opportunity.  I'm looking to grow my career in the field of investment/portfolio management.
good,I worked at APAC for JP Morgan Chase. The place is now called EGS. It's filled with lot's of young kids who are just there to collect a check. Management is all on a power trip and doesn't care to help you succeed.
good,Zero work life balance. Employee are counted as headcounts rather than people. And as usual the usual corporate bureaucracy. Bur Pays well.
good,"The company is an excellent company to work for. I've been with the company 2.5 years and this is by far the worse position I've had thus far. The company benefits are wonderful! The pay sucks! I started this position 05/2016. For this position, the downtown location is great but the work environment is horrible, the management and employees are very unprofessional. This make the position very uncomfortable and also makes a person become very antisocial in a sense. I do not like this job/position at all, expecially coming from my previous positions. The reason for my move to this department was easier/closer travel, downtown is much more  convenient for me than having to travel 1.5 away from home. FYI convenient is not always better!!😒 If I can do it all over again, I'll definitely reconsider my decision."
good,"You are underpaid for the amount of work that you do. "
good,Hard work is rewarded. Nice place to sharpen your skill. A typical day would start with a team meeting to discuss the project goals and what needed to be achieved. We followed more of a hybrid methodology in Chase.
good,Constantly changing procedures was annoying but didn't make sense but it kept the workplace dynamic. My manager was great but am unsure about the VPs.
good,"The greatest asset of working for this company was the core team. We worked together closely and collaborated daily to resolve the daily ticketing or Priority 1, 2 ticketing. The team also worked closely on multiple projects and updated each member on daily basis."
good,"Chase employees are the Marines of banking. They are the best. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of helping many ppl with their transactions. I learned to be patient with everyone. Management was efficient. The most difficult part of my job was traveling such a long distance everyday. I loved helping all my customers.
good,"Review calls all day to assure that agents all following chase's policies. "
good,"Loyalty to this company means nothing.  I spent 13 years of my career here.  Pay is dismal, promise not kept after given more and more responsibilities and never received pay increase as indicated."
good,"there are things that i have learned from working in this company. one, that i should have time management, in that way i would be able to do tasks before the deadline, two, that i should have the ability to do multitasking, especially i worked as a administrative office and a part time teacher. three, that i am able to cope up with stressful tasks, being in the office and being with the students"
good,"There were many day-to-day issues, and we were always fire-fighting.  Mgmt always said to ""plan"", yet, we only had time to complete our daily tasks and to create the reports from the last issue."
good,Lack of mobility opportunities especially towards the US. Lot of talent retention issues. Lack of transparency. Smart colleagues. Pressurized environment to work in.
good,"Customer service on inbound and outbound queues. Assisting with Mortgage payments, questions and loan modifications or payment plans. Assisting with mortgage online banking banking issues."
good,"Chase is a fun place to work. However, branches have extended hours of operations. advancement opportunities are only provided to a few employees."
good,I worked for JP Morgan Chase for 13 years and was suddenly laid off. I've learned valuable skills and developed a great work ethic while working here.
good,"-salary won't increase as you apply for a better position"
good,I worked here as a customer service rep. It's a graveyard shift so there's no work life balance at all. But I learned a lot from this company.
good,"If you're interested in working for the top bank in arguably the most competitive/dynamic industry, perhaps this is the best company for you. However, please be aware as a minority the environment was not culturally friendly or dynamic."
good,"I had a few good employees. I had all good supervisors except for my last one. She did not care about her employees,she just came to work to get a check and that was it."
good,Chase is one of the largest banks in the world. It is because of its size that the work environment is cold and indifferent. They want to most talented people at the cheapest cost. Human Capital. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,"The work itself was ok, but management made it hard to work properly. Management looked over your shoulders while you worked."
good,"C'est un environnement de travail stressant ou chaque appel est chronométré et si on essaye d'aider le client du mieux que l'on peut et que cette appel dure trop longtemps cela affecte notre rendement, voire jusqu'à avoir des répercussion négatives sur le long terme sur une quelque augmentation salarial à la fin de l'année. L'entreprise devrait plus être à l'écoute des clients et employés. Quant au management nous étions géré par une personne qui n'avait aucune compétence en management d'ailleurs elle fût rétrograder à un poste de unit spécialiste quelques temps après mon départ de la compagnie. L'aspect le plus difficile de mon poste c'était le de boucler la fin du mois avec le peu d'agent sur le plancher. L""apect le plus agréable c'était les collègues de travail."
good,This isn't the job that i hoped for. the best part of the job is the co workers and the commission that is granted. job advancement is the worst unless you are kissing up to management.
good,"Meet with clients in branch to take care of a wide range of personal finance issues. Needs based sales are very important, you have to be able to take what a client tells you and see if there are any opportunities to help them with the bank products you have."
good,"I learned team management and leadership skills."
good,expected of large company office politics. it is who you knew not what experience you had to climb the ladder. company was all about numbers which is understandable if they could explain the matrix/metric system.
good,Chase is not concern with employees personal lives outside of work. Very hard to get time off of work for doctor appointments or to handle personal matters. They removed 10% for 2nd shift employees to cut cost while upper management received raises.
good,"Love working with money and meeting many different people. Co-workers have become good friends. The days are long but fly by when busy,"
good,Dry work culture different from other Financial Firms.  Not a whole lot of room for innovation but friendly co-workers were a pleasure to work with.
good,"I thought I was applying for an aml position, and throughout the interview was never told that it was a call center position. First day was taken up stairs and realized it was a call center for the fraud hot line. I told my trainer that I applied for the wrong position and was told I had to stay in the position for a year before being considered to move to another area. My numbers were always high, very strict about hold times, and we were told you have 5 min. A month for personal time but don't use it, because it will hurt your numbers. Omg what do you want good customer service or worry about how long you are on a call. You have a set schedule and they are not flexible if you need a different day off. They lie about how great the dept is, but people are leaving right and left because of the stress. It is also very difficult to schedule a vacation due to them using a vacation bid system. Terrible. I do have many friends I met there, but I would not recommend this place for anyone. The managers are not helpful to help you go to another dept. They don't like losing anyone because it makes them look bad, so to me very poor management. The team leads were awesome."
good,"A typical day involved receiving  phone calls from cardholders who needed help either with statement analysis, limit increases, payments. balance transfers, and so on. I learnt that most card holders needed basic education in handling financial matters. My immediate supervisor was very supportive, however, the overall management wasn't. My co-workers were okay with me until I started   messing up the curve: my numbers were far from normal. The most challenging part of the ob was to maintain a consistently low handle-time.  Since most card holders call only when there is a crisis, it is very difficult to keep the conversation short. But I enjoyed being able to put them at ease by explaining what they did and how to avoid it next time. I also offered them other products and alternatives that they liked."
good,"These days its very difficult to secure career development investment, in particular training and the necessary management mentoring."
good,JP morgan is a good company to work with.no night shifts. goos benefits. overall good. but not much technical growith.salary wise ok
good,"Verizon has an excellent training program, they will try their best to help with you sells. They do like sharing their culture."
good,Come in usually at 10 am till closing which was about 6:45 to 7pm.  Great thing was it was busy work.  Not so great was the manager at the location and the ability to work with work life balance.  Worked every Saturday and did all closing shifts in an entire month.  Overall company is obviously a great company with large potential to move up.
good,I have had a good experience at JPMC. The management team is very open and honest however the training of new employees needs work. Things are constantly changing and once a change occurs and implemented a new change is starting.
good,No one was on the same page.  Underwriting through the location was not the same as U/W for National Underwriting.  Management style was lacking.
good,Demands to work long hours not adjustable to work life balance. Middle management not flexible yet very demanding do not practice what they preach
good,"Sales driven role which thrived on partnership with Senior reps, cold calls, marketing strategy and continuous training and development."
good,"Good people, poor management, terrible compensation.  The benefits are pretty good.  There's little job security because the company will relocate offices at a moments notice.  Customer service is of little importance to them, they are more concerned with cost cutting and impressing investors."
good,"Positive Attributes: "
good,"A typical employer, nice staff but lack of communication between management. Pay is reasonable, however there's a lack of advancement due to positions being withdrawn and removed."
good,"this job has good health benefits promotes team work,a fortune 500 company, promotes travel, typical day at work is face pace, management is fair,coworkers are team players,hardest part of my job is not of room for multitasking,most enjoyable part of my job is helping clients."
good,"This is a fast paced work environment that requires you to be adaptable to constant change.  I have learned more in my 3 years working here than in the entire span of my career.   My coworkers make this an enjoyable place to work, however managerial presence and or assistance is non-existent."
good,"Learned about the process of foreclosure and the reasons for why it is necessary. Learned many different databases involved in the process. Great coworkers, hardest part was the accuracy needed to be maintained on each quote."
good,"A typical day at work was to get settled before you were logged into the system to perform your job.  Calls were inbound as well as outbound.  Be prepared for questions that might be asked and perform my job to the best of my abilities."
good,Management had their favorites. If you were management favorite you advanced if not you stayed in one place. Co workers were nice and personable but 2 faced. Very high stressful job the tools and correct information was not always given. They specter low handle time and great quality and customer service with out the time to do your job correctly. The customer always paid for that analyst rushing the call and this resulted on multiple call backs for same issue. They incur rage to resolve the issue in one call but not enough time is provided.
good,Although Chase is a Great place to work the 3rd Floor manager's are not. This is a very stressful environment and the managers are kinda high school as they hang in cliques.  I received help more from my co workers and other managers since I could not ever locate my direct manager. The way management talks down to workers only confirms that you're just another number who can be replaced. The benefits within Chase are great but I strongly don't recommend working on the 3rd floor. Its not worth your sanity and self respect.
good,"Investigated financial frauds. Used legal research techniques to obtain information pertaining to theft."
good,"I worked here for 4  months, simply because I couldn't last any longer. I definitely came into this job not  knowing what I was getting into. The work load is heavy, and they micromanage everything. I had the part-time weekend shift, which was Saturday and Sunday from 7am-3:30pm. I actually caught on pretty quick and learned a lot from this job. However, after a while of working here it begins to become stressful and tiring. I would wake up and dread having to go into work. They put a lot of pressure on the employees, and ask for a lot of your time for overtime. I just didn't like the overall feel of the environment, everyone there is always stressed and frustrated."
good,"JP Morgan Chase prides itself on investing in its employees, however it is extremely difficult to advance within the company or get an adequate bonus/wage."
good,When JPMorgan bought EMC Mortgage they did away with my job so i worked in the Funding Department then as work got slow they moved me to the Title Department.
good,"its okay. job is easy, but youre on a dialer and that kind of stinks. other then that, work hard, work OT, stay above half the poeple in your dept and you will be fine."
good,I have the opportunity to work with and learn from some great people.
good,"Duties included call center functions for Direct Auto Finance Loan Closing department, preparing documents for loan closing, reading legal disclosures, Way to Wow training, and testing procedures."
good,"Great place to work. Great pay. Great career."
good,A typical day consists of underwriting application which requires continued focus and mental alertness.  Its hard work but I enjoy working with the dealer clients and exploring ways to mitigate risk and maintaining the dealer client relationship while increasing volume penetration at the dealer level.
good,The company is very corporate and follows the books to the T.
good,"•	Coordinate workload distribution across the call center."
good,"I was promised to a position as a banker that never did happen. They much rather hire a dog, than promote you no matter how hard you work. Ex."
good,This company has been in existence for over 100 years. Their model changes and changes there is no consistency. The Regional managers have no idea of what real life everyday banking is. There are a few who came up in the ranks but they are all about business. Some of the managers they hire have no regard to deaths in a family nor does the company supply a program to help people who work there deal better with death in their personal life so they can survive in their work life. The company can be better when they realize that their employees should come 1st so they can make their customers happier.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working for JPMorgan Chase.  Although I wanted to eventually transition into law enforcement I had hoped to be with Chase for another year or two. "
good,Highly Motivated in this role.. work very hard and have a lot of responsibility.
good,Tough to grow on and increases are not as substancial. good training
good,"To many negative people, not enough people willing to step up and assist, and also no opportunity for career advancement."
good,"Compliance analyst, I had a production number to meet on a daily basis"
good,"It is a difficult environment to work in if you expect freedom, accountability and collaboration."
good,great company to grow with. good chances of climbing the corporate latter
good,"The iniatial 2 years was fun at work."
good,"Besides all I included in my resume, constant smiling and great customer service."
good,I had the privilege to help people like me with their banking needs and looked forward to the daily interaction with each and everyone of them.
good,"My typical day is taking calls from customers who are experiencing a levy, hold, court order or ISRN on their acct. My job is to explain the situation give out important information in order to get the issue resolved and keep customer calm and underdanding. I enjoy my job, i really do like working with the customers and being a major help to them in a time of need. My co workers ar great and very helpful when i need to ask a question. The hardest part of this job is giving out bad news to customers because of the hold on the acct but once i offer assistance that makes the customer fell better and less stressed make my job well worth it"
good,"Chase is an ok place to work.  Diversity is great.  They do not pay to keep talent and they make unnecessary organizational changes very often.  They give white, inexperienced college students greater opportunities for advancement than tenured employees.  No loyalty there."
good,I enjoy working with my colleagues who I consider my work family rather than colleagues.  Our working environment is an excellent place to learn various lines of business and products.  Our new management leads with confidence and determination which invigorates and inspires the entire team.
good,the job as I stated previously they didn't pay well and expected more work from you than paid. The good side is they always had food gathering.. I made some lifelong friends from there. The employees I meet were friendly and helpful individuals.
good,"Work/family life tough. Perfect employee no children or ill parents."
good,A lot of work with not enough pay..very busy and work most Saturdays
good,"Overpayments in payroll operations.  Very divided workplace, alot of tension at times.  Supervisor was not the best but the manager was. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the work flow.  There was such an abundance and we were short staffed at the time.  Took longer than expected to get the work caught up.  I enjoyed being busy all day, working the cases, settling the payments."
good,I have liked working for J P Morgan there bonus were very fair
good,This review is specially for the operations area. This group doesn't provide much opportunities to advance your career and its also difficult to transfer to another group even though you're an internal employee. The role itself is very administrative and manual. The managers/supervisor doesn't really care about your development. Most people in this group left or transfer elsewhere; low morale.
good,"If you're looking for a sales job, go for it.  If you really want to help people, look elsewhere - it's all about the sales and money."
good,"A typical day in the chase world is:"
good,"Typical for Mrotgage Industry Standards and expectations. Rates drop, pipleines increase, rates increase, personnel decreases."
good,"It has opportunity, however it can be hard for you to get your manager to trust you and afford opportunities to you. The company is so large, that if you don't like where you end up the jobs are endless.  "
good,"I worked for chase as a mortgage underwriter. Full documents review. I typically reviewed 2-4 new loans and 4-10 re-subs clearing conditions."
good,"*hard work all day long"
good,Chase is a large organization however it is very challenging to move across various lines of businesses.  Compensation is definitely an opportunity for improvement but they do provide plenty of PTO hours.
good,Was able to secure work for the summer.  Job was pretty much as advertised.
good,"J P Morgan is a good company. They have a professional and an organized staff.  On the other hand they sent me link saying i was not qualifed for the posistion after they scheduled for an interview.  They did not contact me after the interview to let me know if I got the job or they decided to go in a different direction.  I worked for the company as a temp three years ago; however, they felt this was not enough.  My overall experience with the management was good one but they leave a sour taste in your mouth"
good,If your interested in place with constant change this may the ideal place for you. I learned the necessary skills to enhance my current knowledge within mortgage industry. Management and teams tend to move around frequently. The most enjoyable part was receiving  a good income. The hardest part of the job was the company's culture.
good,The perpetual change caused by regulators and DOJ is impeding the business and daily normal working environment of the employees.
good,"Normal larger financial service bank.  People to try to be caring, many managers work hard to make sure others are able to succeed, but largest mentality on pay, benefits, and culture."
good,"In a typical day, I manage my teams closing queue depending on their abilities.  On a daily basis, I analyze the human capital to determine the workload each Closer receives.  I monitor the quality of the closing documents generated to ensure the customer receives accurate figures.  "
good,A typical day includes critically analyzing Modification reviews submitted by UW.
good,"While JPMC offers a good compensation package, they lack in career development and they will not fill positions of employees who have left the company.  This makes it difficutlt for the staff in the the work load in intense with no addtional resources to be added to the team to insure proper delivery of projects and solutions.  work life balance is hindered because items must be delivered and very few resources to effectively do so."
good,"Work enviroment was ok to work with."
good,Learnt a lot. Management has no clear knowledge of how to make sure new hire have knowledge about the software and concepts. Its like blind leading the blind
good,"During my tenure at Chase, I watched more inept people promoted merely because of spectacular numbers than any measurable amount of experience needed for leadership.  Most of the people being promoted because of their good numbers (particularly calls/accounts per hour) only had such high numbers because they refused to follow procedure.  They'd often zip through their work so fast that they'd make untold numbers of errors, most of them never caught."
good,The hardest thing about the job is the high sales goals.  It seems as if you must be favored to be promoted.
good,Learned many valuable abilities such as Title Issue Resolution & Attorney Timeline Management 
good,The job is stressfull yet rewarding at times. More needs to be done to create work.life balance
good,My experience did not show many opportunities for advancement or Annual Reviews based on Merit.
good,Little work/life balance and advancement is very difficult.
good,"Long Hours, Hardly appriciation. Knowledge of international tresury, Swift banking."
good,"The typicalday ws runnig around all day short staffed due to the company iring based on teller transactions instead of the structure of the branch. I learned that no matter how much you devote yourself to a company and improve working environments and customer service, some companies will still not look to employee satisfaction. Management never took responsibility for employee satisfaction, issues amongst employees,etc. The hardest part of the job was getting the branch manager to hold employees accountable for their actions, goals, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers,the employees with carer advancement, and that I went home daily knowing I did my best each day."
good,"Managers manage with complete lack of engagement with employees. Long term plans not in place, style is more ""survive the day""."
good,Responsibilities
good,"My typical day includes reviewing journal entries, updated quarterly workpapers, and following up with ad hoc requests. The hardest part of the job is coordinating the various functionalized teams to complete their tasks in time to pull together the quarterly workpapers for each of the funds by the client deliverable deadline. The most enjoyable part of the job are the various online training resources available that help to expand your knowledge of the industry."
good,"This is the epitome of a sales position. A typical day includes making sales calls and meeting with customers to drive your personal sales. If you do not produce in a consistent manner then management will get involved. They will come up with an action plan to work to your strengths. If you are good at people skills then the branch will try to get as many people in front of you as they can. If you are good at phone calls or working the branches book of business then management will make sure you have time to do that instead of dealing with maintenance. I excelled at selling banking products. I was the best of the best, I achieved various personal achievement rewards, including National Achiever, which is only handed out to 80 bankers per year."
good,A typical day for me consists of bringing up all systems needed to perform my job. Checking with my supervisor to see if there are any hot projects that need to be completed. I check to see if there are any changes to any of the guidelines that we have to go by. I will speak to my co-workers and offer my assistance if needed. The hardest part of my job is when someone has a problem and no one knows a direct answer. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am helping someone get into a home.
good,I am looking forward to starting my career in the nursing field and discontinue banking.
good,Overall a decent company but was laid off twice in two different departments. Just chose to leave after the last layoff.
good,"Fast paced environment, but there is not much of a career growth. They prefer to bring people from outside rather than promoting in house talent. People are good but like all offices there is some politics going on. Lot of offshoring makes the environment little stressful."
good,"Decent company to work for, with poor pay and poor management."
good,"Overall, it's just a paycheck...that I'd rather not have to put so much effort into getting such little pay and terrible treatment."
good,"Great for resume building. Like any other company, it's defined by its mid-level managers. Some are very good, some are average -- it's always up to you to make the most out of your experience."
good,"I am currently i the Chase Works Program, its a temporary project."
good,"Check in with manager, have work assigned to you for the day, review and perfect foreclosure documents. Co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job, would be having to get the documents notarized."
good,"The associates were friendly and helpful, i learned how important the mail extraction process is for the bank and it's daily deposits. The management team was very approachable. The hardest part of the job was just staying awake, i worked 3rd shift, I enjoyed meeting and working with the associates.."
good,"A typical day at work is different everyday. It is normally for them to tell you that you are moving to a new department with out any notice. I have learned so many different things since I have work in about 4 different departments in the year that I have worked there. My co-workers are great for the most part. I get a long with mainly everyone and love working with them. Management could improve within the company, but are good for the most part. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what is going to happen day by day. It would be nice to stay in same department and learn more about that department and have the opportunity to move up in the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is the things that I have been able to learn and the people that I have meet. Even though mortgage is not something that I want to do in my future, it have given me the chance to learn about something new."
good,"This employer was one of the best and worst to work for. I attribute this to the the challenging times during which I worked for this company...US economic crash and struggle to recover. I learned much in a pressure cooker environment with much disorganization. Challenging, educational and at times rewording. I appreciate the opportunity to have worked for one of our countries leading financial institutions."
good,"Extremely detailed company, customer oriented. If u can get in the right group, ones career can accelerate."
good,"Cash deposits, audit ATMs, settle fraud cases. Good job to learn about banking policies and procedures"
good,In order to succeed at JP Morgan you need to be able to multi task. You should be able to work in a very fast pase environment.
good,"Working at Chase was one of my worst job experiences. In my 3 year tenure, I was laid off twice, then the job transferred to Texas. Very frustrating for me and my family."
good,The environment was very stressful. We had too much work to do and not enough people to do it. That didn't stop them from letting me go from the job though and move it overseas.
good,"Loved this job, but it is so hard to move up in the company, even though they say that it is easy. You get promotions not based on whether you deserve it,but rather if they want you to get it. If they can keep you doing as much work for less money, they will try."
good,Managed a group of telephone reps in Call Center. Most peers were not hands on at all with there employees. Felt as though Senior Management consistently gave preferential treatment on a consistent basis based on race.
good,It would have been a better place to work at if the management team were different and professional
good,"While Chase provides jobs for Ohio families, they do not practice fair payment to individuals doing the same job. Management in my department are not well versed on the subject manner and cannot offer assistance. Work flow is not streamlined and while customer service as a whole has improved, the customer service to the employees has not - and it is the employees who often are the customer. Expectations and priorities change often while communications of these changes are not reported to the floor."
good,"Services are focus on assisting customers whose loans are delinquent or at high risk for delinquency. Advisory services will focus on assisting customers find solutions to maintain home ownership and, if not possible, discussing other solutions including short sales, deed in lieu, etc. Advisors analyze the borrower's personal finances and intentions and make recommendations on loan modification and work out options to resolve delinquency and potential for loss. Conduct face to face meetings with customers, meet with non-profit agencies, loan officers, bank personnel, recommend and initiate loss mitigation workouts according Net Present Value (NPV), negotiate and formalize repayment arrangements when appropriate. Comply with standards associated the customers contact including (Fair Debt Collections Practices Act) FDCPA regulations."
good,"Answer phones all day, lots on interaction with a verity of people."
good,"The position was stressful with the monthly goals changing several times thought the month and mandatory OT. I enjoyed my coworkers so that made my day easier, but it was hard to miss out on family time."
good,"As with any place, it's a crapshoot on who your manager is. Those managers who are good, fair, and supportive tend to go off to bigger, better positions. The other management tends to be filled by the unsuspecting who have been handed the job, because they are the least threatening to upper management. Management did not encourage my career, nor did they support me in my position. It really seems to be an every person for themselves kind of place. Colleagues are all top notch professionals who are good at their job, especially since a lot of what is accomplished is a fly by the seat of your pants operation. It is interesting in that there is constantly the question of how do we get this done?; who supports this?; and how fast can we get it done? Admittedly it's a whirlwind of activity. Unfortunately, this whirlwind can take up your nights, weekends, and holidays. There is remote access to allow mobile and home access to your systems, which alleviates some of the burden of the 24x7 responsibilities. And team coordination allows dedicated after hours on call support. But emergencies arise and things must be reacted to asap before business open. It can be quite stressful. After all the hard work and dedication, you would think advancement would be forthcoming. However, management does not look to promote and it is a struggle to find other positions. Bonuses are either thin or unavailable, and raises have not been provided ""due to these tough times that we live in"". It seems the promotions go to those who do not do a good job, so as to move them up and out; away from the bad job"
good,"Real Easy, Unplug and plug in computers and peripherals. management was a bit hard to get ahold of at times. hard part about the job was making it different locations on a last minute notice."
good,"Chase is a very good place to work if you are a student or fresh out of college. If you're attractive, young and can count to 10, you will get in and progress. If you've worked for any of their competitors you will get paid more. If you're motivated, can sale and attractive go for it, you'll be moving up the ladder quickly!!!"
good,Experience based on retail banking.
good,"I liked this job as a whole but as far as compensation for the amount of knowledge and dedication that I put in for $13.00 an hour was not worth it. I couldn't receive any raises but if someone came off the street without any knowledge they would make a nice amount of money. I tried so hard to get the recognition that I thought I deserved but I did not ""brown nose"" enough. I felt the work I was doing taught me so much and now I will be looking to apply my skills within a new company who will appreciate me. I had one supervisor who indeed thought I had so much potential to move foward and she was going to help me but she left the company and I had no one else to help me."
good,"Great company to work for, innovative and changes swiftly with changes in law etc."
good,"For advancement it’s all about who you know, not your performance. Also the pay as a Personal Banker is very low compared to other Banks. They also tend to change the incentives quit a bit for the bankers and that changes the bankers pay and what they can earn. Not consistent or for the better. There is very little employee morale."
good,"Branches only care about the customers input/surveys and will use the negative against you, management can be retaliatory and HR doesn't seem to do much about it. I've seen coworkers apply for other positions and management told them the only way you can move is it you do A,B, and C, or block it completely even if the candidate already qualifies. They never ask what the workers need to make things better or be better at their jobs. No company celebrations, no raises, no bonus'."
good,It really depends of the manger you get. there is career upper mobility if you connect with the right people. On my time there I've seen too much favoritisms.
good,Their are limited opportunities to advance or improve into new role. Limited job security. Management needs improvement. Training courses are overwhelming and pay increases are very limited
good,"need more improvement by respecting their employers no room for improvement you don't belong to a certain group of people. good benefits, clean environment,"
good,"Very limited in thinking and largely traditional in its approach to dealing with employees and business problems"
good,"-Monday to Friday 7am-3:30pm"
good,"The company promotes career mobility but in practice it is very difficult to achieve. Although the compensation is not the best in the market, other benefits are very good,"
good,"The company is constantly struggling with turnover due to not keeping up with the times. More work from home opportunities, more upward mobility for those who show potential, cutting bonuses even when the company does well. It could be a good place to work but changes need to be made."
good,"Don't get caught up in the prestigious name - JP Morgan.  It is a great company; however, in exchange for the salary - work and unpaid man-hours that's required to get the job done, you might as well work for minimum wage."
good,Extremely competitive and challenging environment with daily issues and problems associated with the environment. Political but also meritocracy based environment.
good,"It was a decent place to work but it was a call center. Need I say more? Poor pay, hard to advance anywhere, and 7 cent pay raises made me leave the company.  Good benefits though.  Like I said....it could be worse."
good,"The pay was not terrible, but it was not the worst. They took fed us weekly to keep us motivated and installed a coffee machine in the break room tab offered flavor options, tea options, and hot chocolate. They offered ramp up and did not make customers suffer from lag time in refinancing like their competition at Bank of America who blames employees for their poor customer satisfaction because they refuse to hold people accountable for their job. People are held accountable at Chase and customers are not suggested to wait a minimum of 35 days for a purchase transaction."
good,"At least in the sector in which I worked, managers strictly look upward for ways look good for their own bosses, hoping to move upward, while almost universally not looking out for, nor showing interest in, the needs and wants of their employees."
good,"There are continuous job eliminations......there has been 3 separate large Reduction in Force (RIF's) and there are more to come by the end of the year.  There is no loyalty to the employees, upper management only thinks about themselves and their careers."
good,"Just as in many life pursuits, it's not what you know, but who you know, job satisfaction is often tied to a firm's environment and the culture evidenced in the day-to-day experiences of professional relationships. These can and do vary depending on individual departments and the leadership thereof. My immediate team was congenial and collaborative; however, some partners outside the group were competitive and self-seeking."
good,Management Always looking over your shoulder and treated very poorly.  If you get sick management will dock you as if you did something bad. They will wait till your review to tell you if you did something wrong instead of teaching you the correct way of doing things.
good,"Very redundant work. Feel lack of strive from management to make things exciting or challenging. Work/life balance was decent, however  felt very time managed throughout my time there."
good,Chase has been a round a long time. It has great global management. The company is strong and it strives to be the best in class when it comes to the Financial arena.
good,The difficulty to get off the phone is extremely hard. Especially if you doubt know anyone in the inside for a bit of a boost. They do promote from within but only after being in one department for years and the promotion is to another in the phone task
good,As often happens with large corporations the upper management changes frequently.  Unfortunately the changes are not always a good fit.  This impacts the teams.  The workers do their best to adapt but it gets difficult when the changes are not good for the company and its investors.
good,"They were not organized, showed much favortism, some racism. Poor management, some managers were not a people person, showed power trips at times. Need new management, then it would be a better place to work."
good,You never know what your walking into. The retail banking side is a double edged sword. No matter what happens your OSAT will go down because someone from an overseas call center leaves a bad taste in the customers mouth
good,"Managers promote their friends instead of their staff.  Overworked, managers are not involved in day-to-day operations.  Managers evaluated you on university degree, but had no degree themselves.  Heavy politicking going on."
good,They cancelled my contract to hire with no notice or explanation but claimed I was excellent at my position. The department I did work in was wonderful. Was extremely upset when they told me I did not have the job after they agreed to higher me.
good,I worked as a level 1 support analyst in Wealth Management. They brought in new managment in 2018 which proceeded to bring in new team leads that had no prior IT experience. It was announced that part of staff would be moving to Texas.In 2019 most of full time staff that was offered move to Texas was purged. I don't feel that the new managment was honest with staff about the movement of the department. Those of us that raised our hand about moving to Texas were the first ones purged. So I would be careful when they offer relocation.
good,I enjoyed working with smart and dedicated colleagues. Company brand is strong and there is pride in high performance. Early mornings and evenings are part of the work.
good,workflow was done as a team. Goal was to bring down delinquency and bring our portfolio back to current.Typical work be on the phone dialed answer all customer concerns and questions they might have on their mortgage.
good,"No freedom on call"
good,"I was super excited to work for chase. The employees behave worse than the customers. Get ready for favoritism. And if you have a problem with any employees managers tell you to ignore them, but how much can you ignore when the environment becomes toxic?"
good,Job is highly stressful and utilization numbers are unrealistic. Management has no concept of the actual work that goes on in a day to day work day. Management is strongly against you joining any fund/charitable raising event given by the company
good,"Teller duties with management skills. Drive up teller, Vault teller, ATM maintenance, Opening new accounts. Referring to loan officers."
good,Overall a well managed bank but obviously very large and can be impersonal. They are investing heavily in technology and as a result there is less personal interaction.
good,Nice office in great location with subsidised gym and canteen. Working hours are very strenuous and very little work life balance. Great food and services provided.
good,"Better client to work, Good work culture, Normal market level Salary, Better Management, Jobs Work life Balance is not good which will be a difficult part."
good,Ok company to work for.  Progression is very limited and they do not like to promote. Better chances of getting senior position applying outside of the company.
good,JPMC is an interesting firm with a lot to offer if the values set forth at the top off the house ever trickle down to middle management. The culture and employee experience can vary by line of business as well as the  leadership at the helm. Overall a solid firm.
good,It was a stable place to work.  The culture was pleasant but without much in the way of career advancement.  The benefits were good and the salary was low.
good,sales goals are hard to reach even if you are driven. if people close their account with in 6 months you have to pay back incentives that were given to you. you could not get your commission in one one month and have to live on your very low salary
good,"JP Morgan Chase is very good most of the time with balancing home & work schedules and are typically flexible when you need it due to doctor appointments, child care & family emergencies etc.  I was very happy there since I first was hired in March 1990 however, my last two years there weren't anything I've encountered in previous positions dealing with co-workers for the outside & a manager in the NYC main office. I had the been an employee for 24 years when a new position was created and I intereviewed & was hired. However, it seemed I was the least liked due to my 24+ years and 4 weeks of vacation time and going on 5 weeks. In all my positions I held at Chase then JP Morgan this was a negative experience for me and I was constantly singled out for the most ridiculous reasons and they were so ridiculous that when I explained them to other coworkers & family they all laughed & thought I was joking. I feel the employee value as diminished my last few years and the concern & assistance with growing development almost nonexistent.  Many employees that had been with the company 20+ years were quitting or being let go.  I had planned on retiring from JP Morgan Chase but, I to was let go shortly after my 26th year anniversary."
good,The people in the company are smart and talented however the company itself is stingy with pay and compensation. They don't care about their employees.
good,"Great people!"
good,"Learned a great deal about loan servicing and was/is encouraged to think outside the box.  Management is quick to say ""well done"" and acknowledges forward thinking."
good,location is nice and office space is great. mgt is not the best and the company does not care about anyone. Its hard to say anything nice about the company because we are being laid off.
good,My position did not have room for advancement because of the location. The branch was relatively close to other branches. The employees worked well together and the job ok. The pay couldv'e been higher but I did not have prior banking experience.
good,"Good bonus for performers. Promotions are done more often as compared to IT company"
good,The company offers great benefits and have numerous business groups.  The team I worked within struggled with be proactive and sr. management was extremely difficult to work with.
good,Cooperative and productive work environment with great culture. Assisting customers in their needs. The work culture and family surrounding chase offers great comfort.
good,productive place to work. hours are OK pay seems lower than it should on average. Work responsibility is not always clearly defined.Management sometimes is very hands off
good,"With all corporate jobs comes goods and bads, JPM is no different.  You'll find a good amount of flexibility in schedule however a lack of actual impactful work.  Management is hit or miss, most dont have the drive to actually make things happen and honestly there is so much red tape at the top that I dont really blame them.  The best jobs in the company are the ones that just leave you alone to cruise by.  Whether or not you have a drive to make an impact, the corporate nonsense will find a way to take it from you.  I guess in the end, it ended up being just another job."
good,"Chase was a great place to work until the merger with Bank One.  There was great appreciation for employees, a gym, good work/life balance.  There was a focus on respect and trust.  Those values faded away after the merger.  I was so impressed with the quality of care for the customers before the merger.  When you had a Chase credit card you had prestige. "
good,No one treated me fairly or cared I don’t have much to say I know I wouldn’t recommend to anyone else. Not a safe place to work not good for physical or mental health
good,As a teller they could have us more hours than 20 because some of have more responsibilities to take care of and make the transition to be a banker more easy and have to resources to help us to get there.
good,Great company. Lots of conference calls and text and emails. They can slow that down a bit. Market managers never see. Manage by text. They tend to overwhelm employees daily with tons of unrealistic expectations. And no guidance
good,"Productive work environment, provided a great experience meeting with high end clients and communicating their financial goals, great partnership with advisors providing a wealth of knowledge regarding the financial markets."
good,"The job was very stressful. Numbers had to always be met, typical work day was spending 8 hours a day on the phone with some happy and some very unhappy customers depending on the outcome. the best part of the job was when I was able too get a struggling customer approved for a mortgage so they could remain in their homes There were a lot of training sessions and meetings once a week to help to keep informed of changes in the banking industry"
good,"Since indeed insists on me filling this out, I'll tell you a little about my experience which is about 8 yrs old. The morale was low--- micromanaged-- you had to fill out how you spent your time on a piece of paper that took about 20 minutes to fill out."
good,worked dialing system --handled inbound/outbound calls in delinquent mortgage department -review loss mitigation options with borrowers to try and resolve delinquency
good,nothing to add about my time at Chase.  It was difficult to get the attention that you deserve with this company because they hinder your ability to move up if the managers thought that you were a threat to them or would out shine them they would not help you to move upwards.
good,"On the whole a pretty decent place, except politics can get very tricky if your team does not have enough power."
good,"Perform a variety of quality control checks in accordance with standard operating procedures for the setup of new accounts and additional locations."
good,such a large company there will always be a job available but not be what you want or like.  Culture - advancement is gained by being the biggest supporter of all ideas/suggestions no matter how bad.
good,For the right person Chase is a great place to work.  If you are looking to start in the banking industry this is a great place.  The comp plans and the base salary are not competitive though for experienced people
good,The position was changed to a call center. Daily contact with customers to ensure the proper documents and/or questions from the customer were answered for excellent service.
good,"Working at JPMorgan is fine for some people and not for others"
good,Ability to work from home. Haven't been here long but management is ok. The culture kind of forces you to be secluded even though a open area. No laptops so people are stuck at their desk for most of the day. People rather have meetings remotely than in person. Managers usually leave you alone. Lack of code review and don't uphold agile principles well. There is a pool table and can watch tv. They are slower to adopt new technology due to regulation
good,Too much micromanagement. Was a rewarding experience helping customers facilitating loans and underwriting prospective ones.Only draw back was too much micro-management and too much pressure on sales calls that did not fit the need to call.
good,"Very large bank, very profitable, with some challenges to work life balance, promotion for veterans over 15+ years tenure, and low compensation for employees who have stayed longer than 10+ years."
good,"Your experience completely depends on your managers. Some are great, some are not.  Environment is ok, Business casual dress. Bank as a whole has no loyalty to employees."
good,Management was terrible there were constant lay offs.  It made the position very stressful and everything was always a rush.  I had to support other countries and there was a communication barrier.
good,"It was typical production environment working within AML, however working long hours during the week and coming in on Saturday's was a little much for me."
good,"The company is not a bad company to work for.  They do pay on the low side of salary for the knowledge and experience.  Merit increases barely cover the cost of benefits increased.  Advancement is only available if changing the LOB you are in, and even then its tough.  I have applied to so many other departments with most of them denying you an interview.  "
good,"I enjoyed the poeple that I worked with, but I think that overall the environment was poor and management could do better, everything was unorganized and poor management."
good,This was and extremely fast paced and competitive culture.  There was a culture of family that developed among the coworkers.  Due to corporate decisions the site was being relocated to another state.
good,"Work is very fast paced and environment is always changing with new people, organization, and/or policies."
good,It is an ok place to work depending on your manager. Management is alwasys changing thier minds and groups are constantly being reshuffled and jobs moved to other places around the country.
good,"Chase is all about tolerance but not for Religious Freedom. There is always workshops for women, minorities and gender equality but never for religious functions"
good,"very poor IT, and outdated systems "
good,"You learn a lot about banking and banking culture, which are helpful life tips for a young professional. The company is always pushing sales and trying to find a way to maximize profit, like any other corporation, so it is expect that you continue to produce if you are in a sales position. You can get your feet wet on the operations side of banking but those positions aren't as common as they used to be. The bank is moving towards automation and finding a way to maximize profit. Raises aren't very common and sometimes year end bonuses aren't granted if your office doesn't reach certain goals. The job is mediocre and becomes very repetitive but the people you work with are what make most the difference and make the job enjoyable."
good,However compensation and advancement is not the best. Would love to stay with company but need to advance my career. Changes need to be made. Should be easier to move from retail to corporate.
good,"JPMC / JPMCB is huge, and sometimes feels impersonal; other times can feel quite collegial and supportive.  Definitely a firm for younger staff, not older.  Excellent place to have a broad range of experiences in financial services. Culture varies a bit between divisions, but essentially hard driven, and fast paced."
good,"Love my staff, however my VP was not good management, no fair to employees, long hours because she was unaware of what her manager needed.  Long hours for same pay to meet deadlines. workplace culture was great with medical center, cafe on site."
good,they offer great benefits and time off but the job itself is harder than it sounds and it can take you a while to advance even though they make it seem easy. management is not easy to get a hold of and they can be rude an overlook you often. it really is an everyman for himself type work environment and not many people actually like the job which can definitely make it hard for you to want to stay with all that negativity. that being said you have to negotiate to make sure you are getting the right compensation for the job you're doing. if you're trying to work in fraud hotline do not accept less than 15.50! the calls are long and hard and the customers make it no better so be sure to get enough for your time and energy cause this job is draining
good,I was a contract employee... was only there for a year... the management was young and inexperienced. It is a large company so your voice is not heard. Overall it was not a bad place to be.
good,It is a good job and a fun job.   I have a tons of friends there and the are very helpful.   I have had lots of experience and help with my co-workers.
good,senior management talks the talk - but rarely delivers. It's a large institution. It's good work and money for a couple of years. Then move on. Senior managers are more interested in their next move/position than doing real work.
good,"Everyday is something different and constantly keeps you growing.  "
good,A typical day at work usually involved stressful goals. Management was never available to sit down and discuss goals and opportunities. The hardest part about the job was meeting the daily goal. The most enjoyable part of the job was that they celebrated my birthday and made me feel appreciated.
good,"I've had 5 different branch managers in my career. All but one of them are supreme micromanagement specialists that likely have little to no sales background. However, Chase does hire a multitude of people and are willing to give just about anybody a shot that has the desire. So, apply and work there but don't consider yourself settled."
good,JPMorgan for most of us was a very busy and fast pace environment.
good,"RHIR does not check in on their contractors to gather information on the assignment and employee relations.  Once you are placed, they only call when the contract is completed and your last day.  Pay is great based on assignment."
good,We were well trained at JP Morgan to be on our toes all the time as process were always volume driven and that we had to deliver even if it is past the normal working hours.
good,"Bureaucracy, often too many obstacles to get things done. Many managers and senior leaders are just not good at what they do. Either not good at managing others or simply not good at leading. A title doesn't = effective leadership."
good,The firm is big enough to afford mobility to anywhere and the employees are diverse. There is opportunity but it can be very competitive and being internal does not provide any shortcut to the application process.
good,"I have been here for about 9 years and its time for a change, there is several other departments to move around but I just want to try something different, want out of banking,"
good,"retail banking, sell services to all customers  ask the same question to the same customers daily, weekly............................................."
good,We had over 25 manager and only 243 employees to manage. Also anyone of manager could have your fire layoff with knowing you or your work. The work was always stress and management did not handle employees in great.
good,I'm ready for career advancement.  I am a senior specialist.  I am eager to learn.  I am capable of training my peers in various accounts. When I don't have experience in a particular field I can easily be trained.
good,Many groups or team are really good but in some of the group lots of unnecessary work politics. Good work have no value unless you are a big talker. or make relationship with high management.
good,Basically a 9 to 5 day. Learned customer service and time management. No job security or advancement. Workplace culture - get money no matter what. No enjoyable parts.
good,Working schedule is based on bank operation hours including later hours during the day and Saturdays. Client facing role and service oriented. Friendly team.
good,Work was routine. Environment changed as more of the Chase culture was incorporated.  People were nice. Work was satisfying. Layoffs often as business needs changed.
good,Treats individuals and a number instead of a person. A lot of pressure to meet expectations on a monthly basis. Relationship bankers only make referrals don't have opportunity to work on financial products.
good,I used to love working at my branch until chase made our ABM retire and made us have a lead teller that is not capable of doing her job . Chase also does not allow tellers to work anymore than 20 hours a week . And our management is horrible they don’t care anymore.
good,"working at chase was a very stressful working environment"
good,JP Morgan chase is a stepping stone. Always network and on the look out for your next position. Do your job and stay focused. It can be stressful at times.
good,"Usual teller work, dealing with lot of customers. As teller i performed lot basic teller transactions, nothing too rigorous. As a part time job this was good."
good,"Very Stressful"
good,"JPMC is a great company to work for but like any big corporation - depends who is the manager. Lots of co-workers are off shore, many jobs outsourced, lots of cultural and language barriers"
good,A professional company  hard work lots of changes daily . Company located to Plano.... Lots if layoffs . Providing no job security. Company did a large downsizing of the mortgage loan modification department
good,I am grateful for all I have learned in my years at the firm. It is a huge place and has strong brand recognition (household name) which works well for the bank's employees in sales roles.
good,The recruitment strategy isn't good. They recruit for some function and the person finally ends up doing a different work. Work life balance is average at 11-13 hours per day
good,it is hard to advance within the company when you do want to be a banker or branch manager. There are so many different areas in the company that you can choose or seem of interest but when talking to management it is not clear. Loved my co workers it was always a fun day at work.
good,"Management tended to treat us like children, the workplace culture was cut throat at times, and competitive at other.  There was a period where there was lot of cheating because we received bonuses based on the amounts we collected."
good,"The products are good, and the ability for the personal bankers to help customers has improved over the years, but lately staff levels have been declining with the push for electronic banking.  In a branch like mine that has not received the latest technology upgrades, it just means long waits for customers. Commissions for relationship bankers can be decent, but personal bankers will be forced to spend more time as tellers, and their commission program is very poor. "
good,"Stressful with limited advancement options - Most jobs are being outsourced to India, South America.  The CEO is moving most jobs / opportunities out of USA"
good,The expectations became more and more difficult to achieve as new requirements were added to call center staff but no changes were made to the metrics by which we were measured.  To be told to work more quickly with more accuracy became dueling priorities since I could not talk on the phone and type at the same time.  I had 4 different managers during my time there and most were helpful or at least understanding.  Two were particularly difficult and one was actually negatively aggressive which did not help my job success.
good,"A typical day at Chase requires the ability to multi tasks while responding to customers inquiries and concerns, in a extreme fast paced environment. Management at times over emphasizes certain metrics while not providing sufficient solutions to remedy the issue.  The hardest part of the job is trying to find a balance  between performance and providing excellent customer service.  The company does do a good job of recognizing exceptional employees, by having award programs and luncheons."
good,"Shouldn't be 25% below national average pay for a position at a company this size. Work days are normal 8 hours, managers are good, care about employee's but very limited to what they can do because of the corporate rulebook at this place."
good,Benefits are the only good thing about this company. The outsource jobs to India and have you train your replacement then close the entire department.
good,"JP Morgan is the biggest bank in the world and the culture for middle and back office support is for from stellar. In the KYC department for the GCB division, the management and the Quality Control people are more interested in numbers and productivity than quality and being a supportive. They is not a lot of product/workflow knowledge within the management team."
good,Great Benefits. i.e. 401k Medical/Dental Insurance and Pension. OT is usually not a problem if wanted. Starting salaries are pretty low. overall its a job that pays the bills
good,"The job and culture is low stress and diverse environment. However, there is no published salary range or  work experience  are adhered to, Bonuses and salary arbitrarily assigned.  There are people doing the same job making $30k more, yet less qualified,but friends with management  make considerable better income which  creates hostile work enviroment."
good,With new management JP Morgan Chase exited our line of business and sold us to RBC Mortgage out of Canada. We were making money it just was a decision made at the top of the house.
good,This was a micro management position which is t always the best but nothing someone cannot handle. Also the training was fantastic they made sure you understood everything explained to you.
good,A good place for people right out of school who need licensing and to get a foot in the financial industry door. Predetermined breaks and lunch times leads to very little day to day flexibility.  Very little 'added value'. A laundry list of technology issues. The management is fair and considerate.
good,"This bank is good for gaining experience but it is not a customer service-type atmosphere.  It is migrating to automation without people. It's products are very good but as an employee, there is a lot of pressure to maintain sales numbers with declining foot traffic.  The staff turnover is tremendous for that reason. The focus changes quickly and outsourcing is big so it is not exactly a dedicated American type company.  The only loyalty is the bottom line."
good,Immediate managers were pretty good but Senior Execs seemed out of touch. Always received top reviews but was laid off while under-performing employees were kept on.
good,"Local competitors offer at least 15,000 to 20,000/ year more in salary on average; however, the experience gained during my early year with the bank was invaluable."
good,Good company if you end up in a good team. Can be stressful sometimes. Management and culture depends on the team that you are working for. Lot of opportunities to move internally.
good,I started as a Telephone Banker which I feel that don't pay enough for all the things that they require that you do. The shifts are okay. They sometimes had shift bids but you typically couldn't do those bids unless you have been that for a year. They have great benefits. The other 4 positions I was in was not good at all. I didn't apply for these positions I was just placed there without any compensation are notification.
good,"When I started there things were old school and people were treated as people, but as time went on and management changed, we were just numbers on a production line."
good,"You will be severely underpaid, however, you will have the name JPMorgan on your resume so I suppose that's worth something.  They are notorious for transferring terrible managers as opposed to firing them so good luck having a competent one."
good,Difficult to work as due to excess staff they remove some employees every year which becomes very difficult for new employees and they need to boost their performance from start
good,"I only worked for JPMorgan Chase as a temporary hire so my experience with them was low. The work was fun, but not being able to talk with your neighbor was a bit unnerving."
good,"Never in a million years did I think I'd work at a bank but I decided to give it a try. There is really nothing interesting about working at a bank as a teller. Your experience depends on the people that you work with. At the branch I worked at, management was not involved at all."
good,"This firm is very large, so you have to be very careful what team you join. Individual teams and their management will have a large role on your future progression at the firm and lateral mobility."
good,"I used to love working for JP Morgan Chase but recently I have relocated to Fort worth Texas from Chicago Illinois, the manager I have now is the absolute worst. She's racist and condescending. There's no power in being the lowest on the totem poll so I choose to remove myself since Chase wont remove her."
good,"It was a good place to begin, but management was absolutely horrible.  Learned a lot though.  You felt like a number.  Management went back and forth on what was acceptable"
good,They hire new people off the street and paying them more than their employees whom have years of experience. They struggle with promoting leaders within.
good,"Company entices you with a good salary and benefits and claims job security.  The truth is that they lay off every three months and there is no job security.  The management is not properly trained.  There is no EEOC required training of employees or managers and as a result there are managers that grossly violate employment laws every day especially with regard to Age Discrimination and violations of the Disability Act.  Expect long hours (11 plus hour days) on a regular basis and working weekends.  Even when you are on vacation or on sick leave for a medical procedure, you are not off.  You are expected to work just like you would if you were in the office."
good,"Overall an ok experience, learn some things but not really a good environment to work.  not much support when it comes to management side. A lot of people are unprofessional that includes managers."
good,So far my only gripe is a move to Brooklyn - as JPMChase have moved several team to MetroTech Brooklyn.  Also not the greatest work/life balance. Average work hours are 8:30 am - 8pm.
good,Very intense. Didn't like it very much. not a hard job to do but management make it  extremely difficult to adjust. The company doesn't supports students and does not work around school schedules for a part time position. Great Benefits though.
good,"The header says it all."
good,Good place to learn and strong base for future as its a complete procedural learning and helps to tackle chalenges in future hence had a very short stay there
good,"While JPMorgan is good for many, it has not been a good experience for me. to get the overwhelming amount of work done I need to work 11-13 hours days. Management is one sided and there is little opportunity for growth."
good,Great benefits and PTO.  Commission package very sub par along with their Salary. Expectations were high but they never followed through with great compensation for achieving goals.
good,Mortgage loan data entry and document review. Production and quality emphasis work environment. There was thourough training and lower level management or supervisors were readily available and involved in day to day work.
good,"worked with the firm more than 5 years and gained knowledge. "
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and learned a lot  Chase started out as a great place to work and we were treated very well.  As times changed, the work culture changed and the atmosphere and I did not agree.  It became a job, not a career.  I prefer not to say anymore."
good,"Very difficult working to help folks save their homes during the big housing crisis."
good,its a huge organisation with more tha 200 years of rich history. the organisation greatest strength is the job security it provides. productive and fun workplace.
good,"Great benefits. low pay. Company mission and goals do not always filter down to frontline management.  Overall a good place to work, but expect stress and pay to be mediocre."
good,"I got a call one day while on the phone with a lady who came in immediately on fire! Money had been taken from her account from a vendor that she had already canceled with. I tried speaking, however, she cut me off, cursed me out, and told me to shut up. I listened very well to her problem and at the end I was more than happy to help her without getting angry. At the end of the call she thanked me, and apologized for everything. That made me feel wonderful. I was happy that I was able to help solve her problem."
good,"Company provides great benefits, and pension contributions. Easy going department but management is hands off most of the time."
good,This particular employer has fair compensation however the opportunities for advancement are not readily available within the unit and they are in the process of actually potentially downsizing the unit.
good,"If you are comfortable with change in the work place this may be the right fit for you. If you like changing jobs every 2-3 years this may be the job for you. However, if you are looking to gain more experience in your career this may not be the right fit for you."
good,"turn on the computer"
good,"Responding to client queries. Liaising with internal stake holders. Great team focus in terms of meeting and surpassing goals and objectives."
good,Overall JPMorgan Chase Bank  wasn't such bad place to work however it was difficult to get linked to a Mentor in the Field I really wanted to advance into and grow with the company.  Such as the Investment Banking & Asset Management Field.
good,"Job security within I&AM is not that great, Pay is lower than industry average, but the benefits are better than most."
good,"I was employed with chase for over 7yrs.. I have meet some wonderful friends and great co-workers along the way. But chase DO NOT appreciate their employees nor does the company have a work life balance. Branch manager was very manipulative, sneaky, and enjoy micromanage.."
good,I learned I am capable of so much from the opportunities I was given. I was given the chance to utilize many of my skills in every position and at the same time obtaining new skills and experiences from them.The toughest part was not having many options to continue to grow and expand within the company. New and advancing positions were either short lived or just not made available in to me.
good,Contract position with no room for advancement and poor benefits package with no paid time off also very little job security.
good,"Before I started working for Chase I had always wanted to work for them. I believed it would be a great company to work for. When I started working there, first thing was that they didn't pay as great as i would have thought. It's decent pay but not exactly what i was expecting. I had a few issues with my manager only because she seemed to me a bit unprofessional. Not only that but going in to the role as a teller I was not aware that I would be spending most of my days as, what they call, an adopter. Which is basically just standing in the lobby teaching people how to use the new ATM's. For some people I'm sure they wouldn't mind but, as for me, it wasn't a good fit. It's too easy and doesn't fit well with me. It made me feel like I was a glorified door greeter. I didn't like it at all. I don't change my mind that Chase is a good company to work for, I would just know next time to be clear about what is expected from me and them."
good,"Fun place to work. Always asking for more from employees. Management sets unrealistic expectations of employees. Amount of work does not equate to higher amounts of pay. Little room for advancement without moving between departments, however, that is expected from a large company."
good,"Too big to work efficiently within its own structure. After almost ten years, multiple different positions including management and a lot of late nights, I'm looking for something smaller"
good,"•	Collect on accounts that typically  range between  20-89 days delinquent"
good,"Typical work day consist of 4-5 meetings.  The remainder of the acutal work day comprises of 'putting out fires' and responding to emails.  After hours consist of creating business requirement and test considerations documents. Creating test scenarios and scripts, running daily KPI reports, detecting, logging, following up on defects.  My co-worker is awesome and is a wealth of knowledge.  Most enjoyable part of the job are weekends when I'm not on production support."
good,"Steady schedule, clean buildings, short breaks, and you have to keep your belongings in a locker. Managers are nice, willing to train you on new tasks."
good,It's a culture that demands a lot of achievement but falls short on rewarding you for that.  The ever changing management structure had a big impact on job satisfaction.  It's a place where it's virtually impossible to establish any sort of lasting relationships because senior management and organization structures change at a rapid pace.
good,"Great Benefits, paid vacation and holidays. Also available matching 401K, retirement fund. Short term disability, long term disability, offers life insurance. also has pre-tax medical spending, and day care offered."
good,All branches are very understaffed. work life balance is really bad. clients are constantly complaining because of the fact that there isn't enough employees.
good,"Most Managers dont have technical skills "
good,"learned everything a Teller has to do and responsibilities,management is poor,opening and closing procedures,co workers it a long very well,the hardest part is that not so much availabilty of assistance and not so many employees"
good,No security at all. Went through several layoffs until I was waiting on my severance package. Pay raises were small at best
good,"Very busy during beginning of the month due to month end dividends."
good,"working in banking industry was pretty challenging at first but, as time went on it became fairly easy and I started getting more comfortable with the daily operations"
good,"I started off as a 20 hrs teller and I enjoyed my job so much. Unfortunately, Chase has turned into a company where they no longer care about their employees nor customers. Everyone is quitting left and right, it is incredible the amount of people this company is losing. I hope things get better and realize that it is not worth losing the great talents that we offer to this company."
good,"Limited growth potential, constant worry of layoffs, work life balance is difficult at times especially if you are hourly."
good,There have been several points of inappropriate behavior (stereotypes and jokes) from the management which make the employees uncomfortable. The work environment does not promote quality work.
good,"A typical day was to respond to customer's inquiries and to add additional products to their account."
good,"If its a typical day at work, there is a lot of work firstly. I have learned to deal with different sets of people. Management was not very okay but fine. My peer workers were very supportive and good enough to talk to. Hardest part was the work pressure and the most enjoyable part was the events and workshops in our office."
good,"Supportive management, a busy fast paced line of work. Liked that we had weekly meetings to update us with any updates on processing subordinations, in accordance with bank guide lines."
good,The job overall was stressful. There were many reports that gauged your performance. Many of these customer service surveys are subjective based on other employees and overall experience. As a processor the surveys had the most weight.
good,"I wear many hats at JPMC.  Art Direction. UX Strategy. Some days are locking down visual design language for the companies biggest redesign of it's website in 4 years. Other days I'm directing the motion team through a set of videos in production.  And yet on another day, I might find myself working side by side with the Development team coaching and advising them thru approved and desired design decisions. "
good,"	Teller duties with higher approval authority wires/Paying/receiving transactions"
good,overall a good experience. people were good to work with. Senior staff also good to work with. Had a very good benefits scheme.
good,"Vibrant environment, high intercations with client. I love helping clients and going above and beyond. Day to day I see clinets on different forum, can be from a simple deposit withdrawal to a mortgage or a loan, referring to a Financial Advisor."
good,Awesome team work with great co-workers. Department Management on the other hand wasn't so great. No room for for growth what so ever.
good,Fun place but management only cares about numbers. I wish that there were more opportunities for advancement. Over all it is a fun place to work with great people.
good,"The co-workers and atmosphere was pleasant, however the pay was typical of a bank - low. Likewise there was plenty of lateral moves, but few vertical moves available."
good,"Chase is definitely a well respected Global Firm.  However, depending on the geographical location, you can expect inconsistencies in the level of professionalism and management competencies. Compensation is below industry standard for many of the job functions."
good,"My stay at JPMorgan Chase has been an interesting one. The people work hard for an inclusive culture and succeed. The people here are great to work with."
good,"This a large company with several moving parts, continuous policy changes and effort to improve processes that may appear disruptive or progressive depending on how you view the company's drive to become best in class. "
good,This is good pay and great benefits if you care to be on the phones all the time and no advancement. full service café is good a bit pricey but good
good,Hard place to work.  So much to manage.  Management is turmoil and will probably be a few years before it evens out.  Fire Drills every day.
good,JPMC will become a better place to work when interest rates rise and the pressure to grow earnings through cost cutting comes off.
good,"The experience of your role specifically in Branch Branking, is entirely based on the type of Manager that you have. Job Security is little to none; you always feel like every day can be your last. Opportunity for advancement is solely based on who you ""know"" or how much you've sucked up to the right people."
good,Working for JP Morgan Chase is challenging but rewarding at the same time. I say challenging because of the amount of work you need to complete to reach your monthly goals.
good,"almost 6 year working for and with Chase and all 6 years at least once per year the threat of being laid off any month was real. corporate red tape makes the easiest things way harder than they needed to be.  All and All the company was a great place to work due to the people, but I am sure that can be said with all large companies. I would work for them again."
good,The industry is competitive and requires a lot of hard work and self motivation. The hardest part of the job is when you have done all that can be done and a mortgager still loses their home.
good,"JP Morgan is a ""Production Oriented"" company.  Their focus is on hitting your numbers.  As long as you meet your SLA there is no problem.  JP Morgan Chase is not a company where you can expect to have job security."
good,"I am a customer assistance specialist for JP Morgan Chase. on a day to day basis I deal with mortgage modifications. I am the point of contact and subject matter expert for the customers when it comes to modification. I have learned how a loan is modified and the policies involved. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the red tape when it comes to collecting documents. in the 21st century email is a commom way of collecting documents. The customers have to either Fax documents, or mail them which are both outdated and Inconvenient. The best part of the job is being able to help people save thier homes. In a down economy the little guy needs some help to gewt back on his feet. Management is excellent, and my co workers are fun to work with."
good,"Originally it was a great opportunity, coming in thru a temp agency, But when hired on 100 days later things originally was told was taken back on. Management tries to assist and be there but there work load is also heavy, and changes the atmosphere/environment. I LOVED helping customers understand things that weren't made clear to them. My co-workers helped get me thru the day on a daily basis. Everyone is always willing to help with questions and difficult accounts. The hardest part of the job was handling customers in the rears with there mortgage and explain the next process."
good,This job is hit or miss intially was very good but as soon as gov't changes regulation bank changes incentives the dramatically change commission programs. Sometimes corporate culture was very harsh as kissing butt was the safest way to be on everyones good side.
good,"I found the managers not to be very caring, they had a slave driving mentality. Work, work and more work, also you are micro-managed to the point that it is hard to even take a bathroom break. The company pushed numbers and speed not Quality when it came to your work performance. If you want high stress, not enough pay, micro-management, and a company that doesn't understand the importance of Family then this company is for you."
good,"Every year the compensation pay changes and it has changed drastically over the 4 years I have been with the company. The salary stays the same and their is no annual increase in salary. They put more responsibility and a different focus every year on the bankers with no increase in pay, and a decrease in incentive pay. The benefits of this company are great ex: health, 401(k), dental, vision, etc."
good,The job was incredibly simple and provided very little challenge. The pay was nothing spectacular and the environment provided little room for advancement.
good,"Great benefits, good company to work for. but the process of hiring and getting the places staffed is beginning to drag on many people."
good,"In some internal communication it was once noted that the firms greatest asset is its people.  This is very true. Though sometimes culture and politics makes working at JPMC challenging, most of the people were great."
good,"JPMC is a great place to work for a fresh graduate. However, as an experienced professional, one would find that the place reeks of petty politics that comes from lack of job security and everyone is trying to save themselves..."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, but very little job security. Fastpaced and high stressed level job. Awesome training program!"
good,"I've learned a lot at chase, but it's time to change fields and locations. I can't divulge to much info as I'm still with the company and if for whatever reason the info is released I would be liable."
good,"A typical day is usually putting in long working hours, where every minute counts. It has strict line of hierarchy and reporting lines."
good,Don't work here. Not employee friendly.  Too focused on costs and not fair compensation or work life balance.  Work at a smaller organization where your efforts will be recognized.
good,Diminishing work life balance with ever increasing demands. Cost of benefits continue to rise. Management decisions ever focusing on profits/expense reductions and less on employees.
good,A typical day at work is busy.  We are either opening new accounts or doing maintenece on accounts.  We are constently helping customers with either problems or teaching them the technology side of banking.  I introduce them to products that can help their everyday life a lot easier.  I also back up the teller line when the line gets too long.   My day is filled with different problems which I learn new things from all the time. My co-workers are great!  They are great people who are willing to help one another out whenever in need.  The hardest part of this job is not having the management support we need around here to help us get better at our jobs and coach us.  The best part are my co-workers and the customers.
good,"Can be repetitive.Most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new customers. Very strict about policy and procedures. Coworkers are easy to get along with,"
good,"great company - but very true TOO BIG to FAIL"
good,"I loved the work I did but the amount of stress they put upon their employees, with the constant use of the word "" termination"" made it impossible to do the best job you can.  "
good,"work starts the moment u enter n end after 10 hours minimum. "
good,"It is a good company overall, however, the technology arm has some not insignificant challenges that mute the appeal of working for such a large firm."
good,I would help employees with problems and also help customers with problems . I also set up training classes
good,I learn how to communicate in the business world. Important of meeting deadline. the way to interact with client. The most enjoyable part of my job is mostly the interaction with co worker and learning how to communicate with different individual in different department around the company. I think the hardest part is to meet tight deadline with 100% accuracy and timeliness.
good,"I did learn to be a change agent during the most difficult economy. Processes and procedures changed on a daily basis as well as reporting structure. I kept a professional and positive attitude and kept the moral of my team up during difficult changes."
good,A typical day was monitoring phone calls of customer service employees. I would review up to 5 calls a month and provide an overall score for the calls. I would also provide monthly training to help the customer service representative improve their ratings.
good,"A typical work day processing transactions and helping customers. Working at Chase I've learned the fundamentals of the banking industry. Management seems to be nice but they do not really support employee's needs. Co-workers are nice. Hardest part of the job would be dealing with incompetent customers. A lot of employees are not happy with recent changes in staffing, I just try to make the best of it."
good,"log in to computer, review new entries into pipeline,  "
good,This company tells employees they are all about career advancement but they are not they already know who they want in those jobs.
good,"In all honesty I don't think JPM would have ever hired me if it was not for the fact that my firm was purchased by JPM.  It was a nice place to work and I think my dissatisfaction was more self-centered than because of a bad anything.  In the end, I was selectively laid-off so I'm still bitter.  Like I said, if you fit in, it's a great place, if not, it will be torturous."
good,"Chase is a great place to work to learn the basics of business banking.  You learn essentials, how to position products as resources to your business owners, and the correct way to prospect for new clients."
good,Good Place to work but like any large bank with too many road blocks along the way.
good,"On a day to day basis I handled large amounts of money, referred bank services to customers, interacted with our customers"
good,"Learned about investments and building relationships, worked with clients by phone, setting appointments and working customer service in the lobby"
good,"Chase as a whole is a good company to work for but certain departments within the company leave much to be desired.  There were instances of blocking people to advance within the department based on the color of a person's skin color.  You often find your suggestions/contributions were not respected and/or appreciated.  "
good,"Always evolving clients and a dynamic atmosphere to work in, having a great staff is key and making sure all employees treat each other like family."
good,My time at JP Morgan Chase has taught me very important real life  financial decisions that impacts anyone.  Many financial decisions may not come by as easy to many and I am am very satisfied that through my years of working with different partners I absorbed all the knowledge I could to extend that to my customers and gaining the title of their Personal Banker. Many life changing experiences effect your banking needs. It felt rewarding to be there and help my customers walk by them and follow up with all their needs.
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers, it was a very fun and productive place to work"
good,"A typical day will consist of helping walk in customers with everyday transactions.  This can include anything from printing a new debit card to helping with estate planning.  The partners that you work with are going to be very knowledgeable and can greatly assist in increasing you earning potential.  For the most part, the management will also help grow your abilities and provide valuable coaching to help achieve your goals.  The upper management will not be helpful and in most cases will make it harder for you to achieve your goals.  The atmosphere in every branch is different but most will have a close group of co-workers that make your work life more enjoyable."
good,"I love working for JPMorgan because was a very busy environment, lots of work. I was train on my own in Chase you don't get train, I learn everything about BPO's and Appraisals I had very little opportunity to mingle with all my co-workers because the amount of work, but the ones I interact with I enjoyed them and they still my friend to this day. The hardest part of my job was not been able to finish on time, the most enjoyable was the big amount of work. Too bad I was temporary   one year contract."
good,I like the Bank itself but the office Politics are hilarious. There is no advancement unless you suck up and kiss butt.
good,"A typical day at JPMorgan Chase would be to see over 200 customers and handle over 500 transactions. The transactions you encounter are repetitive but the customers are not. As tellers, we handle everything from deposits, withdrawals, payments, we order foreign currency, all while providing excellent customer service. In addition, we make suggestions to our customers from opening up credit cards, loans and  checking and/or savings account. The company is constantly changing so we are kept updated through the various trainings we have every month. My co-workers are very supportive when it comes to assisting me in any way possible in order to provide efficient service. The hardest part of the job is having a customer be upset with you. When you strive on providing great customer service, you want your customers to always walk away happy and looking forward to their next visit. The most enjoyable part of the job is when our CEO and management recognize our efforts and hard work."
good,if you like to work with the boss over your shoulder all day long then this is the place for you...
good,"this company is so big that you can transfer to various positions all over the country. The upward mobility opportunities are available if you network extensively."
good,At my current rolled I have learned a lot about working in a corporate environment and really have enjoyed the overall experience so far.
good,Take remittances out of the envelope along with our clients payment and processed it into the system.
good,"In many ways J.P. Morgan Chase was a great company. Tremendous benefits. In other ways advancement was limited, cronyism was rampant my area was chronically understaffed and overworked. "
good,"Overall not a bad place to start a career and learn basics of sales and customer service. They also are willing to sponsor new hires for finra licenses which is nice. "
good,Not a bad place to work except that you are always waiting for the ax to fall.
good,In the beginning it was a great company to work for. At the end there was a lot of changes with management that made the work place very hostile to work for.
good,Lots of opportunity to advance within retail bank. Great place to work as a banker or financial advisor.  CAW mobility limited.
good,"Typical day at work is deployment of Thinclients and PCs and assisting users with their PC problems."
good,It's not a place that I would be looking to retire. Plus if you are luck then you can get moved around. But they know who they want in what area.
good,Too much management changeover that creates a lot of fire drills and low employee morale.
good,"I learned a lot here, and will take it in future employment.  I really enjoyed my co-workers."
good,"A typical day consist of creating a great customer experience from the time our customers walk in the door, until the time they leave. Teamwork is key to each and every position throughout Chase. Our team is more like a family, and we make it our job to help one another in every way that we can. I definitely enjoy working with my co-workers, they have taught me so much from policies and procedures to how to become the best teller I can be. Overall, it has been an awesome experience I will always cherish."
good,"looking for a good fit and work environment"
good,"I would not recommend this place for anyone ever. The management is biased and shows favoritism towards certain staff. The work itself is easy and fun as well as coworker. But the place itself is horrible, trying to leave as soon as possible."
good,"Pressured environment with lack of direction.  Corporate office environment and setting were nice, lots of people and contacts to make."
good,"This place is where people should be going after they to die, if they sinned a lot. A depressing atmosphere with constant mind torture from people who have become managers because they managed to sit on the same chair for 20 years."
good,Was a great company but they lost their compassion for their employees and we became just numbers not people. I used to recommend Chase but not anymore.
good,Supervisor are incredible.  Upper Management continues to increase workload and reduce personnel with no regard to existing workload.
good,"Routine work, okay management, high expectations, difficult to advance, low job stability, long hours"
good,"Dead end job with high employee turnaround ..not secure...lot's of work for low pay"
good,I worked as a CAS and they constantly changed my schedule. Signed a contact for on shift and 2 months later they changed it.
good,"Typical work days would include a morning huddle with our supervisor and team of 5-8 people. There were a combined total of about 8-10 etams at one point. I was able to come in as a conventional underwriter whom was out of the industry for a period of time, so it was difficult to transition back in and the training given was very poor. After one year I was mentoring and training new people for Conventional and HARP loans, I came up to speed on the business very quickly.  And about 6 months to a year after this I was transitioned and trained to do VA IRRRLs and received my LAPP/SAR.  This was a difficult experience too due to the fact of the lack of training and that more expereinced peers did not openly share tools or advice.  Once I was able to find two true mentors whom were Veterans of VA Mortgage loan Underwriting I then was able to get down alot of information and useful tools, references and documents.  Experience is key in the VA Underwriting world, and once I was trained and because of all of the questions I asked and peers I used as mentors; I am the one that most people come to for answers to peculiar questions."
good,"I worked at Chase for 3 1/2 years in the Rochester, NY area. Made a good amount of valuable contacts that remain in my career network to this day."
good,"The people are amazing to work with and I love my job however, I need advancement opportunities with the ability to be compensated for the work I do. It's important to know that your work is appreciated and valued and there is not enough feedback on the positive. There are so many things to learn in my department and that is what makes my role so special. I want to feel like my input and time is valued but the compensation doesn't express that. The most enjoyable part of the job is everyone's willingness to help when needed. This quality only benefits our department and makes the environment pleasant to be in. The hardest part of the job would be trying to stay within a certain SLA when we have lost so many people and there is a hiring freeze so we cant replace anyone which makes our workload heavier."
good,"Constant learning to keep up with the constant changes.  Some management good, most don't get it.  Co-workers overall great people.  Hardest part is dealing with some poor managers who push their processes down to employees and cause un-needed work and stress.  Most enjoyable is the people."
good,It was difficult to advance in the company. The department I worked for never allowed for you to post out to different departments. But this was over 10 years ago and things may have changed
good,I have worked at JPMorgan Chase on more that one occasion and it is a decent environment to learn and grow.
good,"I started with JPMorgan Chase On January 2009 as a Mortgage Collector I really enjoyed my job. Around July 2010 we switched to Loss Mitigation and It was good to learn something new and different.  I then tried to move to another position and that;s when I knew that I was not going to be happy at Chase. It is impossible for someone to move up unless you know someone, and i hated that. I was sooo Unmotivated being there knowing that I won't be able to move to up. The Benefits are great. Our VP at our location was not friendly nor approachable which sometimes made it awkward LOL. I ended up taking Medical Leave. When It was time for me to go back to work Well things just changed. Our department went to Ownership and we went back to collections, and well Chase decided to take the Customer Service approach on Collections Which Did not work out for me. I Would Say the best part of being there was due to having a awesome Manager. He was the best, he did whatever he could to help his team, and I will really miss him. "
good,Co-worker were pleasing and easy to work with.  The company acknowledged bank holidays and compensation was higher than most in the area
good,"•	Keeping an eye on researching and analyzing reports for identification, reconciliation and documentation of cash breaks or un-reconciled payments under the United States Securities Operations Department"
good,"I learned a lot about the banking industry at Chase.  Worked with customers to help them refinance their homes, help them through financial struggles and offer suggestions to help them improve their investments.  "
good,The company gave me a good opportunity to enhance my QA skills in a financial industry. The opportunity of working in a diverse environment provided me with a good platform to work on different kinds of tools. This job provided me with a good platform to think and work independently.
good,I typical day at chase includes performing an array of transactions while exceeding expectations in exceptional customer service.
good,Company willingly employees and continues to mentor them even after lying to clients etc.  Great work life balance with sundays off.  No career advancement opportunities in this region.
good,A very goal oriented workplace. Nice people. Very active work days.
good,Love to work for my manager. The best manager I have ever deal with
good,It is a great company all around but I feel as though it is harder to advance in this company because of all the white collar polotics.
good,"This company has many opportunities for advancement, but I suggest you start where you wan to be, because it can be challenging transferring from one LOB to another."
good,"Good employees, somewhat ok management, bonuses, benefits, fun, etc."
good,"Register loans on the origination system and maintain accuracy, communication log."
good,"Management at your location ultimately determines your fate. No opportunity to advance in a ""small"" market."
good,"a typical day is 80 percent on the phone. its a inbound - outbound call center. i enjoy speaking to ppl, from all walks of life, the hardest part of the job was when ppl, were really rude, and mostly mean. but for the most part, once u explained what was going on with their situation they were great full and very understanding. once a week u ha"
good,"Log on phone have 15 min to review all updated and take able 80 call daily. ilearned how to manage my time. The management was not good at all and very hard to get one and skills where poor. I hardest part was to maintain your score card and some managers where not managing the team properly. The most enjoyable was the customers irate or not, I like to help in every call."
good,While employed in the loan servicing departments there were specific attainable and challenging goals that could be obtained in a 40 hour work week with minimal overtime. There was light at the end of the tunnel. In the loan origination departments there is a different story. Work life balance is alleged to be part of the culture but in the loan origination departments it is not. The life of a closer is extremely stressful and leaves little time for family and other interests. To keep up you need to work a minimum of 12 hour days and Saturdays. The more productive you are the more they pile on. The expectations are unreasonable even for the most efficient based on the volume of borrowers wanting to refinance and poor organization.
good,it all depends the branch that you work at and the clientele that banks there. Sometimes there are a lot of bankers trying to get the same customers
good,"A typical day at J.P. Morgan Chase consisted of setting up necessary windows usually 5-6 on the computer. I would answer phone calls, check individual accounts and check for legal actions, call dealerships and make sure the accounts that needed processing were done in a timely manner. In this job I learned how to work at a fast paced environment using multiple windows in a computer. Attention to detail was very important and my managers were very demanding and great. I felt that I could go to them with any problems and they would handle them in a timely manner. My co workers were very supportive and fun to be around turning the job into a fun race of who can process the most accounts by the end of the week. The hardest part of the job was paying attention to legal documents and being able to remember all the codes to use on accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was the people, they understood when to work and when to be professional."
good,"A typical day consist attending/scheduling meetings with management to address road blocks presented in the trading space. Addressing emails, phone calls relating to client and counter-party issues. Guiding/overseeing my team's output ona daily basis as well as compiling metrics to show performance transparency."
good,"stressful and chaoctic in the liquidations department, typical day at work consist of calling customers on what is known as a verbal communication report, taking numerous incoming calls and trying to perfect files, the hardest part of the job is actually going to work, because you already know what awaits you, the morale is extremely low."
good,"The workplace was fun at times when them management was not micro-managing us, and allowing us to do our jobs."
good,I worked at JPMorgan Chase in retail banking for over five years. The pay was good. However it can be a high stress work enviroment.
good,Most enjoyable part of job is learning different avenues and categories of banking regulations.
good,Please see my CV for more details.
good,Different environment. I worked with wonderful people. I miss my co-workers.
good,Overall great company to start a career. Job security may not be the best - depending on the LOB you join.
good,Its a big company with no centralisation. It has been growing by aquisitions and mergers however the technology and process is not centralized. Each geographical location follows its own set of process. The roles and positions have to be more clearer with what is supposed to be done. People at higher roles are not clear they are just doing something or the other which is not contributing for the organisation.
good,When I first started they presented themselves as a great company to work for and that maybe true if you are middle to upper management . The training was sufficient. How ever working in the. Call center is brutal. Taking over 100 calls a day and literally attached to your desk is very degrading. You are told when to take your break but if get a call that runs over into your break it counts against you. Sometimes you can miss your break altogether. The calls are mostly negative and you have very little time off the phone maybe an hour or so once a month for a team meeting. I am on a mental health leave and it is unlikely that I will go back.
good,I collect on charged off checking and savings accounts
good,"Handling customers transaction, problem solving, reading about banking policies ,product sales and referrals,learning about products, working with the managers to improve sales,and helping the other team members with their goals, the hardest part of the job was to sale products to clients, who did not believe they needed that products. the fun part was working in busy atmosphere and talking to the clients,and helping them."
good,Layer upon layer of management that undergoes re-org every quarter and generally results in layoffs for reasons not related to performance.
good,Average place to work. No opportunity for advancement. High employee turnover.
good,Atypical day at work taking calls about credit card issues. and checking on sales for fraud over seas.
good,"The Chase environment is wonderful at times. There are a lot of room to learn however, not to grow."
good,Performed several upgrades and migrations.
good,very aggressive pursuit of sales
good,"The job was very relax, management made it more stressful than needed."
good,"They say to have a balance between work and home life, but when issues arise that need attention with home, they are less than considerate of your position."
good,not a bad company to work for. I just need more of a work/life balance
good,"Typical bank has reasonable work like balance, typical day is busy."
good,"JPM is a great company everywhere exept retail banking. retail banking is the pitts, unrealistic goals and bad management"
good,Despise branch manager and district manager who do not support employees and only will throw you under the bus so watch your back at all times
good,Great benefits if you have a strong will to withstand management.
good,no really good advancement opportunities unless you know someone in management
good,"Plenty of benefits, limited advancement within you own line of business"
good,The Print & Production Services branch of JP Morgan Chase's 383 Madison Ave. office is probably more tolerable of an environment if you're working there as a full-time employee. It's not necessarily the place you'd want to be if you're a temp who's looking to establish a professional foundation.
good,"working will involve standing on your feet the whole time, frequent meetings and huddles, continual and strong emphasis on building strong customer relationship, referrals for products and services."
good,I have spent the past few years within several different business units within the firm. Your experience will be directly related to the business units objectives along with the management team of course.
good,"It is a wonderful place to work when working with seasoned senior leaders with internal experience. Great rewards, recognition and appreciation as well as network."
good,My experience with JP Morgan Chase is limited to the one branch I worked at and the one supervisor I experienced.   I had a negative experience with this particular manager.  Other that worked in other branches really enjoyed their job and their treatment by management.
good,"Learning , trainings are available whole year long, less chance to apply what you have learned sometime.  It has no cafeteria, hunting food outside are great in certain locations, not all."
good,"They promote a very highly skilled and professional environment."
good,This was my first corporate job.  It became very boring after the first month or so.  Manager was rude and obnoxious.  He never took any interest in his staff
good,"Training is almost exclusively virtual now, so employees don't meet others in training classes. Budgets are so restricted that Market and Region Managers don't hold events where employees meet staff from other teams. The feeling is almost isolating."
good,"Almost zero  advancement potential.  Metrics for success make little sense for my particular job.. Management is more or less a clique... One can survive and make a decent living, but don’t expect being judged on merit"
good,"THey make promises of advancement, but it's really just a boys club. Don't fall for it. The benefits are ok, management is not flexible, It's a very typical corporate environment in the worst kind of way."
good,Chase has great medical benefits as well as 401k contribution matches. However to proceed within the company is hard especially during layoffs. Hardly any remote work is available or flex work schedules. Compensation is less than other companies offer.
good,Top heavy management. There is a lot of favoritism at JP Morgan Chase. If management likes you then you will do very well.  I didn’t enjoy my experience at JP Morgan. I feel as though my time was wasted.
good,Not enough hours. No more full time positions only part time for this role. No one can support themselves or even a family with these kind of hours. Only great for a college student or someone who lives at home with their parents. Great first not a career job.
good,"Management was not responsive or interested in career development of employees. "
good,You are responsible for many plates in the air and not a lot of opportunities to really make the process better or improve unless you get direct go ahead from management.
good,ok experience at Jpm chase. large company lots of different managers. really can have a different experience depending on which department you land in.
good,"A good job if you are fresh out of school and want to begin to learn how a big business operates. While there is room for upward mobility, is is extremely competitive."
good,Management is not good full of politics and favouritism no work life balance task should complete and go no exceptions no most important thing no job security.
good,"Great job at the beginning, like any very large co it all depends on imdeate suppervors I some ok. Some terrible recent changes in comp & what is expected made it a difficult place to work, loved the clients. The position I had success can be dependent on location bad location bad #s you can be termed quickly."
good,Lots of restructuring which brings uncertainty. Company culture is good. Options for internal moves. Management too busy to help with carrer development.
good,Not a bad job to work at but better oppurtiniteies elsewhere. A lot of down time and cold calling is what they want. Very easy job though. The culture is not so great either.
good,"A highly reputed organization, good on resume and is good for candidates starting their career. A good company to work for but career advancement may be challenging at times."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great company for some individuals to work for and can be very beneficial for some people. Some people can have a great experience there
good,"Productive & fun place to work."
good,"Overall Chase is  a good company however with new management coming in, there are many flaws. Many things were changed and in many employees opinions, the current way our job functions were done, worked fine."
good,"I have had a poor experience at this firm. Management is not professional. I have been treated very poorly, only time recognized is negatively regardless of fault. Communication is poor as well."
good,A lot of incentives  employees involved with employee training. Open door policy. Supervisor communications was great. Leads that way in charge was not as communitibe to the Temporary Team coming in.  I felt that was a big problem
good,"This place wasn't for me. I had a nice manager, but everything came from the top. All they were worried about was PVCs and selling selling selling. They weren't interested in the customers actual needs, just what could be sold to them."
good,Large company with many opportunities for internal mobility through networking. The downside of working for a company this size is that it is easy to feel lost and to feel like your work doesn't add any value.
good,Operationally is a well structured organization and good place for starters to gain experience tin that area including project management skills. Organizational silos though often make it difficult to be promoted within the organization.
good,"Management likes to say how valued you are. You are a number. That is it. If you have a great supervisor who backs you, you have a future, but if you have one who just cares about numbers, you have a problem."
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working for JPM.  I would have continued there had it not been for a terrible office culture generated by the senior manager.  He poisoned the well, so to speak, and a number of people left, including myself.  High turnover rate due to this manager."
good,"Its a loan processing job. Anyone who has ever worked as a loan processor can understand, fast paced, long hours, pressure to close loans. Nice bonuses if you work hard."
good,Lots of meetings.  Nice co-workers.  Lots of pressure to produce and sell more loans.  Yearly changes to the comp plan sometimes for the worse.  Nice work environment in the branch.
good,I was hired at a mid-senior level at JPM and found it incredibly difficult to penetrate the clubby Senior management ranks who look out for each other and are highly resistant to new folks. Folks stay there for 30yrs and are immovable objects that are highly resistant to change. They have a strong franchise so there it limited appetite to do so.
good,"Chase has a low base pay compared to other banks. There is not much salary raises. Depending on your location, you could make a lot of money in commission or you could make nothing and be stuck in that location with that same role which is frustrating."
good,"Enjoy working at JP Morgan , great group of people working on my team"
good,Its okay. glass ceiling if you trying to move to corporate. overall an okay company to work for if you have the passion. you will find your self struck if you don't enjoy what you do.
good,"I’ve held 3 different roles within JPMC and had varying experiences in each, mostly dependent on manager. It’s hard to advance within Compliance and bureaucracy can sometimes be stifling."
good,"Overall, for the size of the company, I would say they are somewhere around average."
good,Srarted off fine but got sick & tired of the CEO putting politics into his emails and trying to influence people to agree to his political views. Had to fine another bank.
good,"JP Morgan preaches ""Work life balance,"" but that's not the reality.  They over work, under pay and all the while claim they support ""Work life balance & health.""  They're master at spinning BS and I hold them responsible for at least one suicide."
good,"Chase promises career advancement and promotion within, however the people I've seen advance within the company are to mediocre positions, the higher positions such as management and corporate are given to outsiders.  The employee benefits are great (retirement, paid time off (sick and vaca), maternity leave) and depending on your manager, your schedule can be pretty flexicle, which is why I've stuck around."
good,There is opportunity to make money but upper management tries to make you drink unrealistic koolaid. There are passive aggressive sales tactics bestowed upon you as well.
good,The bank has almost zero growth opportunity. I have applied to 40 different positions with the bank in the past year and I got only one interview and one offer which I was treated as an outsider when they presented the offer. They don't care about your experience with the bank especially when you moving to a different organization within the bank.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a decent company to work for if not in a branch. The company does a good job of providing opportunities to sharpen your skill with quarterly workshops, providing licensing and a new hire monthly bonus for a year. For a mix of base and commission it is not too bad, but the commissions plans are being reduced yearly. This is a great job if your career is geared towards in-branch sales. "
good,"JPMorgan Chase is not a bad company at all. They are just well known for HUGE layoffs, and I think this is what deters people from working there mostly."
good,"Good brand name to work for.  But no work life balance.  And limited advancement. The job is very political.  The goal is to make money for the firm.  Not much meritocracy, advancement is depending on politics."
good,Competitive culture.  High expectations. Prior accomplishments have no bearing on present relationships with management. Always want more. Opportunities for advancement for the high achievers.
good,"Good place to work, the pay and culture are not the greatest but the benefits are. The vacation time isn't bad. Internal mobility is hard. JPM carries a big name when interviewing elsewhere."
good,High work pressure. It depends on which process or team you have joined. Have only worked for 9 months so cannot comment. great place for learning. will consider.
good,"Hardest is to meet departmental goals and resources available to complete your work accurately."
good,There's room for growth under the right management. Politics takes place in who gets promoted regardless how hard you may think you work. Simply because you work hard and put the company first in your priorities will not get you the promotion you are looking for. Your manager has to be your best friend.
good,Job security was poor. Set up so managers job secure but workers job security poor. One mistake could cost you your job. Pressured through production goals to bypass procedures but any mistake mad while not following procedure would cost you  your job. Pay was low barely above minimum wage. Benefits were good though
good,I was there for many off their layoffs. The work always increased. I was doing the job of a full team on my own. Way too stressful considering my position. I liked the job I did and the DevOps team I worked closely with but management was awful
good,"As a company it's a great place to be at."
good,"There is room for a lot of improvements.If you are in retail, prepare to be micromanaged and stressed our of your mind with little money to show for it."
good,JP Morgan Asset Management 是擁有較多內轉部門或工作地區的一家公司，只是公司的組織劃分很細，所以有些較灰色地帶的工作就容易會有負責部門劃分的問題，並且主管部份很看運氣，如果碰到有管理問題的主管即使向上反應，也很難得到有效的處理。
good,"Competitive culture, set goal of new accounts, mortgages, investment products, business accounts etc.  Morning huddles were a fun way to start the day,"
good,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. is one of the largest financial institutions in the world. I think that by working here, all of my adult life, it has provided me with world-class banking knowledge, which I could take anywhere and succeed. The problem with my particular department though is management. There’s too many individuals providing ideas that aren’t ideal for our particular job. The department appears not to value their employees, where it’s just a number based environment, which weakens employee morale. JPMorgan Chase & Co. needs to learn to treat and value their employees as they would want us to treat their best customer."
good,"Fun place to work and good atmosphere, Does not lend to a good work to family balance.  Change in direction in management structure has made it difficult for promotion or lateral career mobility"
good,"Spent a long time in fully merging Bank with Chase Manhatton and was a harder place to work."
good,"I spent 12 years at JPMC.  If you put the time in and play the political games that I'm sure every corporation has, you can advance.  You will work long hours.  You will take lots of meetings.  You will answer more email than you ever have in your life.  You will work on your days off.  You will lose sleep.  You will come to hate your life and right when you start to slip they'll offer you a severance package."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a HUGE corporation so it's hard to give a detailed account of the company because things could be completely different from one LOB to the next. My only suggestion is, before accepting a job at JPMorgan Chase, see if that role has ever been/will be considered for outsourcing."
good,"If you are just looking for new skills and have a good work ethic, this job will be good for you. In this print operator position you must learn a vast quantity of abbreviated print job names, what they stand for and how important they are to print to prioritize as well as memorizing what kind of paper and what kind of printer they print on. You must make sure print quality is good or you will have to start all over holding back production. Multi Tasking is a necessity and must be done fast at time however there are times when the day if very slow and there is nothing to do but bond with your co workers and keep the area clean and ready for the next shift."
good,"I have few complaints about working there, but after five years with several missed opportunities to get the rare promotion, the job has felt very dead-end."
good,Large firm that is difficult to navigate through.  Learned a great deal about office politics and how to master multitasking. The atmosphere is one where you are expected to do more with less.
good,"A typical day at work is a combination of working my emails responding to regulators, and investors (AG offices, Congressional offices, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and HUD)  escalations regarding JPMorgan Chase Bank's approach to customers' modifications, short sales, foreclosures, assumptions, etc. I also work on researching facts for all escalations that get to the Executive Office, and finally provide resolutions with promised actions in order to assist customers and non-customers. "
good,"As hard as I thought I was working at customer satisfaction, greeting and helping each person it seemed nothing I did was good enough.  The idea was that I wasn't consistent, or smile enough, etc.  However, the customers saw something that the company didn't.  I was doing a fine job.      "
good,"Corporate America is real.  You will be over worked and under paid if you don't belong to the ""Big Boys Club"".  If you make a mistake be ready to get ""Let Go"". The hardest part of working with this company is the immediate supervisors, who looks out for themselves and their bonuses.  Things said in the dark truly come to the light.  This was my experience after 13 years."
good,"This company requires way too much from their employees and does not provide the environment to fulfill their request. The pay is good, but its not worth the stress."
good,"Not a bad place to work if you are just beginning in banking and need resume fodder.  Management is iffy.  Some managers are knowledgeable, others are their to do their time until shift is over and only give token assistance with issues,  Training is cursory at best."
good,Good place to work - great pay and benefits.  I like the Good Works program.  Most management are friendly but dot seem to look out for their direct reports.
good,"It's an okay place to work but when you work for a really large bank be aware that you're a small part of a very big wheel. Politics will do more for your promotion, so be warned."
good,"Very much accountable for time management, Took rolling calls, transfer calls to appropriate departments. Worked holidays and every weekend. Highly stressful job."
good,Great benefits...Job mobility isn't the best.  Layoffs are consistent but if you are a top performer they will pay you well and you will get through the constant attrition.
good,"1st shift included all the managers on the floor...management wasn't good, employees stressed to make a count by the end of the day..extremely fast-paced"
good,"As a teller, I processed transactions for customers and handled a lot of Cash as well as checks. Now all that can be done by machine which almost entirely eliminates the need for the position. Still, some people like dealing with people. Machines can't brighten your day with a smile."
good,"They overwork their employees and expect a lot from you. The pay is not great and employees don't stay long. Needs some work, but a good job to get your feet wet in the finance world."
good,"They have their name, numbers, and power; which is attractive for young professionals. Not a lot of growth potential for individuals on the technology side; unless you are able to transfer to another line of work within the company."
good,"While Chase often gets rated somewhat high on surveys, it really depends on what line of business you're in. IT/Risk/Cyber has little to no Sr. management in Columbus."
good,"Chase is a great company to work for.  The main issue is the bank is so large that sometimes the ""left hand does not know what the right hand is doing"" - equivalent of too much red tape to get simple objectives taken care of."
good,"This company is great for individuals simply looking for job security. While there was little opportunity for genuine growth and advancement, the company did offer an engaging and interactive work culture."
good,I dont want to write a summary of this job  it wasn't fun and I want to forget about it  it was too poltically correct for my taste and I wanted to leave
good,"have a great system and good benefits such as 401k matching, dental, vision,  medical , tuition assistant program, some managers are not as good as management."
good,The company is great to work with but the management is not so great. The employees try their best to help and management does not appreciate everything that is done. The environment is very stressful and plenty of employees end up on disability for some type of mental illness with all the stress.
good,"The experience one has working here really depends on what department you end up getting into. Some areas like the call centers, are very tough psychologically- some from the callers but mainly from the micromanagement. Several people I knew had to take a leave because they were going to lose it."
good,Chase was a solid employer who seemed to really care about the cultivation of a positive culture. Unfortunately changes in the mortgage rate environment led to a reorganization and reduction in force over 30%.
good,"JPM Chase out sources jobs overseas on constant basis. Individuals who had been employed for 20+ where being laid off. The CEO basically took each department and cut staff to increase savings by replacing long term employees with younger ones and half the salary there by saving money. "
good,"Cultura muito interessante. Empresa preocupada com os funcionários, mas poucos líderes seguem essa diretriz."
good,I have been working for the company for a year now and I could be happier with my job. It is a lot of work for the amount we make. And we are expected to do other peoples jobs as well.
good,Have been with  bank 3 years. In my department there's no opportunity for advancement and the sales pressure is high despite the fact that we are an in bound calls center where others do the prospecting so I've minimal control over quality of sales.
good,They did invest in IT so that was a plus.  
good,"I enjoy my job and the company provides awesome benefits, but the actual department I work in is horribly managed. People are so unhappy all they do is complain all day long about the job or other people. Very rude, very nosy people. No communication from management to the front line associates. Lots of expectations but little rewards from management."
good,"Feels like they quickly decide who is worthy of grooming and who is cast to the side. I had a wonderful manager until they hired someone who they decided before being hired, would be promoted over people who have been there for more than 20 years. She was there for about 3 months and was promoted. And she's not a great leader, by any means. I'm very disappointed in the organization and think it's better to move on than to fight the machine."
good,It was fun to work in the department but was stressful to deal with manager frastuation. It was really good to learn many things while working there in the industries.
good,you have different responsibilities and continue to pile them on you until you fail.  Management is pressured from above and trickles it way down.  A lot of people are watching you and waiting for you to fail.
good,"Chase is a great company to work for, theoretically. The pay is decent, there are two types of commission, and the benefits are excellent. All types of insurance are available, you can add a domestic partner, you don't have to be married to add your significant other to your insurance. Each position is given a fair amount of vacation, personal, and sick days that are available from day 1, you just have to earn them over the course of the year, or pay them back if you leave your position. "
good,"Totally numbers-driven culture.  I was hired to work a low-volume back shift.  I worked bad hours (3:00 pm to 11:30 pm) to do overflow customer service on the East Coast on Chase Slate cards."
good,"Chase is a good company to work for if you work full time. The benefits are good, there is a pension, and the wages are better than nearly every other bank. Although, Chase values is not always present in the branches. My manager did not care for me, so I was not valuable to him. Even though I was consistently one of the top-ranked Tellers in our branch, that did not matter. I finally left because they took away my scheduling accommodation. I was working there 20 hours a week. They told me that I had to have an open schedule. That meant I could not work my second job or go back to school. I don't know if it was my manager or if it was his boss, but I ended up quitting. It is not practical for people who would like to actually progress. It is more for people who want to stay sharp, but not stressed."
good,I was hired for a specific skill set that I am not using. Ask as many questions as possible about the job you are offered before you accept the position
good,"In lead generation specialist should contain list of duties and responsibilities associated with  the role, along with the amount of time expected to dedicated to each  task . I learned here how to deal with customer and lot more things I learned here . In my team my manager and colleagues are friendly. The  most enjoyable part of my job doing more transfer to HLA."
good,I lost my job because it was sent overseas.   I worked with a good team of people.  They were amicable and professional.  The work was interesting and challenging.
good,Good work  environment with lot of learnings..The company has lot of opportunities and  is very open for learnings . The environment is very nice and has lot of advantages.
good,"Management in this department does not provided the needed tools to assist with career mobility.  Its a fast work pace, the client treat you as the help and not someone assisting with the completion of their projects. Management does not have your back at all."
good,"The hours can run pretty long. If you're lucky you'll get at least one Saturday a month off. It can all depend on your Branch manager how your experience will be. I've had quite a few and it can be fun to wake up and go to work if you have the right management or dreadful. Which, unfortunately I've had more than one manager who has not made my work life balance or work experience something I enjoy."
good,"I had been doing what I was trained to do for three months. All of a sudden they asked me why I had been doing it, and then said I was wrong and they didn't believe me."
good,"A challenging, fast-paced environment.  A great group of people but limited opportunities for growth.  "
good,Below average pay. Good benefits. Good reputation in industry. Advancement is not defined well. It used to be an excellent company until 2008 and then mergers changed the environment.
good,The company is making it harder to hit sales goals while cutting pay. It is an easy job but the branches are seeing less and less traffic. its a dying field.
good,"Not a team player oriented environment; certain managers keep employees from growing; no communication within team, a lot of competition within team; no ownership of projects; very vague directions / instructions"
good,"I worked on the operations side of JPM - so this probably is very different than the IB or anything else. My work was very dull, and they didn't really seem to know why the team requested an intern. I never felt like I could advance very far or that my work mattered all that much."
good,"After successfully getting hired, I learned that it was not easy to move around to different jobs. That was one of the biggest reasons that I wanted to work there...because it was such a large company."
good,"Lots of bureaucracy, politics, and poor management. However, also many smart people due to the competitive environment and brand name. If you land here, take it as a job/learning experience and move on if needed.  Don't get sucked in by the brand if you don't feel good."
good,a steady Paycheck great benefits The work that you do you are not always compensated as you should.The retirement package is not bad. Just would like to be  appreciated.
good,Work life balance is always compromised due to very high volume since this is a bpo company.  Shifting of work schedule changes everytime that may lead to the employee being exhausted and drained.
good,Management is disloyal and unreliable. It is very difficult to have a work/life balance. Barely anyone helps each other out. They care more about the work than the workers.
good,"not much benefits. "
good,Fast paced corporate environment. Structured and an equal opportunity employer. Deadline driven and able to work independently in some areas. Room for advancement.
good,Chase as a wonderful place to start a career and support my life as a young adult. They did not offer a lot of opportunity for career growth as well as they could have.
good,A typical day at Chase was doing my normal job and maybe helping out another department.  Reviewing loans or removing conditions.  Change was a big thing.
good,This is not a bad company it is actually a really good company to work for. Like any company you are going to have the good and the bad. They have great benefits
good,"i would like to think this bank is like all other banks, this is no different then any other ones, and depending on what dept you are in you could be working your tail off.  i can only speak for my area that I'm in and the culture and moral is pitiful.  no proper training, no leader to show or provide guidance. have to learn on your own and figure things out on your own too."
good,This business unit was purchased by Great-West and later changed names to Empower.  The purchase my have changed the culture as it relates to upper level advancement.  During my time there you could only go so far before you hit the political soft ceiling.
good,You will stay because of the co-workers. The call center has many perks like daycare for your sick child so you don't have to call in. Cafeteria that makes breakfast and lunch and the food is great!
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. Management was not diverse or fair. You can work hard and not get recognized for your hard work. I enjoyed the benefits, the hours, and compensation. I learned a lot from this company."
good,Management AWOL most of the time. Projects are interesting occasionally otherwise lots of manual processes and suggestions to fix this are ignored. Always seem to have lots of vacancies.
good,Chase's commission is good but the base pay is horrible.  Management is a joke. The only reason I stayed with Chase for 7yrs is because they have good benefits and after the 5yr mark they give you two extra weeks of paid vacation. So I had a total of 5 week paid vacation.
good,"The pay and environment was good but I was laid off 6 months ago and not able to find a job with the same pay. The atmosphere, environment and employees were easy to work with"
good,"Very busy center, if you are not receiving inbound calls, you are making outbound calls. Very strict productivity goals, and very difficult to bonus.  Managers do their own thing, but some really did care and helped as best as they could, though none of them ever took calls as a agent.  Culture among the reps was good, fun.  But the center was difficult. Went from having our own cubicles to side by side desks, sitting on top of each other.  Made it hard to speak to customers. very loud."
good,Great company to work for. Most Managers have no training or experience and pace as they go due to knowing the job.Too much favoritism and or mistreatment.  Awesome benefits. Good pay.
good,"While my manager boasted about a generous project budget allocation, I was often asked to work overtime without being compensated as it was against the project/group policy."
good,"Overall nice place to work however, there was a lack of upwards mobility opportunities and professional development. Senior management was not appropriately groomed for management positions"
good,"If you are looking for a position to getting start after college, this is it."
good,If you are a supervisor or a banker your experience may be different. But as a teller part time it is not a suffiecient source of income . Also the schedule is inconssitent and career advancement is very scarce.
good,stability of jobs are good...career advancement is tough...previous sales experience is a plus... health and 401k benefits are good...rigid corporate structure...
good,I've been with the company for over 3 years now only been offered two advance in the company twice since I've been with the company but constantly been applying for all available open positions and constantly getting denied.
good,"This company was overall a good place to work. However, there was a severe lack of career advancement. There was a small lack of communication between authority figures, but I recommend working here for anyone."
good,The work life balance is not suffice for anyone that has a family and in the position of management. The benefits are very good and the best possible healthcare available. However room for growth is minimal and there is lack of communication between employees and upper management.
good,"No work life balance. Very difficult to take time off, or get a shift that's fits within what's needed for parents with children. Too much focus is on what the company needs and wants versus a good balance of company and employee needs."
good,"Falling in Wells Fargo Steps with Sales and Pressuring customers for products that are not needed.  Selling based on customer needs is not there.  Selling to meet a number or a goal is there.  Selling credit cards to an 85 year old lady is not needed, but since numbers need to be made......"
good,It's a job great benefits and pay. Very fast paced without updates to information as needed in some cases.  Management not the best to work with in some cases.
good,"JP was a fun company to work for but they don't pay. However , you want them in your resume because that's how other companies will give you a great pay. They provide great trainings and the culture is vibrant."
good,Enjoyed working with Peers.  Great Base24 Experience.  New Enhanced ATM (EATM) Network is Top of the Line.  It was a privledge to assist during the upgrade of the HP Nonstop Platforms and Move over 17K ATM's off of the Legacy Platforms.
good,"Work is subject to opinion and varies from person to person depending on who becomes supervisor. Can impose guidelines and restrictions on one individual and not the other base on personal preferences. Discouraged from discussing between peers conflicting concerns about policy & procedures even if it to gather opinion and to see if anyone have same concerns."
good,ground hog day every day. processing so low you loss clients.  Management are hired by how well you know upper management. no room for advancement....
good,"There is no work life balance. The company doesn't compensate very well anymore. I enjoyed working for the company before all the changes, getting rid of the tellers and installing automated machines."
good,"The management doesn't really take care of their emloyees on our site. Putting more load of work without right compensation. Their coaching contradicts themselves, for example they will coach you about your Average Call Handling Time they told me to be on the Dot and straightforward so my call time will be low.. Then if i do that they will coach me that im too transactional and I need to Talk more to the customer."
good,"Working at Chase is not terrible. The job itself is frustrating. Micro-management is an issue, along with how you are scored on an annual review. Benefits are good."
good,"Management was only concerned about shareholders. Every decision an employee makes is scrutinzed, on whether it is a valuable to a shareholder. Raises are very low for exceeding expections. For employees on the phone...the audit process is set up to always find something the employee did wrong."
good,"Great benefits, good management,  compensation is not comparable unless you leave and come back, unclear job paths and very little assistance from direct manager."
good,Fast paced and cut throat.  They should pay their operations managers more.  A lot of turnover but their is a lot of opportunity company wide for advancement.
good,"So your in a booth and calls come in. It you like talking to people, this might work for you. But sometimes the people that call are not the happiest."
good,this job took alot of training. it was a ok place to work. but very hard to make friends. everyone had their own klicks. overall i would go back if the branch was till close by.
good,"Working full-time is the way to go here. Not only are you eligible for PTO after 90 days (and the PTO is a lot) but after 1 year you are eligible for STD benefits and great maternity benefits.  There is a stipend available upon hire for the uniform which is great. The hours are not bad since it is typically 9-5.  As long as you request early enough, you are free to take vacation whenever.  Field management works very well with their people and offers a lot of support."
good,"Management makes decisions in a rash manner without all relevant information. Management will almost never challenge each other, even when they see something wrong."
good,The company is amazing to work for but the management is terrible the information you receive isn't consistent and its really hard to advance to a new position unless you know someone that's unecessary
good,Big bank. Lots of turnover. People are replaceable. Required to do a lot of sales in order to move up and make more money. A lot of inter office politics and bureaucracy.
good,"This was my first corporate job and I was excited for my start to a career with Chase. However, it was a call center environment but a step in the door. "
good,"J P Morgan Chase does not provide job security. The company is an ever changing company that downsize at least once a quarter. The benefits are ok, the compensation is on the lower scale. I have learned to adapt to looking for a different position just in case my current position is sent to Indian or the Philippines. The hardest part of the job is waiting to be laid off, the most enjoyable part is making it through the layoff phases."
good,"sales oriented, , you have to make phone calls in order to get clients in due to low traffic , to management you are just a number , if you don't bring new balances in you are not a good employee"
good,"Remotely resolve tickets and some onsite. Control process' are numerous. People are nice. Boss in different state. Hardest part of job was having to do numerous things that were in our view pointless such as needless meetings and LDR (HDD removal, bagging, tagging and storing)."
good,"Typical call center job chained to your desk. Deal with customers over the phone back to back. Some days there might be time between calls, a minute or two. I'd say more days than not though it was back to back. some of the customers calling in just want little things, or details, what is their balance, they want to make a payment etc. Most of your calls consist of customers with problems, why their transactions were declined, they lost their card and need a new one rushed to them now, and so on."
good,"Easy going environment"
good,"This was a job that I worked during my years in college and I got out of dodge as soon as possible!  This place pays well, but the headache and unfair treatment, micromanagement was not worth the stress.  I am happy I got out."
good,JPMorgan is a great place to work for people seeking entry level job positions in a fast paced environment. Each day you come in do your work and leave without having to bring your job home. You learn a lot about your job and how it affects your community. It's a great place to start for young professionals seeking to gain employment experience and skills.
good,"I took a contract as a Unix SA here eleven months ago and it has been the worst professional experience of my life. The area I worked in was extremely disorganized with a high turnover -- something on the order of four months when I arrived ( getting better, but still sucks )."
good,"In general, a pretty good company, just wish it was easier for career advancement. It is a team environment and we all help one another to make sure the job/requirements are done according to guidelines and procedures."
good,"hard work, low salary. company was not attentive to financial needs of employees. However, I deeply miss my colleagues there. There like a big family."
good,"Work nights, enjoyed the work.  Learned all department but one.  Management was not fair to all employees.  They seem to favor employees that did not meet nor follow the companies policies and procedures set.  Diversity.  Not being supported by management.  Setting goals, giving ideas that were used by the company.  Being top performer.  Knowing at the end of shift that I had earn my paycheck."
good,"Job was good, had some bumps in the road to begin with but i adapted quickly. The best part of the job was the coworkers and the paid time off. Always have Sundays off and holidays. No job security  and don't feel appreciated. Customers usually come in angry because or outrageous fees. Company was always taking away things the tellers can do to help the customers."
good,What I liked most is the judgmental part of the credit analyst job. Gathering informations form different source and analysing the informations before taking a decision.
good,"Have enjoyed my tenor having exposure to various products."
good,"JP Morgan changed into an open architecture environment which has produced a work environment that employee abhoar to work in.  There is not more collaboration, there is less as employees."
good,If you're just starting out in the IT field then this would be a good place to begin your career. Management is what you might expect ... if you know the right people then you can advance. Consider getting some experinece for 1-2 years then move on.
good,"Too demanding for 8 hours worth of work and more is expected out out you than what you are expected to do."
good,"Chase was an unbelievable opportunity however, the decisions of the operations team impeded the progress of the over all success by integrating non-compatible systems causing many failures."
good,Executive leadership in most cases is solid.  Its a great company but will work you to death.  Difficult to find work life balance as they don't care how often and long you are asked to work.
good,"Some people are good people, but the pushy and down right mean managers and district managers were just too much. Very stressful work environment. "
good,"It will be depending the management who you are working for. The corporation culture is not bad, however, when management changed, you have to either change or leave."
good,"I have worked in multiple areas of JPM. The company is all about dollars and cents. They dont care about their employees. Lets face it, they are JPM, they find multiple replacement for you within an hour."
good,"The workplace is funplace to work and client oriented.The company appreciates its employees with ""Service Stars""(which is received from clients for appreciating work in terms of client satisfaction) and ""Team of the Quarter awards."
good,"Management was not good my first year.  A lot of turnover.  New management was brought in from site manager to various line managers, which shored up the prior issues.  Not very good on job security. Even if you have skills to advance, the pool of talent applying for various positions is so high at a 10k + person facility, that chances are slim to even get picked for an interview.  You primarily need to network and make yourself known to get a better chance of advancement.  Performance reviews are set up so it is hard to get anything else than a met review, which other areas look at as a negative."
good,"Great benefits here, but with a big company come more polotics and a lot of unnecessary layers. Not the best place for data science... there's a lot of data there and a lot of problems to solve. However all the regulations of the banks prevents them from moving forward and keeping up with up to date and necessary hardware."
good,"Difficult to maintain life work balance.  Annual salary increase is based on performance reward without measure to rank  Multiple systems of records for commercial and retail bank that do not interface,  Technology limitations."
good,The benefits are great. It can sometimes prove difficult to move up since they are so large in Central Ohio with an endless supply of applicants and a vast workforce.
good,"Fro my first day, you can tell her intentions were to get rid of me. It was not long before she did. Soon I was out of a job and looking for something else for a reason that was ""confidential."
good,This company is okay if you can handle a lot of pressure. Should learn to do multitasking if u really wana stick to this place. Work environment is awesome but the pressure is a lil more than the normal.
good,"Days are long, hours are long, they are unfair with what to wear. Management watch every single thing you do. Hardest part is getting use to the way they manage."
good,"-Shifts were round the clock"
good,Its a good company to learn lot of new technology. Its always a good opportunity for employee to get involved in new things. Job pressure is very high and you have to work in a stressful manner to deliver the task on time.
good,"This is a honest review about Chase based on my current position. Long hours coming in early , leaving late and doing OT and still not enough. Managers have unrealistic goals and don't help you achieve them. I think Chase would be a perfect company to work for if they would hire better managers."
good,"People are kept at entry level. There is a group of managers and they are moved around as needed, people who are well qualified are kept on the front lines to make the supervisors' job more easy."
good,"While I was there, there was no structure at the time on new projects. I learned a lot in regards to AML compliance and check fraud. Management was helpful and willing to assist with any question and were very flexible."
good,"Although it was great that we could work from home when necessary, the process was ridiculously complex, and worse, there was absolutely no social interaction, all meetings on phone. You were tethered to a headset all day. "
good,"company that does not offer any raise for their employees and promotions opportunities are very weak, its much easier when they bring someone outside."
good,"If you've been in banking sales you've heard of working the lobby.  That is exactly what the bankers were asked to do, all day long.  The problem was they wanted to go digital, so most people did not come to the lobby.  So no way to accomplish the required sales."
good,"perpetual restructuring - management inaccessible - strong and supportive female culture was refreshing - multiple systems with little/no training, low continuity."
good,A typical day at work consist of client interaction. Understanding the scope of the project/Needs and requirements. Assigning and reviewing with team what need to be accomplished.
good,"Overall, great company to work for. I was with this company for over 13 years and pretty much developed my work experience here. Management was great and there was a sense of pride working for them. However, I was downsized which was the only wrinkle I experienced working for this company."
good,"Constantly watching DVR footage looking for things to terminate people on. Not enough opportunity for advancement from within, false promises made by middle management."
good,Good culture.  Difficult  to manage job work and life balance. Long hours  of break.  Good  career to start for freshers.  Job security is there. Good  opportunities  to learn.
good,Great place to start your career but not end it.  It's too big an organization at the end of the day to really grow your career.
good,Firm is at the forefront of lot of new technologies. You will get to work on every technology available out there. Internal mobility options are available but limited due to various reason like location strategy & offshoring efforts. Drawback are very bureaucratic organization. Technology jobs are not as valued as the financial jobs. Work/Life balance take a hit due to high pressure environment all the time. Rewards & Benefits are pretty limited. Work satisfaction & Compensation can vary greatly depending on the business unit you work. It gets better if you work directly with the business units bringing in revenue. If you work in technology units outside business then it can be less rewarding.
good,They micromanage every bit of your day.  They also force you to sell products that may not be the best fit for their customers.  When it comes to someone's finances you should always do what's right to build the relationship.
good,"This company is okay not much really to say. The company has great benefits starts the same day, daycare onsite, dont like the schdule,not friendly people at this location, poor management, great checking and savings account, great pay"
good,"Generally pretty good place.  Management varies from individual to individual.  Upward advancement is very hard, and its hard to get training."
good,"A typical day including sales calls on prospective leads. Company has great benefits and a nice work atmosphere and management staff that promotes a great life work balance. The hardest part of the job is sales are cyclical and company expectations are that sales will maintain regardless of changes to marketing campaigns, season, economy or competition. Company is also slow in product development and base salaries are low. The opportunity for advancement is limited as well. The commissions plans can allow for great take home despite low base salary and staff and employees are very friendly."
good,"Good Place to work as a fresher,But very stiff competition for the next roles.Management needs a bit fair treatment rules.and the management should take a better feedback sessions on their management abilities."
good,"I loved my actual job and the analytics involved.   My coworkers were amazing.   Due to the middle management team it made it very hard to excel in my position. Even though I continuously got awards for the services I was able to provide customers, coworkers and other departments, I was never given a promotion.   This past fall it was announced that our entire campus would be closing in 2018, which made my quest for a promotion even more difficult."
good,"Overall, JPM is really a good company to work for. My experience was rather challenging as I worked with an Extremely difficult group of people and a terrible manager. No true leadership, Your group is a reflection of its leader - Good and Bad! (I could write a book!) I truly believed a few have gained the title of manager because of their ""Social abilities"" and by the ""who you know not what you know"". EXTREME Passive-aggressive managing styles will produce difficult, undisciplined employees who are allowed to mistreat others unfairly, just on the basis of their tenure.. Management should be professional and without bias at all times."
good,The managers are only interested in the advancement of themselves. They scrutinize everything you do including taking what they consider too long in the bathroom.
good,"Coomo atendia o cliente VALE que é uma empresa muito grande, tinha contato com todas as plantas e muitas pessoas de áreas diferentes, isto enriqueceu minha cultura e aumentou minha experiência. Durante 1 ano tivemos mudança de gerência por 4 vezes, o que trouxe muita turbulência em cada uma das mudanças, mas que me fez crescer e amadurecer para que pudesse tomar algumas decisões. "
good,I learned a lot about the credit card industry and how things work. Benefits were great. Compensation was horrible. Full Time management was only making just over $40k/year. Change is something they like to do on a weekly basis. Not that change isn't good for a company however they would continually go back and forth changing the same things over and over again. Most of management is so stressed out by their management they make it an extremely hard place to feel comfortable about your job security. When i started working there in 2010 they really cared about their employees & showed them they were appreciated. When I left 10/2016 that was completely gone.
good,"Stressful environment, everything changed daily. Management was not the best.  I did not enjoy working there at all. With a change in the economy, there was a reduction in force."
good,"A great company to work and have met some good people working there including the CEO, who is one of the most down to earth guy you can meet because his head is not in the clouds and he knows how to use the power."
good,"Chase is a very diverse company to work for. "
good,JPMorgan has talented and energetic staff that are largely hard working and committed to results. Things get done through matrix management and your ability to network.
good,One of the oldest and largest Investment bank in the world. Good Salary/Perks benefit. Leave Management System. Job Safety and Security. Ample opportunity for Growth across different verticals.
good,"A typical day at work is many, many withdrawals, deposits, and payments. The chase clients are enjoyable people who make the day worthwhile. I learned how to deal with large amounts of cash comfortably."
good,"It all depends on who you work for.  When I started, I realized very quickly that it was difficult to move up.  Also felt as though there is lack of diversity at the management ranks."
good,Constant push for more. It is a typical production shop. There is never a dull or slow moment. That is not a bad thing necessarily but don't work there if you want to put in 40 and leave.
good,"A typical day consists of dealing with customers and at the same time upholding policies and procedures. You must have the ability to multi-task while providing great customer service. Management on the other hand, needs to hire more compatible people who care about work and not just anyone who needs a job. Co- workers were great and we got along pretty well for the most part. I tried to create a fun environment making it easier to work together. Although due to management not being able to hire qualified employees it made it more difficult to maintain a positive environment. Newer employees relied on the more seasoned employees to take on the work load which caused more tension among staff and others. This in turn made the job more difficult for me dealing with my responsiblities that others should have. The most enjoyable was building great relationships with customers."
good,"I was hired for the position or a Lead Teller Operation Specialist. This position required someone with at least 12 months to 18 months teller experience within the company. I did was offered the position without any banking experience. Although, Chase is a great company with excellent benefits, it wasn't what I had expected."
good,"Chase has great advancement opportunities, however, you sacrifice your social life work more often than not. The bonuses are killed by taxes so you don't get much reward for the work you put in. Unless you are a Manager you are very under paid. The company can be very frustrating with the constant changes in policy."
good,"no comment, I don't like doing survey, it upsets me to have to do them. But, it won't let you get past it without doing them. So, here it is."
good,"OK company to work for. A lot of red tape and bureaucracy"
good,"Nothing really bad to say about my time I spent at Chase. Well,  except I think I should mention the overtime. 7days a week for weeks on end. Happens every month. Scheduling is terrible. They will tell you it is going to change but I heard the same story for the year I was there. And the old timers will tell you that's just the way it has always been. You can make a lot of money but if you have a life outside of work, which you should. It will suffer."
good,"Started with the team working on projects. Quickly thrown into multiple projects and daily procedures with little guidance and high pressure results wanted.  A lot is learned on your own so if you are looking for a formal training this is not for you. Particular team has high turnover and slow to replace. Compensation could be better, comparing position title salaries online will show it is far below average. Everyday is a new adventure."
good,I would not recommend Chase as a company that cares truly about their employees. I have made several complaints about different work related issues and no one has seem to care about my needs as a employee that has worked for them for almost 9 years.
good,"Start working the minute you arrive, work hard every minute, go to the bathroom on your own time, half the number of employees that needed to do the job well, manager inept, leave exhausted every day."
good,"-Patrolling, access control, knowing post responsibilities."
good,The Team Leaders were helpful if they knew the information correctly. You were not told you did something wrong until several days later by then you don't remember what they are talking about.. They do call reviews which are helpful so you can learn what you are doing wrong. . If Compliance hears your call make sure you can back up any time you are off the phone ( Keep notes for your self)  Not only in an email but paper form also.
good,The hardest part of the job was the EMEA shift which was from post noon to endless hours. The Onshore - Off sore cuture as well is not appreciated.
good,"4 1/2 years of pure stress, management made working situation very stressful, your are spoken to in front if customers unreasonable schedule if you don't have kids or in a relationship. they question you all the time about things your doing when you don't have a customer. then when you ask then what they want for us to do we get in trouble for not knowing what to do. No direction at all."
good,"Very poor work/life balance - not enough recognition, mobility is not as easy as one may think.  They don't promote well within the company, it is easier to leave and come back with a higher ranking/title."
good,"JP Morgan Chase has great benefits and is a great place to work but I know this personally, you cant miss any days in your 90 day probation or you'll be terminated and there seems to be a mixture of he said she said and passes the buck and no one wants to take responsibilities and they preach to us in training. Other than that its not a bad place to work, just be healthy and make sure you don't have any stays in the hospital during this probationary period or you'll be canned...."
good,"They expect a lot from you but wont give what you deserve they will help you but any mistake will make you loose your job.You must provide great customer sevice which I agree,I made plenty of friends hard working people"
good,Job was quite limiting. I enjoyed only working 40 hrs a week. They constantly changed the incentive structure which made the pay inconsistent.
good,The company is a great place to work depending on the department you are working in.  The opportunity for growth and stability could use some improving.
good,"Great intro to the financial world if you are looking to transition into a career involving face to face customer interactions, handling money, advice on accounts and working in a face pace environment. Benefits are not as competitive as others, but they do offer some good benefits and scheduling flexibility."
good,50+ hour work week with dedicated individuals. Great place to make a name for yourself but only if you dedicate yourself to there principals. No time for work/life balance. Very late lates 3-4 days a week. But benefits are great.
good,"The hiring process is extremely long, it is measured in months, not weeks.  Management and culture is all about protecting what you know and not letting other know your information.  Too many games but the peers were good people.  Too much of a risk being let go, there seemed to be some type of lay off every few months."
good,Great people to work with.  Good team environment.  Management needs to go back to school to learn how to treat and motivate.
good,"I manage and run a team of 14 people, I would ensure of scheduling, and plan for the day. Show recognition in the morning meeting’s and also show concern where needed and how we can improve as team. Coach employee’s in a consistently basis and take correct action as needed; also ensure that staying in compliance with regulations of Chase. I would hire and on board new employee’s. I would trained the new employee’s once they would arrive back from classroom training. Fast pace environment and always staying in alert, in need of any assistance for the employee’s and customer’s."
good,"Benefits are good. Job is a little unstable with constant changes, however, entire company is always changing. Pay could be a lot better."
good,"I provide customers solutions to their needs; whether it be transactions at the teller line, or methods of avoiding a long wait time by utilizing our multiple technology sources. I learned how to provide good customer service while balancing overall customer experience. I have learned how to see opportunities in customer accounts that allow me to cross-sell or refer additional products/services for bankers to sell to them. The hardest part of my job is lack of management intervention or supervision when necessary. There are times when an irate customer only wants to speak to a manager, however only a quarter of a forty hour work week is the manager actually there. When asking for advice from manager on how to deal with such situations, he provides solutions that directly violate JPMorgan Chases policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the customer, and meet new people on a daily basis. By knowing the customer and building trust/report, it becomes easier to understand their personal needs and help them find solutions through products and services JPMorgan Chase offers."
good,Great environment to work.  Always friendly competition around the building.  Not much room for growth in the workplace.
good,"checked all files for dates that issues needed to be completed, put them in order of importance and started the task of answering the incoming phone calls, making time to do outgoing calls and complete files in a timely fashion."
good,working on the weekends was very nice for me. Because the weekend staff was much smaller than weekdays we were able to be closer and communicate better
good,There is a mixture of great and poor culture within the firm.  It really depends on where in the company one is.  Certain groups are a lot of fun with a great spirit of innovation and collaboration with a great focus on building a positive culture.  Unfortunately the size of the firm has lead to bureaucratic processes that prevents real solutions from being implemented and promotes a culture of finger pointing between groups.  It really is hit or mis within the company.
good,Aggressive deadlines without proper planning. Hardware provided had to be shared with another developer. No training tools.
good,"Mobility is not as seamless as advertised; depending on line of business opportunity for promotion is limited. Process and compliance driven business, very conservative risk appetite. Learn and love to play the game and navigating the organization may seem worthwhile. Not the best place for someone looking to surround themselves with entrepreneurial self-starters with ""out of the box"" thinking."
good,Supportive management. A place to grow personally and develop. The management are flexible with employees and diversity of employee
good,Very Underpaid work load is high for such little pay the polices would confuse anyone and sometimes even too ridiculous .
good,I worked in the fraud department which was very stressful. People were always calling in yelling about their credit cards not working.
good,"I came from brokerage operation background into the WORLD OF BANKING in 2008 due the financial meltdown, The past seven years at JPMCC have been a challenging exprience of getting used to the culture of the banking world. JP MorganChase is a firm of about 250000 people worldwide.  JP Morgan is to big of a firm to substain a career and trying to get ahead,"
good,JPM is a good place to work if you are looking for a relatively secure job where the pay is very average. Work /Life balance is not one of JPM's priorities. 50+ hr work week is usually required if you work in management.
good,A typical day was always being on time.  I learned about the different ways to use the computer.  I enjoyed my co-workers and I learned from them.  My most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers
good,"work varies from day to day, very small team for such a large campus so can be hard at times but overall a good place to work but no chance of progression"
good,"Current position we are doing 3 or 4 different functions; high stress position. I have developed my communication, specifically writing skills, through this company. It has given me the opportunity to communicate with government agencies and play a role in finding resolutions for customers. The benefits are good."
good,"Job work/life balance is pretty good"
good,Great place to obtain your investment license. They have the best and easiest technology to work with. The pay is okay but is below what other banks pay their bankers. The ability to advanced is based on popularity within your market.
good,I have been at Chase for 3 yard and it is very difficult to transition from the retail bank to the corporate sector of JPMorgan.
good,Challenging work environment where no one day is the same which challenges you with ever changing assignments. Production is key.
good,"As a Branch Manager, I endeavor to ensure that all controls are followed to prevent loss through diligent review and consistent follow-up. I lead a team of four employees with the goals of driving revenue and monitoring branch costs to ensure profitability"
good,"- I performed teller duties and looked over staff"
good,"I enjoyed the employees I worked with and the fast-pace of the job. I did not like that management was always so confused or at least, on different pages, about new policies. The numbers such as, handle time, sales of new accounts or credit cards, mattered more than it should have. If you don't like selling, you may want to steer clear of this company and all banks."
good,"One of the most important skills that I've honed on this job is efficient multi-tasking. A typical day could involve priority record reviews, answering product and client-type based queries, diffusing escalations, preparing/presenting training decks for new hires; identifying gaps, and coordinating/spearheading team projects and initiatives. There is never a dull moment. Efficiency is vital."
good,Needs to do a better job balancing employee experience against business initiatives and ensure that change effectively contributes to objectives rather than complicate processes unnecessarily.
good,"Overal bennefits are good, salary is too low for responsibilities required. Advancement opportunities are few and difficult to come by."
good,"Great place to work, room for growth if you have the right management team behind you. Co workers are the best and always willing to help out, great peer coaches."
good,"While the benefits are great, the company is downsizing and they have begun delegating responsibilities onto those that are left and are expecting results equal to or better than that when there were more people to do the job. The work life balance is not conducive for individuals with children."
good,company does not give annual raises i can make 17k more a year at wells fargo with my inv licenses. only good thing is bonus paid monthly.
good,"good environment, benefits, great people to work with, good management except for a few that will keep you from moving up in the company because they dont want to see you do better."
good,"Friendly environment"
good,"Great co-workers, some opertunity Learned about estates process and the procedure within estates. They have a pool table and ping pong table."
good,The job wasn't actually hard it was just a graveyard shift job. Some of the coworkers we a little surly but for the most part ok people.
good,"I enjoy working with my team. I learned a lot from my job new acquired skills,knowledge and techniques that would be very beneficial for me as I continue my service as a nurse."
good,"I sit and completed classes during the first three months I was there, and then it was determined the united I was hired to manage was not going to be moved to Dallas.  I was given another position; the manager over this unit did not trust anyone, and went behind me checking and asking associates questions that I have already provided the information on."
good,"Challenging work environment and competitive. Sometimes bureaucratic. Work life balance dependent on department and manager. Benefits ok, pay competitive."
good,The day at JP Morgan Chase begins with the opening crew coming together for a morning huddle. During the huddle the branch manager goes over the numbers of the previous week and/or day. Afterward the manager sets up each person on what they need to be working on during the day and what they want to accomplish. Throughout the day you are working as a team to help each and every customer with anything they may need from a simple deposite to a new mortagage loan. The hardest part of the day can be when the system shuts down or crashes. However the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the satisfied looks on my customers faces after helping them with complicated issues that arise.
good,"The most reputable company I worked at in the financial and banking industry nation and worldwide.  I was fortunate to work with great people and team players.  JPMorgan fosters leadership and ownership. "
good,"opened and serviced existing deposit accounts, business accounts, credit cards, loans, recommended investment options, and business services such as: merchant services, payroll, and business lines of credit. Built, retained, and acquired customer relationships, managed high balance (250,000+) customers. Resolved complex customer issues...etc.. Learned a lot about customers' businesses and what was important to them in regards to good customer service. I loved to see happy satisfied customers and at times it was hard to see situations in which nothing could be done and the customer was not satisfied, which is highly avoided at all costs, but still tends to happen every now and then. There were some managers that were really good and wanted you and the company to move up and others that didn't really care and did not support you or recognize a job well done which was very disappointing. Although I did meet a few good managers through my career at chase, I feel like overall their management teams need a lot of work. I did very much enjoy what I did, but sometimes being paired up with an unprofessional manager can ruin the experience."
good,The organization allows a lot of mobility opportunities but compensation lags behind. Many areas do have a lot of flexibility which is a big trade off.
good,JP Morgan Chase & Co is a good company. There are various opportunities to learn and move around if you have the desire to do so.
good,"This Entity was Offshore service provider for Deutsche Bank AG which had typical work culture of BPO, Less pay. Time to time shifts change, Focus on Cost and charges."
good,"You  come . You Log with your phone"
good,"Diverse culture and enviornment; JPMC is a great melting pot.  However, if you stay 5+ years your raises suddenly get smaller and smaller because they are afraid you will make too much money.  I was very handsomely compensated when I first started, but after 4 'promotions' I am now doing work that is way above my salary grade.  I got my best friend a job at Chase after I had already been with the company for 3 years.  He now just got an offer from a competing bank offering him 40% more salary, LIFE CHANGING MONEY.  It is sad Chase would rather promote this kind of behavior and not encourage loyalty."
good,Good for freshers & campus hires. Internal Growth is slow. Lots of learning. Management is good. Work environment is good.
good,"Answered customer inquiries and solved problems, offered products and services that enabled customers to reach their financial goals, interacted with card members using expertise to create a positive customer experience"
good,Hours from 9-6 generally. I learned cash and inventory management. I built and fortified my interpersonal skills and continued to hone my customer service skills. Management had a high turnover. Great team besides constantly changing managers and partners to utilize for best seamless assistance of customers. Keeping up with ever changing management. Satisfaction of helping all my customers to reach their financial needs and goals. Personally getting to know many customers I was able to connect with through customer interactions.
good,A good place to work in but a lot of mismanagement and disorganization.
good,JPMorgan Chase afforded me the opportunity to learn a lot about the financial/banking business. Room for advancement..great benefits!!
good,"Chase is good company as far as benefits and pay. However the schedules are tough and the management can be rough. Since being there I seen them fire supervisors that were excellent at their job, and been there for 15+."
good,Chase is ok. I'd like it better if they paid more and if the group I worked in was good at being fair
good,This is a great company to work for as far as benefits. The compensation in terms of salary is not competitive however.
good,"I previously worked as a Fraud Prevention Specialist and the quotas were almost impossible to reach. They do have wonderful benefits but the compensation is rather low for the type of environment that individuals face on a daily basis. There is no room for advancement unless the quotas are met, which can actually become a problem for raises and job enjoyment as well. Overall if you can perform the job and deal with all various systems you will more than likely enjoy the job as they are not a bad company to work for in general."
good,"Overall,Chase is an employer of choice with unparalleled benefits in comparison with other huge companies."
good,"Very fast paced professional environment.  As Chase continues to grow, so does the work load. Compensation structure is one to be negotiated."
good,"The Assistant Branch Manager is responsible for making sure all jobs are covered in the branch. We process bank transactions, open accounts, research any discrepancies either for tellers or customers. We order operating cash for branch and ATM, we order office supplies, we schedule employees not only for there work week but audits, training, meetings, and vacations.  We  also help bankers meet their monthly and quarterly sales targets and the tellers also have targets to meet. "
good,"While working at JPMorgan Chase, I am most proud of my 2 year effort to resolve a Customer's request for mortgage assistance.  I received the case as an escalated complaint and I was able to work with her investor to modify her loan and help her avoid foreclosure.  I was recognized on the JPMorgan intranet homepage as a Champion of Chase in August 2013 for my efforts."
good,"Long days, multiple work strategies, management is okay and the people are friendly, Long days 8-9 last week of month"
good,"Working for this company was not my best experience. The overall morale of the employees were low and very obviously displayed. Management members shifted from different teams and even departments often. The workload is manageable and there is open opportunity to be creative as an analyst/developer. Although I was not one of the employees that experienced the layoff process, the constant potential threat was very high and caused tension amongst others."
good,"My typical day consists of continuos calls and emails serving as the main point of contact between my high net worth clients and the bank."
good,"good firm to begin career"
good,"Hard work, long hours, lack of respect for personal life. Getting a little better but 80-100 hour weeks are norm."
good,"Busy, Productive hard working associates, focussed on servicing the customer."
good,"I really didn't work there long enough to experience much."
good,"Open and close accts. Maintain branch goals, make sure that branch stays and is always ready for yearly audit. Coaching tellers in maintaining branch for audit, following the correct policy at all times."
good,"As a senior service specialist in Banker Services; I am skilled in researching and processing information for multiple customer accounts including home equity, auto, and personal, secured and unsecured loans, skilled for all lien release issues, and opening banker researches.  Direct all activities necessary to resolve escalated customer issues with limited supervision."
good,Wonderful co-workers. A lot of politics. Work/life balance was ok.
good,I worked 40 hours 5 days a week.  I reviewed accounts for fraud and finding alternate payments to recover fraudulant funds.  I recieved calls from bankers with questions about affected accounts.  There was a good relationship between management and staff.  I loved my schedule and enjoyed my job.
good,JPM is a huge organisation and there are multiple roles available so transferring between departments is definitely possible. They are a driven organisation who push you to deliver - this is NOT a 9-5 organisation.
good,"JPMorgan is a great company to begin your career. The management is supportive in upward mobility; however, cross departmental mobility is still an issue that the firm needs to address."
good,Enjoyed all aspects of the mortgage industry.Place to work for another aspect of mortgage lending.
good,"Corporate banking in general is a very stressful field to work in. One must possess a thick-skin in order to succeed. JP Morgan is no exception. Most employees work 10-12 hours per day, although Analyst-level employees do earn overtime for hours worked over 40. "
good,no job security.   too many layoffs  I learned to be a team player
good,Its a good place to work. Fast pace. The only thing that I can say thats a negative is that in this company there is not much room for growth.
good,You never know what you will be reviewing when you come in.  There is always something new to be reviewed that will take presidence during the course of a day.  It keeps you on your toes and it never gets boring.
good,"With the current atmosphere in the banking industry and Chase's public statement that they will be reducing employees, job security is nil.  It creates a tenuous atmosphere."
good,"I was in the 2nd mortgage dept as an analyst. It was a fast pace area, with supervisors only looking at their quotas, and very stressful!"
good,Management was horrible. The training classes were in large groups and were not individualized. Promotions were rare and small.
good,Went into work at 7:30 a.m.Sat at my desk and operated computer. Management was great so were the people I worked with. There wasn't really a hard part of this job but the most enjoyable part of this job was using the skills I learned and we always did something different every day.
good,"Interesting work, variety, typical culture, ability to handle complex issues critical among different counterparts key"
good,company is great.  upper management needs to realize that we are helping customers and not trying to sell like a used car salesman.  District Managers want you to approach every customer to sell sell and sell.  I agree to a certain degree.
good,"answer phones from branch bankers, from escalated customers. track records."
good,Good client base and support staff is excellent. Management is good and salary is competitive
good,There was not enough time in the day to complete the calls to have the customers submit the documents to complete the application for the loan modification.  I was taking inbound and making outbound calls all day.
good,"Morning Huddle! All branch team members meet for 5-10 minutes to discuss the strategy for the day. The conversation centers on the checking campaign. I volunteer to commit to completing an in-depth customer profile on every customer that I see today. I also commit to contacting my newest customers, making sure that their accounts were opened correctly and their debit cards and checks have been received. My manager coaches me on different things I can say to make these conversations fruitful, possibly leading to more sales opportunities."
good,Your typical day to day job with no opportunity for advancement.
good,"This is a large corporation with poor structure. Large disconnect between branch managers and their employees. Even greater disconnect between district manager and their subordinates. No connection at all for any level of management above the DM and those at branch level. "
good,Work day depends on the project you are assigned to.Lots of opportunity to learn
good,"I had 300 clients assigned to me. In addition, I would see 15 new prospects per day. Management was pleaseant and helpful for te most part, but the firm had seasons of intense micro management. My co workers were helpful, but selfish in regards to claiming sales that may or may not been thiers to receive credit"
good,"Typical day included handling financial transactions i.e. checking, savings, and etc. I learned how to engage with customers and I learned how to protect their information. I also learned discipline. Outside of a few people I did not really engage in conversation with anyone. The hardest part of the job was making adjustments being a teller for the first time and balancing between work and school. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers"
good,The benefits were great and the co-workers were wonderful as well.
good,A typical day at work is spending a large amount of time on conference calls and in meetings supervising business units overseas to ensure they are in compliance with firm's policies.
good,"took supervisor calls from other telehone bankers, advised customer about their account balances, purchases"
good,"I worked my tail off for almost 2 years. After being promised a promotion and nothing happening, I went to another bank."
good,"My typical day at work was more of helping existing/ new customers finding solutions within their finances by addressing their needs first then recommending solutions based on conversation. I have learned lots of good things while i worked for JPMorgan Chase as a relationship banker such as customer services, product knowledge, mortgage process, Investment process, Business Banking, Management, team building, coaching, lobby management, strategic planning and much more. "
good,"The company is to big to foster the type of career advancement it need. "
good,The leaders work to keep their employees safe and will work with employees with personal issues. Well organized employees assistance program.
good,I was involved with several steering committees at Chase.  I enjoyed learning about different areas of the business.  Every day was a new adventure.  I learned that making mistakes was part of growing.
good,The people working there are amazing!!! Some managers like to micro manage.
good,"A typical day at work is running your reconciliation reports, other ad-hoc requests and preparing yourself for month end.  I learned how a big corporation worked and how political things can get.  My immediate management was inexperienced in his new role and it created a lot of tension among the team.  Higher management was strong but because there we so many levels of management, they could only do so much.  My co-workers were great and my team was awesome.  Hardest part of the job was month end because you are at work for ungodly hours and there is no appreciation at the end.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the young lively co-workers."
good,"Learned new things in the financial industry, great team, great perks."
good,Endless opportunites for advancement. Not enough formal training for employees.
good,"No advancement, didn't receive any opportunities to grow.  I like to multi-task and coming in to work was typical. There wasn't anything I was looking for too.  I wanted to seem as if I helped someone or made a diffrence."
good,People were very nice   liked the job   chase had very high standards which were very difficult to reach
good,This is a very small representative office in Panama under Treasury Services department.  Our clients are in Central America and Caribbean.
good,"Wonderful place to for after 24 yrs., Managed over 25 employees within the helpdesk and supported of 10 lines of business and over 150,000 employees."
good,"Starting each day with positive energy is the best practice to used."
good,My supervisor allowed us to have a flexible work schedule.  We had great benefits and was able to get along with other co-workers.
good,I manage 15 employees to make sure we are meeting compliance standards. I enjoy being a manager. I know I was born to be a leader.
good,Basically you are in a output based environment with little personal space and hundreds of people near you.
good,"Low pay, average benefits, poor management, lots of office politics and favoritism, 20hrs/wk mandatory overtime, no clear guidelines/training on performing one's job."
good,"Although great knowledge was attained while employed with Chase, the work life balance was lacking as well as the ability to enact change. Departments operate in silos such as a separation of tasks not allowing for full transparency or work conducted to add value to the firm as a whole."
good,I enjoy working at Chase. The heath benefits are excellent. Work/ life balance is apprecaited. There can be an issue with advancement at times. The company values are strong.
good,"You need to be aggressive to move ahead in this firm.  There are many opportunities but the environment can be challenging to many.  Expect to work long hours and fight for everything you get.  Also, expect that the way they will increase profits will include taking away from the masses."
good,Worked with a great group of people. There is always so much to learn in the banking world and this company will give you the experience.
good,"The most pleasurable part of that job was helping people achieve their financial dreams. Whether it be opening someones fist bank account or helping a business set up a line of credit to grow their business, those smiles made my day. "
good,"We work on different loans and scenarios out of systems known as zippy, DU, LP.We are given a pipeline of loans and depending on how many days the loans have been in our pipeline depends on the the date of completion. I learned to analyzed asset and income documentation such as: personal and business tax returns, profit and loss statements, appraisals, and investment portfolios and make  proper and credit risk decisions. My co workers are one the amazing part of my workplace. We all help each other out and have a very committed and strong team thats willing togo above and beyond when needed. The most enjoyable part of my current job would be the experience chase provides in qualify and production, where you are pushed to your limits and demands."
good,Company laid off 1/3 of their employees in the mortgage department.
good,JPMC is a great company to work with . they provided good pay for the work we did .
good,Nobody is on the same page in terms of management. Everything changes in an instant and people are constantly left to pick up the pieces.
good,"•	Served as the primary contact in the absence of upper management"
good,Good workplace to start career. to learn new things. late night shift is the hardest part of the job. Friendly co-workers. long working hours.
good,I've worked with some really great people. But management has not been up to par
good,Good learning curve for career. But tough work culture. It has an aggressive management
good,"I enjoyed my job as a processor because I liked helping people achieve their financial goals. I learned a great deal about the ""Chase way"" of processing. I also enjoyed most all of my co-workers. We worked well as a team when management was more in control and made great improvement during that time. Some days the pressure from upper management was so intense it made it difficult to focus on the task at hand. And the most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom I had to ensure my pipeline was managed according to my daily activities and the customers. 97% of the customers were appreciative and complimentary."
good,"Huge company with lots of opportunity when looking for startup jobs after or during college.  Depending on the location and position, you may have a great opportunity to make good money.  If you are looking for a personal banker position, you can make good money if you work hard.  The training is good.  Job advancement is highly on your numbers and recognition that you receive. However, District manager play an important role and if you do not have a good relationship with them, you can forget about the promotion."
good,"The work day was pretty good. Normal"
good,"interesting working process ,odd shift timings, free cabs, extra milers available"
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, but being in the same environment for 5 years can start wearing you out in a call center"
good,"I worked with a very diverse team and JPMorgan does promote diversity in the workplace."
good,I love working for this company just not able to advance as they stay on a hiring freeze.
good,Always challenging and interesting dealing with the clients and responding to their inquiries in a timely manner. Management was supportive and provided the tools/training needed to better serve the clients. My co-workers have been great because we worked as a team and assisted each other. My dealings with our internal partners was sometimes the hardest part of the job as there were frustrating delays getting responses to client issues.  The most enjoyable aspects of the job was providing client satisfaction and my great coworkers.
good,"A typical day at work at Chase Bank if a very stressful one. Answering 80 calls a day and on top of that half of them are disgruntal customer wanting fees waived. "
good,"I worked in the IB in Bournemouth in 2 spells between 2003 and 2008, much depends on the quality of your mgmt group which varies vastly."
good,"I have learned about end to end Application desk Management, PMO Management, Helpdesk Operations."
good,Good place to work for and gain exposure in the financial industry.
good,"not good work life balance."
good,"A good company to work for, good pay master, good HR policies"
good,"i worked contract and was paid fairly well and enjoyed the culture.  If you are perm be prepared to never make any real money and sit on your butt and get fat.  "
good,"no part of my job was enjoyable, the benefits were great but Chase treated there employees lik they didn't matter."
good,I loved working at Chase. My day was busy I always worked in a teller window and had to multitask my other responsibilities throughout the day. On a daily basis I would have to coach staff to the customer experience or if I saw something operationally that wasn't done right. My co-workers were hardworking and dedicated to their positions.
good,"Compensation and promotion were very bad since 2008. Even though we were the top performing bank after 2008, the middle office teams had huge cutbacks. Job security in my group was high but many individuals had lost their motivation and drive."
good,"I really enjoyed working at chase for the time I was there. The pay was reasonable compared to my previous jobs. What I really liked about this job was the flex ability of work schedules. I would say that my hardest part of the job was just making sure a customer kept there word and made there payments. Other then that it was not a hard job. My co-workers were all very good and very helpful team players. Real good and fun people to work with. And as for management this was something that my department had to work on. Managers were hardly around, manager had to be reminded of stuff mostly all the time"
good,"There are good opportunities at Chase, if you want to move to another department they are very willing to get you there with time and the performance. In less then a year it was easy to get trained in 3 different departments and feel valuable in all of them. It is very structured and very scripted as a call center environment."
good,"Chase was a good company to work at for the first few years. however, you can only work so many months in a row with 10 hours of mandatory overtime and mandatory weekends. also underwriters can be responsible for loans that have first payment defaults or if somebody loses their job and stops paying the mortgage, even if the underwrite was done perfectly. this can cause you to have excessive reviews each month."
good,I worked for this place for over 30 years. I loved to work here. and I had great co-workers. But when my years and advancement was coming up management didn't like that and made going to work hard.
good,I would love to stay in the department I am in but there is unfortunately limited room for growth and will have to seek employment else where.
good,"Financial Adviser January 2013 – Current (Tempe, AZ)"
good,"Overall, I learned a lot while I was there. However they need to do a better job of pairing certain personalities together while you work in close quarters while at a inside a grocery store setting. If you have a person with a negative attitude it really hurts the branches morale. I had a great time working with a lot of my customers."
good,On a typical day I process 200-350 business deposits a day. As a operation teller you deal with anywhere from 500k- 900k or maybe more on a day to day basis.
good,Very productive and challenging work environment. Each day is an opportunity to learn something new regarding the banking industry and all of its partners/merchants.
good,Chase is a great company. The size of the company is what really takes away from the good review. The size limits the interaciton with your supervisors. It limits you in the ability to get things done quickly. They have done multiple questionable actions.
good,"A typical day of work consists of creating and reviewing reports that are sent to upper management in order to monitor the new automation of a daily BAU process. Other responsibilities include filing client requests to ensure their accounts are accurate and up to date as well as fix any issues they may be facing. The most important piece of knowledge I have gained from this work experience is improved problem solving skills. I have also learned the importance of being personable and forging relationships among co-workers and managers. The hardest part of my job is being an effective communicator. We work with clients, co-workers and managers from all over the United States, but also outside of the country. This means the type of message that may be appropriate to one party may be inappropriate to another.The most enjoyable part of the job is making our daily processes more efficient and filing client request faster."
good,"Maintained an average of 50 loans, called clients, business partners, and employers for processing of mortgage loans to close. Very enjoyable speaking with Customers and Loan Officers. Direct Management had no Lending Experience, was a tranfer from retail banking. Hardest part of the job, was when they changed the monthly bonus to annual. Most enjoyable was the satisfaction of cloing home loans and the customers happiness."
good,"I worked in the Retirement Plan Services division in Kansas City, MO for over 8yrs. The management of this division love to play favorites. Its a huge clique and very hard to advance career wise unless you are part of the group. When I left in 2009, the department was still in the red which I could never figure out as new clients kept coming in. The company overall is very conservative. RPS is not well oiled machine. I hold out hope that it will be profitable, but management needs a complete overhaul."
good,Constantly taking calls from people with problems about accounts. Management will not work with you to schedule days off.
good,Go somewhere else. No chance to get a promotion. I hate it. I have been in the same position for 4 years and I have no chance at a promotion.
good,Nice place to work with casual work attire and a great onsite cafe.
good,Strong work environment. Great co-workers. Learned time mangement
good,I would intake mail that was being sent in from clients and review to be distributed out to the right claims department to handle it
good,"Since joining Mortgage Banking the most challenging part of the job has been the sheer volume of critical issues, all of which have a meaningful impact on the firm’s financials."
good,Great place until recently. Mass under the table lay offs and salary reductions. This started after the companys loss of the 7-9 billion hit the news.
good,I worked in one of their NYC offices and just recently left after a short time there for a better opportunity. They make you work long hours (10+ day) and weekends. They even had me traveling for them on my own time. The pay for my position wasn't competitive and while the benefit plan was good… it was expensive. The culture was very stuffy… had to wear a full suit and tie every day. (I never saw outside clients and my role didn’t have much interaction with other departments either) I prefer working for companies that provide a work/life balance and this wasn’t the place.
good,"It's a great place to bump up your resume and initial salary, but if you decide to ""move up"", don't expect a large salary increase. They will expect you to work in your new role without any increase till your year end review, and even then it's not going to be much. Nice place to work, but if you are looking to make big money, it's not going to happen."
good,"Busy environment with lots of responsibility. It was a call center, fairly busy."
good,Great diversity program as well as career progression 5 years ago.
good,"Day starts with Resource Allocation and Capacity Planning in order to manage a team of 8 members. Then Managing all deliverable with Zero Error and extreme Timeliness. This I would consider as the most challenging and enjoyable part of the job. Co-workers are very friendly and have been in the industry for quite some time, thus making my learning more deep. Senior Management is very open to new innovative ideas and all put stress in achieving all of it."
good,"A typical day is usually repetitive unless you are working on special projects. I would say that you should be leary of management, double check everything you touch and keep record of every meeting you have with anyone, things can come back to bite you especially with management. I have worked for this company off and on for about 10 years both temporary and permanent. Things went south for me as a permanent employee after I had a child. I was transferred to a new position while I was out on maternity leave without any warning to a position that no one wanted and I was totally clueless in my new position. It was scary to return from leave to find my work and personal items gone from my usual work desk and have someone else sitting there only to be told you have been transferred to another position, not to mention that 2 weeks earlier I had been to a luncheon with my co workers and supervisor. I stayed in the position for six months trying to hold on until I could be transferred to another department, but none of the higher ups was interested in helping get in a more suitable position. They knew about the difficulty I was having with the position on top of having to care for a 3 month old child. The hardest part of this job is that things change everyday so be ready to work at a place where the business need changes on a daily basis. With all that said you will have the opportunity to meet a lot of great people and will gain a wealth of information and knowledge."
good,"Challenging workplace - emphasis on metrics and client retention - good communication between managers and staff, although goals/objectives not always clear."
good,"I worked as a funder/closer in the mortgage department. It became quickly apperant that goals and timelines were always going to be an issue and that you would always have to stay later than you were told or expected. They will then tell you work fewer hours but get more files done, and that you are not doing enough. Very typical of a corporate structurued operations position. Not my cup of tea, but if you don't mind not having a life and being stressed out all the time. This is the job for you."
good,"Some good people, mobility is not as fluid ad it could be."
good,"Working at the retail level of Chase is okay, if you're straight out of college and need a job. Otherwise, you can get stuck as personal bankers do not move beyond the retail level at all. The work is not hard, basically sales. My only qualm with management is that they make unrealistic promises to junior bankers whose passions lie beyond retail. Most retail managers have little to no power at all. Therefore the bottom line is unless you desperately need a job as I did, do not go into this role unless you have a passion for retail sales."
good,this would be a great company to work for a person who does not have a life..you have a be an TAIL kisser to work here..if your a mother or just have dr appt or kid plays then u will not be active at all in ur kids life..i became ill and was treated very poorly..all they wanted was for me to devote all my time to chase..tho it provided a good life for me and my family..i was unable to care for myself which made me decide to walk away..will i ever go back maybe after my kids are grown and i have nothing but free time..everyday they would walk someone out of the center..they didn't care about shaming someone in front of the entire call center..don't be one sec late..never call in..so i hope u never get sick r u never have a child that gets sick..and ladies please never have a child while working at chase..r u be losing a job..
good,"I manage book of special needs and court appointed trust. The clients require a lot of hand holding and attention, and quiet frankly, the number of accounts we is too many. My day consist of reviewing and approved (or disapproving) request from my clients. I work on compliance issues to makes our trust have all require paperwork. I also interact almost daily with business partner within the bank and external clients."
good,Conduct over 500 transactions on a daily basis. I learned a lot of the banking rules. Management was very poor.
good,"The salary is pitiful but the benefits are great- paid holidays, vacation, sick time even for part-time jobs. The corporate structure is very rigid and the management is bogged down in bureaucracy and outdated procedures."
good,Chase is a wonderful company as a whole however the low level management are not very helpful or employee friendly.
good,"Good culture, but it has slow process of advancement, great managers, good life balance not great"
good,Wouldn’t recommend horrible management sick days are slim to none only if you have seniority far commute pay isn’t worth the line of work you do and stressful the job is
good,Chase offers great benefits but keeps cutting positions and making incentives more difficult to reach. Branch banking has become a sales job for everyone from the tellers to the managers. I chose to find another field.
good,The company is global and has a large number of career categories within the same company.  You are able to change careers within the same company and retain your seniority.
good,"I worked for 3 decades at JPMorgan and while most of the people are awesome, the culture has turned into one of selfish self-advancement and that, in the long run, is going to be what holds it back"
good,"Hardworking environment, team culture. Each area works on an individual basis. There are many clubs to get involved with and outside activities. Ideal for University graduates"
good,"Chase offers many mobility options, within many different departments. You have opportunities to learn many skills across many departments within the bank and banking industry. Management can be very supportive of your personal goals, depending on the manager. The most enjoyable part of Chase is the people culture and people you will come into contact with, working side by side daily."
good,Very good company to work with. Challenging and pretty good environment. Management not very supportive though atleast in the team I worked. Overall good
good,"A good place to work. Good environment."
good,Depending on the departments they are all run differently depending on the management at that time. Be ready for change if you can't adapt to change this is not a place for you to work.
good,"You must enjoy good competition.  This is a fast-paced work environment where the successful candidate will have the skills to match job description, but must also have the ability to influence.  You will get lost if you cannot prove that your project is the most important and deserves the attention of the impacted parties who are already fully consumed by other priorities."
good,"stressful to work there and never enough work to meet goals, management does not care and still expects you to meet the goals that they set even though they do not provide enough work"
good,"The experience was ok, however there is still some unfair treatment going on if you are a black person. "
good,"I've been with the company for many years, and one thing is definitely clear, expect ""CHANGE"". Chase goes through phases of extreme changes where they tend to cut several jobs in one area, and create new jobs in others. Job titles change as well as the responsibilities. What you get hired to do today, may change into something completely different tomorrow. These changes can place you in a position your are no longer qualified for and no desire to do. Another issue within Chase is management. Depending on what market your in and who your manager is, can make a world of difference. I have noticed that management usually changes about every 2 years, and you never know what changes are going to happen. Most managers are bad people that are power hungry and don't communicate effectively. Expectations are all over the place with no clear pathway to achieve the final goal. There are good things as well. Pay is good, benefits are great, time off is amazing, and the advancement of technology is fantastic. Overall the Company has a good foundation, great ideas for future ventures, and leading the way in technology. It's the treatment of the customer facing employees that needs work."
good,Being based out of New York the culture is much different than that of a Midwest based company.  If you send a colleague an e-mail management usually asks for immediate escalation.
good,"Chase is one of the first institutions for just about everything, they are  the leaders of technology and development.  Usually the first to implement new plans sought out by other institutions.  Very fun and exciting,"
good,Day to day activity consists of assisting clientele with everyday bank transactions. Depended on the location of low or high traffic with matching the pace. Staffing is low with high turnover.
good,"Management in Plano, TX needs lots of work, tons back end kissers and they put pressure on you even when you're doing amazing in your role. I enjoyed working for this company but not in this area; 5 years in total with the company. Had to quit because female managers can be petty and will try getting you fired just because they don't like you. Instead of using our differences for the better the female managers act like C-unts because they want everything their way. Base pay is 34K for the majority of bankers and commission is only decent if you are a relationship banker. Personal Bankers don't make much and deal with too much from clients yelling at you to poor management; Would not recommend Plano area if interested. Mind you I've worked with plenty of professional females in the 10 years I've been in banking."
good,"How you view the company really depends on what your job role is, probably like most companies. Being a banker is not a flexible position to be in if you have kids at home or a lot of family responsibilities or personal hobbies. Long office hours. You work from morning to evening every day. Typically in the office between the hours of 8am to 6:30pm everyday. Add in driving to and from work. You are easily gone 12 hours everyday. To advance within the company is very difficult and it really depends if people are in your corner or not. There really is no formal structure to be promoted to different lines of business or different positions. Your incentive plans change every year and the minimum production goals are quite hard to achieve consistently. While you can be rewarded for good performance the base salary is very low and the base salary will probably pay for a months worth of gas and groceries but thats about it. If you want to be involved in daily huddles and meetings and if you want to work right next to your direct manager then you can do this. But if you want any degree of autonomy... This is not the company for you. No sundays, at least no in Texas. So if you are ok with one guaranteed day off, you'll be ok too. But if you want/need schedule flexibility then this is not for you."
good,The Hudson Yards office feels like Google without the free food.  There is a game room and fancy coffee bar.  There is food that needs to be purchased.  Open floor plan with lots of places to have impromptu meetings.
good,"Bad experience. Very stressful work environment. Obsessive compulsive and micro managing VP's ans ED's are rampant in Newark Corporate Center."
good,The experience was interested . I was able to learn a lot of productive information and meet some very nice people. I appreciate the growth i accomplished there in the 12 years of working with the company.
good,"A typical day of being a banker at Chase is making as many calls a day as you can; warm or cold calls. Throughout the day, you service clients that come into the branch with their needs. Management is not pushy with sales but the base salary is so low that incentives will make or break your career with Chase. If you are a great salesman you can do very well. If you are an okay salesman, you can struggle making a decent living for yourself."
good,"If you are not able to get through your work, you risk corrective action-which may lead to termination. If you complete your work during time off, it's at your own free will if there isn't a budget for overtime. When you are honest about the time you worked, a manager might update your timesheets to keep themselves off of the naughty list."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great brand and has a multi culture that varies from site to site and team to team. However there is no employee loyalty. You can work hard and excel and if they want to let you go they will let you go. Having other opportunities available they will rather hire someone from the outside than promote within.
good,"They don’t give us enough staff for the amount of changes they made. Two people at one branch is ridiculous. You don’t feel supported by management (direct branch manager is fantastic, but HIS management is not)."
good,"The company needs to have better opportunities for employees that are progressing on their education. Many opportunities are for lateral movements, and it is difficult for promotion. Per company policy, you can not jump several levels even though you have the education and the experience for that position. If you are an internal employee, It can take you years to arrive for what you are qualified to do."
good,"My journey at JP Morgan Chase started at Washington Mutual Bank. I worked there for only a few months prior to Chase's acquisition in 2008. The culture was very different. Washington Mutual was a more casual environment and Chase was more corporate and traditional. I enjoyed working in both scenarios. The hardest part of the job is also what I like most about the job - finding solutions that meet the needs of my customers. There is no cookie cutter solution, and I enjoy putting the puzzle pieces together to meet each customers individual needs. My work day includes engaging customers on sight and meeting off site with potential new business opportunities. In my time at JP Morgan Chase, I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing professionals, from whom I have learned a lot."
good,"Unfortunately, Chase is not driven by Customer Service. Rather, it's driven by the amount of money brought in. There are quotas that need to be met and it's overlooked how you can achieve it. Things that are possibly against rules and regulations are ignored as long as you can bring in the big bucks. "
good,"Huge pool of career choices"
good,I learned a lot about the financial industry and standards for fiscal reporting. I would have loved to have more career growth opportunities and pay structures.
good,"There was never a typical day at work You just show up and read your email to find out what you were required to do. You are required to work off reporting that was always wrong. With the constant changes in staff, management, policy and procedures made it hard to know what to do on a daily basis.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new friends."
good,"Good company with a lot of opportunities to learn new skills and develop your career. The downside is if you are brought in at a low salary. Increases are minimal, and you should definitely do your research to make sure you are being paid fairly based on your experience, but more importantly, based on the value of the job you are performing."
good,"Chase can be really great at times, and really frustrating at times. The majority of my time with the company has been positive, but management has a lot to do with the individual experience there, and unfortunately that isn't always positive and can sometimes leave you feeling trapped. Compensation isn't always competitive, but they do have decent benefits."
good,The firm has solid people in senior positions in NYC and is working to replicate the same on the West Coast.  Major technology systems are built in house.
good,"My career at Chase has a span of 17 years, which gave me the opportunity to hold different positions. The atmosphere was friendly however, always stressful and competitive."
good,"Don’t give more than 20 hours per week. Branch manager, doesn’t know anything can’t used her as a resource. Change schedule weekly after schedule is post."
good,Work can be great if you enjoy sales and helping people financially.  Tools are amazing to aid in job.  Senior management is disconnected from the day to day.
good,He is very arrogant and treats women as if they are beneath him.  He will sit at your desk and raise his chair so high that you are forced to look up and he has to look down at you.  No guidance and has no regard for anyone else unless you are agreeing with everything he does and says. Terrible leader and it was a disappointment that the company would put someone like this is in a leadership position.
good,"Overall I recommend this company. Small opportunity for advancement considering company growth. No stability for long term employment, specially in Retail & Mortgages."
good,"This is a productive workplace. "
good,"Working at Chase has its ups and downs. Like all retail banking, employees must adhere to banking laws and regulations. They don't stress this enough and training can often get repetitive. Management is either a hit or miss. I've had managers who really care about the well being of their employees and hear them out, while others often tend to keep to themselves and not listen to a single concern. Other than that, working here was pretty chill, got to meet many people and build fun relationships."
good,JPM is just a very big company. I worked there shortly after Bear Stearns acquisition and I didn't really feel like there was a deep culture there that encourages and empowers employees.
good,"Initially when I started working for Chase i thought this would be the company i would retire from, but after 8 years of employment i soon realized that regardless of the fact that i had a bachelors degree in management, advancement was contingent on who you knew not what you knew, at the end of the day, reductions in the work force were made, but there was no clear cut criteria on what was used to determine who would get laid off, and unfortunately i ended up being a casualty of the job reduction along with others who basically had the same tenor of time employed as i did."
good,"Dealing with customer foibles and insecurities about their finances is one thing but having to deal with the mind numbing times people can lose/misplace their debit cards or come in to ask to print out a statement after they select paperless and having them tell you there printer is on the fritz is another. Not to mention if your branch has safe deposit boxes, the time lost on people coming daily is painstaking. Yet they call the position a sales position and your supposed to make like happy knowing you are wasting your time and not making one PVC towards your monthly obligation to satisfy your being there. The directors seemed to have lost touch with reality and prefer you to be a raucous cheerleader to their next big idea to bounce sales northward. Sales is a trust position saddled with doing what's right. That trust may take time, allow that time to be used wisely."
good,"everyday work is pretty manageable. Not flexible with work schedules and WFH options. Many employers within the same field as I am working are flexible, but Chase is not."
good,"Chase would be a dream job for those who dont have their dream jobs with college degrees. Chase just needs to be more caring about their employees and understanding with life cycles of emergencies or the fact that sometimes things happen that we cannot control. "
good,overall okay work environment. management was okay as well due to lack of communication sometimes. hardest part of the job was getting assistance cause mangers would have a lot meetings.
good,"They are out of touch with the clients and industry, think they know what drives a customer and what they want when they haven't been on the phone with a client in over 10 years or never even had to work with clients due to having a higher degree and moving up the ladder too quickly. They do not care to ask the people who are processing the applications on a daily basis and getting their feed back on what they are constantly hearing and being requested from clients."
good,Good work life balance. There is always something to do. Opportunity to learn about the finance industry. Salary is not competitive. Ask for current salary when hiring. Bad planning for project. Decision sometimes based on what is coolest technology instead of right technology. People sometimes unwilling to share knowledge
good,"The culture here is weird. I worked in the credit card department.  Their customer service teams were non-customer facing, yet had to be business casual all the time.  People were extremely nosy about things that were none of their business."
good,it was a contract position.  you worked hard but had fun doing it.  the people where nice to work with even though they were losing their jobs.  had a chance to travel.
good,"I had a really god experience working at Chase Bank in New York.a A month ago a got transfer from NY to FL and the management culture was completely different, very poor, unprofessional, discrimination to employees. "
good,"It is nice  place to work and we can learn new things daily and management also good  ,We  will get a chance to upgrade our skills,I have learnt lot of new things technically and non technically."
good,"branch manager and district manager do not appear to be on the same page,  ever.  Branch manager is clueless about what's going on but hides behind the district manager. Comes up with crazy policies and goals that the district manager supposedly wants, but the district manager says different and clearly does not know what the BM is saying.  Leadership by fear. No involvement other than to chastise when having a bad day or week or month. Offers no helpful ideas but demands improvement.   dm and human resources seem to feel the goals are met but BM does not.  No real balance between work and family life."
good,They did not always put the right person in the right seat.  They cared more about what is on paper than giving an employee with experience an opportunity.
good,I don't really have anything good ot bad to say. its been so long since I woorded there a lot of the structure has changes. I know people who work there who seem to like it well enough and the pay is good
good,"Promises in training not honored once training completed. Managers inexperienced and no compassion for customers, who are sick, unemployed or dying. Very stressful."
good,Chase is a great company to work for. Great benefits and competitive salary. I would had loved to stay but because of really poor management I left this location and unfortunately around my area because there was no other openings I am no longer working at Chase but will consider working for the company again at a different location. The manager has preferences. Discriminates. Talks to employees like if they are dumb. Embarrasses you in front of customers and employees instead of helping you. Talks about employees backs to other employees. Will not notify you about new policies and procedures only to certain employees. And the manager wonders why they get poor branch reviews all the time.
good,"Great working environment,  team players.  Hours are flexible,  depending on manager.  Compensation could be more competitive.  They do have great benefits  such as medical,  retirement, educational plans."
good,"Chase offers good benefits such as adoption assistance, tuition assistance and many other things. The job of a relationship banker is very mundain. Too much customer service with expectation of high production."
good,"Management is not consistent with all employees."
good,I worked for JP Morgan Chase for approximately one year.  Unfortunately there was a layoff and I was one of the ones that was laid off.  I wouldn't speak negatively of JP Morgan Chase.
good,Chase Bank is a well oiled machine. Their training is impeccable. The structure and culture is very strict and professional. I spent a long time with Chase and decided to leave the firm to pursue a different career path.
good,"Direct manager was great to work with, but those who direct the entire department is extremely disorganized and at times, creates more problems than resolving them. Workplace culture depends on which office you sit at. There was very little room for flexibility on where you work, and it made it very hard to leave the office, event for an hour to take lunch. No salary increase for promotion, just a title promotion. There was no annual increase in salary - only the rate of inflation increase."
good,My overall satisfaction level is about 3 stars out of 5. The benefits are very descent but could be much better considering Chase is the largest bank in the US and many employers offer far better benefits for their employees. Favoritism is a major problem and I have seen it over many years of working for Chase
good,"An unhealthy atmosphere is inculcated where a lot of work is done for the sake of work being seen to be done, not because it is necessarily required. Several instances of people being promoted due to effort rather than talent."
good,A typical day at work involves working a variety of alerts with the goal of meeting the daily goals while maintaining sufficient quality. The best part of the job is you have others around you that are more than willing to assist if there are ever any issues.
good,"Mostly calling customers on the phone with occasional meetings to review a client's relationship."
good,"Although this is a very large company it did not really offer much to it's hourly employees. I still bank with them and see some of the former employees and hear there is very little change. Upper management reaps the rewards, too much has to go through New York and too many changes concerning the movement of management."
good,"It was always busy from start time to finish, i loved my coworkers we were always willing to assist each other. However, i got switched to a new team with a manager that hated me because the managers at the Arlington location were very messy, and my previous manager told her about a situation i let her know about in confidence that she wouldnt tell. After informing my DM about how she had been secretly attacking me verbally and the sneaky things she was doing to make it hard for me to fix my aht he was very biased and didnt care for what i said. Needless to say he quit a couple weeks later after that, and she finally got her wish to be able to fire me. Another manager told me about her wanting to get me fired so its not just me saying that. But other than that messy situation and that horrible manager it was a good job."
good,"While it is not a particularly exciting workplace, most employees are pleasant to work with and management is reasonable. This position in particular provides the opportunity for collaboration both locally and internationally."
good,"Chase as a company is a good place to work at. they provide training, but the branches are very micro managed. everything depends on the managers and there is no advancement even if you work hard. I have learnt a lot from the training classes as well as daily interactions with customers."
good,"Fair to midland, few opportunities for advancement , pretty balanced work environment/friendly, great benefits for emploees, company is strongly interested in investing in their employees future"
good,JPMC provided me with an opportunity to learn a great deal about ops risk management and to apply what I learned. Worked with great  people who were of great character.  I led several high visibility projects and had the opportunity to successfully turnaround a department.  The corporate strategy has shifted and new operational decisions ultimately eliminated my role.
good,"I enjoyed working at Chase and have a lot of respect for the company and how it is managed.  However, it seemed there was high turn over in middle management and branch employees."
good,"Cautiously service customers with financial service "
good,The mission statement was clear but individual departments were managed separately with their own individual agendas. There was a definite change over the years in the overall culture as the organization felt it more important to hire younger inexperienced talent versus retaining their experienced staff.
good,"This bank has transitioned to a tech company. Specialize in database, research and technology. Most managers expect overtime as a way of life. "
good,Great people to work with.  It was them that made the experience really enjoyable.  Management is ok but lacks consistency.  Overall it was a good place to work.
good,"At JPMorgan Chase the culture of each branch is very unique. Although I felt a lot of enjoyment with the overall job, the non-work related demands that were given were too inconsistent and given with very little instruction. Other employees often would distract others from important tasks that needed immediate attention, which kept the pace at the particular branch that I worked in a slow pace that any customer in a rush would become easily agitated with. That was the only notable problem that drove me away from wanting to work at the location and with the company and longer, but it was still a great experience and I’m happy I had the opportunity to work there."
good,"Nice people to work with, not enough hours. Environment was a pleasant experience with no stress involved. All that was required was to treat clients with respect and care."
good,"Chase has wonderful paid time off, sick time, maternity time and medical benefits.  The culture is family like. All of the departments in customer service pay low with now incentives."
good,The firm requires adept personal and organizational skills to succeed in addition to experience relevant to the job seat itself. The networks take time to build and need constant nourishment to sustain.
good,"Open, close, and service all customer accounts. Cross sell products, refer business to Loan Officers and Financial Advisors. Regular upkeep on training to comply with federal guidelines and to keep up with industry trends. In charge of coordinating monthly meetings and training opportunities. Other duties include: Vault Teller, Lead Teller, and Manager on Duty. "
good,"Strong work ethic, work life balance suffers. Very tight deadlines. Great people. Strong possibilities for exposure. Everyone is hard working. Highly sought after place to work."
good,Employee training was sub par.  Fast paced environment with not enough personnel.  Typically worked 5 hour days with no assistance.  Management was typically unhelpful.
good,"The Job was fantastic in terms of pay and networking. However, it is very slow to move up the ranks and as much great customer employees arr provides, customers continually disrespect employees and it's a hit or miss in terms of management. The pay and benefits are excellent but there isn't a balance between work life and personal- it's only work. Chase ia replacing employees with technology; if you're not a supervisor or higher, job security is scarce."
good,"A typical day at work requires honed time management skills and finesse to balance meetings, meeting planning, project research, learning new software and systems, and competing deliverables. Management skill and culture vary vastly from team to team."
good,Great place to meet people and make lasting friendships. Pay is terrible. Culture is very racist. Middle management isn’t the best at motivating people.
good,"Inbound customer service position.  Must have thick skin as credit card customers can be abrasive."
good,"Job was to keep it less stressful for customers, with making sure the business of their auto finances is being taking care of, and also with the mortgage side as well for the 5 years I work in mortgage."
good,"JPMorgan believes that they are competitive in the Business Banking Segment. They are not in certain areas such as Westchester County, NY. JPMorgan offers a bonus every 6 months that is based on how a Relationship Manager hits their goals and then compared to others in a peer group they are in. There is also a large part of this that is discretionary that makes a lot of the bankers play a political game of favorites. The bonus is also based on an arbitrary ""pool"" of funds that need to be dispersed, which can vary in size every year and it has never varied larger. The pool seems to shrink every year and the Relationship Managers have no say in anything and are left to just accept it. Other banks pay salaries that are double what the same position is paid at a JPMorgan. This is one of the reasons they have such great quarterly earnings. Underpaying their loyal employees."
good,"Contract is coming to an end, Great training course. I've had three weeks unpaid vacation time off. You do not get paid double time for working Holidays."
good,"The responsibilities of the position were exactly what I expected. Managing multiple calendars for executives, preparing documents for staff meetings, troubleshooting daily maintenance issues, ordering office supplies for the department, coordinating domestic/global travel and employee onboarding."
good,I can honestly say the benefits is awesome with this company. Not too happy how they hey do thing within the dept I am in and how they handle thing but I have no complaints about the benefits
good,"i have been working here for over 8 years and i finally left because of the high level of stress, work life balance, long hours , and over the top bad management. GOOD BYE JP THANK GOD!"
good,Salary pay will be good. Hikes and bonuses will be good compared to other companies. Very less importance to  employee engagement.Work life balance is not so good. Work from home option will not be available. Flexible work hours are provided
good,"ok to work there but job security was not a plus, i worked worried that my job was going to end anytime and that is not a healthy work environment and for that reason its just ok"
good,"Great comp and benefits but you work a lot of hours! I wish the company had a better way to promote work-life balance, because in my opinion, working on vacations is tough and you never truly get a chance to take a break. Otherwise, I feel like the company is becoming more progressive and trying to make a difference in the community."
good,Overall good place to work. However the volume of work is overwhelming and stressful. Very difficult to move up in the firm and find time to balance your life out.
good,"Benefits are good, pay and annual pay increase are not that great.  they have a very cumbersome annual review process which depending on your department can get in the way of your job function(s).  management is usually there for themselves and don't want to rock the boat if there is an issue or if they do not know the answer to your problems."
good,"JPMorgan Chase it is changing the majority of the AML KYC process because it is a fairly new department. Additionally, the management team does not promote within the department."
good,Chase has great benefits and flexible schedules. Chase is a very fast paced environment and Chase requires production from their employees. Overall a good company.
good,"great work culture; excellent partnership between different areas within the company."
good,they have great time off paid leave sick leave maternity leave all that. but the management is so poor. you may run into one or two managers that are great but they never have openings on their teams
good,"I had third-shift for data entry, which is not the most interesting job. However, I didn't mind too much sitting at my desk for 8 hours inputting data, what annoyed me was that we had to go through a 3-month period before we were allowed to bring in an mp3 player to listen to music. It's difficult enough sitting at a desk for 8 hours, but doing so in silence was painful."
good,"This job is not a banker's job, it's more of being a mail clerical. Our main job with working with JPMorgan Chase is to work with the IRS on people who own money to the IRS. I worked multiple fields in this job, Extraction, Candling, and Check Destruction."
good,"I like the people there, the work was steady. You can advance in the banking world. The compensation for a teller is just really low and unable to live on."
good,"I was financially stable but struggled with being promoted within, raises and work/family balance. Although they did have programs to recognize employees they did not do a great job of making you feel valued as an employee."
good,Great place to learn about finances and meet new people from all walks of life.  Job is shifting into a call center and less of a face to face setting.
good,"Approve over 50 loans, travel to commercial sites, I enjoyed the traveling but missed my family very much they have rat insurance package, but I is not the place to work if you have a young family  however, I learned and continued use my knowledge I received from jp morgan"
good,"I recently held multiple positions within retail banking. Technology is bar none compared to competitors but pay is industry behind. Rarely any overtime and alot of management is pretty cool. With lack of positions within the branch, more responsibilities are placed on remaining positions without compensation and less opportunity for promotion."
good,with very few staff member the management will expect you to provide excellent customer service and achieve all your goals and customers can be very rude at the same time.
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great firm to learn and gain valuable experience in the finance world. They promote mobility and have a huge diverse work culture. Majority of the management is wonderful to work with and they do promote a work life balance.
good,The workplace environment was very strict with productivity being of utmost importance. Quantity versus quality. Management was unavailable for guidance.
good,Very political environment. Great CEO. Pay and benefits top notch. Very buttoned up culture. Can be stuffy. Some executives can be abusive to junior employees.
good,"In my professional career journey Chase was a dream come true. The pay was well above minimum wage. They offer stellar benefits from day one. The typical work day entails answering inbound calls from customers, bankers, and various departments needing assistance. It is quite possible to take 100+ calls a day depending upon your shift and hours. My professional character was definitely shaped by my experiences within Chase. I learned accountability, improved communication skills, team work, efficiency, emotional intelligence, and met so many interesting people. The contact center environment is fast paced and changes can happen daily. Management consists of a rotation process..not sure how it is determined. Managers will change, team leads will change, and site leaders will change. These changes will bring scrutiny to certain metrics depending upon the person. I've had terrible managers that will throw you under the bus when they fail and great managers who will truly help you succeed. The culture has drastically changed from an upbeat atmosphere to a stressful bureaucracy. They have ""aligned"" segments to get more work for the same pay. Most positions have become lateral moves without a pay increase. They believe in a paper trail and watch all metrics like a hawk. C.Y.A. all day..every day!! The hardest part of the job is feeling chained to a phone for hours upon hours. Customers and managers will either make your day or give you the blues..depends on the person. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you actually get to help someone that honestly needs you and appreciates"
good,"monthly commissions. "
good,Not exactly what I thought a personal banker position was.  Really a personal banker is a sales position; have a fixed 'script' that you must say to every customer. Script didn't fit my personality. Management was ok.
good,"As everyone on the street knows, they pay the lowest in terms of salary compared to other retail banks. They lowered their commission incentive caps last year to the point of being ridiculous. They penalized us not for doing anything wrong but to cut their costs. While our cost of living are rising every year, they make it harder with each annual revision of their incentive plan for us meet it. Unless you are in corporate, retail banking employees are typically treated like second class citizens. Benefits are otherwise on par and weekly scheduling somewhat flexible. Taking a prolonged vacation can also be detrimental to your month's production. Management is in constant state of flux."
good,Working for JP Morgan Chase will teach you about banking and how to be responsible with your own accounts. The Telephone banking position is a fast pace job.
good,No comment I appreciate the opportunity but it was time to move on. Someone else may enjoy the work environment more so I will never discourage anyone from applying
good,I like chase as an company probably working in the bank will be fun and stuff but working CIB was draining. You quickly saw favoritism in the work place which got highly annoying.  As well as you being highly stressed to finish your work. With only being there for almost 5 hrs. Team leads were annoying bc you had one who tried mind play ppl and then you had one who was jus I felt did too much. and thought highly of their ego. The place is very dirty! Few ppl would break out with rashes and stuff. Management didn’t care. Looks like no one cleaned the dust and stuff for almost 5 Years! It just felt like high school or something all over. Too cliquey.
good,"Every day I help customer with their balance, troubleshoot computer, assist wit their online account and help the customer with their online bill pay and I also take management calls and escalated calls from customers , close accounts"
good,Decent work life balance. Business and technology units work as separate companies. Purely from a technology standpoint management is putting a lot of focus on cloud adoption and data consolidation strategies.
good,"Some staff are very accepting. However, others ar very cold and dismissive. Senior Management is accepting and considerate, However, once you are passed off to a line Manager they disappear. The issue with the manager that was assigned to my group (two people) was not someone who had managed staff previously. So guidance was limited not to mention understanding."
good,It was a great job to get me though college. IF you do not mind sitting for hours on end and answering a garage of calls for that entirety and micromanagement then you would not mind it.
good,The people I worked with were great friendly. the only down fall was the lack of work being it was a seasonal job. Had it been full time I would have loved to stay there
good,"A typical work day within TCP may include reviewing of your emails (which can be a lot at times) and actioning proposals that are assigned to you.  You my also be assigned to several reports that you will have to run on a daily or weekly basis.  Sometimes it may be hard to complete the daily tasks in 8 hours, so it's good not to waste a moment of the day."
good,"It is possible to have a successful career at JPMorgan Chase.  I have worked in three very different demographics as a Private Client Banker.  One location was excellent, with great management and teamwork.  The second location was good and it was two minutes from my home.  I could walk to work in 10 minutes. However the manager of a prime location branch had no prior experience as a manger, and maybe 2 years in banking.  The third location was incredibly cutthroat, management let it fly and who ever came out on top, well that was okay with them, not taking into account how they got there.  The book of business was spread out among 7 bankers with some banker being ""handed"" a quite sizable ever growing book that had been initially groomed by a prior banker for 7-8 years.  These ""top' sellers were literally being fed business by fact of being at the right place at the right time i.e.: when an experienced banker with a large book left."
good,Good place to work and good pay.Free lunch coupons and transportation . Transportation s good. Work life balance is not that great. Leave policies are good
good,Call center environment was Extremely stressful. Dont really recommend it unless its already something you love to do. Management was a little flaky. In training he would follow us to the bathrooms to make sure thats where we really went. A group did complain and it stopped. So many stories I have but the good thing is JP Morgam is everywhere. You could get the job and transfer to another state. Only good thing I can say. Lunches were getting stolen from fridges. Benefits were high also
good,"I loved getting 4 weeks vacation while most banks offer 2 weeks minimum. The people i worked with were awesome except management. Work/life balance was awful, management wanted you to breathe and live Chase at work and outside of work. You have no identity but the number provided to you."
good,"If you are a never say die person who can grab responsibilities and run with them, then you will be successful here.  If you require training in the door your are probably going to have a hard time."
good,Worked at JPMC for a little over a year as a documentation analyst reviewing auto loan documents in order to approve contracts. Entry level position with a low yearly salary. They offered overtime but rarely. Overall the position was not terrible but there was little room for advancement.
good,"Productive and sometimes and at times activities for employees."
good,Ok place to work....  good benefits... pay so-so... the CEO seems very sincere... you don’t have job security like you used to large companies and this is no different.
good,"Work in High tech, structured office, in a fast paced environment. Self-manage, interprets requests and perform duties with little management intervention."
good,"My coworkers and managers were friendly and helpful, giving enough space to understand and deliver the job on time."
good,"Not enough staff to get what you have to accomplish done. Not enough pay for the stress you deal with day to day. Being the only teller currently & not being able to take time off due to the company nor hiring people quickly enough due to ""too many employees in market"""
good,"Overall, Its a very good to work.  There are opportunities for advancement, however you have to know the hiring manager to be considered for the position.  Salary and benefits were great."
good,Greet customers as they come in to the bank. Open accounts and cross sell. Very sales driven atmosphere. Some cash handling. Most have a upbeat and personable attitude.
good,"Enjoyable place to work most days, with a generally relaxed atmosphere. There were too many rules being at a big bank that you had to adhere to, but that is part of the deal there."
good,Fast paced. Poor work/life balance. They didn't seem to value experience as much as they did wanting to get the least expensive employee. As a result incompetence was rampant
good,"Good work/life balance and flexibility, benefits could be better and management is not extremely professional. Good internal career moving and huge company"
good,The job in general was good. There was not satisfactory cross training on other areas in which we were required to assist. Managers seemed to spend more time in meetings than assisting the team.
good,"Working Chase's retail banking industry is very competitive and inconsistent when it comes to communication with employee engagement, There is a lack of enthusiasm within as technological  changes consistently impact lower level representatives."
good,Only running transactions. You have to learn about products that you're literally not even allowed to talk about at all. Their one year commitments for everything hinder career advancement.
good,The salary is not competitive to other banks. I found it difficult to advance within the company. Many of the work facilities have cafeterias which is convenient for employees.
good,"Always a fast pace environment, busy with customers. Everyday had something new. Great team. hardest part can be sometimes balancing work with personal life"
good,Too many changes within the company and the pay isn’t balanced with the work done. Too much focus around client interaction but forgetting that employees are clients themselves
good,"Great company to work for but not much room for administrative advancement. Call center atmosphere "
good,My job at jp Morgan chase was as a maintenance. I used to keep the banks and ATMs clean for costumer. Even thought at the job i dint have any supervisor. At the office my supervisor was a respectful person. I really enloy working there.
good,"It is a decent company to work, but need to be task executioner than a thinker. "
good,"A well rewarding place to work if you are willing to work hard.  If you are willing to give all to the organisation and forego some personal life, then the rewards are worthwhile."
good,They need help with there WFM group but other than that typical Call center job. Some times they wouldn't put the holidays in the system but not to bad other than that.
good,"Great company with opportunities for up ward mobility.  Senior management consistently communicate the vision for the organization but some how the message gets loss in translation.   The best part of my job was the team, we worked together to get the job done - consistently winning.  The hardest part was not having the needed resources to reward the team - salary increase"
good,its all about work and no time pass. learning is endless. management is non supportive. workplace facilities are good. the hardest part of the job is no time to breathe easy. breaks the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,A typical day of work was challenging with working with multiple sites. The systems  were often were not working properly but allowed people to think outside of the box to resolve meeting service needs for the customer. The workplace culture was diverse and fostered the ideas of many people with multiple perspectives. Your  experience with Management  varied as some managers are teachers and others may be micro managers. The most difficult part of the job was making certain that all operators on my staff were following guidelines without personal interpretation. The solution was on-going coaching. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people grow and create innovative ideas that improved our processes and systems.
good,I enjoyed the pace and environment.  Commuting to mid town New York from Stamford was enjoyable.  Great exposure to cutting edge projects and it felt wonderful to make meaningful contributions.
good,"JPMorgan Chase & Company is a good place to work for overall.  The hardest part of the job. was some of the management time, but as for and the work good need better training. The culture is good. Need more bonus and lease lay off."
good,"A typical day consist of preparation for client meetings  and presentation."
good,"You are expected to do a lot of extra work outside of your typical day to day responsibilities. We are rated not just on our team's performance, but also on how much we participate in recognition events and how many tasks we additionally take on. Our ratings seem to be subjective and attrition is volatile so our hands are tied as far as holding people accountable that may be impacting our performance. Overall I do not feel as if we had control over our performance due to it being so subjective on how much you seem to contribute vs actual performance and even then your performance can go drastically down due to those that we are told not to move forward with corrective action. I cannot recommend Chase as a place of employment at least not in the contact center environment unfortunately."
good,It was an ok place to be employed. They do not care much for their employees only that they are there and nothing more. The pay was good but the hours and the amount of overtime that was required was not a good work life balance.
good,The work environment in the department I worked in has become more and more toxic because of the call volume and senior management has demanded impossible targets which caused higher absenteeism rate month on month. The Employee Engagement should be prioritize and they should give incentive that focuses on improving the absenteeism rate.
good,"work from open to close with hour lunch"
good,"I do like the work environment, too many extra events that I'm not interested in. Easy work environment,, I learned how to work in an officer environment. Management is bias."
good,"After over 2 years, only a 25 cent raise. That's was with really good employee reviews.  Management was hit or miss. Relatively high turnover rate. Culture was really competitive and all about the sales. My first banking job and I learned so  much.I had lots of really good coworkers. But after working at other banking institutions where the culture was much more people oriented can't say I'd recommend to someone I really care about. I will say their systems, policies, and procedures are more efficient compared to some newer banks."
good,"The Salem office is closing, perhaps that has something to do with the mayhem. I understand the business needs, I accept that they have made the decision to close Salem, but I do not understand why they have abandon the Salem workers before the office is actually closed. Management seems to look the other way when the misguided people are being disrespectful, even at times seem to aid in this behavior by giving in to their every demand, even when its against policy and could put the company at risk. Mostly I am just saddened, this company has the potential to be great in every location, I just don't see that at this time."
good,work was OK when your systems actually worked when they did not you did side by sides with co-workers and the day would go by very slowly. I was injured and had to take a disability leave and was let go right after i got back
good,Competitive and Moderate Stress. Greater opportunities with Networking. Almost 10 years of experience in Mortgage and Risk and Controls. Career Mobility available with Networking.
good,"not much room for career development unless you know someone who can put in the good word for you, monthly compensation decreases annually. Other than that its a good job for someone who goes to school, normally managers work with your schedule"
good,"3rd shift data entry long term temporary employee via employment agency. Hours inconsistent, being sent home early several nights; never know when assignment will end."
good,"The atmosphere at J.P. Morgan Chase was a little stressful. Management required a lot of quotas. It didn't seem impossible to meet, but was somewhat intimidating."
good,"It was really a competitive job. At the same time, It was fun working for the company because It provides Training which empowers us more with our Current position. Not only that. It gives us the support to be an Edge to our own selves, which in a way help us improve day by day. "
good,Have to be on point with every single thing. Count your cash over and over. Be confident in the answers you provide to the customers. Set goals. Set example's.
good,"Environment is demanding but fair; fast paced and requires strong business acumen and strong project management fundamentals. One challenge is that there is a strong degree of management change over time, this requires a great deal of personable flexibility to adjust to changing management and objectives and can sometimes be a detriment to career development."
good,Typical day at work consisted of processing transactions and helping customers. The management at the local branch was excellent and extremely nice. The only downside of working there was the lack of opportunities locally for advancement saying within the company.
good,"JPM is a good place to work.  The heath benefit had high deductible.  Not very good with the internal posting.  If you are there for a long period of time and want to post to a high level of position, you will not be able to do so, you can only post to the some level as is"
good,"Company runs very slim. They just add more titles to your current roll without giving you any raises. Unfortunately, they eliminated the assistant manager position, which makes it hard for someone to get promoted to a branch manager."
good,culture there is a melting pot.  People from all cultures. People are all trying to do the best with whatever training they get. There is a lot of turnaround there I suppose just like any other company.
good,I have logged in over 4 years under Randstad Technologies as a Site Engineer. It is a good first IT job for anybody trying to get in the field and develop experience. The position deals more with hardware and cabling with light amounts of administrative work. The management are great. The workplace culture is also great. You learn a great deal about Data Center practices and procedures if your looking to expand your knowledge on the administrative side then you won't get much here. The work has a high demand for detail. It helps if you are proactive as well. The work/life balance can be poor if you are relying on this job as your main income and you have family. It does pay below the local market for the similar positions in my area. The environment is mostly relaxed.
good,Meet new people every day.Good job/life balance hardest part is working on commission. Great company care's about their employees. During my time with chase i have work with great managers.
good,good place to work. work long hours. management is helpful. pay is good. there is no enjoyment working here. will work very long hours. process of workflow is always changing with out notice.
good,Good Company for entry level. I have learned a lot about the banking industry. Good culture with endless effort to innovate. Its hard to move up the ladder.
good,"Standard underwriting production reviewing and approving mortgage loans. Culture was diverse. Management varied, some were great and some were not and the management turn over rate was high. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping home owners."
good,"Good to work in JP Morgan and Chase yearly bonus, good atmosphere , great people support , employee engagement, long working hours less salary, poor management support"
good,"Assist customers over the phone verifying fraud, claims for fraud, sending new debit cards and verifying transactions."
good,working in the bank on a daily basis can be challenging. I was a teller for the select window and also business window. I dealt with high Volume of cash daily. Helped clarify any customer concerns.
good,"A typical work day consist of making out bound calls and receiving inbound calls from customers in regards to their mortgage loans. Servicing mortgage loans by updating information, answering general questions in regards to escrow accounts, resolving customer complaints when possible, conducting financial interview for hardship programs,processing payments ect. I learned a great deal about programs and options that are available to home owners. Management was helpful when needed.The hardest part about the position was dealing with some of the irate customers however I maintained a polite and professional demeanor. The most enjoyable thing about the position was being able to educate and assist customers that were experiencing a hardship that we could potentially help"
good,Good place to work if you are a self starter & go-getter. Atmosphere is friendly but opportunities for growth are limited unless you know someone. Good place to start.
good,"Working for chase in the beginning was great fun, and professional. Had a great relationship with my manager. I learn how you to assist customers with mortgage assistance, collect on delinquent accounts."
good,"JPMorgan is a fast pace employment, wages can improve as well as management and employees, Security on the third floor is wonderful. majority of my employees are very kind and helpful. overall JPMorgan is okay to work for"
good,"QC Work load,Responsible for Scanning, processing of mail.	Perform client data entry per client specifications.	Operated automated mail sorting, extraction, or imaging equipment."
good,"Durante mi estadía en GWM, tuve la oportunidad de interactuar con colegas de todo el mundo. El salario era above average, ya que trabaje en NYC. La demanda de trabajo es alta, la oferta es poca y recae en pocos. Administración tenía el hábito de despedir a las espaldas, por lo cual género una constante incertidumbre laboral. Si no trabajabas más, podías ser despedido. Ambiente de trabajo interesante - administración intenta promover la diversidad y la cultura de sus empleados, pero su hipocresía era sobre sus intentos. Aprendí, pero siento que mi experiencia fue dañada por el poco cuidado de administración hacia sus empleados."
good,"A typical work day is 8-11 hours long. Learned to handle people well, management varies. The people you can work with either make or break the day. Vary from all ages. Hardest part of the job is dealing with hundreds of people throughout the day. Most enjoyable part is leaving. They move around people at any given time, without notice."
good,In search of more work experience in a corporate environment in order to further financial knowledge. I took on this temporary contract in order to help JPM Compliance department out of a back log. It was overall a good experience. Much knowledge was gaining about the securities business.
good,I learned a lot about banking with JPMorgan Chase.  I was able to interact with executive management on a regular basis.  This exposure allowed me to be looked at for positions of increasing responsibility.
good,"Have been working here for over 2 years and it has been a very fruitful time."
good,"lots of independent work "
good,This company offers great opportuities. There is not much more that i can say. Chase is a large company and it provides various options for growth and exp.
good,"Working Utilities was a very short and easy job. Stocking food in refrigerators and freezers, also stocking beverages inside the cooler areas. When orders came in for paper goods such as plates, and plastic forks they were stocked inside the dry areas. Some days ended up being long when having to wash dishes and place them to the right locations. Delivering food to different departments was also part of my job as well."
good,"Typical Day consist of do more with less mentality. "
good,"I felt in this position that I was just a number.  It wasn't like working with a group of people, you didn't even know most of your team as we were constantly taking back to back phone calls."
good,"There is no intellectual component to this job.  Sales driven.  Management does not listen to your concern or helps with issues.  Compensation is  below industry averages, but the bonus can make up for it."
good,"the job can be VERY hectic, the salary can be low but you can make money based on your commission... As a personal banker you will be doing teller work ... It's a great company but you feel like they expect wayyy too much from you for what you are getting paid."
good,"Your experience here depends on the managers and staff you work with. I worked with a few different branch managers and assistant branch managers. Some of them were great and some of them weren't. I worked in a branch where the other tellers were catty, rude, and seemed miserable with their lives. I just dealt with them because it was a part time job for me while I was going to college and I needed the money. I was able to enhance on my customer service and selling skills since I had to make referrals to bankers. I enjoyed working with the customers."
good,"Over the years of working for Chase there were many changes.  Some were for the good, some not but that is the same with all companies.  Overall a decent company to work for."
good,"Greats benefits, but extremely competitive, say no quota, but expected you to exceed it. You come in early, deal with customers all day, very fast paced at my location so time to breathe, always stayed late. Had great perks, but was stressful"
good,I've been with the company for nearly a decade (10 years in November 2017) and I am ready to take a leap and move into leadership. It seems that those who have the experience can move to other companies easier than moving internally.
good,A normal work day consisted of extreme focus and attention to detail. There was no room for errors. The goals were set pretty high to achieve. There were monthly trainings for the latest trends.
good,"My typical day at Chase centers mostly on data entry work, processing appraisal orders, making sure documents are in files so that the closing date of the home can be met. There are also meetings, on-line trainings and rotating tasks, to keep the staff fresh."
good,"As a bank, JPMorgan tends to stay within the realm of repetition. Nothing changes too often since most everything that has worked, has been working for decades. This stagnancy makes it tough to be a creative team player, but the people who work with you will make working worth it."
good,"On one hand, the team I worked with was great with few exceptions. Upper management was constantly changing however, creating a lot of disease. There was also stress with very heightened security measures that began to make things less comfortable for a work environment (no bringing in personal items, entering through full-frame turnstiles, etc.)."
good,"I would balance the vault, perform transactions for members, cross sell products, answer the phone. I was never fond of my managers. they tended to micro manage."
good,"Chase has really great benefits. With that being said, working in card services is just another call center job. It's repetitive and can be very stressful at times. You have to be very detail oriented and precise. Also, it's nonstop on the phones with little time for projects. Project time is also incredibly competitive amongst employees. The call center is open 24/7 and schedules frequently change which is absolutely terrible if you have a family, and especially if you are a single parent."
good,"good experience. generally speaking family friendly."
good,It is a good company to work for. Offers great pay for the industry standard. The life and work balance is not that bad. Management cares about their employees.
good,"Nice place to work with.Management is good, lots of learning, however, in terms of monetary front, it is very bad. looking forward to grow more in terms of career as well as money."
good,Overall great benefits but is a large corporation with lots of moving parts. The climate is ever-changing and they are always looking for ways to improve the employee and customer experience
good,"Good company to work for, however management in need of desperate overhaul, specific to the relationship management department."
good,I have been with Chase for 10 years. Our CEO  is the greatest at making money for the Stock Holders. The base pay sucks for Bankers but the incentive plane in great.
good,Great benefits and access to many clients.  Supportive in continued education.  Make sure they don't hire more bankers than needed or it will eat your commission (which changes annually). Licensing is only used as referral pay cannot talk to customers about much.  people leave due to pay or to promote themselves. if you want to be an FA you won't get promoted from within you have to have series 7 and some experience to have a chance.
good,"I had an illness that interfered with my duties so I had to resign."
good,"Culture still going through growing pains as Corporate and Investment bank struggle to act as one unit. "
good,A great place to work with a great team. Nice sponsored events. Some departments are better to work in than others. Nice office space and newly renovated.
good,"short staffed "
good,"The company could be a great company, if it took more stock in the employees and get rid of all those nasty and mean managers, VP's, supervisors, etc."
good,"Overall, the name carries weight so it is a great place to do an internship.  However, I felt that not much learning occurred and if you really want to gain the most technical skills and responsibilities then you should do full-time at a smaller shop."
good,"Nice place to gain lot of business knowledge, Managers are really nice, and the business Analyst, are much more patience to provide the requirements"
good,"Color within the lines and you will do great, no room for free thought or ideas.  What they say they want us to do and what we are asked to do are two different things and the base pay is the worst in the industry."
good,"Me gusto trabajar en J.P. Morgan, pero no tenian mucha flexibilidad. Tenia un horario laboral complicado que al principio no me afectaba pero despues tuvo repercusiones en mi vida personal. Hay muy Buena gente y Buenos compañeros. Aprendes muchisimo y tenes la posibilidad de hacer trainings para capacitarte constantemente."
good,"Although there is no job security, it's a place one can learn a lot.  Diverse amicable work force and a nice work environment.  I would recommend this company."
good,Working for Chase was a great experience but I hated the sales. Although at the time they were not very demanding. I had an amazing manager who cared about his employees alot and made the job a lot easier
good,"Want to advance more, broaden my skills and experience, and advance in  compensation status. In Current position 5 years. No wide range for advancement."
good,Chase does give us ice breakers before we start a meeting. They do give us free lunches. They recently started to give everyone in the company 3 weeks of vacation when you start with the company. This new incentive does beat all the banks.
good,Decent place to start out at. Low pay compared to industry standard. No work life balance. Excellent benefits. Covered parking is a plus in the winter.
good,"•	Reconcile mortgage accounts default action, compliance with all state and federal laws, investor guidelines i.e. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and VA Reconcile or note and report discrepancies found in records."
good,I want to work at a place I feel like I could grow and go to work every day and feel like Im important. Theres issues with management and understaffed
good,"During my last 5 years with Chase, I had 6 different managers due to the constant reorganization of executive positions. Each new executive would undo the previous changes and create new ones that made work more difficult to complete and not easier."
good,Chase has a lot of room for improvement. The management is terrible and the communication on the floor was horrible. They never took employees off the phone for coaching so they could learn how from there mistakes.
good,"Company is changing to a more ""Micro-Managed"" approach (which is TERRIBLE). Adherence must be met regardless if being on the phone.Management is TERRIBLE. You can be laid of ANYTIME!!"
good,"good foot in the door not really much room for vertical employment , however alot of overtime if desired, A regular day would consist of taking 50 60 calls of dissatisfied customers"
good,"Typical day: We could always expect their technology to stall and slow us down, in case if we were not already (or even if we were) behind on our work.  There is almost no CQ done for their technology, and if ""the green light"" lights up when the technicians turn it on, then they assume that it works (unless if WE are messing up)."
good,"I had a great time working with this company. I believe that there are moments when the senior management were more concerned with results for the stock holders and less concerned with the overall happiness of the employees. "
good,"Great company in terms of association, however I don't believe that in the position as a part time teller I was given any thought or consideration for growth. It was much of my belief that regardless of my previous experience in Customer Service I was not sufficiently utilized or rated. As for benefits, they were zero. I do think the Managers could do better with leadership skills."
good,"A lot to learn in a short period, unfortunately I came in during very busy period so training was difficult. It was a great company to work for. I truly enjoyed my position."
good,great place to work but as a contractor no job security or advancement. as your not suited and booted you are treated differently and do not reap any benifits of working for such an amazing company.
good,"I am a Senior credit analyst and the job itself takes some time "
good,"Long hours worked lunch, breaks and weekends."
good,"constant change, constant change on a daily basis. It has a high turnover rate and no job security.  Many people who are in management and upper level positions did not know any job abilities but were put into place by who you know."
good,"Up-to-date on new policies and procedures in the banking world. Dealing with foreign currency's, opening new customer relations, absolute exciting environment."
good,"Working at Chase was a great experience to learn about finances, as well as to make enough funds to be able to pay the bills. Work days were typical 8:30 to 6:30 shifts, depending on the amount of hours that the bank allowed you to have. The climate was wonderful, I enjoyed all my coworkers and my manager was a very nice individuasl."
good,"The company is an ocean and and too many people joining in leaving out very soon. "
good,"Various trainings for employees development includes communication, presentation skills and many more. That also included employees personal life development also."
good,I thought this company would be a place to retire from until I was employed and realize that this company wasn't as flexible and family oriented as they claimed to be.
good,"fast paced environment requiring long hours"
good,Pays well; slow; inefficient. Best part of the job is working for a leading US bank. Culture varies depending on where in the bank you are working.
good,"Managers as well as other employees tend to be late. An investments related position is advertised but you find yourself stuck mainly with retail services. Position does get you licensed though which is great. Series 6, 63, and group 1."
good,"Smooth, easygoing, relaxed workplace. Not cluttered or over paced stretches in the office. Definitely the best co-workers I've had. The hardest part would have to keeping myself focused those last couple hours with a stack of documents for a case I don't wanna finish."
good,"Constantly changing, no room to grow you must stay in your position forever before you get noticed. Pay raise are not great. This job is for someone getting out of high school looking for work."
good,A good stepping stone . difficult to handle with time management . Must work around their schedule. Nice place to work at.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping every day customers with their banking needs. I love learning the new banking technology such as the eATMs.
good,A typical day of work consisted of problem solving. While employed there I learned how to think outside the box. Management was always available to provide support and guidance when unusual situations arose. Coworkers were long-term and knowledgeable employees of the company. The hardest part of the job was that the shared amount of work wasn't always equal among coworkers. The most enjoyable part was being able to work in different areas within the company.
good,I thoroughly enjoy my every day interaction with my staff and our customers. Helping them meet their goals is the best part of what I do.
good,"The SQA role is an Assistant Management role within the Quality department of the Chase Contact Center in Houston, TX. The work environment is great because I get to help manage a productive and talented staff. I assist the Quality Manager with: Daily, Weekly, Monthly Production assignments,reports, and updates. Coach, develop, and support the staff to help them produce excellent quality reviews for the Operations area and to do their jobs better on a daily basis. I provided weekly and monthly result reports to the Operations area with recommendations for improvement. I meet with the Operations and Training departments with common goal of improving the customer's experience at Chase."
good,"Regular job, work branch hours. If you are not a super star or have a buddy in upper management it is very hard to move up based on own merit. Overall, the company is ok moving towards innovation."
good,Not so good work-life-balance. Good salary and benefits.Bad politics in some area of line of business. Reputable company
good,JPMorgan Chase is a good place to work.  The team I worked on was fantastic.  Our team was a very high producing team.  Originally we were using waterfall method of delivery.  Then our team was chosen to transform to Agile method of delivery.  This was an amazing experience.
good,"This is a great company to start a career, but it is very hard to advance a career here, unless you drink the ""kool-aid"". "
good,"7 am to 7 pm.  Double/triple/quadruple booked for meetings. Crisis of the day focus. Working culture par for course on the street, somewhat better morale and sense of team spirit, compensating for and perhaps caused by frequency of crisis mode."
good,"Great place to learn and grow, with fantastic trainers and managers. Company is very numbers oriented. Has been going through many changes within the past year. Co-workers are helpful and provide guidance. The toughest part was calling customers and creating them into opportunities. After a while it becomes much easier. Best part is helping customers and putting a smile on their face."
good,"When began working at the bank it was a regional bank that was then acquired by a national bank and finally bought by an international bank. Due to the longevity of tenure the possibilities for advancement were extremely limited without relocating which presented a problem having an elderly parent here in town, This virtually permanently stagnated advancement possibilities. In conjunction with that the pay scale was at the low end and unattractive. However the work environment was fair and management was considerate regarding personal lives."
good,"Supervised 30-45 Employees"
good,No chance of advancement in the department. No variety or any challenges for work either. Was a job for someone who preferred to be challenged and wanted growing opportunities.
good,"As a personal banker, i was told to open accounts, be friendly and help my customers as much as possible. I did not like that all of a sudden i couldnt do part of my job."
good,My Typical day at chase was keeping track of and managing dozens of reports.  I have been able to polish and development my managing skills.  The hardest part of working at chase was finding a balance of managing my staff to the level of micro management that was expected.
good,Immediate management very supportive but high pressure sales environment took precedence over customer experience
good,"The benefits are great but the ability to advance is convoluted. "
good,"Good Company till significant Management changes in the AML/BSA space over last 3-4 years. Provided opportunities in the past but new management regime brought there own team members.  Salary was not fair with the workload,"
good,"Management takes effort to keep employee satisfied."
good,"Chase has good benefits for both part-time and full-time employees. The retail branches revolve around sales-orientation. Depending on your manager and how much you speak up, you are able to move up within retail banking in a fair amount of time. The atmosphere in branches can be stressful because employees are stretched thin, due to branches being expected to run on a skeleton crew. I appreciated being able to develop my skills and wearing many hats."
good,Must be able to multi-task and work independently as internal resources are strong. Will face a wide variety of customer service requests and the focus is always on growing balances and revenue.
good,Felt appreciated and I liked the fact that management acknowledged your hard work; also I enjoyed working with everyone on my team.
good,Very fun and customer service based environment. Main focus is the customer which I highly respect and value. Everyone is very helpful and provides the correct amount of help when needed.
good,Worked at Chase for almost 9 years. The early years in development I was with a good team but that team was disbanded and we were disbursed to other teams. The new team was in retail financial services which turned about to be a stressful area.
good,"call center environment"
good,I worked in a call center taking inbound calls...monotonous and boring.  Turnover was high.  Not much room for advancement unless you want to get into management.
good,"It is very hard to move up at Chase, its all about who you know.... Also you really need a get your degree, education is key. Even if you have vaild work experience, you need a degree to move up."
good,very strict you must be on your toes and kiss peoples behind.  typical corporate america.  not a lot of adavncement opportunity.
good,My particular department's primary focuses surrounded being audit ready and doing the right thing for the customer. Not a whole lot variation from that.
good,It is very sporadically paced. Challenging management and unnecessary actions are prominent. Light growth abilities are also a feature. Possible long relationships established.
good,In was a interesting job. Back to back calls. Deal with sometimes angry customers but most of all the job was very rewarding.
good,Good Company to work for. Super culture. Great diversity inclusion.Transparent and close knit. A brand name to reckon with.
good,A typical day at work consisted of customers to efficiently complete their transactions. I learned a lot while working at my job. One important factor I took away is the bond you form with people because it was not just the workers I came to be close with but many of the customers felt like they were family. My management just like I am with a lot of places had its ups and downs. I had a professional relationship with them and that is all I can basically say. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with grouchy customers that just won't have it with the policies and not even wanting to sit an talk to a manager to see how else they can help them. The most enjoyable part was the family the branch built together.
good,"Over time, you are added responsibilities but not compensated. In 5 years i've received a 1% pay increase. Employees are leaving, and not being replaced."
good,"Steady work flow, customer service , manage large amounts of currency . Helping customers above and beyond with deposit , withdrawals, money orders, cashiers checks, foreign currency."
good,"If you enjoy working with high-dollar customers, this is the place for you.  Maneuver yourself under the right person, and you'll go far."
good,"Over worked and under paid, they don't value their employees. Great medical benefits, but the people who generate the most revenue for the company are the people that get paid the least."
good,"Work pressure is more, needs to spend more hours all the time."
good,The benefits that you receive with this company are great but as in any corporate environment you are just a number and you have to work very hard to move anywhere in the company.  If you are looking for a company that allows you to have a life outside of work this is a great company.  You will always work one weekend day and there are multiple shifts available for all lifestyles.
good,"A good initial training ground, to get you prepared for the real world. Just don't stay in a department too long. Things can be from one extreme to the next and your tenure, nor loyalty is appreciated. So don't think it buys you any type of reassurance."
good,The firm is a highly demanding and requires delivery within specific time limits. This makes it fairly challenging and exciting.
good,"Loved working in my local office, people were great, made coming into work everyday enjoyable.healthplan was amazing with extra benefits."
good,The management made this experience very difficult. Getting sales is cut throat. It can get very depressing working with money. Sales can be tough to achieve.
good,"Identifying any problem with Military loans document all mail and checks to a spreadsheet,mail all file to Iron Mountain."
good,After 12 years with this company I have seen too many management changes. New plans implemented without clear goals for the employees.
good,"your manager has control over everything. your monthly incentives, your schedule, and your lunch breaks. A Normal routine for this position is answering customers' questions about their accounts and helping them with maintenance and services."
good,The benefits are great. The communication between employees and management are not so good. There are many things they fail to mention that hurt employees overall performance. The breaks are short and don't really have time to gather yourself before next call. The experience i have gained working with chase in all areas has been overall good for me.
good,There are no referral quotas which are nice but the hourly pay is subpar and you get a bunch of empty and broken promises about advancement
good,I learned a lot working at this company. I started as a Branch Manager Trainee with the New Build District in South Florida. I helped assist teams with all the processes of opening a new banking center as well as trained bankers and managers on how to effectively prospect clients to acquire new relationships.
good,"Long hours, compensation below market level, low morale."
good,"It's really cool and  good platform with management. I am gained lot of things when I went thorough work. I am proud of myself that, I had good team and lead."
good,The typical day at work will involve with the tasks being completed and then looking for new opportunities. The firm has a good learning environments and also provides a way to do multi-tasking in most of the project assignments.
good,"I learned various aspects of banking and teambuilding, Very structured in how to interact with other departments, very associate oriented"
good,"Overall, JPM Chase is a good bank to work for on the retail side if you are straight out of college. Compensation is changed every year, so reaching commission goals becomes more difficult as the plans are constantly changing. Management doesn't always encourage career advancement, which doesn't make for the most ideal work environment if you are starting out in your career and hoping to grow with the company."
good,"Globalement passable"
good,"JPMorgan Chase offers a great benefit package including lots of vacation time. However, the environment is very focused on working long and busy hours."
good,"No growth at all. Stagnation is the biggest issue. Average salary as per industry standards."
good,"A decent place to work.  Great benefits with plethora of opportunities for training and mobility."
good,"When we merged with CHASE it all stopped, Jamie Dimon cut everything, raises were laughable to be an exceptional and get 1.85% is disgusting Bit the board approved a 70% pay raise for Jamie.  And we kept doing wrong under his leadership and had to keep paying HUGE fines no matter to him, his solution close down sites and lay off people.  My entire floor lost their job on 8.29.14 13 people in my group did too only our jobs went to the over seas.  Now I am a 48 year old woman who made a great salary who cant find work because when potential employers see my ending salary they laugh. I can't start over making under 40,000 a year and while that might see, like a fortune to some people to me its just surviving  I don't live above me means I own a modest 80k house drive a 2002 Saturn which is paid for and have one credit card and 6k in medical bills.  I wish I could speak more positively for CHASE but as long as Jamie Dimon is in charge and continues to get huge pay raises and stock options all while getting in trouble and paying fines and then laying off good people to offset the cost never will I be happy with chase"
good,"It's a versatile environment, constantly upbeat. They try to show they are employee-centric. The policies in regards to leave is excellent and the medical benefits it provides. A very professional company overall however when it comes to growth the management is indecisive whether to give it to someone who aspires and has the ability to do it or the person who they are fond of and we know who gets it then."
good,"Working with JPMorgan Chase was a good life experience, learned a lot, and are great at training for any position. Management pays little attention to my work and did not appreciate the hard work in both quality and quantity I put out. They told me a lot of lies of how secure my job was even when I was willing to relocate at the right price, but did nothing to help. Tried to apply from within but got no help from management."
good,you do the same thing everyday when you come into work which is fine but there is not room for advancement and there was a lot of in the office politics
good,"The job itself is excellent.  I enjoy the work and stay busy and challenged.  I have learned a good deal and been given many responsibilities.  The only problem is with management, which tends to be unorganized and not well run.  Managers show little appreciation and respect for employees."
good,"Typical day is attending meetings, resolving day to day issues, producing reports, writing requirements and testing system changes. "
good,"Take the pay while you can, but don't count on tomorrow. Like most Large companies they care about the stock price more than people."
good,Chase expects their employees to be perfect in every aspect of their jobs and gives little time for family emergencies or personal illnesses.
good,"J.P. Morgan is the preeminent and largest bank in the United States. However, the management and the culture is somewhat toxic. There is talk of people development but not much of it actually takes place. The pay overall is good especially coming from another financial institution but the increase in yearly salary is very minimal."
good,"A typical day at work was promoting, selling and referring financial products and services."
good,"Make phone calls to prospect existing clients on new ""special offers""."
good,"Good to work. Nice process followed."
good,"I understand that the branch model has to adapt with technology. With this change, staffing of branches has to get streamlined. But with staffing changes, there must be some adjustments to expectations as well. It's truly challenging to meet the same expectations with reduced resources."
good,Team environment everyone helps each other.our main goals is our customers
good,Job security usually translates to a high hurdle to get canned which typically leads to lower quality work.  There are a lot of smart people who work here but the company can probably operate with much leaner staff if they change the culture a bit.  This also leads to performers being frustrated and moving on.
good,"This is a good place to work and learn starting off my professional development; however, you definitely have to know the right people to truly get to where you want to go. On that note, it is really easy to network to the necessary level if you take the time."
good,"The overall company is ok, but it's really all about who you know to move up in the company.  My position requires sooo much work with Teller pay. Assistant Manager duties but severely underpaid.  But the  other employees are fun to work. But in my experience, it's a very stagnant job."
good,In loss mitigation the work is ever changing. You have to be willing to thrive in a constant changing environment it very little notice.
good,Very supportive of mobility and opportunity to improve and develop a career. Co-workers are great and life work balance is good.
good,Good company with a lot of exposure. learnt many new things.
good,"Fun enviroment"
good,Opportunity to meet and network with other associates in the industry
good,"A typical day for me consists of sorting e-mail faxes to be processed, blocking or unblocking ATM accounts, and/or assisting with other tasks, if needed. When I'm not busy, I look for classes to take on JPMC's Training Central. Taking these classes helps my internal and external knowledge of finanical banking systems. Sadly, management usually doesn't say anything to me, unless I make a mistake. Management also has a tendency to play favoritism, in my honest opinion. They often don't speak to employees. Most of my co-workers are usually stressed, and often are rude to other co-workers. Not all of them are like that, but it seems to be the culture of this workplace. I'd have to say that dealing with the job culture and politics that come along with it is the hardest part of maintaining my happiness here. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have a job to pay my rent and bills monthly."
good,"It has been a good experience so far"
good,Worked in the Global Wealth Management practice.  Day to day activities included working closes with cross functional teams to ensure project deliverables were being met in a timely manner.
good,"call center, not really any room for advancement out of the call center and they don't want you to leave either. Not an exciting job, but if you don't mind taking phone calls all day and telling people click here click here, it compensates nicely and isn't very high stress."
good,"As with any large company, politics often got in the way of doing your job well. So much movement and job change made it difficult for clients to really know who they were working with from day to day making relationships harder to build."
good,Rumored to have more responsibilities in job role for pay versus similar companies. Good culture. Great resume piece.
good,"Review customer loan information"
good,"The weeks, months, quarters, and year are very regimented, as one would imagine working for a financial institution. "
good,"JP Morgan Chase controls 53% of all US assets. It boast of a workforce of over a quarter million people. With that being said, it is also a difficult place to find a voice of your own or to feel as if your individual contributions matter to the company as a whole."
good,Good Job but dose not allow any carrier development if a teller.
good,"I thought it would be different...and for awhile it was.  but I was literally thrown under the bus so my manager could save his behind."
good,It is a decent place to work.  I had been with the firm for 17 years and would recommend others to explore opportunities if it fits their interests. .
good,"Although there have been many nerve wrecking deadlines and pressure filled days, I have a great group of people to work with and can call my ""team""."
good,was a sponsored athlet under this belt...i have competed in the company event and was always a great pleasure racing at JP Morgan
good,"Typical day at work begins with log ins to systems, you need to be on time as there is about a 7 minute window to get logged in then your immediately synced into the threshold of calls. Good or bad calls depends on how well you are in handling customers. If you have better social skills than others then your looking at busier flow. Picking up the systems turned out to be much easier than expected, however there are the times for unnecessary changes for awhile then it'll go back to normal BAU. The corporate environment though is really beneficial as it gives you more of a taste of the business world in general. Dress attire to actions is all paid attention to as presentation is a major factor into your everyday activity. Management can sometimes be inconsistent depending on your department. Most management is well rounded and keen on information to help you better yourself, however the ladder to climb may not always be fully looked into if you catch my drift. The promoting portion is what I'm referring to. In my experience in the FHL department, it wasn't about how well you did your job, it was more along the lines of how fast you did your job. The hardest part of it all was having to ask for assistance on situations and the management either able to help you if your lucky or refer you to another person. In my eyes development was definitely needed there. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get to know the employees around you, taking time inbetween calls or on breaks meeting the new people, learning their stories, and sharing information about tips and tricks"
good,Need better management training structures in place. People have no filter on what they say.......
good,"I applied at Chase in hopes of getting my ""foot in the door"" and then doing something with my degree. I worked in 3 depts. and all were call center based (the 2nd job is nothing to mention).  I started 2009 and tried to get off the phones, but it was very hard and such a huge company. For some people they luckd out & movd in2 a role/job they liked, but for others like me it didn't come soon enough.  The first job I entered at Chase was in collections and it was challenging. in that dept. they would sometimes do job postings thru a program called JEP roles. These are jobs you can apply for &are automatically set up for 1 yr. in the role so you learn something different/new. The problem is I had friends that entered in2 the program (have their degrees) and Chase just keeps extending the role past 1 yr. which means...they do this so they don't have to pay a degreed person and keep the pay minimal. So it has it's pros/cons. The last job I had was Branch Operation Support. This job supports all policies/procedures at the Branch Offices to all Branch employees making sure they stay in compliance. It is very fast paced, muliti-tasking, always changing in policy/procedure. In this dept. you cater to the Branch employees bcuz they are helping customers. The problem in this dept. is management wants you to answr a questn w/in 2 mins. and you have to keep going back to your Banker to let them know you are still researching info.  Well while u are doing this you are trying to reach out to a senior co-workr for help thru a chat room which sux bcuz you sometimes don't get an answer there."
good,"Daily tasks included setting investment, mortgage and personal banking appointments."
good,Everyday we had to meet a quota on filing and researching. It was fun helping others with their job.
good,"Great way to work your way up."
good,There are tremendous opportunities to learn and grow skills.
good,very fast paced and all about chase. if its not chase its not important.
good,"Solid option for a day job.  A typical day begins with a team meeting prior to doors opening.  Typically heavier on walk-in customers on Mondays and Fridays with lighter foot traffic in the middle of the week and on Saturdays.  Management really depends on who is in charge, I've had great managers and terrible ones depending on who's assigned to what position.  Co-workers vary from excellent to annoying, but everyone is deeply professional and handles customers well.  No matter how the day goes, you can check your work at the door by 6:30pm and spend your evenings however you would like."
good,The compensation opportunities changed quickly within the short amount of time I was employed. Management was professional.
good,"I worked with various VP's to setup meetings, processes and conference calls for all leaders in the organization supporting the sales roles in the Southeast."
good,For a bank it was a fun place to work. But the bottom dollar was more important than anything.
good,"At JPMorgan Chase, a typical day starts with a meeting in which the day's goals , expectations and new announcements are discussed. The Management team is there to lead you and not to micro-manage you. The hardest part of the job is meeting the sales goals because usually they are very high and impossible to reach."
good,"Due to the competition, the bank outsources a lot of works to inexperienced offshore resources. A typical US day starts with taking over unfinished offshore tasks.  In most cases, these unfinished tasks were handed over to them from US the night before.  They were either untouched or worsened by offshore."
good,"In general, Chase bank is a good company as a whole. Many changes have occurred within the company, causing the work environment to change. Management does not stress employees on their referrals. However, of course all employees should always put their best foot forward and try to build new relationships with customers to hopefully bring in new business to the company. The one downfall and the only part I did not like about Chase is the pay. Everyday employees are facing multiple challenges yet they are not getting paid very well at all."
good,"underwriting loans and signing off conditions."
good,"Stressful job, no work culture & management is bad."
good,"My typical day working for JP Morgan Chase would be to assist customers with their bank accounts and past due payments in collections. I've learned a lot about the company also about finances and how to manage my own money to not be like the customers who are past due on their account payments. I  enjoyed my co-workers, everyone worked as a team if i or someone else was in need of help with a customers questions or concerns. The hardest part of this job was nothing. I enjoy Collections and i've always had good feedback from customers. The most enjoyable part about working for JP Morgan chase would have to be the information i gain about the company, experience in banking as well as the overtime and benefits."
good,"- 8am-8pm hours"
good,"Work customer issues/concerns in a timely and reassuring manner."
good,"Not as fun to be there as in years past. Are trying to eliminate the Assistant Branch manager position. Compensation, health care has become very expensive with no increases in wages."
good,hired me permanent but eliminated my job after I successfully completed a critical project for them (10 months later)
good,"A typical day was preparing for training new hires and implementing them on my team. Developing and motivating the team I already have for sales and continued customer service. Managing staff issues with attendance, attrition, and projected sales."
good,Challenging workplace with the ability to multitask between projects. Self Motivated and a go getter will be successful.
good,"I love to work for Chase because I do believe in the vision that Mr. Dimon has for the company, however, I feel that middle management has changed my perspective on this.  There are a lot of broken processes and it seems to get lost in the mix once you escalate it to management for improvement. Also, I have had numerous experiences with managers that work from an intimidation factor as opposed to let's get it done.  They have the habit of making you feel like it is the employees against them.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coaching and managing the employees.  It is very satisfying to show someone that they can do more and to help them to achieve their goals in life."
good,I worked with some great people. Management could use some help as they do not help you excess up the corporate ladder.
good,"Taking inbound calls and educating our Participants on their 401k plans."
good,"Got Series 6, 63 and Life Insurance"
good,"It's a great way to get in touch and understand what it's like to work in the banking industry. You get a lot of chances to interact with customers. Proper cash handling and great customer service is a must in order to succeed. Not a hard job, but is dull and slow at times. There is incentive for persuading the customer to open accounts, apply for credit cards, and etc. However, other banks give better competitive pay. There are better jobs out there unless you plan to move up to a banker or other positions."
good,They think that they own you - that's why they pay you well.  Horrible company unless you can deal with being owned.
good,The company overall is okay if you know someone on the inside that can get you in. The work hours are good the pay is a little low for my taste and the raises are low. Like I said before if you know someone with a high ranking then its easy to get in and be promoted if not then you might be stuck in one position.
good,"Enjoyable and work with good people whom are driven. Time I spent there was enjoyable and commission pay was nice, not very competitive for the market though. I spent my time doing mortgages and JP Morgan is known more so for their investment banking rather than mortgage banking."
good,"Low job security, overall ok company to work for.  Their compensation and benefits are good.  Parking is expensive.  Management is flexible."
good,I had thought that there was security in the size of this company.  I was wrong.  There have been massive layoffs...
good,Reviewing loan documents and preparing files for Underwriting and ultimately closing.
good,"JP Morgan is an open plan office. There is no development or training, you are dropped in and expected to run as you hit the ground. This is good experience as it is a harsh environement to work in. Career prospects are difficult due to the sheer size of teams and jobs are competitive."
good,it was fun I get to know ad still friend with some of the co-workers I meet while temping.
good,"I was hired on at Chase as a supervisor, and on my hire date was advised that the supervisor position had been filled but they had another processor position I could take if interested. I accepted the job and was trained by co-workers. A typical day included review of a daily report, answering calls from Chase customers and their attorneys/title offices/government employees, sending correspondence, reviewing legal documents, inputting data into several Chase systems, reviewing staff members' work for accuracy, submitting reports to management and underwriting finalized transactions for quality. After six months I was promoted to team lead. The management at Chase is required to micro-manage every detail of staff members work. Our department was like a title company, and we had to input every minute of our days work in a tracking system called ""EPIC"". This included each minute we used to make a phone call, review a file, prepare a legal document, create a report, etc. This system is universal to Chase but is more suited to data entry and call center departments. Our department handled land transactions (title work) for the entire firm, meaning every Chase customer in the US. There were eight processors, one team lead, two mail intake personnel and one supervisor. At one point they moved half of the staff, including myself, to another department to process foreclosure documents. The foreclosure document department did not have the workload that demanded extra workers and during those three months that we were transferred there we spent much time not having work to do. Upon our"
good,"My experience at JP Morgan Chase was okay. My work/life balance was good. They were good with scheduling in my department. The compensation was above market average. BUT the benefits the first year were good and then they went extremely cheap. Very high dect. and dental not so good. Job security is okay, but they did some major layoffs over 4,000 at our site. The management starting out my first year was good. Moving forward a couple external hires and others from other departments at JP Morgan Chase. It went downhill from there. Co-worker's were great. Friendly people and hard workers. Raises were good, but the amount you pay for benefits takes a away from your compensation, vacation is above average."
good,A typical day at work is answer inbound calls from customers regarding their mortgage and creating payment histories on certian files to find out how delinquent borrowers are on their mortgage. I have learned how to better communicate with customers on the phone and have also learned how to make accurate payment histories. The hardest part of my job is the lack of communication between management and processors. The most enjoyable part of my job is the team of people I work with on a daliy basis.
good,"JP Morgan has good compensation and benefits. This company puts to much stress and pressure on its employees, you consistantly see employees taking leaves of absence do to the environment of Chase."
good,Great place to start career.  Plenty of learning tools and on-line classes.
good,"Being with JPMChase for 4 years, I have witnessed a lot. I have seen 90 people let go because their ""positions were no longer needed"", given 90 days notice and a severance package. About 1 month after the 90 days, they would hire 120 completely unqualified new people for a new project they would have. That makes absolutely no sense. None."
good,"Working at JPMorgan Chase has provided me with much experience, however working in the mortgage industry is a roller coaster of a ride with times being extremely busy or hardly busy at all. I enjoyed the fast pace of the environment when it was busy. I learned a lot of how the mortgage industry works and with my background in title I was able to understand even more."
good,"•	Perform Transaction Processing for Outgoing Domestic and International Wire Transfer."
good,"Typical financial firm -- 99% co-workers are great.  Management does have ""boys club"" mentality.   Very difficult to get promoted."
good,"I worked as a Teller and Customer Service Associate and was responsible for handling cash transactions and customer service.  I handled business transactions such as deposits, product recognition and Cross Referrals to Personal Bankers and Financial advisors to help meet the customer’s needs with accuracy and sincerity"
good,"Answer calls (call center) data entry, looking up customer information, contacting other banks for customers."
good,"Work was fine. Reviewing documentation for loans to be prepared accurately. End of the month is typically very busy. I learned a lot about title work and the loan process, including documents and federal guidelines and policy."
good,"At Chase, I was able to utilize a sophisticated, computerized underwriting system that streamlined some of the decision making support factors.  However, the non-traditional office hours and desking sharing duties, made quality loan analysis difficult at times.  Quality underwriting should not be hastily done, but should be performed in a manner that does not cost the company additional time and unnecessary expense."
good,I had been with JP Morgan Chase for 2 and half years. I have learned a lot of things where we had fun in running various committes. But the hardest part was salary was too low.
good,a typical day at work consisted of taking back to back phone calls where I assisted customers with their accounts. Management was hit or miss in the fact that there were great ones and ones who weren't. the best part of the job was the availability to pick up shifts.
good,Now a days I am working with Bankruptcy team my morning start by sorting the bankruptcy docoment and end by scanning the document so the images can see by legal person.
good,"A typical day at work consist of sale of products and services, servicing customers, obtaining new relationships, retaining existing relationship. I have learned how to deal with large amount of cash, customer issues and resolution of various problems. My current manager is one of the best managers I've had, and he would always coach our entire team, to always make us better at what we do. My co-workers are always very supportive and know how to work as a team. the hardest part of the job was following district managers demands, and constantly being reminded that if we don't produce, we will be replaced. I've enjoyed going to work everyday knowing that i will meet and help people with their financial need."
good,"A typical day is extremely busy as I manage email , phone calls, preparing files for closing. My day is extremely demanding as you are meeting the deadlines for borrowers to purchase a home.  My co workers are extremely helpful.  The hardest part of my job is when I have to communicate to a borrower they do not qualify for a loan.  The best part of my job is knowing my borrower refinanced to save money or bought a new home."
good,"If you went to a good college this would be a great opportunity right out of college but I wouldn't stay much longer than a year.  Management has a one track mind when it comes to promotions.  They only expect you to stay within the retail setting and they offer no assistance when it comes to leaving retail, even if you stay under the umbrella of JP Morgan Chase.  Sometimes they even get in the way of that."
good,Researched financial entries to determine accuracy and completeness of financial statements for pension funds. Management was never available always on conference calls and never able to assist with problems. Co-worker were great.Hardest part of job having to hunt down another team to provide you with info that was needed to complete your statements all while your supervisor is down your back about why its not done. 
good,"If you are all about work, you will enjoy working with JPMC. New technology and many holidays. Too many people in the building."
good,"Fraud Investigator III, Transitional Training assistant, Pilot Team, Peer Mentor,"
good,I would have to state Chase is an excellent company to work for if you just starting in the mortgage industry. I have learned many different practices and facets of the mortgage process that I can use in not only other work opportunites but in personal situations. 
good,this job was very stressful and not a fun place to work. my coworkers were always on short term disability because of stress
good,As a teller you do a lot of work with little to no recognition.
good,"I have learned to be assertive, aggressive, and to always take the initiative. The hardest part of the job is to be here for such a long time and the company rather hire externals than promote within which is why I rated the way I did. I like my job because I get to help people with the financial troubles and can explain to them how to avoid certain things in the future so those troubles don't arise again."
good,"a typical day at work (results may vary)- log onto computer, greet customers, open accounts, deal with customer money issues, deal with management over ethical sales issue (some people feel it's okay to sell certain products to customers), cold call customers, work with tellers from the line, pull customers from the lobby, smile, compete with coworkers for accounts, clean desk, get a daily performance review from management explaining minute to minute, rinse and repeat"
good,Attending at least 150 calls per day.
good,"Typical day at work - more work than hours in the day. Management looks at numbers and not task at hand. Best pay in area, insurance used to be a perk but no longer."
good,There is no shortage of work to go around. It is so big that you are very specialized. Once you get to a level of understanding of your job you may have a hard time learning more.
good,Great people to learn business. Long hours. Management not always available.
good,As a Project Coordinatior at Chase daily challenges came with the territory. Each project had multiple parts with several departments inside of each part.
good,A typical day involved reviewing customer complaint letters and writing responses to those complaints. I learned about government regulations. Management could be iffy. Some much better than others. My supervisor was great. Co-workers were friendly.
good,Manager of IT security projects
good,"Company culture does not support consultant support. It is an excellent environment to strengthen your skill set and maintain executive support within a very detailed and controlled environment. Expect any consultancy position to be short term as the company looks to hire from within. Colleagues move around a lot as the organization supports long term grooming and molding of individuals to maintain their culture of excellence. Young, energetic and enthusiastic individuals can expect long term employment if you fit the company culture. I am not a finance professional but a project professional, in this position I gained experience at a high level of project organization and control within a global organization that is highly regulated and intrinsically connected to technology. The hardest part of the job was not feeling like I was part of a project team. The PMO and lines of business functioned as silos."
good,JPMorgan Chase has been a great place to launch my career. I was able to build a solid network and learned many skills that will continue to help with my success.
good,Great friendly co-workers who are always willing to answer questions and lend a hand. There is always room to move up within the company. It just takes hard work and dedication.
good,"Was once a great place with good benefits. Still has the good benefits but if you get caught in the layoffs/reductions (mostly the so called older workers) they don't say it but we could all see, its not so great. Forget about working in WSS if you are new coming in unless you have a degree, doesn't matter your experience. They would prefer to train a YOUNG college grad who for the most part have no interest in a lot of those jobs; just getting something for their resume and will move on at various stages while the rest of us will have to keep training new people; also they don't always ""get it"" like mgmt think they will (because of the degree). Nothing against people with degrees just against the sudden attitude that you are an idiot. While I understand hiring new college grads, I don't understand not hiring unless you have a degree yet you have years of experience so basically past employees with experience in the work and culture NEED NOT APPLY!"
good,"The work invironment was good, though the nature of the project, OCC Article 7 (Independant Foreclosure Review), was unsettled and changed often. JPMorgan Chase trained us well as to our responsibilities and the policies and proceedures of JPMorgan Chase."
good,Good company to do well at - lots of benefits and perks but need to follow the corporate and political rules and be well accepted by manager and colleagues.
good,"good place to work , lots to learn if you work with a good team there are no problems..."
good,I usually enjoy my job when I'm into a friendly environment but this one is not the case since the environment is far from been friendly.
good,New products being tested and reviewed in beta.
good,"JP Morgan has helped get good experience in the area of Market Risk Reporting. Apart from learning risk management techniques and the commodities business working there has helped build the following skills: Communication, Leadership,time management and great partnership skills that you get with working from various teams. The one downside of the job was work-life balance since this was a demanding role."
good,* customer service
good,"Helped tellers meet referral goals. Conduct meetings regarding new policies and procedures. REview branch's cash goals and meet those requirements, follow guidelines according to branch policies to minimize errors and robberies."
good,This was a good first job experience for me to gain some knowledge of how the workplace functions.
good,"It is a large organization and with it comes bureaucratic layers. But if you can find the right group and a good manager, you can have a great experience."
good,"Chase is a great place to work, my counter parts made it enjoyable. Durning my time at Chase I've been in four positions. Can't complain, did enjoy the learning the other area of the mortgage business. I've learned the business of Short Sales, Collections, and Hafa."
good,- A typical work day is doing my work accurately and efficiently
good,The hardest part about the job is not being able to move up in the compny the way you might desire. the best part is the opportunity to be compensated
good,A typical day at Chase goes by well unless the managers are being put under pressure about customer service or any other nonsense they look to complain about. My co-workers are all down to earth and we work as a team. The hardest part of the job is learning the job at first and at times the customers. There are some customers that they their fustration out on us and all we can do is let them scream at us when its not our fault.
good,The banking industry is a fun and exciting industry to be apart of. I learned a lot during my time with JP Morgan and look to take my knowledge to help in my future sales endeavors.
good,This job has no stability i have been laid off two times. The production demands are very hard to meet do to the Procedures never being accurate.
good,"The company pays very well and offers great benefits, however there is a reason the salaries are much higher here than at other companies if one were in the same position."
good,"Banking wasn't for me, but if I had been more into it Chase would've been great to stay with. Lots of room for advancement, however too many politics, and if someone didn't care for you, no matter if you were a tenured employee, your job was likely to be gone."
good,"....started as management, as company didn't open as many stores as they predicted i was asked to step down from my original role which was not problem, however, 20000 pay cut didn't allowed me to stay as i have a family to support, overall ok place to work, bit boring to be honest."
good,"Good work environment , excellent training classes... Not too aggressive in job growth but good benefits and very understanding management"
good,I have been a Top performer for JP Morgan Chase however I have been unable to advance due to there own gain and upper management not wanting Processors to move over to the Underwriting side because they don't want to lose processors. I feel that it is my time to move forward with my career I don't see a future at Chase if they want to hold me back from advancing.
good,I enjoy the friendly staff and management. It has prepared me for the world of finance.
good,JPMChase is an extremely professional and productive workplace. I have learned a lot within the course of a year.
good,difficult to transfer from retail banking to investment banking
good,Great benifits its a call centertake 80 to 100 in bound calls
good,"I never had a typical day and I loved that. Between calling the courts, updating the case database, dealing with venders and helping my attorneys with case research I never got bored. And when I got the Archiving Team Lead position even though we were closing - I felt really appreciated. I may have not gotten a pay increase and it was in name only but the managing of the workflow for my staff and keeping them motivated even as people were let go each day gave me a real appreciation for the opportunity and the faith my managers had in my abilities to get the job done."
good,Great co workers however Management needs more work. Pressure and work late hours if sales goal not met.
good,Not a bad company to work for. They rarely give advancement.
good,Chase is a wonderful company to work for. Great benefits and there located all over the world which makes it very easy to transfer if needed. Chase has given me the opportunity to expierence new careers.The hardest part about the job was the lack of training and knowledge management provided. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team with my co-workers and having the opportunity to actually work in the field Chase origianlly sent me to school for
good,"no job security at all , some managment is rude an HR is too."
good,Peers are very friendly and it was a great experience. Management is well informed.
good,"helping customers with banking details, very overprotective management, enjoyed helping cusomers solve problems"
good,"Its a nice organization to work , you get a chance to learn new technologies and pursue certifications related to your work. Co-workers are very helpful and understanding.A challenging working atmosphere which teaches you efficient time management. The management team is strictly ok."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job happens to also be the hardest part of my job - offering our customers the best experience possible. I spent a lot of time coaching my team based on client feedback to be the best according to the customer. I have learned to have patience, every situation / customer / employee is different."
good,"good learning experience, no growth oppertunities. The role is just confined to what you to everyday no oppertunity to do something new. It gets really very monotonus at times."
good,"It's no big 4, but they will throw you into a top tier bank to get your feet wet. Most people go to a large corp or big 4 after a few years here."
good,"my review is based on a ""Personal Banker"" position at Chase. This position is perfect for the individual that likes pushy sales, doesn't mind your branch manager or district manager standing by your side as you're helping a client and being corrected and called out right in the middle of your client session, and that doesn't mind having a monthly quota that you must meet and that if you don't, you can be terminated."
good,Went to Chase after working for another major bank. Chase truly compensates employees for what they do. Pay for performance is accurate and pay is fantastic. Management though uses bully tactics. Many managers are in roles they do not understand and that affects all aspects of the branch environment.
good,"As far as how they compensate you, it is like any other sales job. If you perform, you can make good money. The hours are great and the work is not real difficult its just the stuff they preach and the stuff they ask you to do are polar opposites. They want you to do what you can to create a good customer experience but when a customer has an issue they want you to drop them and carry on with your day. Then they want you to cold call ALL DAY LONG and beg for acounts just to try and convince that chase is better than all other banks when all banks are really the same. There is not a whole lot of difference. If you want a job to do while you do part time school or while you are getting life together this fits great. If you want a career that is rewarding and your treated fairly amoung everyone, I would advise to keep looking"
good,Expansion brought bad attitudes in management and a complete disconect with the people that got them there.
good,"Chase is a good place to work for . There is a good work life balance , an opportunity for education and advancement and job satisfaction"
good,Benefits are Excellent but easy to get stuck in current role.  The company claims to be accepting of internal upward movement but dependent on how important you become in your role that may be an issue.
good,"It's hard to give a blanket review for a company so big because the quality of your work and the quality of work/life balance are really dependent on the manager or the organization that you are working under."
good,The work nature is quite stressful as the management there loves to micro management their staff and the workload is immense because of those pointless meeting.
good,"At this job everyone was friendly and very helpful, the best part of the job was getting motivation from management with different types of gifts and recognition."
good,"Sales oriented all the time, if you love sales your right place."
good,"In my 19 years of working at JPM Chase, I've learned that upper management doesn't really understand the needs of the job.  It's the first line managers and employees who understand what needs to be done, and who make the company successful.  Excellence is expected, and individual managers do help their employees succeed."
good,"Working at Chase was a great experience I could have, it was self-motivated and very productive. I also had the chance to explore different cultures every single day I go to work."
good,Decent opportunity for advancement and career mobility to a point. There is absolutely no transparency or consistency across the multiple lines of business with the company
good,"Huge Global company, so the policies are pretty rigid around pay increases and bonuses.  Make sure to negotiate to your full potential at the beginning,  After you are hired it will be hard to make up difference if you come in low.  Mid level managers need more people oriented training."
good,I have worked here for 11 years. Leadership is not great. Depends on the team you are on. A typical day of work varies. I learned what not to do from a leadership perspective.
good,Lots of politics meant that decision making was slow and took a big chunk out of delivery timelines otherwise a good working relationship between departments
good,Production environment during peak season for client. Data entry and mailroom duties. Often overtime was available and sometimes mandatory with prior notice.
good,Chase was a great company to work for . They were always will to help me grow and succeed. I enjoyed my time with this company and will recommend it to my friends and family.
good,I enjoyed my time here as you work in a friendly atmosphere with smart people.  The atmosphere is getting more challenging in the US as there is continued pressure to cut costs
good,"The culture changed so much. It was like they were showing us they didn't care. Pay & benefits were excellent. That's what made me stay. But I think pay was great b/c I was there when they did away with bonuses and got a great raise. Management doesn't care about employees concerns when it comes to work. its more like do it. We could be laid off. Unfortunately, though I loved the raise it made it hard to find comparable employment of the same field. I am not having to take a 10k+ pay cut for new employment if I were to stay in the same field. Great benefits though and time away. But a stressful place to work as far as the mortgage side. But its going down so it wont be much left soon."
good,"JPMorgan is a respectable company to work at. The work culture is satisfying. Overall, it has been a good experience. Employees do not have much visibility during the time big decisions get made, but that is true to any large corporation."
good,"Workplace culture is okay but really depends on your manager.  A lot of turnover and reorganizations, you can be in the same group for many years with different managers"
good,"Fast moving development environment like other big investment banks.  Many full timers work very long hours to meet the deadlines."
good,"It's an okay company as it is in-house support unlike others as third party. If money is your goal this company is perfect for you. Not advisable for career growth. Tools are incredibly outdated that they encourage you to ""trust"" even it fails bigtime. The processes are inconsistent as well. Mobility is okay but you got to wait for a chance. They promote work-life balance but not being too involved in site activities will be taken against your scorecard. Working environment is kinda toxic as it's a bank."
good,The hardest part of this job is there is not support system when questions arise therefore leaving you with a feeling you did not give your 100% to the customer.
good,With rates at a low currently we are busy and are seeking experienced underwriters to assist with the work load. I have learned a lot working for this company.
good,I worked temporarily at JP Morgan as a Clerk! We managed information for businesses and taxes for companies and also for people in general for the payments to be handled
good,"JP Morgan can be a great place to work if you have the right fit in a department you find interesting. Regardless of what department you are in, the work can be demanding more often than not."
good,"Everything was good until the LAY OFF happened, January 2018 - November 2018. Great benefits, the location was close to where I live. This company does a lot for their employees."
good,You will get lost in the overall big picture.  At Chase it requires a manager that truly cares about their staff in order to grow and or advance.  Some management only focus on their career but neglects their staff.
good,Working at Chase was very challenging I had to work with dual computers something I wasn't use to doing you had to listen to customers scream at you saying there  mort payment went up we had to explain to them that there mort didn't go up but there insurance or the taxes went up
good,Chase was very challenging I didn't like working with dual computers you were on the phone 8 hours a day explaining to customers why there payments went up but it was not there mort that went up it was there taxes and insurance
good,Ethically questionable referral practices. People who had been there for years were handed business but if you didn't keep up with their production you were penalized.
good,"JP Morgan's Private Bank offers strong financial products for clients. However, evaluating it as a place to work, I have to say that the analyst position has entirely turned into clerical work. There is absolutely no technical finance knowledge required to work as an Analyst here. They are hiring purely based on diversity and what will allow the company to win more organic clients (i.e. family ties of the new Analysts)."
good,Hard place to work and long hours. Management are too political and do not care about employees and more concerned about their reputation and not about work life balance.
good,This environment is very tense and not a joint group. Management did not part take in keeping the team informed and were not employee friendly. They micro manage the team.
good,"Enjoyable colleagues, productive work atmosphere. Easy to make new connections and good work-life balance. Can be difficult to move up or around the organization."
good,"This is a large company made up of lots of smaller teams. Many of said teams use antiquated business tools/applications to meet their business needs. The insurance isn’t that great, parking and requires a shuttle ride to and from the office adding about 20 minutes (one way) to the commute. The pay is not competitive, and it could be different to advance in tour career unless you are interested in bouncing from team to team"
good,"The hardest part of the job is the speed in which you need to take the call, assist the members needs, and offer great customer service. There were other jobs they required me to do without an increase in pay."
good,expect to complete the work assigned on a daily basis or as given to you. production based organization looking for results as most organizations do. no surprises
good,"JP Morgan Chase gave a lot of effort to a healthy job culture. However, they didn't display as much care I didn't feel to their contracted employees as they did to their permanent employees."
good,"Basic business environment, a lot of bureaucracy, typical corporate environment. Good benefits, good vacation, life insurance, benefits etc. Hiring a lot of Java developers."
good,The job was a great place for learning the proper way to ingauge in a customer service setting and provided great support from team leads in challenging situations
good,They do not disclose what future opportunities might look like for you at certain locations until you are locked in and stuck at that office. Puts some people at major disadvantage because they refuse to communicate how your location choice might paralyze your career.
good,I was part of a great team at the Tanasbourne location. The manager there is a great guy. I'd give him 5 stars. It's upper management that is 3 stars. They seem a bit disconnected from the day to day operations and don't accept input from the people running the day to day operations. Other than that it's an okay company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for J.P Morgan Chase while on Syracuse University's campus.  Unfortunately, the site closed down and many people had to look for jobs elsewhere.,"
good,"Overall it has been a good company to work for.  Many areas offer flexibility and work from home options.  Like most large corporations there is a lot of political maneuvering by middle management that goes against the good of the firm and adds unnecessary bureaucracy.  The lack of training for new managers have also contributed to a toxic environment in some departments. You also have to come to grips with constant layoffs living alongside thousands of job openings. These layoffs have nothing to do with job performance most of the time. They are just arbitrary decisions made by senior management. Everyone has a number and when the ball with your number gets selected it is time to post internally, or move on to an outside opportunity.  A good run in the same area with a good manager and good coworkers would be 2 years. Be prepared for many reorganizations and management changes!  Pay and paid time off is good enough to retain most employees. There is a saying that a person joins a company and leave their manager, and that would be a very true statement at JPMC."
good,It was an okay place to work it was very fast paced and sometimes short staff. The customers were great.The employees were very nuice people to work with.
good,"Like all companies, there is behavioral variety across the firm.  Upper management provides a strong solid vision and messaging of the expected culture, but middle and lower management does not always heed this. There is wide diversity from group to group in the execution and my recommendation to anyone joining the firm would be to learn about the area they are joining and its particular management/culture before coming onboard.  Work-life balance has become tougher and tougher in tech as they continue to trim areas and strive to ""do more with less...""  Also, work from home is frowned on by many of the tech areas."
good,"We would call the client to see if they still want to donate for the breast cancer awareness. And make sure that everything hadn't change before we send out anything,"
good,Pay was good but customers were hard to deal with. After awhile management and other departments were hard to deal with . nobody was on the same page.
good,"Hires some very talented, hardworking, intellectual individuals. Learned a lot about secured transactions, litigation, business and client relationships."
good,"The customer service officer (first level) role was in a fast paced demanding environment. Offered detailed daily account information to customers inquiring about payments, cycle dates, account management in a call centre environment."
good,"I started with the Complaints Resolution Unit as a stepping stone in order to move up to a more senior role with the Office of the President. I dealt with first level complaints, reiterated resolutions that had already be delivered to customers. The work environment was also fast paced and demanding. As my previous roles with the bank the hardest part of the job is to deliver negative resolutions to customer and is always a plus to deliver some good news as well!"
good,Tier one Investment Bank JP Morgan Chase bank. Good Bank to work for.Provide good benefits. Nothing to complain about.People are able to have a good balance life work balance if they have a good understanding manager.
good,"JP Morgan is a good company wit very bright individuals. The work/life balance needs some fixing as a typical work week can easily go over 50 hours, sometimes 60"
good,"JPMorgan is an excellent firm to work for. Unfortunately because of recent restructures they are committed to moving all non client facing employees out of New York to hubs in Texas , Columbus and Delaware."
good,"worked there 2 summer and hate ever hours. no freedom,always watched, and etc. The people there are nice but have their own agenda. Very little chance to move up in work space."
good,Micro manages. Lots of responsibility. Kept changing pay plan throughout the year. Fired people at the drop of a hat. Massive layoffs. Pay wasn’t as good as it could’ve been.
good,"come into work with set goals for the day, goals are met for the day, week, month etc. I learned about teamwork, management is involved in most day to day activities."
good,I have worked at Chase roughly 3 years now. After a year I earned a spot on a special project. After that I have not gotten even a 1st interview for other positions even though I had worked 2 years on a special project. Chase seems to like to get you into a position and keep you in that position. I say its a good company because they do hire good people however in my experience when I have gone to management about my career potential they seem uninterested in helping me.
good,"When I worked for Chemical Bank, we merged with JPMORGAN Chase.  Things now are alot different than back then.  I will say everything is totally automated and that is how the big bosses want it.  I loved being a banker and having people at my desk and customers sometimes preferred speaking to a person rather than a machine."
good,It was great in the beginning than you get moved around doing different jobs.  It is what it is and than you get laid off.  The lay off part was good they sent me home with pay for 90 days.
good,Awesome place to work great managers great benefits paid time off as soon as you start on the floor great training managers a awesome health benefits.
good,"learned comprehensive knowledge regarding sales accumen, operational proficiencies, credit analysis, loan origination, personal and business deposit products"
good,"Requirements, metrics, and procedures are changing constantly and makes you feel insecure but other than that great company. The hardest part of the job is keeping calm taking calls from angry upset customers"
good,was not to difficult till you got to the management side of the call center and the childish shenanigans the supervisors were getting in to between office affairs and favoritism shown between some management and staff and if you make waves you get thrown to the wolfs and simple is not acceptable after
good,"There is a strong sense of professionalism, but it is an outdated definition that is used in the company's philosophy. They believe that the providing an excellent customer experience as well as being great at your job is the pinnacle of performance, based on a very unrefined grading system running largely on customer reviews. You dont really matter to corporate, because they will always favor the customers over their own."
good,The overall process took more than a month. Once i was in didnt know that the position was a sales job. It very aggressive with sales.  If U have previous experiences as a salesman this is the job for u. If not stay away will do nothing but stress u pit!
good,"Stressful most of the time at work."
good,"I enjoy the day to day interaction I have with the team but also being able to work with the customers. Some customers are more difficult than others, but it’s taught me so much on how to build communication skills with customers and being able to use them in my everyday life."
good,The customers are really paramount to the company producing well.  There is a good sense of team-orientation when working within this financial institution.
good,Not comfortable working in JP Morgan Accounting.  No accurate training been encountered and not been trained in a complete Accounting procedure and principles for 3 months contract.
good,"J.P. Morgan & Co. is a commercial and investment banking institution founded by J. P. Morgan in 1871. The company was a predecessor of three of the largest banking institutions in the world, JPMorgan Chase & Morgan Stanley"
good,You get to learn how to be a self starter and innovative. The culture at times is pressure filled. Much fails to be communicated to the appropriate counterparts . Management changes often.
good,They place is great to work at if you can handle working with short notice schedule. They change and alter the schedule alot. The pros is there is alot if room to grow and it seems they push advancement alot.
good,"I worked here for a years and its been good. I don't like that they try to develop internally, but take a lot of people from other banks. Good starting pay, and good benefits. Hours can be good, if you don't have a second job because you have to work a minimum of 20 hours at the entry level role. They do, however, work with school schedules."
good,Management needs major improvement but the benefits are good. The job lacks communication but they do alot for the community. Majority of the people that work there are on FMLA due to the stress.
good,great opportunity but limited decision making and poor communication between staff and management hours has mainly no flexibility and holidays are a musty for beginners
good,"Your experience at JP Morgan depends on your department. Different departments are ran differently, have different management styles, and different cultures."
good,Working for chase was great.  They had the best technology to help the clients and they continue to improve their technology.  They need to update their hours of operations.  Many times the branch could have closed earlier because we didn't have client coming into the branch or they could have been helped by the customer service line.
good,The job was okay but they were firing and not hiring. Too many customers not enough workers. They wanted one teller to work drive thru and all the regular customers at the windows in front of them. The bank manager was about to quit. Everyone was just quitting or being fired it was insane so i quit.
good,"The job was very stressful to meet call goals on a daily basis.  However, the staff was very helpful with any help that you needed.  Management was not available right away to assist with help."
good,"The pay at JPMC is great. My compensation package was more than I had expected. The people I work with are outstanding. Unfortunately, I joined during a transition phase. The company was in the middle of transitioning to Agile. There were several changes in leadership and team assignments. In less than a year I had 4 different managers, assigned to 3 different teams and was informed that the office location was changing. So many changes in such a short period of time left me feeling very uncertain about my future."
good,"could not put on hold more than 3 min, management knowledgeable in training, the hard part was keeping customer interest while researching information"
good,"Dependable environment, when the potential candidates can gain valuable experience. Plenty of trainings available with professional workplace culture."
good,Nice atmosphere to work in! Management was friendly and helpful! It was a temporary position so I only worked during peak times. Mail room associates were easy to work with and we still remain in contact with each other.
good,"My co workers were amazing, management on the other hand has not been great in any of my experiences. I worked in two separate departments, each one started out great then once management came in and took over it went downhill at a rapid rate. demanding roles and demanding management at all times."
good,"Chase is every where !! Chase is so popular and serves a huge number of customers nationwide and they have great features for their clients that help them succeed financially. As a Chase employee, you have a chance to grow your career with Chase but you have to be really patient. Competition is so high and they make you wait a lot to get promoted which can be a disappointing factor for the employee  and not a motive to keep going forward."
good,I have learned more about flexibility on my last position.  Larger emphasis on compliance practices.  Need to escalate a number of items due to procedures.
good,decent place to work if you have the right boss. If you have a poor boss your career goes no where and you get stuck.  if you have right boss it easy to succeed
good,"Every major banking trend begins at Chase. Good, bad, or indifferent--they lead, they do not follow. A very political and clique based environment. Compensation is not competitive."
good,"Unless you are in a profit center, you are always in danger of a cost cutting.  JP Morgan has no faith to its employees.  Jobs are routinely shipped offshore to cut costs."
good,"I am in release management , so have to work a lot of weekends/nights. There is no concept of comp time for the weekend work. Depends on the type of role. Most all are stretched thin and over worked as i see it"
good,"Average day begins with clocking in depending on which department you work in. I learned to always know you product, position and always, always keep networking."
good,busy paced daily. great training. everything changes depending on managers' background; whether they have sales background or not. wanted to continue to work but company prefers outside promotions to internal.
good,"JPMorgan Chase offer competitive benefits package to include medical, dental, optical, 401K, & tuition reimbursement.  Salary ranges are broad to include several levels."
good,I worked for Washington Mutual Bank that was taken over by Chase Bank.   By the time Chase took over I was already laid off.  I understand they are a great company to work for but I don't have the experience you are asking for.
good,They allowed you to work either at home one day a week or work flexible hours.  They had fun team activities and they are really good with working with the community.
good,It's a typical big bank environment. There was no importance placed on culture within the organization. I've worked other places where my colleagues became my closest friends but here it was hard to get people to say good morning when you passed them in an aisle.
good,it was okay to work even its big company and need to understand lot more things. But there are good opportunities to explore new cutting edge technologies
good,"There is a disconnect in management. They hired a manager without any banking, compliance or management skills causing problems in completing projects"
good,Worked here for 12 years until they laid me off with severance. Never really received a good raise but am thankful for the stable jobs I had for the time I was the firm.
good,The hardest part of the job is navigating the bureaucracy and red tape. My suggestion to management to cut down on the amount of bureaucracy and red tape.
good,"Associates are located in different region. Hard to coordinate work effort."
good,The employee experience at JPMC differs depending on the business unit you are in.   There is mobility within the company but there is also a constant effort to offshore jobs to low cost locations.
good,"Good life/work balance. Good management. Very focused on revenue growth as relates to compensation. If your product did not bring in new revenue there was little or no compensation, even if the product helped maintain clients with growing revenue in other products."
good,I learned not to stay at a company for the benefits only. I worked at Chase for 21 years and needed to move into other avenues much  sooner than I did.
good,It has been many years since working for this company and I do not wish to discuss on social media this company.  I enjoyed working at JP Morgan Chase when I was there.
good,"There was no onsite HR, I went out on disability. I was told I couldn't work nights, but was then was forced to return to 3rd shift and was fired shortly after."
good,You will be required to make 50+ calls weekly and that will continue to increase. Micro management on another level of micro management. You do get a lot of vacation.
good,Monthly goal driven environment. overtime allowed. management is average. stressful environment when attempting to reach monthly numbers. Pay is typical for a call center
good,"JPMorgan chase, the biggest banking giant in US is offering a lot of career. but I would say this company doesn't pay well for fresher's and people who works in the night shift. They are very below par in pay compared to other US banks"
good,Great pay and benefits for a reason- this job makes you wish you were dead. This job is so mind numblingly repetitive and you know you are working for an evil blood sucking money hungry corporation. They try to make you feel like you are making a difference but you are just getting screamed at 400 times a day by people who are being screwed over by the fine print.
good,I think they have one of the best employees health insurance system in US otherwise working in a JPM Chase Bank Branch is tough and stressful. Stay away as much as you can.
good,Hi pressure sales and service environment. Great benefits and vacation package.  Great business resource groups to support a multitude of individuals.
good,"Great company learned alot from them. Great work environment , great management would have stayed with company but benefits and income wasn't great for me."
good,"Not good if you are coming from a Product background. If you are coming from another bank, I guess this would the best you get. "
good,"Chase is good place to work, it give lots of opportunities to grow, management is also very good. Good work life balance, benefits, ESPP, Health Insurance etc."
good,Dont apply unless your coming through randstad. I personally am only here because they ran out of spots in data entry which is what I originally asked for. You aren't truly a employee as they say until after the first 30days.
good,I work different alerts on a daily basis out of a queuee in which worked is assigned to complete in 3 business sla days I work new to bank account in which the customer is tring to open up a business banking checking account my job is to analyxe the potential customwer for any negative media or aml risk
good,"I worked for the company for over four years. The benefits are great, practically unmatched for a starting job in their call center. Unfortunately the company culture is to see both employees and customers as a number. They talk a lot about work-life balance but they don’t provide the means for it. Their retention is very low. By the time I left the company there was no one from my cohort. People get fired all the time for not meeting company stats, some of which are ridiculous given the resources they provide the employees to meet those stats with; I.e. average handling time. But it seems that is easy to fire employees and get new ones, because if you work 10 years for them with your salary at that point they could be paying for two employees. It seems to be the logic behind their poor retention practices."
good,It tends to be the norm to bring in outside talent and pay them more than the employees who have been there dedicating a great deal of their personal time to complete the work.
good,"I worked a contract position right out of college doing Hedge Fund Accounting, immediately upon being hired i was informed my team's work was being moved across the country, and i had to start learning how to train my replacement. Contract was not renewed, i cant say i enjoyed it, but it was mostly bad timing."
good,I wanted to work  with the Company but my numbers were to low so I was laid off . I tried so hard to produce higher but I was laid off and had to produce working another Assignment
good,don't ask me right after I got terminated.  you really don't want to know how angry I am that I and three other collegues of mine were forced out of their jobs by systematically reducing the size of their branch until we couldn't meet the new goals.
good,A typical day at work would be to assist customers with their account. Learned how to help a customers balance their accounts. Mixed culture. The hardest part or the job was to be balanced at the end of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be in balance at the end of the day.
good,"The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom. The budding artichoke flower-head is a cluster of many budding small flowers (an inflorescence), together with many bracts, on an edible base. Once the buds bloom, the structure changes to a coarse, barely edible form. Another variety of the same species is the cardoon, a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. Both wild forms and cultivated varieties (cultivars) exist."
good,working with a team and helping clients. Seeing clients buy their first home/ car/ or retire with out concern of running out of money. JP morgan has the best retirement planning tools in the industry.
good,"the benefits are costly, incentive plans goes down each year.  Sales role is very stressful.  They want certain number of appointments and sales goals, while acheiveable not flexible enough.  I would have to work almost every saturday due ti high turnover."
good,The management culture at Chase Bank is very sales driven and in the banker role you are very pivotal to the success of your branch. You will normally meet in the morning and evening with the branch manager. You are expected to refer business your partners. You have to make and take a lot phone calls. And all of your appointments and Phone calls and emails are tracked for security and for production
good,"Decent company to work for, very rigid in terms of given timelines. Not many chances given to improve in areas of weakness. Extremely flexible schedule."
good,"I was actually very curious about reviewing this program because I had recently seen it on TV and the radio (and especially considering I had just finished two straight months of testing what turned out to be one scam after another). So I wondered, was it more of the same or would it actually live up to it's word? I really wanted to find out for myself, but I was still skeptical."
good,JPMorgan Chase is a great place to start out in the industry. I used it as a stepping stone to figure out what I really wanted to do in life. Management is great and tons of opportunity for growth within the compnay.
good,"very stressful"
good,"It is a good place to advance and pick new technologies and tools, a lot of resources."
good,"I wake up every morning pumped to walk into work... sounds cliché, but so true! The culture is unlike any company I've come to work for or interviewed for. Everyone in the Glassdoor community is truly genuine and extremely helpful in all aspects. Upper management will help you focus on your next career steps, in setting up mentorships and having one-on-ones to meet your goals."
good,Working possible fraud accounts is stressful anyway you think about it. Working with peers to assure that accounts were completed was the most fun in a day at JP Morgan Chase
good,"Definitely a great company to work for. Started as a Teller, then got promoted to a Suoervisor, and Curremtly a Personal Banker. After working for almost 3 years, I have gained valuable banking experience that can help me grow within the banking industry."
good,"The team that I was assigned to has more workload that an individual team member can manage.  A typical day during busy season would be 16 to 18 hours. But, management tried their best to listen to the woes, suggestions of the team. Despite these, I was able to get through issues encountered with the winning attitude of the team."
good,Chase was okay to work for.  The only thing I didn't like was that they outsourced a lot of their jobs which caused us to be out of a job. The pay was okay if you didn't have a lot of bills.
good,"Hours were good."
good,A typical day is helping customers with their bank accounts. Hardest part of the job was the goals. The workplace culture was very diverse and I learned banking 1 on 1
good,Good place to work with opportunity to develop. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with stakeholders globally. The company promotes diversity and equality which is reflected in staff employed.
good,Not much perks. Work longer hours than typical technology companies.More micro-managed on your work. Less collaborative. More political in the work environment.
good,A big concern has been the lack of communication from management. Assigning projects to individuals without providing the necessary training to be successful.
good,"JP Morgan teaches you a lot if you're willing to learn. The analysts work long hours, but there is the feeling that the talent is being developed. If you want to work in finance, this is an excellent company to learn from and grow in."
good,Worked in a small team based out of Delaware to transfer files.  Great place to work.  Did not stay too long as work became routine and understandably so- as application was small.
good,Need much better work/environment culture....oversight of new management with current employees in branch. Consistent management surveys as the last manager I had is the reason I left this company after 10 years.
good,"I processed securities for exchanges, (also on exchanges, checking for record dates upon when stock and/or cash dividends were payable). I also processed converitible preferred stock converting into common stock (only if conversion is favorable). If conversion is not favorable, I would always reach out to my clients.  I also processed tender offers for upcoming mergers. Processed stock and/or cash redemptions."
good,"You come to work, do your work and go home.  Some managers are excellent and the smartest people I know, others are ruthless political sharks.   For some reason, Europe calls the shots at a ""US bank"", so everybody in the US defers to Europe. "
good,It was a good work environment. The pay sucked though. I'm sure their are ways to advance and get more money but I did not stay long enough to find out because I had major bills to pay.
good,Aggressive competition between Personal Financial Representatives in which later lead to a very hostile environment. Learned how to maintain a well organized pipeline and how to multitask in a tight timeline.
good,"What do you expect. Be in a good place with good bosses, you make money. Otherwise it is a bank. If you think that is interesting - go there. Basically there are a lot of boring people there."
good,It’s a good company to work for. I worked for a while but clients can be a little of a hassle and taking a vacation can be a little tough. Your bonus is literally ur pay. They refuse to give raises ie why I decided to leave
good,"Good introduction, mediocre follow through with development and advancement opportunity. Sales calls general bulk of day. Restricted in work place ability and then demanding in output."
good,"Sales driven. Management was always great and the team I worked with, making work fun. Clients were amazing in the area I work les and they were more like family."
good,Compensation was good but the company only paid for 10% of your health benefits. The recruiter checked in once in a while. Hardest part of the job was long off-hours work
good,The position can be highly monotonous without opportunities for variance.  I've learned valuable financial product sales skills.  Management is inconsistent both in temperament and overall job direction.  These attributes birth a below average workplace culture.  The greatest challenge remains understanding Management's expectations.  The silver lining is the rather interesting subject matter.
good,Changed my schedule last minute but pay and benefits are nice. normally very helpful but sometimes feel like you are just thrown into the fire with new hire training.
good,Great job to start of with. Provides lots of fudamentals but they don’t appreciate you. A dime ah dozen Is the saying because they value you for your production only
good,"My experience at JP Morgan Chase was very rewarding as I got the opportunity to work in different areas of the bank. I worked in Alert Operations analyzing transactions for diversified lines of business for the purpose of assessing criminal and suspicious activities and generating investigative reports."
good,First professional position.  Chase offered me good experience and an opportunity to learn and deal with senior managers.  It was a good first step for me.
good,"As long as you did your job you were fine; however, the company did not protect employees when the supervisor did not like you (HR will side with the manager or supervisor)."
good,"High turnover is the nature of the business.  Managers must be prepared for near-constant on boarding.  Company leadership handles this well and makes it easier but, still, a concern."
good,"It is a customer service based company that focuses on the needs of clients that walk in the door. It is a fun company to work for with great co-workers that make it fun. I have learned a lot since I first started in banking. I have learned to deal with difficult customers and deal with different situations. I have learned how to utilize the different computer systems that constantly continue to change. I have learned about the different products and services that fit each individual, financial needs is not a one size fits all we have to accommodate each client according to his/her needs. I deal with different customers each day, therefore each case and lifestyle is different, what may work for one person may not work for another."
good,"GOod place to work but promotions are very slow but managers are very motivating."
good,The team and Line of Business that you end up will determine the work that you'll be doing. There is a lot of red tape and it's usually a slow paced environment.
good,". very quiet and ended unexpectedly. Hopefully it has gotten better with time. I have nothing more to say about this job, just wanting to meet 150 min"
good,"Productive workplace, good benefits, most managers support flex time.  They encourage mobility, culture is very flat and organization is really open.  Great environment and opportunities to grow."
good,N/A i don't have any reviews to add at this time... I am looking for either work from home or working closer to home to help my mom who suffers and aneurism of the brain.
good,There was not coaching or mentorship.  Manager visits were somewhat frequent but unproductive.  Incentive compensation was adjusted away from goal achievement.
good,JPMorgan was the start of me learning how to become diverse and work with all types of people. This employer helped me to improve my internal and external customer service skills. Definitely a great start!
good,JP Morgan does not give you freedom to explore your passions and does not give you enough independence to explore projects according to your interests.
good,"Productive work culture..."
good,"it was an ok job, just became a bit frustrating when new employees were getting better pay for less or the same work, and if you work on a small department your schedule flexibility goes out the door."
good,"Pool of secretaries when i first started, then worked alone with VP. VP nice and generous in his handover of work. Sorry I had to leave to have a baby."
good,"Satisfactory place to work, learn and grow, while working with people of like minds.  Workplace culture sometimes felt somewhat unbalanced and not quite fair"
good,"Every day is busy day and there is lot of new thing to learn. Management needs to be improve, Culture is Ok, Short staff- One person working for 2 people's work. Company is good to work."
good,"I worked in a large call center assisting people with Home Affordable Modifications, which was the hardship program established by the Obama Administration.  It was tough work, but I was grateful for the chance to help a few families save their homes."
good,"I didn't spend a whole lot of time here, but it was during a time that the call center area was changing. Life was fine here and I am sure that it is even better now."
good,The people I worked with on site and the customer that I got to know during my time with JPMorgan was a great please.  I got to know more about my customers as I continued to work with them.
good,"As with most large multi national company, it has it's opportunities and rewards.  My experience is that it is also very political in how one department deals with one and another."
good,"regardless of what people say, this is a sales job and numbers are the only thing that counts. if you are lucky you will be with a great group of coworkers and they will make the day easier. the coworkers are what make the job easy and delightful but can be the reason why it drags if the teamwork is lacking."
good,"Set appointments, work with partners for relationship development, "
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a pretty big company that pays well. However, I found with my experience there that it was pretty hard to not feel like a number to them."
good,"Although it was customer service, the most important thing was to meet quotas in balances, accounts, etc. which was difficult to meet when wanting to put the customer first. Management was competitive with employees."
good,"Being employed with Chase for nearly 20 years came with its highs an lows. Overall, I do not regret working for a firm with great integrity for its employees. I learned and gained so much experience and will take with me on my new career path."
good,"Good Place to work, great work culture, good for fresher to learn more and explore. Good environment and ambience, Good Transport services and cafeteria."
good,"Chase is a great company to learn and grow professionally, because it's the banking industry they have many great opportunities. Great career / product opportunities working for the company"
good,"productive and fun place to work ,coworkers are great helping each other"
good,I had several successful years with this company.  It is a very significant chapter in my career and life.   I am thankful for the time I had with the company.
good,Work environment and culture varied by department. Some departments are more flexile than others. Quality of work/life balance varied by department. Good maternity leave. Good holidays.
good,I have no review to give for this employer.  My employment was O.K. but some managers I worked for were very nasty self indulge individuals with their on agenda to make employees miserable.
good,stressful work to collect on old charged off loans.  working with realtors and customer.  stressful trying to locate people with old information and taking inbound calls.
good,"Was not too pleased working at JPMorgan Chase. People were nice, but Management really put the hammer down on goals and aggressivre numbers. It was what it was."
good,"Although Chase Bank does a great job at paying you it does not make up for the lack of interaction from manager to a Bank Teller. As a Bank Teller, there is not much room for job advancement."
good,"The work is very simple, easy to learn and quick to master. It is 100% phone based. It may seem strict due to the fact that you will be required to be available for a phone call unless you are on a scheduled break or lunch."
good,Provide customer service to external customers. I worked grave yard shift and that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was working in a small team environment.
good,"A large, corporate environment that doesn't foster employees well. No work from home opportunity while with the company. The schedule wasn't very flexible."
good,In my previous role I worked in conjunction with Loan Officers and Underwriters to ensure a timely and accurate experience for the customer throughout the mortgage process. That experience will benefit me in my next role.
good,"A OK place to work, under qualified management. Sales driven/ didn't feel safe working there. Rude management, Unreliable security. Had to stand most of my shift"
good,JP Morgan Chase is a good place to work management always were interested in you opinions and new ideas. our weekly meeting were productive and informative.
good,"The benefit package including holidays, sick time and vacation were very good.  I was located in Dallas while most of my team was located in New York.  This made it very easy to not treat me fairly because they did not have to interact with me on a day to day basis.  I think I was not treated fairly also because I was the one person in the group from Bank One."
good,My experience with JP was very short as I spent about a year and I found work life balance is somehow not promoted by organization. There were several conflicts between delegation of work.
good,"Autonomous    busy, liquididty studies, culture is challenging, product elimination, business model changes fiscally responsible good immediate managers"
good,Worked together as a team to provide a great. Customer experience. At times could be stressful and disjointed. We were robbed twice in one week. A little unsettled.
good,"Good company to work for."
good,I would not ever work for the mortgage side of this company ever. This is a stressful company with no regard to family life of your well being. Very stressful
good,Daily activities included maintaining a case management system with time sensitive case reviews to complete on a daily basis.  Daily team meetings were conducted unless management had no new information to pass along.  The department seemed to always work in a perpetual backlog which created a sometimes stressful work environment.  Often management seemed to be promoted on who they new rather than merit.  However my experience was an overall good one as I was there approximately ten years.  After said time with JPMorgan I have contemplated a change which includes a possible change in careers.
good,The team I joined was an acquisition for JP Morgan Chase to eneter the fund administration arena.  The management was entirely from the acquisition and was afforded autonomy.
good,This was a mixed bag.  I had the opportunity to learn new software and use it productively.  My work was closely examined for the entire year I was there.
good,Good company to work for. Management styles depended on the department you worked in. The company always trys to promote from within and works hard to find positions for employees that have been laid off within the company.
good,"Decent life work balance"
good,Technical recruiting was fun and exciting if you are an experienced recruiter (which I am).  I loved working at the Plano location.  I left a FTE position for a contract opportunity at JPMC in Plano.  I was interviewed by wonderful team members and I was hired to start as a contractor.  The only drawback was that the current manager just didn't like me even though I was performing at a top level.  I was replaced before I even got cut from my contract.  Different management would have appreciated my talent more.
good,Chase pays average to slightly above average.  Demands are high to commit considerable time to your job yet claims work life balance is important to the company.  Layoffs were made but more retail locations opened..........profit above employees feeling secure
good,Lo mismo o peor que Citi porque lo jefe quieren que hagas tu trabajo y el trabajo de ellos.
good,"JP Morgan is a great place to work, the people here are what make it so great. The culture is fast paced, intense but at the same time it's friendly and laid back."
good,"If mission is practiced and being serious about career development, not just on paper, it would be a five star company. People culture is based on who you work with, most is all about “me” and it is celebrated."
good,"Worked here as a Business Banker for 2 years between two branches . Excellent on job training , some of the smartest and op sales individuals  ive ever met . Definitely cut throat and you need to be on top of your game  im sure they changed a few things since my years to modernize a bit . Expect to put in extra time , and self source clients  and always remember as in all BANKS- its all about the  Deposits $$$$$"
good,"Always a Professional Atmosphere there, which was a plus..  Benefits were standard at best.  Compensation ,in my opinion, was under the market for the job skills/responsibilities expected at the chart level in which I resided.  Advancement  in house, for current employees, could have been weighed more favorable."
good,it was okay place to work i just like the job i used to do. sometimes i will have a good day and other times i will have an okay day just depends. my hardest part of the job is hearing them saying what work we have to get into
good,"This company was good for the most part... I would have still been there, but I had a car accident that cause me to be out more than 6 months and they had to let me go... I really like this company and wish them the best..."
good,"I enjoyed working for Chase bank. I was a personal banker there. I worked a standard 40 hours a week with an occasional Saturday in the month. Depending on where you work it could be high paced. High paced is good, if not you will be sitting at a cubical making phone calls to potential clients. The downside, like in most jobs, is the work environment. Some employees weren't so friendly or team oriented. People are working on commission (when I worked there) and some are trying to move up, others just don't like their jobs. Aside from that, its an alright place to work."
good,"The people are great but its difficult to work when the motto is less is more, and make sure your productivity is up. Theres no quota but management definitely finds a way to hold you accountable to something."
good,"The personal banker typically handles personal loan applications and is responsible for supervision of the teller and customer representative staff."
good,My experience was when it was Chase Manhattan not the new JPMorgan Chase entity so cannot provide a useful review. It was an ok place to work for then.
good,"The work environment is pleasant but sterril.  Everyone dresses in the same clothes every day that you are required to buy from Lands End on your own dime.  They do give you a free shirt each year! LOL"
good,I worked at branches for several years.  Management would interview external candidates versus internal.  Management eventually offered me a position after I had started looking for employment else where.  I became stuck in my new role and didn't receive guidance on what I could do to get myself more qualified for desired positions.
good,"Organizational and strategic plans developed, reviewed, approved, and implemented. Entire affordable housing and multicultural market infrastructure rolled out and then closed down within 2-3 years without consideration of market commitments established."
good,I have not worked for this company in 18yrs its closed down and I will like to work for another mortgage company in the near future if you like paying attention to detail
good,This is a great place to establish yourself as a finance professional with lots of opportunities to learn about the business and the financial services marketplace.  This is not a sustainable work place.  The days and hours are long with a very large pyramid organization.  Employees with families and children are few and tend to be at the top of an organization.  Not a great place for new parents nor a sustainable work environment in the long term for families with dual incomes.
good,I enjoyed my time with chase as far as my coworkers.  The salary was low and no much room for advancement with the department.  I did have a nice manager so that helped
good,"If you work hard, it will pay off.  But I ran into issues with work/life balance in the Investment Bank. After having a child, I was unable to reach an agreement that allowed me to continue with my career."
good,Working for Bank One prior to the firm being acquired by JPMC was like working for your own family. Management was engaging and they cared about their employees. Compensation was good and incentives were incredible.
good,if you thrive under pressure its for you. office culture is not the same as compared to other investment banks. prepare for lots of office politics. would only recommend for the name on resume
good,Just remember wanted to get out.  Much too stuffy.  More people got promoted because they pointed out other faults.  Lots of people with not much to do.
good,"was laid of twice in two years, job security was not there. Overall, great pay.  Did learn much about the company besides having many town hall meetings and new opportunities in other states."
good,"Good work culture and work life balance, and good profiles to work on and better pay and motivating managements and food coupons transportation provided"
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for however the management staff there and the structure that they have is not that great they have their favorites of who they promote and you have to bust your a** in order to move forward if they like you
good,In the 15 years I was with this company it changed hands from HomeSide Mortgage to Washington Mutual Mortgage to Chase Mortgage. I began as Consumer Direct Underwriter to Default Underwriter due to changes in economy.
good,If I were in my early twenties and this was the first place I worked-okay.  You probably had chances that I would never be allowed to take part in due to how old I was when I went to work there.
good,"What can I say, it's JP Morgan.  The place is huge.  Some managers are good, some aren't.  If you like working for a large conglomerate, JP Morgan Chase is the place for you."
good,"Job security is main concern here."
good,Career mobility is great. People are generally good. Learned a lot from training that is ongoing. Varies positions and varies hours available. Secure work place environment.
good,Working with family/group. processing and underwriter documents upon receipt from the loan processor or customer. Make loan decision based on Fannie and Freddie Mae guidelines.
good,"I am sure this is a fine company to work for, but I had a negative experience of being downsized. I am sure there are many good entry level jobs for newer people."
good,Company is more company focused but still is a corporate culture that does not understand their employees needs.  They are more team oriented and try to assist clients.
good,"Good working environment. Offering multiple jobs and opportunity to grow. Good benefits,avarage pay. Opportunities to learn and expand your skills. Multiple schedule options."
good,It was an ok work environment. TMs were dedicated to high net worth clients who weren't always the nicest people to deal with. Management always took customer side
good,Very competitive when it comes to employment. Mainly  because of everyone that works there wants to move up with the company. It is a trusted company to work. Retail platform goes through a lot of changes more so than corporate.
good,"This predates the merger with Chase, don't assume this reference is accurate anymore.  When I was there they had just outsourced their coding to Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).  They were outsourcing a lot of additional coding to Barbados and India, which we still had to go over and correct."
good,I enjoyed my time at Chase with the only exception being you had to know someone in order to get a head. This sometimes made it difficult to do your job.
good,"Like my job, felt like I was helping people resolve issues."
good,"Great benefits , great people , great environment , typical day at work is task, projects, daily duties, connections and networking, exposure of great people"
good,"Your typical big bank, secure, stable, good salary, highly political, hard to get ahead, many layers of management and agenda. Good 9-5 with benefits."
good,"JPMorgan has great benefits including 401(k), vacation, and health benefits..  There is a lot of opportunities to expand your work experience due to many different lines of business."
good,"I really can’t remember anything about chase other then going through two downsizing."
good,Really hard for me to write this dumb of you because it was really only an inch and shipped it lasted about two months. Was in was out of the holidays and just processed internal ids
good,I started out as a teller.  Then I moved into a Relationship Banker role. That role expanded beyond the job description because I was a key person in helping open a new branch
good,"Company has allot of moving parts, very large. Moving within the firm can be difficult."
good,Good environment for those who can learn quickly.  Second largest bank in the USA however cross-training and cross-business transfers are not easily facilitated though encouraged
good,Great team but definately not a work from home role when dealing directly with business clients. The company was very skeptical of the outside sales role.
good,"Workplace was good, never felt overworked. Pay was good as well. Opportunities for advancement were slim, and it seemed like they would rather hire from the outside then to promote from within."
good,Transitioned to Chase during the WaMu buy-out. The changes were significant and the sales goals were too intense given the over-saturated branch market. The environment may have changed since I left.
good,"In the ten years I worked for Chase Bank, the business changed drastically. It's a high traffic transactional business, you have to be on all the time. It's a Bank and you helping customers with their futures."
good,JPMorgan Chase Corporate Accounting is a constant struggle where zero policies and procedures or basic business communication exists.  A classic example of a company that is too big for its own good.
good,"Can be a fun place to work but honestly the job just wasn't for me. I was put in a higher position than other new employees, and was expected to be perfect. Management/ supervisor was not paying attention to me when I was doing perfect in my position but the moment I started to get a lil rough around the edges I was let go. I was working there for a year and that just go to show that I was doing something right. I was only looked at by my mistakes. This position isn't for everyone this was just my personal experience of course."
good,"Good man people, salaries are low, management is developing, made some good friends that I will have for a lifetime.  Growing company and innovative now ."
good,In the beginning there is a learning curve.  After people learn and catch there groove it is easy to grow.  As long as you manage your time properly the sky is the limit.
good,"I have had numerous positions at Chase.  In Closing and Underwriting, production goals were very important.  Underwriting expects a monthly average of 15 touches per day, with no quality issues.  Depending on the time it takes to complete a touch, this number is impossible to meet within an 8 hour day.  However, if you were to touch a loan and half complete it within the timeline, you could meet the goal."
good,Work well with other.  Had the ability to learn new techniques from other departments.  I was able to teach other my skills and learned from others in different areas
good,Solid company but all about the numbers. My direct management was great however the higher up you go the harder it gets. Extreme sales pressure at all times.
good,Great place could be better. Raises are few and far between. Remote work is accepted but frowned upon. Location is not great but benefits are good. Friendly people
good,Arrive and immediately begin. My department was is known for the favoritism. The worst part is the micro managing that starts with the Division Leader.
good,good work environment. provide world class training that newbies can benefit. previously offered good benefits. company that you can see anywhere. good
good,"JP Morgan Chase & Company is a global financial services provider headquartered in NY, NY.  It has offices and operations around the world.  It provides financial solutions to consumers, middle market and large corporations."
good,"	Responsible for all documentation in accordance with underwriting decisions, ensuring governmental with Chase compliance guidelines are met (including counter offers, Regulation B and Commitment letters)"
good,"Technology is lacking in performance and some parts are outdated, back offices are inconsistent in completing requests, too top down heavy to foster creativity,"
good,"Nothing memorable. The technology on the banker's side always seemed slightly outdated. Slow computers, old fax machines, etc. However, it did not seem as though bankers with different institutions had it much better. The company culture was a cut above. I personally felt as though I reached my ceiling, and therefore, my impression of the experience is somewhat tainted. If one is looking for a longterm career in consumer finance and had to or wanted to go through a retail bank, I would encourage them to try and get in with Chase."
good,"corporate is terrible, branch management was good. review not specific, just need to apply to some jobs.  don't work here unless you're getting paid a lot."
good,"JPMorgan is typical of a large multinational bank, with varying degrees of bureaucracy depending on the department. There are decent company-wide benefits, but general office atmosphere was lacking morale."
good,"Low base pay but have opportunities to make more if you have a strong pipeline. Usually don’t have to work more than 40 hours so, good work life balance."
good,Great Company to work for with great benefits that are hard to find.  Unfortunately unable to grow in a competitive environment.  There are some seasonally individuals that you are able to learn from.
good,JPM has great benefits and a team culture but at times work/life balance is not a priority. Work from home is also accepted on a manager by manger basis and is not consistent.
good,Chase was good until they switched me departments and i was bilingual getting paid less than an English speaker. Was not properly trained and had to ask others for help
good,"It is hard to move around to other departments, they have been known to hire outside than promote within.  You have to focus on your own development and network, which they promote but you have to go hunt for it."
good,"At JPMorgan Chase, job security appears to be based on friendship in other words, whom you know. This, is not good for development. Favoritism need to stop"
good,"JPMorganChase did a good job of awarding compensation and promotions based on merit.  There was a good working environment, but some uncertainty about job security."
good,There are some things that could be better than others. The job itself was great.  Benefits were great and matching 401k. Some of the processes need attention like annual reviews
good,JP Morgan Chase has good benefits and if you are connected with the right network then you will definitely have good career at Chase. JP Morgan Chase also has good volunteer opportunities.
good,"Typical Large Enterprise environment with a resource warchest necessary to fuel innovation or tackle any obstacle. As any other large enterprise, bureaucratic red tape tends to slow progress down at times."
good,"The Wilmington DE location has mostly poor resource quality. "
good,"A typical day at JPMorgan is as its with other IB, trading hour you have to support, Overall company work culture is good, in some cases its bit hectic it differ project to project"
good,"Bank teller role was simple and steady, but constant. The job does not really stop and the company wants you to put more into the company than the company is willing to put into you."
good,"it was a six months contract position. we had a break room and cafe with amazing food. great communication with each other as a team."
good,"call center environment, pay not that competitive.  Some managers have tunnel vision with micro-managing skills, They have decent benefits and good job security."
good,"overall the company was great, even dealing with angry customers didn't discourage me, a lot of times I was able to turn their frown upside down to a smile by the time they left. it was really just my manager who made it hard to stay at the company, I made a complaint through HR but it doesn't look like any action was taken."
good,I was a number- no motivation either you are favorite or you are not. No support from management- management could care less as their philosophy you are just a number and replaceable
good,"I wouldn't say they were a great company, but I did get paid.  However, the supervisors favored people of different ethnicities and wouldn't give bonuses to people who worked hard, just their friends.  The place I worked for was closed down and most of the jobs moved out of the US so that Chase could pay a lower rate and make more in profits."
good,"Thank you for the requirement of obtaining my series 6 and insurance license as a banker, I learned additional information on my personal investments and how to refer to other individuals."
good,This company is one that helped me prepare for the work force and help me find a career. Unfortunately I’m wanting to take all my skills I got from this company and get paid what I deserve for them.
good,Chase is a very large company with numerous departments and potential to move around.  The area  that I worked provided limited opportunity to network.
good,"Nice place to work, Good  Support from the Management,"
good,"this is a good work place to grow and for on shore opportunities."
good,Typical day at work was taking calls from mortgages that had gone in default. We would assist the customers with trying to come up with a plan to pay off the mortgage or initiate a short sale.
good,In the middle of nowhere. Good resume builder for future jobs. Not a career long term. Tons of turnover around the office. The pay is substantial for Delaware cost of living but nowhere else
good,"very stressful atmosphere, dealing with money and the custimers demands. one has to be very careful with the transactions and if there is a error, we could not balance at the end of the day. Not  a very copoperwative team but the manager was very nice and helpful"
good,"dead end job, no future. busy job, no work life balance. no advancement, constant changed and pressure to perform, no support from mgrs. no tools to do job"
good,"Too much corporate bureaucracy. Managers rarely asked for your opinion how to solve problems or make improvements.  "
good,Great work environment lots of team meetings with questions and answers from management and supervisors enjoyed working from home and going into work early.
good,Good Place to work. There are alot of great people within each team.They have Great benefits but more personal time is needed especially for the people that have children.
good,"This was a clock in clock out type of role. No one was personally vested in the team goals. It was heads down most of the day and not a lot of bonding with co-workers. There was very little opportunity to learn outside of your role, even if you had interest and looked for opportunity. Most managers were knowledgeable in a narrow set of skills and topics and didn't have much to impart."
good,My immediate management was very easy to work with and very understanding as well as ALWAYS will to teach anyone willing to learn new things and always helped out her employees when needed.
good,JP Morgan Chase is a global organization that offers a variety of job roles where one can learn and grow if you are determined to compete and succeed.
good,Started as a Network Technician and then moved into the Project Management Role.  With all of the mergers and acquistions it was had to hold a stable position.
good,Meeting people from all different backgrounds and being  able to provide customized solutions for the clients needs. Working with team members to better every clients experience.
good,"chase provide 24 hour banking making it easier to do transactions, checking and business accounts are available. debit cards and credit cards can be used for purchases where accepted"
good,Heavy incoming phone contact from the Tri-state area. Stressful and competitive environment. Rude and demanding customers. I had teenagers when I worked at this company and they were changing my schedule.
good,"cutthroat culture, they find different ways to cut down on your incentive payout. not a place that helps you advance in your career.  they preach team work, but everyone is trying to back stab one another to reach own sales numbers."
good,I Enjoyed the Employee Appreciation week. It was  filled with a week long of fun food and gifts from management and the company. I really enjoyed the last day of the eventful week.
good,"I've never had a complaint related to compensation and benefits with JPM. If you dedicated your career to working for a large high profile corporation and willing to accept the fact you are a resource you'll be fine.  It's the inherent nature of any large company there are highly structured processes, multiple layers of procedures, documentation and tracking of your work, and the unavoidable bureaucracy.  I'm proud to say I've worked for this company though the layers of bureaucracy and impaired communication have been tiring.  This is an outstanding bank devoted to their customers that invests top technology and assets in serving them."
good,"make sure to negotiate your salary. Some employees get paid more than others. They will expect you to take many calls a day, about 80, so keep that in mind when apply."
good,Not the best job but also not the worst. You deal with a lot of upset customers at time and sometimes you do what you can to help them but you best usually wasn't enough
good,"Managed a $229 million dollar banking center portfolio, oversaw all premier client investments.  Provided superior Customer Service to new and existing clients, developed and maintained professional relationships with internal and external clients to ensure open communication and feedback. Selected Accomplishments:"
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at JPMChase, it was a good place to work. Good management, good benefits. The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable. I have no complaints."
good,"I loved my job at Chase, I liked learning all of the different departments and all of the different laws regarding the housing industry. I advanced to a couple of different departments and learned everything in the mortgage world from Customer Service all the way to underwriting."
good,"Overall a great company to work for. There is room for advancement and higher pay. There are an abundance of schedules to choose from. However, the company does need to work on management. I am all for advancement, Better managerial training needed."
good,Worked at remote location and didn't feel included with mother ship.  Benefits didnt seem to be that good except for the vacation days.  Health insurance seemed expensive
good,The place has a very beauracratic culture and no focus on learning cos half your time goes in managing inefficiencies upwards. Managers are clueless and just swimming along
good,Competitive Benefits with great 401k matching. Culture is improving with executive leadership focus. Most difficult portion is the constant adding of duties without proper compensation
good,Friendly and professional environment. A lot of work. Management was hands off. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some difficult personalities.
good,The company is very good to the employees and the atmosphere is fun and very good to the employees and the hours are very comfortable and manageable for the employees.
good,In retail telephone banking the calls are back to back no time to take a drink of water or breathe. No time off the phone at all. on average 200-300 calls in your shift.
good,"- Highly competitive"
good,"Responsible for providing business loan services to 7 locations. I learned when loans are approved or denied, you are not really explained how a decision was made."
good,Call center started off taking inbound calls and assisting with credit card services. Soon sales became mandatory and quotas assigned. This was pushed on all everyone and write ups were assigned for not pushing sales. This was stressful for the employees and annoyed customers who were only seeking assistance with their credit cards.
good,"Call center with strict rules and demanding pace of work. Good work area and team members. Only thing that was deflating was how much influence customer reviews had on your performance, eventually being a huge factor in promotions/raises."
good,Good place to work.
good,"I would highly recommend Chase to any financial services applicant. Like most jobs, it depends on your position and management that makes the job. The merchant services, or Paymentech division, of the company was my employer. This division overall was good, however I was ther during a time of industry chaos. New regulations made it difficult to exceed sales goals and achieve the maximum bonus potential. In addition, there were several management and compensation changes during my brief tenure. Both of these made it extremely difficult to enjoy work and financial security."
good,I would never work for this company again. The management does not care about employees and treats them horrible. The will cut anyones throat to protect their own jobs.
good,was with chase about six years. did all kinds of things. technical support. fill in manager. fill in trainer. was on the phone quite a bit of my time there doing troubleshooting.
good,Great place to learn and sharpen your skills and all necessary tools are available.  Friendly environment with understanding management willing to listen to concerns and recommendations.
good,"My job was outsourced to Manila, I guess they didn't wan to continue paying the employees. management was sub par and the the job was pretty easy, I would not go back to work for a call center after being at this job, The culture was ok, but it was a popularity contest to move up, it was all about who you were in good with that decided if you would be promoted."
good,Work & be rewarded. There were some long hours but family oriented & team environment.  Major business clients. Company made sure we enjoyed the time.
good,"work on the issues from QA, UAT and PROD. release process and build; code development on the new requirement; code reviews and documentation; attend training"
good,This is just another call center company that is only out for the big guy.  Not a whole lot of team effort going on here so my time here was short lived
good,"Over all this was my first job out of college, at the time I had nothing to compare it to. After my first year many managers left the firm and due to significant turnover there was no reason for me to stay plus i had a lengthy commute"
good,"This was a contract job we were brought in to underwrite FHA modification loans and refinance FHA loans, work place culture was good, the hardest part of this job was the systems, the most enjoyable was my team of underwriters."
good,Working at Chase is overwhelming. Banks are usually very busy and become unorganized when they only hire 2 people to work the center. Banks can be stressful when you have customers angry because you are dealing with their money.
good,"JP Morgan Chase Bank is an extremely competitive, high paced, high stressed environment.  Advancement at JP Morgan Chase Bank is available and encouraged."
good,Sr. management only care about making themselves look good. Would move an entire team to work on a big project with tight deadlines then firing you when its all done. Generals get all the credit and benefits while the army gets scraps and laid off.
good,When I started working there it was a good place. I left when things got less interesting and they weren't so interested in excellent design any more.
good,"Strong brand, ample training and leaning opportunities, great corporate responsibility and wonderful leadership. Collaboration among teams and communication of information from top to bottom could be better."
good,start our work day by seeing what's on the schedule and what needs to by done before end of work day.  set up our work area with all the material needed to complete our task for the day
good,"Ok place to work. I had several different positions there, so a typical there was not typical day. Not sure what else to say. I really don't feel like writing a review. I came here to look for jobs."
good,The environment can be great and stressful depending on the need for the day. The learning curve is very steep and requires great level of thinking and learning.
good,Not a bad place to work the environment was very friendly and professional and all the managers and supervisors were always willing to help answer any questions.
good,"Night shift was preasurised but enjoyable, very tight deadlines had to be met which required immense attention to detail, accuracy at speed was expected at all times."
good,Given the size of the company there are many wonderful opportunities but beware of the bureaucracy and mediocrity in daily routines. My experience is they are the biggest obstacles to career advancement internally and the success of the business as a whole.
good,"Limited advancement opportunities,management is unfair,Company needs to think about tenured employees ,lot of favoritism ,.I have been working for the last 2 years,but no development program"
good,They focus more on numbers and widgets than employees. Great company overall in terms of launching your career. No work balance. Management only cares about meeting goals.
good,I was a temp to perm employee.  Job was fast-paced and had demands that were manageable. I was in this role for a short time before I was requested to be a full-time employee
good,Receive calls relating to both personal and business accounts with chase.  Found out how debit and check processes work.  Customers are what make the job difficult.
good,"I took this job in a bad economy, needed to insure my families well being, collecting and moving people is not an easy job, but it was an experience that humbled me."
good,"Bank One was purchased by JP Morgan Chase. Enjoyed my time at Bank One, 26 years ago, as a Junior Trust Officer. Would go back if the opportunity arose."
good,"Good vacation package depending on your title."
good,"Typical day at work, always on the move."
good,I did not enjoy selling loans and credit cards. I did however become licensed as a registered rep and was able to learn about investment banking.  That was a side of the business I enjoyed
good,"For the most part this company was a good place to work. However, I do not like that this company expects the employees to compromise their integrity to gain business."
good,Great company to work for but certain divisions lack leadership when it comes to career development. Certain groups and managers clearly demonstrate acts of nepotism and favoritism to specific employees.
good,"nothiJPMorgan & Chase 									1/2016 to Present"
good,The branch I worked at was low traffic and would be slow at times. It was hard to find new people to open accounts.  The busier locations are easier to get people to sign up for new accounts or expand the ones they already have.
good,"The people you work with are okay and can make the day easier but this  is definitely a job for people who rarely have life or family emergencies and does not mind being cursed out by ignorant customers for 60% of the time and then ""coached"" about everything else like personal time and adhering to seconds on a clock. Not a job for sensitive or mellow person. While the pay was great, the verbal abuse is not worth it to me."
good,Advantages are a large company with many opportunities available....the flipside of that is you have to network hard to get noticed for those opportunities.
good,"- Lot of merger activity"
good,"JP Morgan is an institution that relies heavily on individual strengths in determining its own success.  Perseverance and goal orientation is vital to an individual's growth at this firm.  Learn your position, then learn areas of growth opportunity - in that order.  Execute your positions requirements with excellence, then advance yourself in the areas of growth opportunity; you will be recognized for your effort."
good,"Given the company size, with number of employees well over two hundred thousand globally, there are various functions available."
good,"typical day was Stressful. challenging. "
good,"Chase offers top of the line products and technology for the consumer and their employees. Chase is 100% committed to customer service, but could improve in employee/employer engagement."
good,Recruiting can be fun planning events and interacting with candidates. Headcount needs to increased for many of the programs we cover; sometimes you must work long hours to complete the work of two. Overall the peers are fun to work with as there is support among the different teams. The can be management micromanaging.
good,"No great incentives, long hours, you may not get lunch breaks, especially on Saturdays.  No annual bonus unless you are in management.  Manager gossips about other employees of other branches and uses the branch as a meeting site for ""offer up"" personal sales.  The branch lacks professionalism."
good,"You can easily create a career at  Chase. Management is not very proactive in deliberate development of employees.  As a result, employees who are not self-driven and are not self-motivated get overlooked and under utilized."
good,chase is a great place to work if you are starting out in the industry.  They typically have a lot of turn over and managers are pretty strict.  You have to hit your numbers.
good,"JP Morgan is a name brand,  which makes your resume look good. but you have to work hard day and night to make sure your boss is satisfied. Compensation is not competitive comparing with tier 2 bank."
good,Enjoyed everyone there always helpful and made sure everything went smoothly from day to day! Verifying checks making sure they processed at a timely manner.
good,During my time at Chase I've learned a lot about customer service and banking regulations. It pays well for what you are doing but the real reason to work here is the benefits. It's hard to find a job like Chase without having a college degree of some kind.
good,"I have been with the company 7 years and I have worked in a total of 4 departments in 6 different roles.  While I do like my team and management, I do not feel like the amount of stress is covered by the compensation."
good,"When the company was ""Bank One"" it was an amazing company to work for. They were generous with commission and they didn't make you feel like a number. They appreciated you and your family. They had nice insurance that was reasonable act... Chase purchased them and the Turnover is terrible."
good,Just ok. Chase pushes tellers to make referrals. Management needs improvement. The only way to move up is being a banker since they got rid of assistant  management roles. The teller pay is low i started with 11.25 as a part time teller and then full time as a vault teller after a 1 1/2 to $11.75.
good,Im just typing to fill in blanks nothing to say in this area but it is required. there should be a way to skip this and not make people write nonsense
good,"Recruiting, defining job requirements and engaging in vendor management. Domestic and Globally. Traveled extensively, based in India to start up Asset Management Team in Bangalore, India a dedicated QA support team."
good,"Very busy environment , Too many layers in completing many simple job functions. Better training maybe required."
good,"Had a pretty good experience, was offered a very good opportunity. Unfortunately the position was eliminated early on into the role. I like the people and staff, all worked to meet goals every month."
good,"The department I worked in lacked the ability to be reasonable when it comes to managing the balance between productivity and quality. I couldn't move from seat because of Gap reports. Management treated their employees like robots. Little reason why so many employees were on short-term disability. The ability to pass on information regarding company updates or networking was insufficient. Most importantly what I learned from this company was to Cover Your Own Behind not teamwork."
good,"Highly rated company that maintains good professional check for employees, good cafetaria, good salary, highly professional people that have lost human touch."
good,"Enjoyed working there in various positions and learned a lot. A growing company worldwide. the location I worked at closed and jobs to moved to other states through out,"
good,JPM is great place to work for someone who can be molded to what is expected of the individual. you do have great benefits and ability learn a great deal about banking.
good,If you need to get a quick start in your career and get paid way less then you're good for employment here. I get paid way less then most Assistant Branch Manager in any other bank.
good,Good for goal oriented hard working people. Work Life balance was not possible due to extended work hours. It is a very competetive and challenging enviornment.
good,"Only looks good on resume. They expect alot from you for little pay. "
good,"Pros:"
good,Great branch managers in the branch locations. The operation centers depending area of business can be very stressful with limited opportunity for advancement.
good,This company ensures job security and advancement and management believes in promoting from within and getting those who desire to advance to the next level.
good,"I have no comments to complete this review at this time. If I had to say something about the company and job I would just say that is was okay. Other than that, no comment."
good,This was just a stepping stone to something more. I was here to pass the time and to pad this review. Why do you have to fill this out? Just post my resume.
good,I've been in my current role for 6 months and have had very little training. I came from a totally different side of the bank and have been expected to perform a variety of new tasks with very little/no training
good,Collections was too hard to make goal for bonus. They as well over hired to compensate work load. When I left they were about to lay people off. Did not work there long enough to fairly rate.
good,very well organized. good audit practices. good product/application documentation. good people to work with. very professional and knowledgeable. good work life balance
good,In enjoyed working during my tenor with JP Morgan due to its fantastic work life balance feature. But overall I also found lack of opportunity for learning and dual management within Company.
good,Pretty fast paced but not anything to hard to handle.  I would recommend this as a place to work very supportive team that believes in helping one anoher
good,"If you want an aggressive and competitive working environment, then this place is for you. JPMorgan has a lot to offer especially to young and new partners"
good,I learned a lot about project management while at JPMC.  this organization has a well defined PMO and provides team members with every opportunity to be successful.
good,"JPMorgan is a very large bank. It has investment banking and equity research, along with retail banking. It operates globally. It has very many employees."
good,"inbound calls, stressful, compliance, slow software, not great recognition, pay is ok, good benefits, leadership program and alot of different departments."
good,"Ok job to work at slow most of the days some days are really busy, no progress in moving up especially outside the branch. The Career opportunities are non existent."
good,"Working on the merger and the special project with JP Morgan Chase was interesting.  The workplace culture with their LGBT team was comforting.  However, the poor management in my department made it a unpleasant place to work."
good,"I don't really have must to say about this company, there was nothing special about it. I prefer not to review any of my employments and I'm not sure what that has to do with me searching for employment"
good,Ok place to work for production work team player temporary only seasonal couple months out the year wish it was all year  round sometimes you will be on call.
good,"decent place to work at. Not a lot of room for advancement. Salary is nothing exceptional, neither are the raises. Benefits were great though. Not a bad starter place"
good,"Lot of opportunities to move around the company and go up if you are willing to establish your network. Along with your skills, networking goes a long way."
good,"Jp Morgan, professional call center, extremely high call volume, not enough workers to cover the floor, It is large and they do have fun activities and great team support, several potlucks, and parties. I love it because you receive benefits the first day you start. The company is large, making advancing difficult."
good,Nice work environment great people to work with was my first teller job so I learned a lot from this job and they were very flexible with my work schedule
good,"As a teller, you are the most essential and vital organ in banking. In my day i usually managed the ATM's, so i would be in work from 7:30am and i would leave work after 7pm. The hours were not flexiable so it made going to school very difficult. I did learn how to handle cash and how to engage in policy and procedure."
good,"	Perform PC Deployments, resolve trouble tickets software/hardware repair break-fix and Data Center Builds                                                                                                                                     "
good,The benefits and work life balance are positive factors of working at Chase. The workplace culture is fun and diverse.  I would recommend Chase as an enjoyable place to work.
good,"Good people, job was only a contract position so I do not feel I am qualified to be filling this out since I was only there for a few months.  While I was there, it was a rewarding."
good,"My career really grew at the company, I was able to learn a lot.  The recent location strategy changes with regards to finance roles, and offshoring as well as onshoring to another state outside of NYC has led to changes in environment and culture."
good,"I was a contractor at JPMChase so many of these questions do not pertain to me.  JPMChase is a fast paced very competitive company to work for.  I did not particularly like the way they treated contractors, but my direct manager was very professional in how she worked with me."
good,"Training was cut down from 3 weeks to 1 week, should have been kept at 3 weeks. "
good,"Work balance was missing with this company.  High turn over of staff due to long hours, high stress levels and mismanagement.  Teams were divided and not much unity within the organization."
good,A lot depends on the direct  manager.  A good manager can make a bad job ok.  A poor manager can make a great job unbearable.  Case #  2 is why I left.
good,Typical day at work would be reading my emails first thing in the morning to make sure I didn't miss any rush requests.  The most enjoyable part of this job is my team.  They are a joy to be around and makes the day go by faster.
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. I would recommend Chase to friends and family. Like any business it has it downfall but I would definitely recommend the company to others seeking employment"
good,"Proactively work with clients to discover financial needs and provide product/service recommendations"
good,"Good company overall. However, constantly upgrading archaic systems and software.The training could be better too.. Underwhelming for a fortune 1000 company."
good,The company at the time offered stability in the mortgage industry.  It also offered room to grow.  This was a place to find the best of what is being offered.
good,"J.P. has a strong brand name and looks great on a resume. If you land the right position there it can be a long term place to build a career. Benefits are pretty standard nothing extraordinary. Very large firm and communication between teams and departments can be challenging. Very diverse, global financial services firm offering many opportunities. Blue blood firm has been around over 100 years. Entry level jobs offer licensing and good training."
good,"Long work hours, work-life balance seems to be non-existent, good mentors though mentors may not have the time to guide you as uch as they'd like to, friendly team."
good,"Separation with Chase does not allow me to disclose anything. "
good,"YUCK ! , so far mine worst life working experience, well to be honest it gave me so much that i can´t even describe, you will understand how to treat your bosses and that you have to simply stand your ground, be careful with who are you talking.. they might use it against you.. well you know people"
good,"“I saw a story a few months ago on the news about the outreach the company does with the community.  Giving back is a big part of my personal philosophy and I was excited to see that there was a company that felt the same way.  You can imagine how excited I was when I found out there was a job opening in my skill set here.  I really hoped to be able to come to work every day to a place where I knew not only are my technical skills valuable, but my personal philosophies are as well, but that was not my experience and they gave preference to a white male and I am a black woman."
good,JPMorgan Chase was a solid company to work.  At the time there were a lot of overtime put in with no pay.   Some of the corporate activities were exciting (i.e. the corporate challenge).
good,It was great professional environment. We worked as a group in tandem with other team players. The management ensured that it was a respectful and diverse culture.
good,Working at Chase was very stressful due to the fact that the position and departments have to meet deadlines and being a collector was a very tough thing to do when the economy is going through tough times. Trying to collect was like pulling teeth. I am pretty sure that other departments were not as stressful as collection.
good,"It is a phase job. Better than a fast food restaurant job, but limited opportunity for advancement, and no salary growth potential. There are benefits, but they are average"
good,Everyone follows the rules but it is fun to work with people who knows the business well. The work is enjoyable even if the load is heavy. Diversity..
good,"The area I worked in lacked supportive leadership at the director level and micro-managed managers and projects. The supportive, fun and collaborative work environment I need to be successful was lacking. Teamwork was not encouraged."
good,I got this job through an agency.  I liked that you stayed busy and you knew what you had to do everyday.  The people were nice and helpful when it can to learning material.
good,"Low comp, & micromanagement, not much room for advancement or upward mobility. Can make decent money but commission structure is not in your favor. 3 stars"
good,"As with any large organization, you will always find good vs not as good pockets - Chase is no different.   Overall the organization is stable with a firm foundation."
good,Continually going down hill. Always wanting more and giving no more. Low pay. Little real advancement opportunities. They pretend to have employee appreciation.
good,There are many nice people there. I met some nice people while I worked there. I enjoyed working with the people. Other than the people I worked I have no opinion.
good,"could be a lot better..."
good,"As a developer working for front office applications, I spent a lot of overtime work. However, there was a big support from my manager and team when it comes to finishing a project."
good,Chase was a nice company to work for i worked 3 shift and a check sorter. fast pace and somethime could be stressful but the people would work together and get the job done.
good,Ok place to work.  The way they give a monthly scorecard is horrible. They base the scorecard on 5 calls out of 1300 I take each month.  If you had a bad day or gave info that one call can mess up your scorecard.
good,"management is not great, pay and benefits are good. Days can get a bit long, not much room for growth but plenty of opportunity to get sales which are key to getting paid well"
good,Opportunities are available for those that put in the effort.  The culture is somewhat difficult to break into and it's more of a who you know environment.
good,The pace was slow at JP Morgan. The management seemed unorganized. Coworkers were friendly and willing to help in all ways though. Location was ideal.
good,Working at JP Morgan is an average experience. Although there are rooms to develop but limited to go up the ladder. Decisions are focused on profit making not people making.
good,A typical day at work is pretty stressful. I got to work with various technologies in a global infrastructure. Management is not fair as it favors certain individuals over others!
good,"Great work environment. Good people. Banking is fun, but kind of boring. Handling money was fun, and customer interaction. I was originally an employee of WAMU, and was part of the transition to chase."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a nationally known company with employment opportunities the world over.  My experience was positive as I worked remotely and felt included on a team many states away.  The company is so large that you do feel small and under-appreciated at times.
good,"They pay lower than other banks.  The longer you work there the less you end up making.  Unfortunately, they don't reward dedication.  On the plus side they are good at what they do.  Senior management is good and well paid, so they make good decisions."
good,"People make the difference and definitely enhances the  work place culture, The management is  very engaging and works hard to assist their employees any way they can."
good,"If you are looking for security with ability to make commission, chase is a solid place to work. The atmosphere can severely be determined by management."
good,"Multiple requests to review files and upload to the database for further reviews of properties pertaining to titles, rights, foreclosure, eviction, and the like. Management skills and how to keep an influence over the team to accomplish goals. Hardest part of the job is the continuous influx of cases/files/properties to review and vet. Most enjoyable was the team I worked with in my specific space."
good,"Make sales calls to meet company goals to acquire new consumer banking accounts. "
good,Great benefits.  Management varies depending on who you get.  Too much stress on everyone doing the same thing in terms of what to say and how to perform.
good,"The job work and life balance are not even. The employees always need to work on the weekends. The benefits are not good, bad medical insurance. Job culture is so so."
good,Handled customers account who had difficulty paying their mortgage. Ran information to see if they qualified for loan assistance. Faxed copy and scanned documents as needed. Answered calls
good,"My work day included sales of Chase products and customer account maintenance. Making sure all contact info was updated on the patient. Also if the branch teller side was busy, I stepped in to assist with cashing checks, deposits, etc. I trained my co-workers on new and updated material and work side by side with them to assist with customer accounts. It was fast pace and very competitive work place. For me overall the job was easy and I caught on very quickly"
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"Having good experience in the Information Technology Industry and also healthy participation in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) including analysis, design, coding."
good,"If you are a hard worker and like a fast paced team environment Chase is  a good company to work for. The hardest part will be dealing with customers who may be rude but, if you just put yourself in their shoes and understand that your dealing with money you will be just fine."
good,"A typical day usually starts and ends with emails. You will be able to receive calls also from clients checking on their bank accounts or requesting for their funds to be checked or wire transfer information and other banking needs. "
good,It is great to work with like minded and qualified individuals who are passionate about Banking. People are competitive and believe in new challenges.
good,Job was easy and secure.Good workplace and great people to work with.Management provides timely feedback on performance and improvement plans.Good compensation.
good,"JPMC's various mergers - and its 21-month outsourcing of 2/3 of its technology to IBM - made for a varied experience.  Heavy emphasis on regulations and audit-readiness, as to be expected in a financial institution such as this, sometimes made for the proverbial ""red tape"".  Much back-and-forth on how to align/manage IT service delivery - alternating between central, and then business sector aligned, allocation of Technology teams.  All-in-all, though, a positive (IMO) experience working at the company."
good,"High security stressful job. Lots of changes in processing the checks. Seemed like once you learned something the process was changed. Glad it was temporary. All types working there, You were on camera the entire time you were working. Certain attire could be worn."
good,If you are just starting your career start at chase and move up. low pay but the knowledge is there to learn. The atmosphere is very corporate but if you have a great team around you than its awesome.
good,Good learning experience. Lots of activities. Employee centric. Employee benefits were good. Management was approachable. Would recommend to others. One of the better places to work at in the banking world.
good,"Fast passed, high pressure place to work at."
good,"Good benefits, but not much room for mobility.  Management is good but I wish they would hire internals vs external hiring more.  There are so many talented internal employees who can be great candidates for management."
good,"Don't apply here if you are thin skinned, the environment is extremely fast paced and cut throat. The hours are long and work is tedious and rarely challenging unless you are highly regarded."
good,"Very stressful environment. A typical day at work was answering 100 calls of mean customers, people screaming on the phone."
good,WaMu is now Chase and many people I know don't like the current iteration of the bank. Can't really make a valid recommendation. WaMu was great though.
good,"There is a lot of opportunity at Chase if you know the right people. Management is usually someone that is put in the position because they were going to be laid off otherwise. The team employees usually know more about the job than the supervisor. They heavily play favorites. They profess an employee first environment, but in my 7 years there, I never witnessed it. Employees are put in different positions with no warning. The motto is ""the C in Chase stands for Change"", and they definitely mean it."
good,overall it is a good company to work for...the pay sucks starting out but within a year i have qualified for two pay increase but considering the workload i think it should have been more...you are able to move around easily..
good,"Management was great but banking culture was just okay.  After having over 30 years in the financial industry, Chase treats their employees like they are new hires"
good,excellent place to work. lots of opportunities to grow and the money is pretty good especially if you dont have a post secondary education. too bad they left surrey
good,"Intense environment, politics drive advancement. Not many in management that care rather do what they can to advance their own agendas. Some very smart people, but pretentious."
good,In JPMC you get opportunity to learn new technologies and tools. But on many instances have to extend working hours and in timesheet it reflects as well that I have worked more than 20% on monthly basis.
good,"• Provided personalize and professional service to customers, to include mortgage account retention options; rate and/or product information; also opening new mortgage accounts; FDIC coverage"
good,"not clear expectations/policies.  work is good and the people are nice.   great benefits and many locations as well as opportunity to transfer, but not for at least one year"
good,My experience at JPMC hasn't been the best. This was my first job right out of college. I learned a lot and developed a lot of skills however the management style is very top down. Management makes decisions based on what they think is happening instead of actually walking the floors and seeing what day to day production is like.
good,I worked there for three years. the work life balance is good. I was able to take the time off when I need too. most of the management is flexible. I had good customer service experience.
good,Very much favoritism. You are expected to give everything you have plus some but get no waivers in return. Loved the job itself but not the company. They lead the public to believe they care personally for their employees but they don't.
good,"The worst part of the job is the customers themselves. Between the sense of entitlement or the pure ignorance every interaction creates a headache. "
good,"Working in the Global Trades was a enjoyable experience, the staff was helpful and informative. Learned to use other systems with in Chase and processing of documents."
good,"Working on the retail side is challenging on work like balance. You will work most weekends, get the lowest bonuses and advancing outside of the retail division is tough. Not impossible but challenging."
good,So I worked here during the buyout/conversion took place and everything was very unorganized. Some people were not sure if they were going to be able to keep their jobs or be laid off. We were moved around from department to department for a couple of months
good,This was a good experience. The company was helpful and had a lot of opportunities for growth. Most of the people in the firm were helpful and pleasant to work with
good,"Good company to work for however, the desire to drive efficiency results in higher demands on staff, resulting in 12+ hour days at both the exempt and non-exempt levels."
good,Did work as a teller did not like the pay or the way the sales expectations were and how aggressive they were with the bankers to generate the business and even the tellers as well.
good,"JP Morgan is a trypical US investment bank which owns it's ranking thanks to it drive to be the best in what it does."
good,"Productive and opportunities to grow"
good,Fast paced high call volume.  Working with consumers deposit accounts and credit card accounts is fairly easy but there are times the calls can be challenging. Employee should possess excellent communication skills and problem solving skills. Should be comfortable multitasking and offering products available to strengthen business ties.
good,"Good company overall, do a number of things well on the employee engagement front. However, focuses too heavily on controls and not the people who do the job everyday. Compensation is very good, however you work harder than most other organizations & work life balance tends to suffer."
good,The department I worked in had very limited opportunities and would give you a point against your attendance for any little thing. When my father passed away they decided to use my vacation time while I attended his services.
good,I worked here while going to school. It was a good place to work. The work atmosphere was good. The branch manager was awesome. I would recommend this place to work
good,"Stressful, though the company is good. The first time it's good but as time goes by management began to be strict with regards to employee output. Training also is very good."
good,"When a company gets to big it is hard to make sure everyone knows how much they are appreciated, it is something you learn to know with proper management."
good,"Chase is a great bank to work for, they just need to appreciate the staff more. They lack genuine employee appreciation.  As well as how to grow the business without interrupting the daily focusses across the company when other areas slip. Balance Chase balance!!!"
good,Great place to start your career. Ample opportunities to learn and grow and explore things. Have been involved in financial analysis and other core finance activities. Very good work life balance can be expected out of here.
good,This job is better for younger individuals. Low base salary makes it very difficult for a career. They keep making it harder to hit you 100% pay-out on commission by raising the bar and also capping out the max one can make from each customer. Minimal raises. Unimaginable errors one can make from account opening that can reduce pay raise.
good,The banking industry is very competitive. The benefits were great and they tried to practice work/life balance. There was opportunity for advancement.
good,My manager at Chase bank was very helpful to find a way to balance my job and home life. Chase also devotes a lot of time and effort to ensure that their employees are well trained. I appreciated their commitment to educate their employees.
good,A typical day at chase as  a business analyst is pretty busy. There is never a dull moment. As a business analyst you will learn meaning job functions and network with upper management. At times this job can get stressful but you will always learn something new in the process.
good,I learned many things in my years with the company. Depending on the type of manager would dictate the work environment. Overall it was a fun but hectic position.
good,"good benefits"
good,It was very fast paced environment. The people I worked with were all very helpful and never had a problem assisting with learning how everything worked.
good,It is a very stressful place to work. Hard to have career progression in very big teams. Not a lot of room for development or training as very stressful.
good,Chase overall was a good to their employees. It is a huge company so sometimes people can get lost in the shuffle. The culture was very quiet and being Seattle sometimes felt like you were far away from major decisions being made.
good,"I used to enjoy working here, however they show no loyalty to those who have shown loyalty to them.  Got laid off after 12 years, and received no help to be placed within the company."
good,"I worked at 41st Floor, I just loved the 360 degree view.."
good,"a typical day: interesting"
good,i liked it ok but i was bad at my job. bad enough that eventually my boss advised me i should find a new job because she didn't want to fire me. it was nice of her to give me a warning like that
good,"management could have been more suuportive, more team meetings and develop each individual skills and areas of improvement is def need more attention."
good,Stressful work environment with constant worries of being laid off. Great benefits and emergency daycare is a bonus. The cafeteria and additional training is a plus.
good,I enjoyed my job at Chase because it was very different from what I was used to. I learned a lot about working on a machine and having to figure out what was wrong based on what was happening with the material. It could be fast paced when the machine was working properly and we actually had product to run from the printers. When it was slow we had to find things to do and after a couple hours it was hard to find more to do to pass the time. Managers unorganized and did not communicate.
good,"Some managers don't treat consultants respectfully, I know this is not true of all managers, but in my case it was. Highlights include verbal abuse, long hours, little payoff."
good,"long hours of work, if you will not render overtime your score will be deducted, all tasks are being scored. Its just that your in school being graded monthly and if you did not pass the score, you will not get salary appraisal."
good,"The employer has plenty room for growth, however it was hard to achieve. They were very selective on who will move up. People there are great to work with."
good,"Would begin with logging online and getting the daily goals set up for all the employees.  Once employees would make it in, I would get them to acknowledge their goals a set up our hourly pace to hit our goals."
good,"-Extremely fast paced environment"
good,Stressful with the quotas and constantly worrying about how phone calls are monitored.  The first line managers did follow up on training and made sure we knew exactily what chase demanded of its associates.
good,Very stressful position; company is numbers driven and the employee gets lost in the shuffle. People were friendly but company itself doesn't seem to care about the employee.
good,Chase was a terrific place to work and I really enjoyed the fast pace.  I only left to pursue another line of work.  I would recommend highly.  Overall a fun and fast paced environment.
good,Great company and stressful environment. Fast paced. I learned a lot about the job I was doing and got to know a great bunch of people. Liked the hours.
good,"Chase is an average company. It is typical of any large institution with good benefits and lots of regulation. Given that it has so many lines of business, it is easy to advance."
good,"Focus is getting high balanced clients in the seat to see a financial adviser. Also, to get as many people to use online banking as possible, so there was more time to call higher balance clients and get them in for an account review."
good,"The banking world can be a big one or small one, depending on how you view it. There is room for improvement. You get to network and if your a people person you will like it."
good,So far it's just like any job they say you can get more hours if you are hired part time but the possibility of that happening is unlikely. Management could be better as well.
good,"Lots of talented, capable people.  Very low tolerance for risk.  Decision making is very centralized but generally fair.  Senior management has high integrity."
good,"ok company, i was only a temp with the company so i learned a lot from when i was with them, thank you for the opportunity!  i would recommend this company to anyone"
good,it depends on the teams. generally JP Morgan is paying it's employee less than market average. But it is a huge organization so there are a lot of mobility
good,As a young professional working with JPM I was given a good amount of responsibilities and was able to learn a lot about asset management. Anglo Sachsen culture.
good,There's much to list for all a single typical day consists of. I have 6 clip boards of information I have to track daily that's to start. We do a lot.
good,"In the area that I was in (Escrow) The work is continual.  I learned about the taxes on different properties.  I was responsible to make sure that the taxes were paid on escrowed properties.  The only thing that bothered me a little was that some of the managers had favorites but generally they did treat most fairly."
good,long term goals weren't well established by management. The role of the team was almost purely to handle ad hoc request from the finance team and no real progress was made long term.
good,"All companies are great, it all depends on who you work for. By far Chase has the most resources out of any company I have worked for.Which is the key to your success if you have a sales role."
good,"Lots of sharp talent, but Employees are secondary to corporate profits. Upper management tends to focus on their priorities, so the employees need to look out for their own career. This is not unusual in Corp America."
good,It's a better place for a Banker than a Technologist as the main focus is on banking and financial transactions as a service. There have been repeated purges of the technology staff in attempts to increase the bottom line. The pay and benefits are fair but there are limited opportunities for advancement in the technology department and it is not an especially secure place to work regardless of performance for the lower echelons regardless of position as positions are filled/removed according to immediate demand.
good,"The work is very ""robotic"""
good,"Management seems to favor certain people over more qualified, lot of nepotism, manager would give certain information, and when the information harms you, he would then revert to company policy."
good,Was a job until they offshored my position to India and after training the offshore team for a year I was laid off.  Besides that an okay company to work for.
good,"It can be stressful but rewarding at the same time, but sometimes the position or job will be fading away to our overseas partners.  I have to make some better moves to secure my future and family."
good,"My brief time here was OK.  If you like working for a larger organization then this one might be for you.  Unfortunately, during my tenure of under a year I had three bosses due to high turnover."
good,A good place to work. Nice people I really liked it. They are nice pay was good. Nice people and a good place to work fun people and I like them. Good pay and paid time off
good,"Hard to advance in the company"
good,Jpmorgan was great a place to work the co-workers were there for each other and  that created a team environment. But the the culture was for sure  business first
good,"- My days go by fast with the heavy load in hand."
good,"Good. I am only writing because its compulsory, otherwise indeed is would not let go further."
good,"JP Morgan Chase, was one of the most laid back places to work, until the work ran out in the department that I worked in. I believe that if my department didn't get forced to shut down I would still be there."
good,"40 hour work week "
good,Good job to get back into the work force. Good pay and benefits lots of micromanaging in the department I was in. Many different areas to branch out to once you pass your initial year.
good,I would suggest friends to apply. I learned a great deal about the mortgage industry. There is a great deal of growth within the company and many people have made this their life long career
good,My first manager was amazing. My supervisor was very understanding. Once the new manager came in there were new policies in efffect and tellers were unappreciated. Promises were made none were kept. Werent concerned about employees concerns.
good,Very corporate structure with no work-life balance. Compensation and benefits are okay. Not a whole lot of space to advance your career. Some exposure to latest technologies.
good,It is a great place to work if you have the drive and worth ethic but there isn't much support and there is a lot of overlap with other branches as they work your leads.
good,"Don't really expect to work yourself up into a corporate office working for Chase Bank as a teller. "
good,"Its a very hectic job with hectic management to handle. Process wise learnt lot of things. But growth wise, it is not employee friendly. Night shifts are bad"
good,"Strong culture, good benefit and compensation. Lots of opportunities for network and job rotation across functions, but it's hard to make a big impact."
good,"was a good place to work, had good benefits, a place to eat so you didn't have to drive anywhere and management that keep you up to date on how you were doing"
good,"It can be hard to work in corporate offices that are not NY, which is the company's hub. "
good,"JPMC is a very large company and experiences can very widely across the firm and even the same organization. "
good,"Chase is a great place to retire, they offer great benefits and incentives to employees. They have many different areas where an employee can find their career match."
good,The hardest part is trying to get out of telephone banking they seem to pigeon hole people there. Great Benefits and vacation time off. The culture is pressed hard.
good,"Extremely long days, immense pressure and no support.  I made some really good friends."
good,"Good Compay for Entry Level Position, but navigate at your own risk. Alot of potential lateral moves. Very difficult to jummp from job are ro job area."
good,"challenging environment, high caliber employees.  You learn how to work independently to push your agenda through and complete tasks.  Advancement can be difficult depending on your area"
good,"If you are lucky, you get a great manager, but then, don't get comfortable, they will change them and the direction of the company.  Feel they are lost right now in their direction (it changes every time regulations change) and their expectations are unrealistic."
good,The company is a multinational but work culture is not very westernized. The working hours is on the higher side and the culture is more inclined towards later shifts. There is nil customer interaction and hence work becomes mundane after a prolonged period of time.
good,"Take inbound calls from customers, assist on account information, file claims when needed. Computer experience in job function. Assist other employees with questions."
good,"The average day is to achieve sales, provide excellent customer service, and maintain strong operational procedures to reduce fraud. Each quarter there are different categories to boost."
good,"i was not thrilled with all the security but I have to understand it is a bank therefore they would need to be really secretive, also the co-workers where all in bad moods every single day"
good,"large company, offer a great salary and wonderful benefits, stay on top of workplace  happenings. never had to worry about your personal info being disclosed"
good,Working at JP Morgan will help you build your career. Plenty of job opportunities. You have plenty of chances to make your own path to success within the company.
good,"I was on pins and needles for the first year of my job. I never knew if I was going to be able to come back the next day. The culture is cut throat as most everyone knows. After gaining confidence and finding success I became a little more comfortable and had fun with the job for about 3 years. After working hard and reaching success, I found that it was never good enough and that the pressure from managers and department heads could never be satisfied. I left under a re-hireable status but would find myself to be hard pressed to return into such a lifestyle. The company is formidable and strong. I was pleased and thrilled that they would give me the training possible to make a successful run in the industry"
good,great company with great culture and balanced life and work style. There is a plenty of overtime and weekends work sometimes.The management is great people
good,Met good co-workers here. Great security. Monthly town hall type meetings held to discuss new procedures and anything else that may affect the group and any questions or concerns.
good,This company was a good place to work.  Worked on closing packaged HUD statements  and ordered funds. This management team were knowledgeable. Company was not that busy when I was employed.
good,"It was good experience to have. I worked with great partners; Financial advisers, Mortgage bankers and Private client bankers.  I learned a lot about the banking industry as well as gained experience in financial advising and mortgage banking."
good,"In my experience with Chase I found the culture to be totally out of the box."
good,JPM is a good company to start your career as it offers great entry level positions across different lines of businesses and functional teams.
good,It was a solid first job that was not without it's issues. I have not been a part of the firm for two years so I cannot comment on the management at this time.
good,"I enjoyed working with my team, learned a lot from the both of the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was the workload, it was very overwhelming at times but with the help of my mentor I was able to get organized and prioritize my work."
good,"Expectation is to do more with less, lots of promises but little support and follow through from management.  The potential for greatness is there for anyone, unfortunately it does not matter if you are a star;  in the end the deciding factor in your success depends on who you know and their tenure in the company."
good,"Obviously, this bank is very well-established and they strive every day to continue the progress they've had over the past 5 years.  It's a challenge to navigate the hierarchy and get a sense of how things are organized but otherwise, I've found the people here to be helpful and accommodating."
good,"Project driven at all cost. JPMC provided all required tools for success. The PM manages many calls on a typical day. The PM is also required to manage the project administration task to remain on schedule, and manage milestone dates."
good,"JP morgan chase is one of the best companies to work once its about wor-life balance. If you really like your life to be challenging, then this might not be the best fit for you."
good,Very busy job but something new to learn everyday. Great benefits. Great place to advance in.  Job culture is good as well. Work/life balance it is not easy.
good,"What can I say?  We had some good times ,  good people working toward the same goal.  We always found a way to have fun at the same time!  I believe being a true team player is so important in any situation"
good,Duties at work are difficult but manageable. Pay/raises is not consistent with work performed.  Bank is very good at letting employees balance their work/life schedules.
good,"While they did have many aspects to the work place and attitude to give the appearance that they were an IT company, the corporate leviathan nature of it all still bled through. Colorful work spaces, writable walls or even game rooms couldn't hide it."
good,"Lots of great things about JP Morgan, well paid, good products and lots of smart people. But its leadership is sporadic and is often desperate to hit a result. Huge ego's."
good,"JP Morgan are a very well respect investment bank and their reputation speaks for itself. Good salary, benefits and job security."
good,"JP Morgan are a very well respect investment bank and their reputation speaks for itself. Good salary, benefits and job security."
good,job work/life balance was a plus. However during high deliverable cycles departmental pressure created tension for quick turn around and quick analysis for testing or for external source reviews.
good,"Awesome exposure to different industries across geographies"
good,"Overall the company has some great mentors that are able to identify your talents, but the structure of the company as a whole has become upside down."
good,"Everyone will have their own unique experience here. Mine was okay.  They suffer from being to large in my opinion."
good,"Very stressful, no work life balance, very high expectations."
good,"Very business like company, Can get very busy at times. You will have to deal with a lot of changes. Good paying job but not a lot of room for growth."
good,"Working the treasury sales team, I focused on building relationships with company's focusing on institutional sales. I built sales presentations to help increase customer and product engagement."
good,I enjoyed Chase Bank for the most part. There was always something new to learn. I loved meeting and becoming acquainted with customers when they came in to make transactions.
good,"enjoyed going to work everyday"
good,"great training in to aggressive sales, technology is very advanced and easy for employees to accommodate clients, will like to be less micro managing"
good,"A typical day at work consist of strategically planning your pipeline of 200+ plus loans needing SLA compliance every three days per Investor guidelines. "
good,I liked working for the company. The only thing that I had a problem with was micromanaging. I feel that adults should be trusted to be adults.
good,had 3 great branches co-workers where great the loans i did get you could not of closed them processing was not good but U/W where very helpful.
good,It was ok working here. The people are nice and it is a nice environment. I worked as a web designer and found it frustrating that decisions were always made based on hippo opinions as opposed what users wanted.
good,The team was very supportive. There was some drama in the back between other employees which made the job interesting and horrible at times. The customers were the best part of the job.
good,"Temporary contracts are both good and bad. I was still in training and having the accounts I was opening kicked back to me to further edify the clients' paperwork, they canceled my contract."
good,I dont want to talk about it. The place has good and bad like any other but be wary of having to get fmla. Its a good job to gain experience and then move on.
good,"Great place for career minded people, room for mobility and advancement.  Great team atmosphere and partnership across functions and businesses"
good,A typical day at work consisted of compiling numbers for various reports due to numerous legal entities across the globe. This was challenging work but rewarding.
good,I am not very happy with how this company noted my file after I stopped working there. I am eligible for rehire and  can not get a callback for any of the jobs I've applied for since I've stopped working there. I was a top performer while I was on the job.
good,"Easy work, have to fallow government rules set in place, there is nothing hard about this job. Pay is not the best to support a family alone. recommend the job to someone looking for experience."
good,Aggressive sales techniques but I have heard that they recently improved. Focuses more on service than sales now. Still a long way to go.
good,10-Key was a typical day at work.  I learned about processing corporate and personal accounts and remittance.  Managers were good and fair.
good,Chase has great benefits and pay but they are getting rid of the personalized banking experience.  It's also very difficult to get full time employment.
good,"Overall the benefits and pay are in line with company standards."
good,"Balance life and work is hard. Depending on management."
good,"""Work life balance for all employees was very generous"" "
good,Reviewing and modifying clients applications online. A computer based job function and daily researching. What I learned at this job was to how to work fast and efficiently by the hour.
good,"Hardest part of the job is the politics floating around, upper management focuses on people they feel to be a team lead of manager. I believe that they play favorites in order for people to become team leads "
good,I did not really like it. It was a stuffy job atmosphere. Very corporate and very down your throat. I guess new version of office space. People are very robotic.
good,"Seasoned professional with proven experience in large-scale implementations and strategic initiatives in the Retail, Corporate/Investment and Institutional lines of business. Works effectively in a global team environment with demonstrated project management skills and a commitment to quality and continuous process improvement.

good,this was a serious but organized environment.  I learned a lot from working here as everything was so detailed and organized
good,Overall great company with great work life balance. Only drawback is they like to hire outside rather than promote from within  the company. If you arent the assertive tpe that likes to shake hands your chances of moving up the chain are slim.
good,"good to come in to CWM and get licenses, not much room for growth after taking associate position. Moves to advisor are possible, but rare."
good,Never get to take your vacation when you would like too or get to works shift you prefer even after years of employment . To short handed to send for more training to further career.
good,"I enjoyed working for JPMorgan Chase.  I was able to build relationships with my peers as well as our callers on a daily basis.  My position required me to engage in customer interaction and every day was a new lesson learned.  My co workers were exceptional and the environment was a very comfortable place to be. The most challenging part of my position as a supervisor was dealing with upset/angry customers, however, by using the skills I acquired within my time with the company I was able to de-escalate the situation and provide a solution to almost any issue."
good,"•Gather documents, submit complete loans to underwriting and clear outstanding conditions and prep and submit files to closing."
good,This particular temporary assignment was great because I learned a lot and meet a lot of great people.  Even though this was around the time when people where loosing their jobs left and right.  I was happy and blessed that I was able to be employed.  I can take what I learned from this employer and use it today.
good,I was trained for two weeks on how to use their computer systems and when I began using the computer system on my own I found the training to be not very useful.
good,"J.P. Morgan is a productive place to work. I had the opportunity to work for different Lines of Business and learnt tons, to the point it seemed as if I was in a boot camp for financial services/corporate. On the downside, we were usually understaffed which meant working long hours. "
good,The company overall was great. If I could change any thing its the lack of communication upper management gives like in AVP and above role. More feedback with them would be good.
good,"fast paced, highly informative environment"
good,"I worked for JPMC through Design Strategy, on-call as needed.  Never really knew when I would be finished with my work day. Some days were really short some were extremely long.   Most PCs were dirty and dusty so gloves were a must for me. Other than that people were friendly and respectful."
good,"great work env, no complaints. Compensation issues with hr as far as accuracy is concerned. Love the customer service aspect of the job, it is what i have a passion for."
good,"Daily confirm service levels and sufficient staffing"
good,many events and activities every weekend specially company's sportsfest wherein every employee share their skills and competitiveness to each other
good,A typical day at work immidietly starts with picking out work to complete.  Our production numbers are calculted hourly.  Management and co-workers are ok.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the production requirements.  The most enjoyable part of the job is finding an area on the floor in which you excel so making the production numbers is easier.
good,"too many changes in company are affecting employee experience"
good,"I only worked in the cafe for a few months so it is hard to provide a proper evaluation of the place of company. The cafe/ shop was good fun at times but also went through erratic stages, being very busy to absolutely dead."
good,"Nice work experience ."
good,Lot of learning & exposure. Good company & employee friendly. Scope & opportunities are plenty. Management is responsible & lot of fun activities & camps & trips are included to vibe up the employees.
good,"When I worked for Chase it was a lot of fun. I worked in the mail room with fun people. The only drawback was the pay. we were allowed to listen to music while we work, and often dance while working. It was a lot of fun."
good,"Salary was good"
good,Nice place to work. I enjoyed the work environment and feel that JP Morgan is a good place to work. JP Morgan had a good internship program.
good,"There is never shortage of work every day.  Hard work but we try to maintain a good work balance at the same time.  "
good,"the environment is good because the people you work with are very welcoming, i've learnt a lot through my training even if it was a short training but as i start working i did get good help from my supervisor"
good,"JP Morgan Chase was a great company to work for, but two mergers in 4 years created an air of uncertainty around your job. The high rate of turnover after each merger was unsettling and communication from management was sparse at best."
good,"Work life balance can be difficult at times. Like any job role it is dependent on deadlines etc, so sometimes there can be long weeks but equally there can be times where we are out at 6."
good,"great company to work and grow professionally "
good,"Exciting , friendly co-workers, hardest part of the job is the time sensitivity when volumes spike. Extremely qualified managers which give direction for advancement."
good,Job provided was not of my type...I jumped just bcoz it was just the begining of my career..salary was not satisfied.well there was fun working there...
good,"An environment where you are always learning something new; working with high caliber professionals, and provided with the latest tools  and technologies to support your work."
good,"I was with Chase for 11 years and I learned how to multi task and manage time,  The benefits are well above average and every day is a challenge."
good,I like to be busy all the time. Been able to get different person all the time allow us to learn all kind of stuff every day. That's what I like about working in customer service.
good,secure reason I cannot comment on JPMorgan it is not good place to work management sucks and  performance system measurements cannot be reached
good,A typical day as a teller would be doing multiple transactions and managing money. It was a very busy branch and I learned how to be very patient with customers.
good,"Overall Chase is a OK company to work for. Within the QA department the morale was great; however, in other lines of businesses there were other concerning opinions (time off, mandatory OT)."
good,"Good opportunity to move around the company/businesses"
good,Worked at testing the DDA & Savings application after the conversion of the data from JP Morgan to match the data on Bank One. The functionality for JP Morgan had to be added to the Bank One software to accommodate the environment and program enhancements.
good,Team player and make sure the team meet all deadlines; The deadlines was the hardest part of my job but it was best part because I like a challenge.
good,"We would have daily morning meetings to discuss new policies, and any potential issues that needed a resolution. Verify all appraisals, title, flood insurance, home owners have been ordered. Contact all parties needed for outstanding loan documentation needed for final loan approval. Re-review underwriter conditions. Work a pipeline of 55-60 loans."
good,"Nice company to work for, the manager I worked under was ok. The environment was ok. The system back then was kind of outdated. But no complaints."
good,"Work days were typical 8:30 to 6:30 shifts, depending on the amount of hours that the bank allowed you to have. This is a stable company with great benefits. Mobility is encouraged and the potential to grow is encouraged."
good,"High Pace job. Constantly changing their rules and work procedures."
good,"Good workplace environment with approachable management, but only problem is with the salary part...."
good,This was a migration from Dallas to New York which required hard work and dedication. This was accomplished and corporate actions group is working on a routine basis.
good,"Productive, Salary is Good. But work life balance is not good. Certain times need to work on weekends or stay late in office."
good,"Its a good company, not for me. The building I work in needs help as far as employee wise, and I feel like there isn't a lot of gratitude for those who do well, they expect a lot out of you."
good,"No work life balance. Worked long hours, and really too tired too come in the next day and do it all over again. Management was not supportive at all, and made life a bit harder for us employees"
good,Interesting and insightful job.Resources provide to do job however training was minimal. Coworkers and management friendly and helpful.
good,Managed workflow for Payment Operations.  Managed 50+ employees everyday.  I worked with a great amount of talented Managers and employees.
good,"I had a cool manager. I would not like to discuss or give a review bout GM Financial at this time. So, no thank you, at this point."
good,"It's easy work and you learn about the different documents sent in to the IRS.  The hardest part is dealing with some of the nonsense, but the enjoyable part is getting bonuses."
good,"Overall, great firm with excellent leadership at the top. Can be limited growth potential in some lines of business. Also can be long hours in some lines of business."
good,"	Reconstructed student loan histories. "
good,"The overall work environment and team work were exceptional."
good,"Very large company so as an individual you might get lost.  Decent insurance, great vacation policy and pay is comparable."
good,"Schedules aren't great, a lot of favoritism w/ upper management. You must work weekends. A lot of optional overtime. Not a lot of room to grow."
good,"My work involves Interaction with regional leads, CFO, stakeholders and finance team on a daily basis to ensure accurate financial estimate, automation of exiting processes to provide value add and communicating and implementing new processes."
good,"1) Obviously its a typical Corporate so it will also act like one . But some where it also provided lineancy. "
good,Having worked for JPM Chase for almost 6 years I can neither say they were great nor horrible.  It was a job that at times was very stressful and others very relaxed.
good,"Not much recognition but enjoyed my time there"
good,"there was a long wait for advancement, and not enough pay. the work hours were starting at 4am in the morning which was very hard to get up at 230 to be at work on time."
good,"Answered phones for JP morgan chase regarding customer accounts and fraudulent transactions. good work environment, friendly customers for the most part and good management team."
good,My direct manager and co-workers are the best people I have ever known. Nothing is really that hard about my job the typical is data entry and answering phone calls. I have learned a lot about banking and finance.
good,If you want to learn good practices then JP Morgan is the place for you. Good work environment but lot of work pressure. You can well groom yourself by working here. HR arrange various activities but integrity and confidentiality is must.
good,I would say this a great company to work for. They are very flexible when it comes to scheduling and requesting time off of work. The culture could be enhanced.
good,"Co-workers and Managers are hard working professionals who enjoy what they do, although like in most companies there are times when you have to endure plenty of stress due to staffing challenges to meet high customer satisfaction expectations."
good,a typical day at work for me would be me arriving a work and going on my 1st break in 2 hours and then lunch 2 hours after that. i hated the hours here i would work 4 10 hour days in a row with no room for a different shift
good,"It was a good experience for me, helped a lot of people made a lot of friends, would recommend it to others. Rating a five. Nothing more to say, the company is confidential"
good,"As a teller at Chase you get paid the lowest out of any other bank. If you want the experience, work here for a year and then apply to another bank or job because the big name of chase will help you get a much better job elsewhere. When working here, prepare to do much more then you are intended to do with no raise. If you do get a raise it will be only hundreds of dollars a year which isn't even a dollar more an hour. Working at Chase helped me land a great job which turned into a career. It's a great place to start whether you want to grow in the banking industry or use your knowledge and their name to land you a great job somewhere else."
good,"The company review differs greatly on whom do you ask. It is a huge company and there are jobs and positions that are great, I'm sure. However, to get there you must know the right people. Hard work and knowledge will not get you there. If you are hired to be in the ""trenches"" (branch employees), you really have to know the ""higher ups"" to advance or be ready to something that would compromise your personal integrity and ethics in order to gain their favor. Here they are going above and beyond the federal recommendations, yet with every campaign (that is every quarter), they come up with goals reachable only if you encroach on the very ""above and beyond"" set of rules. Now since you've signed off on the compliance and took the responsibility for your actions, it is not the company that breaches the rules, but you individually. If you, on the other hand, do not reach the campaign goals, you are a lousy worker. They always have something in your file to fire you at the moment's notice. They also start building that file before you even know what's going on around you."
good,Dynamic workplace with equally dynamic colleagues.Critical processes were handled with ease and confidence thanks to encouraging mangers and mentors.The diversity in the team added to the overall success.
good,"Banker teams, investment teams, and service teams who make clients a top priority.  Global leader in market research and customized client attention."
good,"lots of work during the day,"
good,"A typical day at work in my most recent role, involved being information technology support to both internal and external customers."
good,Flexibility is important at any level of job. I enjoy a fast paced work environment finding the root cause of analyzing financial reports
good,"Good company to work for, advancement not so easy. yearly pay raises on the low end. Company has a lot of Diversity. Co-workers are friendly."
good,"Chase has been a great company to work for overall.  They are generally good to their employees and offer fair benefits.  Their online procedure systems are lacking and compile too many departments in their resources, giving too much clutter when seeking simple information.  Their HR department has a failure to notify you after an interview on if you were or were not a candidate in the selection process.  Overall, a great company but navigation and processes can always be improved."
good,I enjoyed my time being a temporary employee in this company. I liked working in the downtown environment and being apart of a real working family.
good,"Flexible and room for improvement within the company. Collaborative environment and a sense of pride. Always opportunities to advance, learn, and grow."
good,"Most people were friendly. However, work pressure is perceptible. Mid-year & annual review process is not interactive. Job security is definitely missing, at least was for me. Information sharing seemed to be very restricted."
good,"Processed inquiries regarding prepaid cards such as demographic updates, statement requests, beneficiaries, power of attorney, etc."
good,"A good organisation to work with, pays good salary along with good medical insurance and other perks. Work culture is good with follow the sun model in almost all departments."
good,I have been with the company for 14 years. i am now looking for growth and development. A challenging and rewarding place to work and grow
good,Highly competitive environment.  Strong leadership and very skilled people working here.  Very little value placed on anything other than work.
good,"YEs, I was very happy and content with Chase and the opportunity I had there, however they had a massive layoff of over 6,000 employees and I was included in that layoff."
good,Jp Morgan is a face day to day pace customer service environment. Great flexibility of the employees personal and business interactions with coworkers and peers.  Great Benefits and 401k Plan.
good,"I thought it would be a great company to work for and in some respect it was. I had amazing colleagues, a great boss, and the customers I dealt with were good people for the most part. "
good,not going to give a review so this should be a choice not a demand. i think its nor fair that indeeds demand you have to do a survey on a place you worked. so here is mines. thank you kindly have a nice day
good,"	Reviewed requirements and specifications and provided input during requirements and specification walkthroughs."
good,"My day start off by signing on to my machine (OPEX Falcon 7200)."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is one of the top 4 bank remaining on the street.  They offer competitive salaries, provide a wealth of information and place there employees first.  They have excellent opportunities for mobility to grow within the company."
good,"JP Morgan is  a company of change.  Tight work schedules, opportunities to learn and good vacations time.  Pay can be better."
good,"This is an okay company to work for. However, they were going through a operational transition during my time there and was not a good fit for me."
good,"Challenging work with knowledgable people. "
good,I was only there for a short time but everything was good. Went through the training and thought it was thorough. The manager held everyone accountable but was always giving feedback. Everyone was friendly and welcoming.
good,"JP Morgan can be a great employer, however, there can be pitfalls in navigating a career path.  Mobility is frequently discussed, but is very challenging when put into practice."
good,JPMorgan is a strong company that continues to grow and show tremendous strength. It has a great history and the foundation of the company was built to last.
good,I would recommend JPMorgan Chase to young college graduates who have a determination to rise to success.  Where I worked there were individuals who did not posses the skills to manage but were placed in managerial positions and employees who possessed managerial qualities and were not allowed an opportunity to showcase their talents. JPMorgan Chase have many diverse organizations for individuals to join and they celebrate diversity in major ways.  I learned a lot from this organization and have taken and applied those lessons to my living.
good,"Great place to work until the layoffs came. I learned a lot and I had great mentors."
good,"High paced work environment for top bank in the US."
good,I enjoyed working at JP Morgan for 2 years as it has pushed me to work as hard as I could and has made helped me evolve very quickly. I have learned and grown professionally tremendously.
good,Did not like the open floor work space one person got sick we all got sick listening to everyone conversation was not fun either. I was hired to fix a job that was messed up by people in Delaware and as soon as we fixed it I was laid off and the job was sent back down to Delaware.
good,"Working for Chase has been great. I have learned a lot while working for this company. They have great benefits, dental, 401k, medical. Vacation and sick time is great. Starting at 3 weeks vacation for all employees and 4 weeks after 4 years. Cons. no life. I worked about 12 hours everyday and sometimes never got to take a lunch break. Worked very hard ever day (which is fine, not for someone that is lazy or can't stand on their feet all day). Loved being able to talk to customers all day and not at a desk 12 hours a day. Job advancement is all about who you know and not what you know (and it is very clear)."
good,"Nice Place To Work. great people with good wok ethic."
good,Average work week demand exceeded 65 hours.  Meritocracy bonus structure set up an environment of stressful competition instead of teamwork. Individuality is frowned upon.
good,I really enjoyed working with JP Morgan chase.This company has Great options for the employees that work for them. Over all this company is the best to work for.
good,"I've never been in a call center environment before. You sit at your desk the whole day. What they don't tell you is that you'll be dealing with customers that are frantic which I understand but you'll also deal with customers that are flat out disrespectful. Some have tried to call me out of my name and management just blew it off. To an extent management cares but only when it comes to the numbers of calls we take a day and quality assurance. Would I ever work in a call center? Absolutely not! Breaks are only 30 min. with 2 15 minute breaks. The benefits are pretty good though, but do whatever you can to move up and not stay on the phones."
good,Great work environment that allows me to demonstrate great leadership skills with the help of great team players who work together to productively get the job done.
good,The pay as a Teller is not that great but its part time. I am able work and have free time to focus on things that I want to do. My co-workers are great as well that is one of the reasons why I stayed at my branch. Many opportunities to move up in the company.
good,Well known and respected company. I value a lot of learning and experiences from my 6 years if stint in the company including handling multiple clients and tasks at the same time.
good,"Poor decisions made at upper management level to cut costs by reducing staff.  This has resulted in more work to do for the rest of the staff and a poor quality of service for our internal and external customers.  Layoffs are occurring every quarter, thus very little job security and very few opportunities for advancement."
good,"Load and unload packages on and off truck, scan and sort packages for different locations to ensure delivery on daily basis."
good,"This job was a lot of fun when I first started. I was very eager to learn more about the banking industry. The only downfall to this job was that they were not supportive of the pursuit of an education, a manager within the company told me that I should stop going to school because I would never even use my college degree and that I would not ever make as much money as I could at the bank."
good,"Multiple cultures still exist due to multiple merging of banks.  Company striving to create one culture, but different departments still have a culture of their own.  For anyone starting a career, this is a good place to start."
good,"The people working here are all really nice and cool, but you are expected to work a ton of hours with no overtime opportunities in some positions. It is a decent place to work."
good,The firm was competitive and demanding which fostered high performance among the employees. Good benefits and friendly co-workers.
good,"Overall good company to work, life balance is very difficult just like any other job. Top Management means well, but they don't practice what they preach."
good,"It was a calm and fun place to work at, I worked at my pace and did above and beyond. I liked working here very much, liked the people I worked with"
good,"Position was on Contract. "
good,"It was a great environment.  I had various positions in the company from Secretarial, Payroll and Finance.  A typical day at the end of my assignment with working with the managers to ensure that their expenses were paid and reported accurately.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the different types of functions done.  The hardest part of the job was knowing the position was offshored to India."
good,"Working with JP Morgan/Chase is a very fast paste environment.  Where needs improvements is in the Escrow part of training to really understand the concepts of multiple analysis during a one year period and trying to explain to customer is crucial to helping customers and answering the questions correctly.  Other than that, JP Morgan/Chase is the place to work."
good,Culture is extremely cold and impersonal.  You arrive complete your task and head home. No blending of life and work. The hardest part of this role is that some individuals will try an push their responsibilities onto newer people just because they don't know the full scope.
good,the company has had some bad employee reviews and has since tried to implement new things to make it a better place. There is still an opportunity for the overall company but if they continue to imrpove the employee experience things will continue to get better.
good,Fine to work there. Enjoyed the people that worked there. Managers could have been better to work with. Didn't like how one manager had a problems with certain customers.
good,"Working a pipeline of 60+ loans is very stressful in trying to beat lock expiration dates.  I feel some of the guidelines are excessive and creates unnecessary work that slows down production, e.g. reordering payoffs that are past 10 days old and the same for verification of employment that are past 10 days old.  I've had files that had issues and had to reorder those 2 or 3 times.  Some of the conditions requested, I feel, are also unnecessary that slows down production.  The environment is very friendly and active.  Lots of overtime."
good,Strong company but finding too many ways to cut income for employees.It is becoming a stressful work environment with less emphasis on employees and more on bottom line
good,"This was a great work enviorement, plenty of work. Anything needed to be done will be done. This is a small family owned business, so your not just another number"
good,"No comment about Chase mortgage managers, co-workers or the job in general. I choose not to disclose any information on current or former employers unless it's related to my duties and skills."
good,"Hardest part of the job is the not knowing if you will still have a job the next day, high turnover. Other than that great company to work for."
good,Good work enviornment.. customers are mean but your trained to deal with irrate customers . Good training team... overall great company to grow and learn with.
good,"If you're into a high paced working environment, Chase Bank is the place for you. Colleagues and management team are all supportive. Depending on what size branch you are located at, depends on the foot traffic. Every employee has a responsibility or two to always be kept busy."
good,A secured Banking facility with various departments working together.requiring accuracy and speed involving input of data
good,"It was not a bad place to work, just too many restrictions on how I was allowed to speak to people, what I was allowed to wear...even down to how I said hello."
good,"A typical day at work, what you learned, management, co-workers, hardest part of the job, most enjoyable part of the job."
good,My day is spent in front of customers.  I offer solutions to basic banking needs and demonstrate all of the convenience products Chase has to offer.  I assist on the teller line as needed.  I make outbound service calls to existing clients.  I will occasionally prospect new business.
good,"Management is not willing to compensate for excellent performance.  Although an employee is rated as High at their year end review, management notes that the next year performance will not be the same.  Employees perform their responsibilities and not recognized equally."
good,All about numbers and meeting goals. Work hard to be a top performer often exceeding in all metric areas. Management worked to keep employees engaged through various office themes
good,"I learned all about credit cards and more about customer service.."
good,The most enjoyable was working with great people.  Did not agree with upper managements decision on client selection and client retention.
good,"Analyze and underwrite credit requests from all over the United States and across many different industries.  "
good,JP Morgan Chase provided good benefits and good training to their employees. The building is beautiful and located in the heart of downtown Chicago.
good,Typical big bank working environment.Change is constant and depending on the department work can be  unstable. overall good company to work for
good,"Customer service, reconcile, creating mortgages, tactful, knowledge of computer, data entry, excellent phone etiquette, data entry, copier/fax, researching documents."
good,Professional environment very focused on meeting regulatory requirements and considering the customers needs. The best part of the job is interacting with colleagues in different roles and locations. Full schedules and a fast pace keeps things exciting and challenging.
good,"There is tremendous pressure on Chase to continue growth and profitability.  They can only do this in the current economic environment by cutting costs.  Benefits are still what you would expect from a company of this stature.  Promotion opportunities are limited because some areas (Mortgage/Finance) are still in ""downsize"" mode."
good,Great place to start career. Progressively harder to get ahead with workplace politics playing a larger and larger part in career advancement.
good,"Chase is a great company to work for. "
good,its ok no too bad. needs not to be a seasonal job. need more hours for better stability. a typical day is very busy but fun shift. learned how to sort mail.
good,"Enjoyed  the branch team experience!  Face to face sell of JPM investment products, annuities and insurance to prospects and bank clients.   This is a great position if you can build a relationship with your team,  you will depend on them for business."
good,Very smart hard working individuals who collaborate to get large amounts of work done.  There is a need to invest in technology.
good,"JP Morgan is attempting to change its organization to an automated/automatic system.  A typical day involves building out middleware including web servers, app servers and single sign on.  The most difficult part of the job is understanding the dozens of systems needed to set up prerequisites such as access, loadbalancing, firewalls, etc..  The best part of the job is working with developers and project managers.  We have a common goal and try to help each other."
good,"The environment was very challenging with various silos and lack of communication and collaboration at times.  There were many layers of management, so accomplishing goals was always a challenge is you needed to gain management agreement.  The infrastructure for onboarding, training, etc. was top of the line and searching for jobs internally across business lines was easier than most large corporations."
good,"The hardest part of my job is ensuring that policies and procedures are followed on a daily basis in the handling of cash. "
good,"It was a good and clean work environment, everything was good about the job. I learned a lot about business and the legal system"
good,"This is a retail bank job. You have to work with customers and handle their accounts and finances. Chase will teach you the resources on how to open banking accounts, handle customer banking transactions, and how to coach and train employees in the management field. Chase is currently focusing on digital adoption for many of their customers this year, so people skills and teaching/showing customers how to use technology is a must right now."
good,Busy and fast paced... unfortunately hard work is not rewarded. A lot of Micro Managers and a lack of accountability. Many employees that are comfortable doing the same job for years on end.
good,Management structure is disorganized within the compliance arena and mobility is limited. Analysts and associates are underpaid when compared to other banks -- not paid market rate. Colleagues are great and make for a good team/work environment.
good,I worked in a lockbox facility with confidential documents.The environment was strict but the people worked hard and I had friendly coworkers.
good,This job was based on production so there was not mingling or positive morale there. The environment was ok but I have graduated to be a medical assistant and this was a job I took while in shcool
good,"I worked from 12 midnight util 9 in the morning. It was very challenging and the process was complex, but I loved dealing with customer's dispute as it makes me use my critical thinking and decision-making skills."
good,As a big company sometimes you are put on the back burner. But a very good company with great benefits to work for. Very high security.
good,Good working moral. Always have challenge projects to do every day. Good management but slow green card application process.
good,Fast paced workout department with a wide variety of coworkers with different skill sets and experience. A good place to work if you like a variety of tasks and responsibility.
good,"Great company I worked for chase for 27years, "
good,No recognition and reward for the job well done . Manager biased and now scope to escalate to higher management. Appraisal based on manager discretion and not based on performance . no work life balance
good,Everyday was unpredictable. I learned how to balance cash boxes/Foreign bond safe/Main cash vault/TCD Machine. Management was unfair and sexist. The hardest part of the job was learning new audit protocols the day before our branch got audited. I enjoyed going to a lot of branch openings and being the Mascot for outside events
good,"JPMorgan, formally known as ""Mother Morgan"", given the company's size and rank in the financial world, has always been a very well-oiled machine that continues to grow by leaps and bounds.  It's second to none in the industry and continues to do well financially and is heavily involved in community development."
good,"As it was my first job as a full time employee, I really enjoyed working there and every moment was a learning experience. I really got a chance to understand the financial technology."
good,Upper management has a lot of shifting at this point. New incentives and new  guides. Change of banking across the board. Advancement  is non existent.
good,Very Diverse culture with plenty of employee engagement. Analysts put in a lot of hours throughout the day. Management is good depending on where you work and the type of work you do.
good,"Great coworkers and team work. the most i enjoyed about this job is the people i work with, everyone is friendly and great teamwork"
good,Expected to work long hours to justify compensation. Employees are segregated into cliques and eventually outcast some employees. Culture supports looking out for oneself in order to advance within the company.
good,"Average working environment. After 2008 no more bonus, benefits or perks. Depending upon management, can be fun place to work."
good,JP Morgan is a great place to work depending on your managers and your co-workers.  Having a great team makes all the difference.  Management has different levels of knowledge which makes it difficult to escalate.
good,"Overall, working at Chase bank was not so bad but it could have been better with some changes as most large companies are like. The best thing about Chase is the benefits and work/life balance since it works with a flexible (the good part since you can request for a change of schedule if you need it - but of course its under managements discretion) rotating schedule weekly (which isn't so great especially it is 'subject to change without notice'). Working as a bank teller for six and half years, most days were good but with many bad days as well. I was located in a very diverse neighborhood and busy busy branch and many customers whose native language was not English which can be challenging. It was also filled with many rude disrespectful customers and it can be nonstop all day; the branch I worked at did not have chairs so during off peak time I can only briefly lean on the wall. LOCATION definitely makes a difference in work perspectives. They definitely overwork the tellers and the pay was below average and definitely not an environment I would want to go back into to be micromanaged. Upper mobility seems almost impossible unless you can wait a long time or lucky to have good supportive manager. The people are hungry for commission and meeting goals, so beware of the 'teamwork'. Therefore, good company but pays below average compare to other banks and management needs lots of work."
good,I learned to be very organized and also learned to work quicker and more efficiently. management is okay. co- workers are lovely. what i enjoyed most about this job was meeting new people.
good,"A typical day can be very busy. A good portion of the day involved problem solving. I learned to prioritize my work load and own the customer issue from start to finish. My co-worker's were fun and productive, and I liked the way the team worked together. The hardest part of the day was not being able to help the customer with their financial needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customer's with their finances."
good,"Thick team bond between employees below management level. Even if you leave, the experience doesn't leave you. Great opportunities to network and grow your professional relationships."
good,Deposit review department has No room for growth unless you want to go into management. Good schedule except 11 hours on Tuesdays.
good,"I learned a variety of skills. Learned how to underwriter federal student loans, review income documents for borrower and cosigned loans to determine approval or denial.   "
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is above average"
good,"Typical day begins with developing a plan for the day. It is a team environment that requires us all to work together. We share our appointments for that day so the branch staff can work around them. Once we have appointments down, we begin to structure our daily schedule. This includes scheduling call blocks, floor time, follow ups, and partner meetings. On an average day, 75% of my time is scheduled. "
good,Typical day would involve systematic routines aimed to speak to as many customers as possible with complete uniformity and little room for personalization.
good,"Great company to start off with, will learn a lot of skills! While I may not of loved the work all the time, I loved my team! We really were a working family."
good,"very professional, clean and friendly.  Cafeteria is very nice but price is too high."
good,top company to work for in the USA. Decent work life balance. Long hours ok Pay. Every location and department is different.
good,"Cons: The work environment is always changing.  The workflow is unpredictable so you would have to be able to stay late or come in early when you are asked. It is a production-based environment.   Pros: The benefits are great. As an employee, you are able to receive discounts on just about anything, including cars. The employees are close. This was the only job I have had where everyone knows your name. It is not the perfect place to work, but if you do not mind the constant changes then this may be the job for you."
good,"I have been part of chase for a little over a year now. I love the environment that chase offers us as employees. I get to interact with different types of people on a daily bases which has taught me a lot, considering I first started out at one of the largest branches in the whole country down in the city. Different problems emerge daily allowing you to gain different skills in solving each situation. I didn't have much experience when I first started but considering my fast learning ability I was able to catch on in a matter of days, thanks to the management that were able to teach me the things I needed to know."
good,A great place to work wonderful people always felt like 'a family'  was sad when job relocated but Chase had a wonderful re deployment department set up and helped us to find jobs or training.
good,Get expected to make a lot of phone calls trying to bring investments and a lot of covenants in a small cubical.lots of people skills
good,There was alot of unnecessary politics that took place there. Also the meetings took up a majority of the day which did not leave alot of time to do actual work.
good,First time working with a recruiting firm. They worked to get me placed with a great company. The pay was fair and if there any issues they handled it promptly.
good,"Review client paperwork for KYC compliance, compliance,supportive managers, Team work from co-workers, dealing difficult advisor, Lack of required training"
good,Unfortunately there is poor culture which permeates in many areas of the organisation (not all though). Some areas are fantastic with great people and other areas have a lot of improvement to do.
good,Job was pretty good.  Great work life balance. Learned a great deal at this company and gained a lot of experience. Great employee morale.
good,the PMO team is extremely diverse depending on the department and what projects you are working on but overall the company is large with a lot of opportunity to move around.
good,Day to day in FedEx consisted of unloading & loading trucks. Working at a steady pace to get the work load done. hardest part of the job was the consistent being on your feet & the heat.
good,•	Responsible for acting as the industry/analytical expert to defined contribution record keeper clients utilizing Northern Trust Funds on their platforms.
good,"Very busy place to work, a lot customer but they make your day easier, management they have to work a little bit with their employees."
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for, it comes down to how departments are managed and how well managers can properly staff their departments. Due to overwork/underpaid/understaffed conditions it is no longer an environment that I thrive it."
good,"My job was to help customers with their banking concerns including confirming balances, payments, purchases, funds transfers, and also offer products and solutions to help meet their needs while creating an overall ""Wow"" experience."
good,Strict micro managers thaty don't know what they are doing. Not a good long term projection of jobs as they are constantly cutting costs.
good,Work is challenging and staff very bright but company needs to work on culture and team building.  Headquarter location in New York is fantastic but other buildings less desirable.  High level staff working in cubicles creates a difficult atmosphere for conducting challenging and regulated work and has caused general low morale.
good,"Performed a lot of administration things. Simple office things like faxing, answering phone calls, making copies, binding, record keeping."
good,"A typical day consist of generating service orders, managing contractors, and overseeing the daily operation of the datacenter. I work with a diverse group of ethnicity's', which I've found to be a great experience in my job and in life. The most difficult part of my job is to not get too comfortable with my day to day activities."
good,"very fast past enviroment, many opportunities to move around. such a big business that its hard to establish really close bonds with manger and employees."
good,"With this particular position I learned to multitask very quickly due to the high amounts of transactions this branch produced on a daily basis. Not only did I supervise the tellers, I helped keep the flow of the line moving by tellering myself. As an Operations Supervisor, I had a lot of tasks that I was in charge of. You name it, I did it at that branch. From Operations to being a Teller on the Teller Line to Opening New Accounts. My Manager had a lot of faith in me and I was on my way of becoming an Assistant Manager in the near future."
good,Great company with good benefits and family oriented. I like to work for  a company that understands that I have life outside of work. Chase is a good company that is flexible with personal matters and benefits are good as well. However to advance at Chase can be tricky because people can be over looked.
good,"This was a very slow easy position.  This mainly consisted of correcting tax forms prepared incorrectly by the tax payer/preparer.  It could be interesting at times, but mostly very tedious.  Around April it got very busy and that made the day go by much faster.  It was an independent job, no team work was required.  I prefer to work in a team environment."
good,Fun environment to work in but low chance of promotions within the company. Forced to promote transaction alternatives to clients.
good,long hours but has excellent training program for customer service. traits you will develop and take with you to any future job
good,"My time at Chase was rewarding.  I learned alot, was a team player, enjoyed my co-workers and management.  I was sorry to see the department close."
good,"Unfortunately the position I was given has been determined to only be a freelancers position. If you can land a job as a staff member, take it. If not, look elsewhere."
good,Serious place to work with opportunity for advancement; excellent wages and benefits. I learned many things from my superiors and from those I managed. The hardest part of my job was to be pulled in so many directions. I was definitely tired at the end of the day.
good,"Deu oportunidades de crescimento, porém sem revisão salarial. Com ótimo ambiente de trabalho."
good,Flexible work schedule availability. The internal hiring opportunities. Company has great benefits. Work environment is very professional.
good,"they shove that blue koolaid down your gullet, to hide the fact that theirs a lot missing from this company they care about no one not even their own"
good,In the department I worked in which was Quality Assurance there was no consistent work flow. It was very unorganized and there was no security for the job position.
good,"Chase tell you there are job opportunities for advancement, but they don't tell you it may take years to advance and it can only be done in that specific department you are in. Most jobs do require for you to have a degree"
good,"Good place to work, has good benefits and vacation time.  Has many different departments where you can transfer to after a year of service."
good,"JP Morgan provides a very good platform to learn intensively about the financial world.Decision are taken only after rationally and logically understanding issues at hand.Best team efforts and performance can be seen at all times.Inspite of long working hours it is ensured that there is some value addition with which each employee walks out daily."
good,"I learned that the key to success is to be thorough and honest, to treat people as well as clients with respect. Although my day was very busy, working as a team with my co-workers who were hard working and dedicated made the day easy to get through."
good,"I have been with JPMorgan Chase Bank for 15 years. I have had the opportunity to work in at least 5-6 position so they are good with mobility. I think the company is a great place to work and they have good benefits,"
good,I was a data entry temp at this location and it was a good job. was promised a position as lead data entry clerk but my assignment ended and never received a call about the position promised. The pay was ok as a young temp but not much room for growth.
good,"Typical day usually started at 7:00am.  I opened branch and got the day ready for the tellers to perform their jobs. I ordered ICOM did reports managed 7 girls,  Participated in audits ,had sole control of main vault All scheduling by using click to staff. Did surprise audits. Also we had to make sure our girls were demonstrating excellent customer service while achieving their own personal sales goals."
good,I worked with and supervised a team of risk analyst to spot trends that would cause declines or un authorized foreclosures.
good,"Some of the best benefits out there "
good,"Handled incoming calls such as deposit holds, deposit review, and verification of funds through LAD system. Supported branches with fraud prevention, (i.e.: fraudulent checks, deposits, transaction approval, and research). Verified customer’s identity using Fast Data.  Made sure customer information given to bank were legitimate and reviewed documents verifying such."
good,As a relationship banker your responsible for maintaining a book of business thats assigned to the branch. Your looking to help people with the retirement and lending needs.
good,A typical day at work is 75 call requirement and to obtain 60% of collections of portfolio making outbound and receiving inbound calls for a resolve. My team was great while working there I was named an Alpha on the team due to experience. The hardest part of my job is allowing more time for customers to meet their responsibility of debt due to collections being an urgency to receive payments. The pleasure is the bonus and the achievement of meeting my monthly goal.
good,"Overall, good company to work for. I only worked as an intern. I didn't enjoy the company culture as much as I do with my current company."
good,There are many opportunities to grow and learn in the company. If you are dedicated you can move in the firm.  Many people have spent their life career with the firm because of the advancement opportunities.
good,"Learning, not enough staff for one job, I put a lot of hours in because I am the only one in the office that knows how to do what needs to be done. Management has come around since I voiced my frustrations, pay is great but it is very stressful and there isn't enough respect for how hard I work."
good,"Great firm to work for and the quality of work is second to none. The company promotes mobility compared to other companies. Overall, it's a great firm to start a career."
good,"This is a place to learn and see what doesn't work about our society. People being paid low to medium salary's to work with very important pieces of information. Because they work with the public they are viewed internally and the lowest in the chase food chain. "
good,Chase was a fun place to work. The leaders were friendly and flexible. They made it a great environment for everyone. The end of the month push was always exciting and they always motivated us to do better.
good,"A typical day at work."
good,It is a great company filled with technology but the Management program is very micromanagement. Very hard to balance work and life.
good,"Good compensation and work/life balance.  "
good,"Great place to have a career, seems to treat employees well. Work was often dry and not interesting. Bright people, but primary motivator is money"
good,"Working at JP Morgan is great, there are a lot of challenging opportunities. The management is top notch and the team provides clear direction coupled with mentor-ship."
good,* The most enjoyable part of working for this company I would have to say if working with so many different people from all walks of life and establishing a relationship with people you work with every day. So it wasn't only a job you go to for work but you look forward to working with great employees.
good,"JP Morgan Chase Bank is a decent workplace, the best part of the job is working under the name. pay is not great but the sales training and culture is highly looked upon amongst competitors"
good,It is good place to work as Chase truly does seem to care about their employees but I am now going through my second layoff with them.
good,"As with any big company, you unfortunately become just another number.  They try to save money by hiring new underwriters right out of college."
good,"If you are in college, this is the best job to have. You get paid vacation days and sick days after 90 days. I worked in a mon-fri branch so it was great!"
good,"very big organisation, there are many hoops to jump through, the work is segmented into small processes. very slow in moving forward at the moment."
good,"Overall great place to work. Co-workers all worked together as a team, management is knowledgable and cares about employees. Benefits are OK, not much room for growth."
good,"Greet clients and offer help "
good,"I learned how to become a better team player and contribute to making a difference in customer and company environment. It is also a great environment to meet and build relationships with new and existing customers. I learned new products and services, I also remained updated on new policies and procedures."
good,The hardest part of this job was updates.  The system that was used had room for improvement.  Management was good.  I learned several things while at JP Morgan Chase that I have used since I have left.
good,Typical day at work is working independently and managing my own time. Conversations between employees is kept at a minimum and most communication is done through email or instant message.
good,"People management had been average but as of late, it's materially declining due to leadership changes.  Lot of colleagues unhappy and looking for new positions."
good,Frequent reorganization leads to contradictory objectives and also creates advancement hurdles to individual employees.
good,I'd rate JPMC as an average company to work for. Employee appreciation is lacking and you generally have to leave the company and then come back later to get any type of meaningful pay increase.
good,When interest rates rose in 2013 things slowed down in our group. I was put in a talent relocation program but completely pigeonholed into similar advancement. The job was demanding but mundane and not analytical.
good,"Day begins with a small hudle of 15 min to discuss the challeges and plan the day foward."
good,Worked here twice as both non salaried and management.  The pay is good but save your money!  A lot of job transitioning or mass lay offs occur on a regular basis.
good,"This is a challenging time for banking, and Chase is not exempt. From the minute i walked int he doors it's been one re-org after another. So much instability that I really didn't get too comfortable and, alas, I was impacted in the latest job cuts."
good,"Great culture"
good,"Sitting at the computer answering phone calls for branch employees."
good,"Helped customers with their financial goals and needs."
good,This was a great place to work and always team related.  also they take care of there colleagues when they had to downsize and relocate.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a fine company to work for, company has very fine benefits.  Many different areas of the company to work within."
good,"Good place to work- gives you the ability to move within the company."
good,"Good company to work for and a good learning experience. Pays standard industry average, long hours but rewarding number of vacation days."
good,"It is a good place to work."
good,Chase as wonderful benefits. On a typical day I would handle F.H.A loans with a pipeline of about 115 accounts. The hardest part of the job was having to work your pipeline while taking inbound calls.
good,"I spent 21 years in the central technology department, focussing on job scheduling and implementation support, on mainframe and large midrange technology."
good,"it is a great company to work for, but it all depends on how your management is.  they can either make the work environment really great or really negative."
good,"Job is good. Much better experience than Citi bank. Although, very similar environments. Pushy sales managers and district managers and on top of that you have the advisors that want sales from you and if that;s not enough you have your mortgage bankers who want sales from you as well. You are being pushed from all sides of the bank."
good,"Chase has been good to me. But at the end of the day you are just a number. Plain and simple. If you can go to work and just do your best that will pay the bills.. But if you can be better than the person next to you, definitely room for development. Chase has eliminated some positions and will continue to do it. If you plan on making this a career for the long run good luck. I've seem some amazing people leave due to minimal errors, without any corrective action. This a great company to gain experience. There District training is not universal so one manager is completely different for the other as far as training and compliance. One will focus on leadership the other will focus on micro managing. That makes it hard to have a vision in the company that wants you to believe in leading a great team. Building a strong foundation. Also a lot of broken promises."
good,"Great benefits, vacation, 401k and pension, not too much room to grow. Retail sales keeps you in a box of cut throat people and unless you are a shark you either won't survive or won't make it through a day without a break down. This place operates on numbers and the nice guy always finished last, You can be great at your job but if you are not willing to run a few people off the road you won't be good, or happy."
good,"Great organizational structure and pay but this area in Chase is very sensitive to industry changes."
good,"Well seasoned in design and developing PegaRULES Process Commander Applications with more than 9.8 years of IT experience. Also worked on different Frameworks, Involved in all stages of software development lifecycle. Worked on projects for clients such as Toronto Dominion, JPMC, PegaSystems, National Electronics, etc and has the following experience"
good,"The best in providing banking products and customer service. However, as a workplace every day is challenging and is always focused on corporate direction without a clear explanation into changes. All co-workers are great and it is a great place to work for a post-college job, but can be a challenging career."
good,"Great place to work, learn and grow."
good,"Call center environment, due to high turnover department is NEVER fully staffed, low pay, no bonus.  Room to transition within the company."
good,"Lots of work, low pay, no bonus.  Great name to have on a resume, after 12 -18 months move on! Lots of room for growth within the company."
good,"The other employees are very nice, but the pay is not equal to the work expected. The company does not offer high enough incentives and the days are very long and hard to work some days."
good,A great company to work for.  Training and leadership matches no other.  Sometimes you feel lost in a company of this magnitude.
good,"I will mention at the outset that I have spent my entire time at the bank in just one area so my following statements may not apply across all areas of the bank. "
good,"Interacted with customers of diverse nationalities on a daily basis. Counted currency, received by hand or used a currency-counting machine, and balanced drawer at the end of each shift. Performed various financial transactions to include but not limited to deposits, withdrawals, took payments sold check products, etc.  Performed a multitude of clerical tasks such as typing, filing and telephone skills, etc. Ensured all duties were conducted under the guidance of bank policy and procedure."
good,Very challenging work atmosphere. Work culture was very professional. Good Organisation to start your career which gives excellect exposure to Investment Banking.
good,"•	Administering windows 2003/2008 domain controllers, application servers, file servers and print servers, Database servers, Windows Clusters Servers, IIS Web servers, Citrix Servers, SharePoint servers. "
good,"I've learned a lot writing the system almost from scratch, a lot of business knowledge as well the knowledge of building a distributed system."
good,Very large company with many opportunities for one to move around depending on interest.
good,nice place to work; large number of opportunites globally; well known name
good,JPMC is in the process of building its centralized Metadata hub repository for all the 8 Line of Business. This Metadata repository provides 10000 users the ability to access the Metadata of all the JPMC physical and logical attributes. This centralized repository is considered as the worlds biggest Metadata repository with 10K user access.
good,"This department in particular deal in escalations that have not been resolved by Chase's phones units. The cases are numerous, due to the OCC regulations all must be addressed, and the staffing not adequate to handle the case load. If you are looking to learn a lot and willing to sacrifice the income to do so, this is the job, and company for you. The management has some very excellent people who want to help grow you, however then are far out numbered by those who don't care and are not professional. The best part of the job is that if you look at it from a learning stand point, you can gain a ton of knowledge and know when to move on. The hardest part is dealing with some pretty ridiculous micromanaging, similar to those summer jobs of your youth."
good,Great place to work and good opportunities to advance. Always presented with challenging projects and have the pleasure of working with a diverse group of people. I primarily worked in Mortgage Banking department. I enjoy being able to work with an outstanding company that is known globally to provide great customer service
good,Work is pretty steady. The job relatively easy. Learned a great deal about financial litigation
good,"A typical day includes reviewing, analyzing and amending contracts; meeting with Line of Business managers to confirm contract details  and provide a summary of remediation."
good,Great coworkers. Long days and weekends went overlooked often. Not very connected to actual business. Not rewarded for work
good,"Working for Wells Fargo forces you to focus solely on sales. While I enjoyed sales, management enforces it to a point that can become overwhelming. Customer service was also not a priority which can create a difficult work environment."
good,What I enjoyed the most was forming amazing friends from a stressful work place.
good,You are as good as your manager. And this was the case.  It was ok.
good,Within Client Services you are expected to know all products and aspects of your clients.  It is essential that you are properly trained and understand the sector.
good,They could have told everyone the truth about closing the bank down for good.
good,"Large corporation, good benefits, but very inefficient due to its size."
good,"Chase provides good benefits, the employees are friendly, but the demand and workload on the employees can be stressful."
good,An overall good working experience. Also great for entry level associates wanting to join a financial institute
good,"Nice place to work, Good environment and nice people. Good experience. Highly matrixes environment."
good,I had fantastic managers and co workers. Compensation was low.
good,"Daily investigation on the system-generated AML alerts;"
good,The typical day is in general a quiet and focused atmosphere. With a free spirited environment it can tend to have some laughter. Its open door policy so that makes it easy to talk with your supervisors/ superiors inorder to share thoughts or opinions regarding work.
good,"Logging in to a dual monitor system, working a total of 6 systems all day. Placing back to back calls to delinquent homeowners to make contact to discusss options or payments plans available to them. "
good,"A typical day in the SCRA department consisted of reviewing applications to see if customers qualified for the benefits of 4% based on when they got the loan vs. when the loan was taken out or for a few states they would qualify for benefits no matter when they started as long as they were still active. "
good,Lots of work with couple of breaks & team meetings in between fills up the day. Passion for work and desire to outperform oneself on daily basis has been my big learning experience. A very healthy and two-way relationship with the management and my co-workers has been greatest strength in my development. The hardest part of the job has been to find new ideas for improvement whereas the most enjoyable part has been the achievements.
good,"It's a typical large company.  I personally struggle with corporate culture sometimes, but overall I've had a very pleasant work experience.  I've made some life long friends here."
good,Stats driven workplace with pretty good compensation. Long and boring workdays that leave you wanting more at the end. Nice peers though
good,I was given the opportunity to train new/temporary employees. I wrote job instructions by hand. New employees enjoyed my style of training as they didn't feel pressured. I displayed patience consistently as I had once been in their shoes as a 'new' employee.
good,J. P. Morgan is a good overall job. Company provides good location and benefits. One would be able to advance in this company
good,Pay was great but very unstable company you never know if your going to have a job the next day I guess you can say its all part of working in the banking industry
good,"A typical day includes a large amount of data manipulation and validation to produce invoices for services rendered to corporate clients. The remaining time is spent researching and responding to client and client service inquiries as well as meetings via phone and in person. The process is very manual and time intensive and high risk due to the numerous manual touch points. My coworkers are friendly, intelligent, and from diverse cultural and professional backgrounds. The hardest aspect of the job is managing risk and the constant and intensive operational tempo. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is my coworkers and the constant learning process."
good,"Job in the Quality department was to listen and monitor calls from call center, made sure reps were following laws and guidelines per department(Mortgage Collections, Loss Mitigation, Line of Credit etc.) making sure reps documented and conveyed proper information to each customer. Several different programs were taught to us do to monitoring several different departments. Management did a good job conveying all changes, hardest part of the job were the constant changes to processes. Saving and referring to emails was the best way to keep up with changes. Even though the hardest part was constant change, it made the job enjoyable."
good,"This review is coming from CIB Tech."
good,I work primarily in the Health Savings Account area. It's very interesting. Something different. I enjoyworking for them.

In all my previous jobs I have worked as a Business Analyst whereby my main role was to act as a liaison between Business and technology, providing solutions to business/technology teams, reporting on the progress of the projects, escalating at risk milestones to senior management, collecting and documenting requirements for various projects."
good,Answering phone calls and emails from our clients. Assisting other co-workers with there questions. Being able to mult-task at a high standard. Helping management team with escalated issues. Hard when tools don't work when attempting to resolve an issue. Enjoyable part of day is knowing I've done all to my ability to get the job done.
good,There is not enough mobility within the retail banking sector.  The pay is minimal.  The incentive plan is highly competitive.
good,Current regulatory and economic environment is resulting in a large consolidation of the workforce.
good,"I call people to collect mortgage payments. If it is due on the 1st of the month and it is not in by the 5th of the month that is when we call. So this leads to uncomfortable situations, especially when the grace period is 15 days."
good,Good company to work for just short lived. Learn to embrace change.
good,My favorite part of being a teller is the great relationships i built with customers.
good,J P allows exposure to all IDM controls functions and spends expensively on technology and risk

good,Managed brokerage sales for Dallas/Fort Worth market.  Very retail driven.
good,This is a great company to work.  The only thing I dislike is that you have to remain in the queue to assist with technical calls.
good,I learned a lot because they offered many training and progressive learning opportunities.
good,I learned to cope with the challenges posed by the fast-pace work in J. P. Morgan-Chase.
good,"On call 24/7 rotation and weekend.  SLA and apples to apple.  Stressful rapid pace and demanding.  "
good,"I have worked for JPMorgan Chase for 7 years, during that time i have used my skills to develop, motivate, lead and encourage employee productivity to improve operations, increase profitability, and enhance growth"
good,Collaborative environment that is surrounded by talented people
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Chase, but I didn't love the work environment enough to stick with it.  I worked as an assistant to a Mortgage Banker. It was a nice place to work where I worked very hard and had a nice balance of living and working."
good,"JPMC has wide scope of talent and the resources to accomplish just about any task. Some of the positions are tense and strenuous, but they also carry the most opportunity to make the most money. Like other organizations of its' size, there's much bureaucracy."
good,Co-workers are diverse and fun to work with. Chase has many events for its employees to show you are appreciated.
good,"•	Managed eForms and booked journal entries via investrian (accounting & report wizard) in Excel shared master file"
good,"I enjoyed working as an Administrative Assistant and having the people depend on me the way they did.  Over the years of being at the company, I learned to get to know people by finding out what they do because you never knew when you might need to call on one of them to assist in something that you might be working on.  Networking is an important tool to be used in the workplace and even in everyday life.  The hardest part of my job was sometimes knowing something was going to be happening but not being able to say a word to anyone because I knew in advance of the event or whatever it might be."
good,I spent 15 years there working in several capacities.  I had to leave because the office was moving to Florida.
good,Good place to work but they are laying off all the time and Management turnover is always occurring. Nice hours and great benefits though.
good,"I look forward to going to work everyday because I have great peers and great Managers. "
good,"Its OK...they worked me so many hours sometimes and sent me out of town to work, I don't like that."
good,"A typical day would start about 8am getting the staff ready for the day with morning huddle, etc. handle customer situation in a professional manner from start to finish, lunch schedule running smoothly, managing teller throughout  the day, Telephone concerns."
good,As a teller I work with people and help customers with their banking needs on a daily basis. As I still  work here providing much more information on the social dynamics is inappropriate. My coworkers are wonderful people and I am searching for a different position solely for a better opportunity and a chance to utilize the skills I have from my degree and personal experiences.
good,It was great. Nice environment I loved the job. Loved the people everyone was positive and outgoing.
good,"A typical work day for me at Chase is very face paced and productive. It starts with me immediately logging into my phone system to start answering calls. I access emails daily and throughout the day to stay in communication with peers and managers on vital information for my job duties. For immediate contact I also log into my communicator for  important information that needs to be relayed quickly. I have a very good relationship with all of the managers and supervisors and we have an open door policy, so any concerns can be addressed personally. My peers and I participate in pot lucks and daily contests to make our goals that we have to meet more exciting. I have grown to have a very great relationship with each and everyone of my peers and our work environment has a family feel."
good,"you have scheduled breaks, take between 120-200 calls per day. Cardholders are rude."
good,Nothing else to add. Review was previosly submitted. This needs to be corrected ASAP
good,"I worked as a teller for Chase for over a year.  I had great co-workers, I liked what I did.  Overall I enjoyed working there.  There was a lot of sales incorporated in anything we did, which I suppose is necessary, but a bit annoying when trying to properly assist customers with their needs (and then having to try and sell them something they don't necessarily need).  But, all large banks and corporations do this, so this is no fault against Chase, it just is what it is.  I do like how Chase is trying to go back to developing quality relationships with its customers (a more community feel), I just wish there weren't so many fees!"
good,Collected on delinquent accounts Answered inbound calls. Worked with third party agencies to recover vehicles.
good,"Work directly with Financial Advisors to identify client investment needs and determine appropriate action based"
good,difficult to move internally flexible work schedule if you are in sales tremendous amount of pressure to produce you are only are good as your current production
good,"Once promoted to a management position, my workload more than tripled.  I would have to work 60-70 hours in the week to try to keep up.  I didn't feel as if my management team understood how much work they expected from the managers at my level.  It was not realistic or compensated."
good,What i learn was to providing outstanding customer service with every customers.
good,"You have to look for the quality in the work, in order to get by."
good,Working in a retail branch is a bad work environment. Its very difficult to generate business when 90 percent of your day is dealing with account maintenance.
good,Retail banking office has aggressive sales goals and creates very competitive environment.
good,I received check payments from various departments with in the bank to be deposited.I researched and resolved rejected payments.
good,National Bank of Detroit faded into Detroit history long ago due to layers of merges and acquisitions.   It was a huge organization and financial powerhouse back then.
good,There are many pluses and minuses that come with working for a large corporation.  They try and preach that you are important as an employee but it's hard to feel important as one of so many.  The job security is nice but you can't help but feel that you are always easily replaceable without anyone really caring.
good,"Great working with a team that is thankful and positive. "
good,"Hard working culture, with many opportunities."
good,"Overall, not a terrible place to work. Looks great on the resume. Not much room for advancement."
good,"I am always involved in several projects simultaneously as well as the management of work with the analysts.  We work with aged cases so managing the work load is paramount. "
good,The pay is ok but wish they paid more but the people are awesome.  Also don't be late by a min or two even if they don't seem to be upset.
good,restricted environment. Competitive workforce. Old technologies. Compensation is good.
good,"Process documents to be released while meeting the "
good,Unless you were groomed in the banking world it is a hard transition. My management had an extremely high expectation. If the day didnt turn out to be exactly what they wanted they were not satisfied with the employee's performance. Customers like to work with real people not a fake or scripted robot.The branch manager had me doing two to three other job positions at the same time. I wasnt utilizes for the skills they had hired me for. My experience was poor with them because they had promised me proper training. Unfortunately they had promoted the trainer shortly after I started. This assistant manager was so helpful and taught me a considerable amount in the short time she was there. I was thrown into the mix with a sink or swim mentality. The Branch manager was so driven to move up from his position that even the smallest incident would set him off. Hopefully all chase branches have better management techniques. Just something to think about.
good,was a great company to work for until the bank one merger. the best part of the job was the customers. my co workers were awesome and we all did the best we could with the management we had.
good,"Responsible for architecting, maintaining and providing technological solutions for Global Commercial Card portfolio with primary focus on compliance, regulatory and technology initiatives.

good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Application and  Production Support"
good,Not enough room for career growth. Pay has went down increasingly since started. Great enviroment to be in. Benfits are good. The pay is just not as good as it use to be. Career growth is also decreasing rapidly.
good,"Reviewed emails for escalations, quality check on IOLTA accounts, REGD, safety deposit boxes and guardianship accounts and pulled reports. Manager and team leads very fair, most co-workers were team players. Hardest part of the job was not having enough work for the department and having to wait for the managers to find us work. I liked being kept busy."
good,Great environment to work in and many opportunities for individuals to grow their career.
good,Strong company that can offer upward mobility and various project opportinities.
good,Not up for a review. I do not want to do this because i feel like being forced to do a full type up review is silly.
good,"Typical Day - Fantastic customer interfacing experience as there truly are those that believe in the Chase Paymentech ""branding"" despite issues of reconstruction, the economy and regulatory-debacle excuses."
good,Learned various banking products and built a rapport with numerous clients.  I was given an opportunity to gain my Series 6 and 63 licenses.
good,Location and internal promotion &. No additional information.
good,"I worked for JP Morgan for 9 years.  I was torn between the nostalgia of working for such a big, well known, reputable company and the actual day to day experience.  The Newark campus is beautiful.  On a day to day basis, I barely had time to go to the bathroom, I worked through lunch daily, and I worked unpaid overtime daily.  Moral is extremely low.  Turnover is high.  It isn't by chance that there are always hundreds of jobs open at JP Morgan!  I've heard that salaries at JPM are the lowest of any of the local banks.  I have never seen someone from within a team promoted to manager.  The chosen person was always someone's 'buddy' from another team or external.  In summary, I would recommend accepting a job here if you can't find anything else.  It will look good on your resume."
good,"I received adequate training in my job duties that provided the experience and knowledge I have today.  I was lucky to have fantastic management that gave me the opportunities to succeed, not only in Chase but in outside agencies as well."
good,"a typical day  at work: start time is at 6:30am, we work up different business accounts, according to their  deadlines, "

good,Worked with a group of 6 both together and independently. Learned about compliance and researching documents needed.  Management was supportive in this department. Deadlines were sometimes difficult but worked on weekends if necessary.  The best part of this position was being busy and the people I worked with.
good,Good place to work for. Management encourages mobility and professional growth.
good,"Didn't enjoy the job but good at it which made it enjoyable."

good,Teamwork was promoted to a fault. You were involved from start to finish on all projects.
good,"The work schedule is very hectic as its a complete night shift. I have learned many good things such as managing the team, quick decision making etc as the management of my team is the best. The team iam working in have bunch of talented and fun loving loving people. The repetition of the work sometimes feels boring and the toughest part is the pressure of work we are getting nowadays with low numbers of team member.

good,Funding loans for JP Morgan Chase customers. The hardest part of the job is not making typing errors.
good,"Typical day at Chase was easy to complete your daily task unless system issues but that’s the norm with every company you encounter. I learned a lot while working there, especially in my former job roll; understanding how hardship can really trickle down to every type of homeowner. The co-workers I worked with made the hours go by quick and were always willing to help if had any questions. The hardest part of the job was when you've done all you can to help save someone's home. But I always enjoyed learning new material and sharing amongst my co-workers to help them become proficient."
good,same as the last review. This is a duplicate. You do ordinary banking things.
good,I spent 2 1/2 years at Chase within their call center.  I found this position very challenging due to having to stay up to date on system enhancements and day to day operations.  I enjoyed knowing I have the correct information in order to assist the banking center employees.  The major downfall for this job was having to know everything and being the first call resolution even when my area of the department did not have the answers.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Everyone was very knowledgeable and very willing to help one another.

good,"Initial training process was very thorough, while training for advancement felt more organic and on-the-fly. Employees are very diverse. While remembering the ever-changing policy can be challenging, job aids such as the vast online resources and company support line are readily available. To succeed in this company one has to be a quick study and flexible in their attitudes toward balancing company policy and customer experience."
good,"I begin my day by first reviewing appointments schedule for the day. I then prep any materials and files needed for those appointments. I called or email partners to confirm their attendance for those appointments, if needed. I then check my email and messages to make sure none of my appointments canceled. I then call to confirm those appointments for the day. The rest of my day normally consist of a daily meeting with managers, immediate customer services needs, accounts reviews, and calls to schedule other appointments."
good,The day will start with what is expected to be completed. The stress is high as are demands of perfection. Co workers are supportive and helpfull as this is your main support group.

good,"Not the best place to work. Not enough appreciation for the amount of work that has to be done. I have always gone above and beyond for my co-workers and am never shown any appreaciation,"
good,"Great place to work, good benefits. Long hours. Management consistently making changes."
good,Everyday was different not a single day was the same. Learning the customers was the best part of the job enjoying there stories and laughing with them is what made my job great.
good,spoke to customers regarding their file.  Communicated with title company to resolve any issues on the title that would need to be cleared in order to close loan

good,Like stated above - this can make or break your experience working for the company.
good,I would make outbound calls to delinquent customer's to collect funds as well as determine if the delinquency was due to a long or short term issue. If a long term issue I would identify the problem and provide the best solution for the customer and the Bank. I enjoyed the customer interaction and the ability to assist people in a time of need. I enjoyed the benefit package that Chase provided. I would have liked a little more competitive environment with more monetary incentives. Good training and fair management. Many good people working for Chase.
good,"•	Located and notified credit card holders of their delinquency. "
good,Many hours are put into the position and the business and the people you work with become like family.
good,Kept abreast of current investment market conditions.  Constant review of investment products' performance and status. Periodic review with clients on their accounts.

good,Very hard to move up in the company you have to be willing to relocate. Extreme amount of red tape throughout normal business duties.
good,"A good place to learn a lot about trades, market trend, etc and has good exposure to the financial world. However, there is no work/life balance."
good,"It depends who you work for and in what district that determines the outcome of your job environment. The branch itself will always see a lot of employee turnover and it is your attitude that will make it enjoyable. For the most part, working in a stand alone branch in a busy area with large amount of money is easy. Anything else can be tough to make it."

good,"Valley National Bank, Bank One and Chase are all the same entity."
good,"When I resigned from JP Morgan Chase I was a Senior Underwriter.  During my duration at Chase, I worked in a Branch as a Teller, I worked as a Personal Banker, I was licensed to sell investments, I was a loan officer, I was a team lead, I was a manager, I processed first mortgage and underwrote first mortgage.  I learned many aspects of the banking industry working at Chase.  I met many peers and friends that I still keep in touch with today.  My days at Chase when I left consisted of underwriting 5-7 new files a day, typically HARP files and working a minimum of 10 re submissions per day.  The most difficult part of the job as an underwriter at Chase was that you were not the one making the over all decision on each file.  The system that Chase has in place decides who gets loans and who doesn't.  I really enjoyed working and learning the actual way to underwrite a file at AFI.  The underwriter takes responsibility for the decisions, and finds ways to help families fulfill their dreams of owning their own home.  That is what I want to do again.  I do not prefer to work in an assembly line fashion as I did at Chase.  I enjoyed all my co workers and supervisors tremendously.  I am a loyal person and I like to learn, and I am very quick at it."
good,Fast pace IT. Learned to work in an Agile Scrum environment.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I especially enjoyed the intimate setting in downtown Milwaukee.
good,Average company with little to no ability to progress in career.  Upper-management is typically hired from outside and promotion is rare until you are at senior management levels.
good,Great company assist bankers and external clients. Great training and pay.
good,Big company great binifits. Not a employee focued place to work.
good,"policies never remain constant, morally difficult at times, screwy procedures, too many time wasting ""classes"" bonuses for slamming out loans that will be a hardship on customers in the future.  cushy pay, mostly friendly coworkers, mostly corrupt management.  great med benefits, constant and reliable raises, overtime available."

good,"Worked well with partners and learned about other facets of the bank. Cannot say that I loved working in the retail branch environment, for internal reasons, but I did enjoy the many great relationships I had with clients."
good,For the most part the department where I woked was easy going.  The Manager and Supervisors were great and I got along with all of the coworkers.There were stressful days due to deadlines being set with little notice but I was able to accomplish all of my work.  I do not  mind working overtime or weekends or even from home. All of which I did while at Chase.
good,"Dedicated to helping borrower keep their home. Recommend researching all you can before working for Chase.  I believe they are closing their San Diego facility, but they also have offices in Florida and Texas."
good,This position relied heavily on my ability to communicate with individuals at every level of the organization.
good,Great experience for me. Great company.I shadowed personal Bankers and Learned first hand how to Identify Referrals opportunities.
good,"Typical day as a Relationship Banker starts with the morning huddle. Where the management will inform us on any new changes, offers, etc... Honestly, is the samething everytime. While Chase offers a great opportunity to make lots of money, it also comes with huge amount of stress. You have to be a proactive person. The best way to describe it is basically a hustler. You have to constantly be building relationship with your clients and as well as some cold calls. If you want to be successfull here you have to partner up with your mortgage officer and your financial advisor. As a RB you really don't make much money on checking accounts. You have to focus on bringing in balances, loans, and invesments. "
good,"I worked in the mortgage department @ JP Morgan Chase for a short while as a Temp.  I worked as the Administrator.  It was too short to form a formidable opinion of the company."
good,"Good company"
good,"Good company."
good,"I only worked for Washington Mutual Bank, and they have since merged with J P Morgan Chase"

good,Process preservation invoices that are in mortgage default.
good,Sanction screening of financial transactions ensuring compliance with regulatory and OCC guidelines
good,"A typical day at work was a overall a great place to be. For the past 5 years I've learned a lot, but most importantly I've learned you have to be a team player, and be dedicated to your job. I felt that management didn't give you recognition for a job well  done. For me there wasn't a hard part for the most part I enjoyed my job. The most enjoyable part was helping out others. I love helping out people I need."
good,Typicaly banking (9-5) environment. Nothing moves fast and there a lot of legacy sytems to deal with as a result of muliple acquisitions.
good,was not worth working there after 2010 unless they have made changes

good,"It has been six years since working at Chase. However, from what I can remember I enjoyed working there even though it was a hard job, the things that you had to remember a lot of very important facts. I learned how to tell a fake bill from a real one in ways I had not known before. Most of the management was fun to work for but also hard to work for. I got on well with most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when I was asked to lie to my customers. The most enjoyable was when shift was over and I got to home. "

good,"JPMorgan Private Bank used to be more of a boutique firm, it is now so big that it is very out of touch as to what the client wants. Trying to automate everything and taking powers away from individuals. There is so much bureaucracy that it takes days to get anything done for the client. They are pouring money into systems that don't work, new hires are always amazed at how terrible and antiquated the systems are. The flip side is that JPMorgan is a very stable company with good benefits. They pay well, but employees are subject to a very high stress environment."
good,Accounting Principles. You need to be flexible and resilient at all times.

Currently, I am involved in two projects; the first involving creating business data requirements for a new software system while the second project includes designing the test cases for a new mortgage portfolio to ensure the accounts flow into oru processing system correctly."
good,Chase was a very good company to work for. They had great benefits to my and my family.
good,A typical day at work was very stressful (selling bank's products). I learned offering products to prospective customers. Management was somewhat helpful. Great relationship with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was completing the sales quotas. Most enjoyable part of the job was the relationship with the customers.
good,A typical day at work would be auditing 80 loans for the foreclosure postponement process. I have learned that being organized helps manage a sometimes unmanageable day. Management tends to learn along with the employees and the hardest part of the job is remembering the procedures that change daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is auditing a variety of loans.
good,"Results driven industry leader. Supportive team environment, everyone challenges each other to stay on top."
good,Great first job. I'm a not a sales person so it wasn't a fit for me long term but I enjoyed the experience.
good,"OK company to start out with. My manager is great but the company is very hit or miss meaning advancement usually goes by who you know and not what you know. Its no longer about the customer I feel, even though they try to give off that impression its more like push products on anyone and everyone that you can which was not why i got into this business to begin with. As said before my manager is very proffesional however many I have dealt with in the past are not and have different rules for each person depending on who you are""affiliated"" with!!"
good,Worked with wonderful team of folks who had drive and passion.
good,We had a great testing team and we all worked hard to ensure that we delivered a quality product to production.
good,"I appreciated the Professional Experience working for a fortune 10 company, but I was limited in commision compensation."
good,A good company to work due to the various opportunities for advancement
good,"A top performer and employee of the division a few times and employee of the month many times. My strength is attention to detail, this allows good quality assurance scores. My strongest strength is my experience. I have been in the mortgage field for several years and have the ability to adapt to every situation that has been thrown at me. Help trained new employee's, I have added positive energy to the team's motivation. Assisting with speaking for team meetings and motivation tips for the day. Quality of work has always been above standard, with an extreme amount of knowledge of the business and the system. And I have often assisted my peers and supervisor when needed. Great time management skills, have always completed what is ask of me in a timely manner. This has allowed me to be very successful in the position I presently hold. I have given my team and other team's leadership initiatives. A team player, demonstrating great leadership skills. Help motivate other's to strive for better results."
good,"My co-workers are friendly and will assist with projects if possible. Unfortunately, in my department, we are unable to prioritize the work load because it's dictated my management and another department. There are too many task to complete to be current on them everyday and have to complete additional web based training. Also when your team member is off, you will have share the responsibility of working their case loads with others and you are expected to be current in your work load."
good,"Chase is a good place to work, but right now in card services the leadership teams communication skills are lacking. If they communicated better I believe there would be a more stable and happier work force."
good,∙Most work days consist of putting out fires as opposed to being proactive in order to avoid urgencies that cause the fires. This type of work environment tends to lead to unnecessary stress.
good,Loss mitigation analyst in the mortgage industry during a very hard economic time and difficult department with out policies & procedures.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a typically large corporation that can be impersonal and are to navigate at times. As long as you go into it understanding that, you can find success."

good,I would help customers with transactions and sold many accounts.
good,Taking phone calls for a bank is not the ideal job a lot of rich customers who verbally abuse you and then chase pays 3rd parties not really getting any of their benifits
good,"Large corporation and lots of red tape as in any typical big company. However, excellent place to be involved in great projects implementing latest technologies and challenging goals."
good,"Hierarchical and employees can get lost in such a big organization, but JPMorgan was a great learning experience and the environment, as expected, is fast paced. Downside is they don't care much about you outside of your work."
good,I would recommend them as an employer.I have been employed with Chase for almost 4 years.
good,"best commission system in retail bank, competitive environment many position levels if you can reach them."
good,A great place to work helping peole with their financial needs
good,"Management was hardly available. So the typical day was trying to learn the new things they would change every couple of weeks. Hardest part was knowing how big this company was and how long they have been doing this, and having departments that were making changes and unorganized that needed to make things ""easier"". The most enjoyable were the people. Everyone you seem to meet is friendly so it feels like a safe work environment."
good,"Job is simple enough. Customers tend to be nice but you remember the irate ones; mostly due to bank policies, not lack of customer service. Middle-management always seemed to be a twenty-something year old who felt like they know more than they really do. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customers or coworkers that you may not get along with. The best part is there are a lot of regular customers who enjoy seeing the same faces and will become your best customers."
good,This is one of the leading company which provides good oppertunity to learn technical as well financial domain knowledge with work life balance.
good,Amortized loans and posted payoff loans at month end. You recieve loans that needs to be amortized in your cue. The co-workers are great and management was OK.
good,"Fast paced, high pressure sales driven job. Good commission was definitely a plus, however, the distance from home and lack of involvement on the investment side from my role as a Personal Banker were drawbacks."
good,I love working for them. I love working the job that I am doing.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. I would work for the company again
good,the co-workers were great management cared about management only
good,"Excellent company to work for, with room for growth. Good co-works, strong competition but average support system by leadership. Can be perceived as a cut throat environment"
good,"Typical consumer banking branch, not so bad since I worked part-time."
good,A typical day at work is a busy day from the time I get started on my tasks to the time I leave for home. I can honestly say that I learn something new everyday. I love that I am busy. Management micromanages but is encouraging when you have accomplished or exceeded a goal. I would say that hardest part of my day is not being able to really speak to my co-workers. I am a friendly and out going person. I love getting to know people. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it keeps me busy and I continue to learn new things everyday.
good,i think its a good place to work if you have the drive. they move people around alot and theres no chance to build relationships which is the base of making good commission
good,a typical day at work is to come in and sit at ur desk and to search for certain document in a file
good,"Its a nice place to work for the people who need to take rest and have a easy life. For youngster, there is not much learning scope."
good,okay we got laid of and i went back to school to be a dental assistant
good,A typical work day involves interacting with customers with diverse needs. Applying my degree to different situations in the workplace. I would be micro-managed everyday on the smallest tasks. Hardest part of the job would be cold calling customers trying to convince them of something they do not need. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the joy of the customers when you help them out of a financial situation.
good,Worked in an area where the team was in multiple cities and locations within the city. Didn't feel that the project framework in was place for the type of endeavor.
good,loan structuring and underwriting - hardest part of job was learning the structuring from a banker's position vs. an attorney's position
good,Satellite office great working environment however limited growth opportunities.
good,"Role play, role play, role play, role play...."
good,I worked with some good co-workers during my brief time with the company.
good,"I have learned a lot about the credit industry, regulations, and continued increase my experience with customers of all different backgrounds and personalities."
good,"The job was enjoyable and most co-workers were considerably nice to work with, but it is nearly impossible to progress within the company. Corporate politics are extreme here and every promotion is merely a popularity contest. Under-qualified individuals are constantly promoted because they make friends with the management team. Over-qualified individuals are being stunted in their ability to progress and ultimately choose to leave, which leaves only under-qualified people to do the job. Not very efficient."
good,Similar to Wells Fargo. High pressure sale for customers and bankers. Management not too flexible. Constantly insisting to sell additional products that customers don't really need.
good,"A place where people are willing to teach their co-workers,"
good,"Nine years working in Corporate Real-Estate, primary focus is Critical Operations and Data Center Management including financial budget (operational and capital) planning, project implementation and project tracking, contract administration and overall facility building support on-site and working remotely."
good,"With the production volume and the daily goals, the day goes by really fast at JPM."
good,"I handle balance and transactions history of a customer. Helped customer with opening a new account, saving and checking account. We also offer Certificate of Deposits. It was fun working with the company's environment."
good,The set work schedule helped to plan life events such as vacations or family time and etc but there were many days when a change in schedule would have been appreciated. Management lacks communication skills with employees which often leads to uncertainty and confussion about changes in policies and such. Coworkers are nice but often stressed by the work life conditions such as a need to maintain productivity rate.
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a nice place to work. There are changes I would like to see with this company as far as team building and motivators. The work load is heavy and the computer systems are unpredictable. I feel the work load compared to the goals set for processors does not allow the full ""customer satisfaction"" experience I know I can deliver"
good,Managers are very selfish and only care about themselves. Otherwise a fun environment unless you are a banker.
good,"Managed various campaigns across multiple channels, managed the execution of the projects as well as vendor management to mention a few. The one thing I will take from JPMC is that perception is everything and is a reality as well as how to work at a fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job was to please everyone. The most enjoyable part was to see the finish product that you have managed from beginning to end."
good,"My experience at Chase was not very good. The company is very good but the employees are not very friendly. Therefore, not making my work experience a good one."
good,"Your co-workers should make the day enjoyable, that was mainly why I liked going to work, because of my co-workers. As far as customers go, you have to be ready to encounter a new scenario every time you deal with a new customer because they will get mad at you because they feel like you are keeping them from their money. It's a good place though."
good,Overall great experience for not having any financial experience background. Friendly co-workers.
good,"A typical day at work is usually very hectic, I do enjoy being busy. At JPMorgan I have learned to manage a portfolio as well as other employees. The toughest part of my current job is the amount of work I have been facing over the past few months. The company has been downsizing and all of the work has been redistributing work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with upper management in promoting productivity."
good,"- Helping customers with their accounts, deposits, withdraws"
good,Great benefits. Variety of departments to work for. It's a call center with varies of departments and alot of different changes.
good,Call center to a tee. Not much for advancement or opportunity.
good,"Worked with this company for many, many years. A typical day's work was nothing remains the same in that, changes were always taking place. Which, I think is a good thing, because I love variety even though change can be rough, it is a necessary thing for companies to survive and jobs to maintain. Associates were good teams to work with, mgmt was good and sometimes best, considering the different depts that I have worked in. when I first started with this company in Louisiana,the hardest part of the job, there was no supervisor in my department. No having much to do the first month or so after starting. The most enjoyable part after finally having duties and learning how to monitor my own workflow, and meeting the department's SLA's. What I learned is, even if one corporate offices is in (Ohio) manage of the company in Louisiana differs. All in all, it is a good company to work for."
good,"Good place to learn, coworkers are great. Management are not the best but everyone else makes it easier."
good,I provided customer service and a great customer experience while deepening relationships with existing customers. I also supplied sales revenue for the branch by cross-selling bank products and services.
good,"I learned that at the end of the day with a large corporation like JPMorgan Chase, depending on what division of the bank you work you will be treated unjustly. Unfortunately for the state of AZ being an at-will-state, employees don't have much rights. Overall I enjoy the options Chase provides, but unfortunately being such a huge fortune 500 corp they don't operate uniformly with their procedures."
good,Very nice place to work on. Low pay master
good,"Great company to work for (for the exception of management that supports and demonstrates favoritism). A lot of politics involved, just like with every big firm. Great 401k options including employer match. Typical day consists of working with bankers and help them get better at helping customers to achieve their financial goals. I manage the lobby to ensure customers are greeted and all their issues/concerns are addressed and taken care of from start to finish. In addition, I observe and coach tellers/bankers/Private client bankers on ways to deliver a World-Class Customer Experience."
good,"Well my day start off uploaded all application before start working. Look at emails to see any updates on changes with investors or company. Supervisor gives team direction and the task for the day. Learned about all investors FHA,VA, USDA, FANNIE, Freddie, Private and Assets. Management was great very informative. Co-workers were awesome great to see everyone's faces every time i go to work. Worked well together. Well the hardest part was what all different investors needed and once i learned that it was easy as pie. Overall the co-workers they make you smile if you were having a bad day or you needed help always offered helping hand."
good,"a typical work day is slow, well depends on the work flow."
good,"Worked for this company for many years and there are some areas that can be rewarding. It just depends on whom you work for and how you apply yourself. Stressful positions can harm your career - If you find yourself in that position ""Get Out"" Be honest and speak with Management they understand."
good,A great banking organization. They have a variety of career advancement positions for those who excel in their positions.
good,I have talked to many employees of other banking establishments and they all have worked for chase at one time and say that it is the worst out of many alloted banks.
good,No room for your own personality. You must adhere to established behaviors and follow scripts not only to deal with customers but also to interact with other employees.
good,"I see a lot of customers and always make a connection with each customer. Process their transactions and handle large amounts of money. Refilling the ATMs with cash, balancing end day cashbox, refer customers to bankers."
good,Benifits are great. Great company to work for. Management focuses alot on exceeding customer's expectations.
good,great company to work for and learn alot about the money flow
good,"Hours are not a set schedule looking for more stable hours to balance work and personal life, considering going back to college."
good,Constant change creates unstable work environment.
good,"I enjoyed JPmorgan chase, there was so many different things to learn."
good,"this company is together and leading the way to the future. this is the best company with many opportunity, and they listen to their employees."
good,"It was either super busy which was great, or really slow which was awful."
good,A typical day at work includes being on the phones for the most part of the day. Helping customers resolve issues with delinquent accounts. I have learned to be more patient with others and also learning how to cope with others. The hardest part of the phone is being tied to the phone. Most enjoyable is developing relationships with my co workers as well as being able to help the customer in any way possible.
good,Temporary assignment. The XSPAND division of JP Morgan was nice to work for and the people were very friendly. Casual Fridays were the best but also not something that regular JP Morgan allowed - only XSPAND.
good,"Assisted branch associates with internal questions in regards to policy/procedure, Bank products, legal documents. Direct management were good to get along with, co-workers were great. Difficulties were upper managements consistent schedule changes either canceling already approved days off or imposing overtime on short notice and running department with minimal staff. The job as a whole was enjoyable and having knowledgable support staff was great."
good,This position does not offer advancement. Location is very private and small number of employee
good,"My review of this company would be that it's taught me about how to handle situations under stress and time constraints, and to prioritize the functions of the job to get the work done in a timely manner."
good,"Attend multiple meetings regarding updates with in databases used in our department,discuss ways to enhance performace for optimal results. Work diligently and effectively on specifically assigned projects as well as interact management, interanl and external clients. In addition to working on projects, we prepare training sessions with clients enable them to navigate and understand the programs to assist in their day to day responsibilties around teh world.Also address managements incoming requests to update the JPM Legal and Compliance intranet site weekly with bulletins and updated resources for our internal clients.Challenges are there isn't enough time in the day to work on all projects however the team works hard to see things through."
good,Not too demanding; a lot of the people in the branch were in the dark as to what was being done.
good,A typical work day would include opening cash drawer and doing all teller responsibilities for the branch that were assigned to you. Then processing customer transaction and detecting fraud. There is also the referral part to make sure all customers were getting the best experience possible. To close out the day you would balance your cash drawer and secure all things before heading home.
good,I have worked in several different departments at Chase. I have received numerous promotions and I feel now it is time for me to move on and be successful at a different company.
good,Very good experience fun place to work....busy office..co-workers very nice...management good....
good,Job can be stressful and boring. It becomes robotic becasue they want you to say the same thing over and over again.
good,when working chase acts you can count on a bonus check the people whom had these chase acts seem to be worried and paid with no problem
good,A very professional fast-pace environment. Good opportunity to advance.
good,"A typical day was in your cubicle. You could listen to your own music, which definitely came in handy. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the constant changes in our daily routine because of either government or company decisions."
good,Good place to work. Good benefits. Advancement opportunites
good,I worked for JPMorgan Chase 26 years in the trust area. I worked in Corporate Trust as well as Personal Trust in the settlements area. I also worked on Loan Consolidations when JPMorgan and Bank One merged. I sent to loan sites to bring them into the target sites for Bank One.
good,Management only speaks to you if you have done something incorrectly. They treat you like you are still a student in High School
good,It's a very nice building nice works environment it needs to be more relax and have less micro managements
good,"Overall Jp Morgan Chase Bank is ok to work for, just have alot of turnovers with employers..."
good,"If you want to learn a lot Chase would be good place to start with.Teamwork,fast paced environment , if you like challenges and move up from position to position then you are at the right place."
good,"I enjoy working with Chase bank, as well I learn so much within the company."
good,Fast paced environment. Changes every 6 months to a year. New tools more focused towards security and automation. Also quite a bit of life cycle roll off of older technology.
good,"Worked for 8 years in the company and once I gave my two weeks notice, nobody reached out and put something on the table for me not to leave. Got a quick thank you best wishes. Not very helpful when it comes down to moving up. You have to know someone to get somewhere within the company, If you don’t well than you’re staying in the same position."
good,"The day to day are relatively easy. when certain leaders are on site management is engaging, attentive, and accommodating. When those leaders are away management drags their feet, is standoffish and backstabbing. Easiest part of the job would have to be the work load. not over encumbering. Hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with the whims of management. It seems like they dont have a clear picture of how they want to attain their goals. The also say that there is room for advancement but even with the right skills if you dont come into the company at the right pay grade you will not advance."
good,Jp morgan chase is a great company to work for unfortunately upper management is horrible. They hire young non experience college students run a branch not having the experience
good,"At the time of this review I know things have changed, but from my experience Good team to work on, but when there is an issue Management will either take a long time to address any issues or simply ignore you coming to them. 12 hour rotation shifts are reasonable, but if you want to switch shifts because of life changes it is nearly impossible. Overall, not a bad company or work environment."
good,There are numerous opportunities at Chase to gain experience. Other benefits are similar to other large corporations. Take advantage of the training and diverse experiences. Different Lines of Business have different work cultures so I would speak to someone in the specific area you're interested in to get a good idea of what it's like to work there.
good,Pay is great. Hiring Manager was great during the interview process and for the first 90 days. Now he is rude and insensitive. Team members are worn out and leaving the team for other positions.
good,"Being that it’s one if the worlds largest banks, I feel as though the employee could be treated a tad bit better. Collection department especially. Everyone should be treated fair and that department is based on friendship and who knows who."
good,"Can be a very fun environment, if you have the right positive employees, to make the job a fun experience!! Branches receive so many teller hours and can not go over, so as a lead, I had a lot of expectations and deadlines I had to follow, no exceptions. Due to the allotted hours, did not have teller coverage at times, so I was a full time teller with all the additional must due tasks. It was very much a challenge at times!!  Customer Service was a huge part of the Chase Culture...Always needed A++"
good,"It can be a fun place to work depending on your team mates. For the most part I enjoyed my time with the company. There are a lot of opportunities for advancement and managers do actually try to help you succeed. "
good,"Given that I have been a full time remote worker since 2004, my upward mobility was stopped at VP.  Although I worked with many MDs and EDs and even managed an operations team and hinted at the possibility of relocating, moving into the next logical progression in my career into Product in NYC, seemed at arm's length, even though for the past couple of years I was effectively part of that team."
good,"An American bank which expected total commitment from its employees. All the different roles I undertook were in the same overall department.  I was involved in ensuring all payments and credits were processed within time before the currency clearing went.  The final area I worked in was training which I really enjoyed. I created a 6 week technical training programme for new recruits and also managed the other trainers, giving them annual appraisals and 6 monthly reviews, plus set up the departmental interviewing task force."
good,"Air condition. Heat. Coffee. Friendly place to work. Corporate culture is very stiff. Working in a branch has its drawbacks. When I had great managers, everything works well. But bad manager, means every day is painful. The best part is helping clients. Most people are great to work with. Its a place where you can develop deep bonds with clients."
good,"Great place to start off working in an office environment. Lots of training and support. If you get a good manager its a fun place to work. They do have room for advancement, just need to prove yourself or talk to the right people. Great staff event days with lots of free food and time to hang out with fellow employees. Overall good experience working for them. Some departments have terrible hours and privileges"
good,Very little guidance and mentoring. They just start you out on a project and as someone that had only taken computer science classes that didn't use any of the same technologies it was very difficult. Good company if you have significant experience.
good,there is a lot of relocation happening so difficult to say this is a company i can plan on joining again.  culture and work life balance was very good.
good,"I worked JMPC for 28 years.  It was a great experience and room for advancement.  JPMC had become so global that employees didn't matter.  Although I enjoyed my time there, they cared more about the bottom dollar than what dedicated employees sacrificed to make them what they are today.  I will always treasure my time there."
good,"Have its own benefits of being the biggest global bank, pretty stable and reporting huge profits for more than two decades. Came out well of recession due to huge thrust on technology and innovation."
good,"If you've worked for a bank before then you know.   JPMC has many initiatives and programs promoting diversity, career mobility, etc.  Perhaps, it has helped some but I haven't observed a significant impact.  Middle Management is an issue in my opinion and the reason why the needle never moves forward.  AWESOME CEO!!! The benefits are okay. Most roles have a WFH option."
good,Decent place to work. Good benefits. Saturday’s are always short days. Off on Sundays. Scheduling is horrible. Be mindful of the area you apply to work in
good,"If you love banking and need a good place to learn and get experience, Chase may be a great choice for you! However, if you're just looking for a job to pay the bills while you pursue what you're actually passionate about, it may not be worth the stress. It is a fast-paced envioronment that requires multitasking and above-average stress management skills. There will be an obsessive emphasis on customer service that is enough to drive any employee mad. Chase is also one of those businesses that blurs work/life balance. They want you to see your team as a family, which may not be everyone's cup of tea. "
good,Not much scope for carrier growth. Management usually breaks the promises HR give at the time of joining. They very strange bonds for Green card initiation. Salary also less compared to all competitors.
good,"The pay is great, work life balance is great and most people are friendly. But the red tape and lack of development freedom are huge issues. Working at Chase is more about building your network than building your technical skills, in comparison to other companies. If that sounds like a good thing to you, definitely go for it!"
good,It is a relaxed work place with good benefits especially health care and vacation days. One can concurrently work and do studies should they aspire to further their education or embellish their professional career.
good,"My co workers were amazing, management on the other hand has not been great in any of my experiences. I worked in two separate departments, each one started out great then once management came in and took over it went downhill at a rapid rate. demanding roles and demanding management at all times."
good,Very competitive work environment. Quick to lay off with changes in work load. Good immediate management. Lacking good interdepartmental communication.
good,"This is a good place to work overall.  Team placement is very important and should never over looked.  Great benefits and great facility, parking can be a challenge."
good,Management is the worst. Management plays favoritism and if you are they friend they will help you move up. The pay and benefits are great. If you are not looking to move up i would recommend. If you want to eventually be promoted bad place to work.
good,"I worked for chase for 5 years I was terminated in 2019 because I approved what turned out to be a fraudulent transaction and the bank took a loss. I had a 5 minute conversation with my manager about it. Never had the opportunity to speak to HR directly. Based on what I was told my manager didn’t exactly try to save me either. Which to be fair, she isn’t obligated to do. Chase is a good company with an excellent starting salary and great benefits however if you really want to be successful you have to be on the sales side. There are advancement opportunities but in my experience they take forever to make good on their promises for promotions and as o stated above, don’t make a mistake once you get there."
good,"Management is not always reliable, knowledgable or great. Fast paced environment so you have the ability to learn a lot. Can be very competitive when trying to move up."
good,Working for Chase was a great experience.  I worked my way up from a part-time teller to Branch Manager.  Chase has a great training program for all job families.  I would recommend working at Chase and i would consider working for them again in the future.
good,"Initially, it was great and challenging. "
good,"company is trying to change banking and explore different ways to implement technology into banking , big company hard to make changes across different branches nationwide"
good,When entries are downloaded there must be a review of entries to be certain that they post to correct accounts.  Find a way to be certain the ending balances are correct.
good,"I personally didn't care for how things were run.  I felt there were too many ""chiefs"" and not enough ""Indians""   Upper Management barely showed interacted with the departments they were over and I don't feel really established a relationship with anyone who wasn't at their level.   When they were present, would always say, ""my door is always open"" but never gave the impression they meant it or followed through with meeting with individuals."
good,Lots of options on hours and career options. Hard to move up without further education. Plenty of overtime opportunity when it comes to tax season. Great job.
good,The best thing about working for the organization is that there really is a great sense of teamwork. So many of the people I worked with had been there for many years and were very happy to teach what they knew.
good,"Stressful, don’t except excuses, must agree with management. Company comes first and requesting scheduling changes was a bit of a hassle. Advancement opportunities were poor."
good,"I understand it is a bank but it is way too corporate. Sit at your desk all day, log in your phone to let them know you are at work and log out to let them know you are using the restroom or on taking a break."
good,"life was a one fire another another.I came in right during the meltdown. I liked the challenge of finding solutions and helping people. I worked hard for that company and was sad when i was let go. I had 9 managers in the 5 years I worked there and there was many re stacks.  While you are in the bubble life is good. They have fun things for the employees to do and event that make the working environment better than most.  Don't get comfortable and always be looking for the next opportunity I think it is good to be a little paranoid working there. Everyone I know that was let go never saw it happen. If you are managed remotely try to find another job soon as you can you will get chopped in headcount reduction.  When you hear ""information sharing"" we want you to document what you do start looking for another job. They want to offshore what you do. I was surrounded by great people and I watched many walk out the door in the many reductions. Higher wage earners were shown the door their worked to be offshored or replaced by lower wage workers."
good,They have pretty good training to get started. They will connect you with all the top people in the department. At the same time they take training a little too serious and if you make a mistake that will make look very poorly
good,Chase has a good medical benefits package and a great 401K options. The pay is really good. With hard work and dedication a person can climb the ladder.
good,"solid employment."
good,"JPMorgan Chase can be a great place to work.  The pace is generally very fast, and middle management carries a heavy burden in making the company run.  Work/life balance can be a challenge at times."
good,"Great on promoting diversity with women, gender association, and ethnicity. Also, respect ones right to religious freedom. Strong on promoting team work."
good,Quality of job is completely dependent on individual manager. Generally good place to work but don't expect to advance quickly. Benefits are good but base salary is low
good,"Good place to work, but they do lay off a lot. In the past there was almost endless opportunities for advancement or lateral move. Now you are lucky if you can just maintaining your current position."
good,"JPMorgan is a fast-paced competitive environment.  If you are ready to compete and work long hours, this is the place for you and advancement is attainable."
good,"J.P Morgan is a great company to work for. Great staff, training, procedures, and so on. The only thing is that they don't promote enough or recognize improvement."
good,"Management and branch level staff could have produced better results in terms of listening to both sides of the fence in a more concerted effort. Management (at the time) held a two sided approach in the sense of asking for employee feedback, and then using it as a means of holding against those who added their perspectives. Growth can be stunted if only one side of the equation is listened to. To my understanding, strides have been made in many arenas that have improved upon management-employee relations."
good,"Very fast paced job. Answering calls for maintenance issues with debit cards and for fraud on debit cards. All calls were timed and recorded. Call had to be under 3 minutes. 2018 new systems were implemented, which made it a bit harder to meet the required under 3 minute call limit. Management was supportive in what they believed was a good call. All managers had different views on customer service. Coworkers were awesome to work with. Everyone supported and helped each other. The hardest part of the job was meeting the 3 minute call limit. All customers were different and some took longer than others."
good,JP Morgan Chase offers great benefits & career mobility. There is a lot of opportunities to collaborate with several partners within the firm. It is a great place to learn.
good,"Very stressful because of lack of employees."
good,"Ok place to work, typical mortgage underwriting position.  Management was decent.  Very slow time in the industry, somewhat difficult to get files to work on."
good,"Learn of credit card and branch. How to deal with hard customers and still stay calm and positive to help the customer. work for 8 to 9 hours a day answering incoming calls,"
good,Not a bad place to work if you have the right manager.  Not great for work life balance.  Compensation is above other companies. It's a big company so many opportunities.
good,"JPMorgan is a very stressful place to work these days.  There is not a lot of work and life balance.  "
good,Management is very messy and they have favorites. customer are sometimes horrible but the good outweighs the bad. hours are flexible and shift bid is fair
good,"Working at Chase in challenging and good learning process. Helping co worker while learning on job functions by tutoring and cross training. Assigned classes learning Money laundering, know tour customer, patriot Act and Applying Bank and Department procedures."
good,"I no longer work for Chase, N/A "
good,"Good work culture . Job security present. Flexibility in work timings. Safe and secured work place. Respectful work environment."
good,"Good source of money if you need extra cash, definitely not a set full time position. The management could be a little better as well. They can sometimes be rude."
good,"Nice place to work, offers benifits, Kandahar perks for employees and their families. Managers are willing to create a schedule that will work for you if you have a family."
good,This is a great job for somebody who wants a regular scheduled and is ok with doing the same thing every day. There is potential for career growth but it can take a very long time.
good,Chase was a decent company to work for.  I truly wnjoued working for the mortgage director.  She allowed us as employees to do our job to or full potential without getting involved.
good,"Every morning I have to run the Harold talk about where we at"
good,"Chase was a good place to work but getting over the hurdles of having  underwriters, processors, closers, etc  in a different State was a challenge. Getting answers from underwriting typically took several days for issues that could have been resolved much faster."
good,"In my current role there is a lot to get down with little oversight.  My role consists of reviewing docs and communication via phone and email to various parties to complete a loan process.  The job requires focus, attention to detail, being extremely organized, and having good communication skills.  Most of my day is communicating with my sales team, Title, or Escrow regarding needs and getting organized to retrieve all required items and coordinate a loan signing.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes dealing with all the different personalities who are constantly rushing a situation that cannot be rushed.  I enjoy the freedom to work at my own pace with no oversight but I always manage to complete my daily work being focused on my day to day tasks and wanting to provide the best service to our clients."
good,Good company to work for. My experience there has been rewarding and should help to prepare me whatever the future holds. Competitive yet nurturing environment to work in.
good,The company has awesome benefits. It all depends which department you are in. Some are more laid back than others. The only downfall is working for a corporate company and feeling like a number.
good,"Good work/ life balance, horrible management, received no training for position other than shadowing which made an nice job difficult and stressful. Little help from management given often felt judged and put out by management when requesting help."
good,I was working as an consultant. Had experience working with multi-level stakeholders. Reasonable working environment yet could be challenging sometimes.
good,"Working in a prestigious banking company such as jp morgan chase bank was a very new experience for me coming out of high school. The expectations were high, management was always circling between branches, and changes were constantly occurring. However, I have learned a lot about customer service and cash handling policies that I will hold onto for my future endeavors."
good,"Team enviorment"
good,"The job was a job. The culture was not that great, but everyone talks about trying to make the culture better and management was getting feedback on how to improve work environment. over all it was not a bad job it was just not a good job."
good,call center rep taking back to back calls in regards to credit business accounts. must be able to multi task and take care of customers needs and wants.
good,Some difficulty with other employees.  Work demanded my full attention and there were lots of interruptions from team members regarding non work related subjects.  Little supervision in our department.  Company offered lunches brought in for achievements in the department.  Prizes for production.
good,"Generally working with smart, intelligent people.  Ability to learn new conecpts.  Average Work/Life balance.  Job mobility within company is encouraged.  Low job security (My job was eliminated 4 times in the past 15 years."
good,Working at JP Morgan was a good experience because my colleagues was a pleasure to work with.  The job required a lot of travel and this made it quite enjoyable.  Management was fair and understanding.
good,"Making outbound collections calls - 1st Bucket Collections onwards."
good,Good company to work with but you will have to fight for the kind of work you want. Employees are given chance for learning different technologies and fair ratings.
good,"Help customers with their accounts, took supervisor calls from other reps. Open accounts, helped with online problems, went over customers accounts with them."
good,"Better training for the Credit Card collection reps. They stress, ""getting the money by the end of the day"" by any means. Favoritism towards the reps who can ""get the money"""
good,"If you are not able to work on weekends, you need to learn to work  Saturdays and you are not able to plan your weekends, so no notice in advance."
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with and have had good fortune to have relatively good managers."
good,"I wouldn't recommend this for a person who is an active type person, you seat the entire time. Really great pay and health benefits, plus great coworkers."
good,"big turn over,very unorganized management-"
good,Branch managers are usually clueless and only really care about their bottom line. Working the lobby can be extremely annoying. There will be times when you have partake in simple task such as ordering debit cards. Position should be entry level.
good,"My job consisted of helping people with their banking needs. We offered investment advice, mortgage and loan services and credit products. We were very helpful whenever we could be"
good,Monthly targets created a hyper competitive environment where ethics and values were stretched to their very limits. It began to have a detrimental effect on my well-being.
good,Chase is a good place to start in the cooperate world. May be a good place to climb up the ladder but not for everyone. I started in the collection department and worked my way up.
good,I've met some amazing people working at Chase. I make decent money but the pressure from management is stressful on some days. The expectations are contradictory sometimes and there has been a lot of change in the department in the last year alone.
good,"The company offers great benefits and provides opportunities an adequate work-life balance, positive work environment and advancement.  The extent to which one benefits from and/or enjoys the work-life balance, positive work environment, is largely dependent upon the views of the group lead - i.e. s/he may prioritize ‘meeting numbers’ to the exclusion of other KPIs one may not have the work-life balance.  However, when group lead finds a balance it can be a wonderful place to work."
good,"Typical day at chase is fast paced and a vast amount of transactions are processed during the work day. It is a very good place to work , it is a place in where you will learn about the financial world.  If you are into finance and banking chase is an great place to work."
good,"All I can say is, change of management isn't always great. The Company, benefits, customers, coworkers, and the location of the branch is great. I have no complaints in that area."
good,"Lot of work ahead to align JPMorgan and Chase, Work Stress rolls downward toward bankers and tellers to continually raise the bar and you will eventually be looked at as a number based on your figures."
good,some areas do not put you in a position to exceed. Hired into a position then they changed the job description. Sometimes mid-level managers are looking out for themselves
good,Not a place to work. Stressful at times but also good opportunity for overtime if you are looking for some. Advancements are not the best at this company even for people who have worked there for over a year. Pretty low pay for the expectations.
good,"JP Morgan provides a busy work environment, "
good,Great career choice to work at Chase. Layoffs in 2014-16 hurt overall belief in the company's mission. A high number of strong 'talent' were lost in the shuffle and never considered for rehire or placement in other departments. An unnecessary waste of time and investment.
good,Better advancement opportunities once you are in however it is a long process to get in. If you start in the call center the schedule shifts aren't very good in the beginning and its hard to move out of area.
good,Chase is a great play to work if you are comfortable constantly setting products. The better you are at sales the better. The workplace environment is great but can be stressful at times.
good,"Call center style with focus on Customer service and # of calls answered per day. You would take client calls and assist with issues, while trying to maintain excellent customer service."
good,"Pros:"
good,"one of the key things that I've learned and learning so much is embracing change, you have to be receptive of it or be left behind.  working with this company I am also learning how to stretch myself beyond the normal. you learn more each day on how to strive to be and do better than you did before. taking care of our existing and potential clients, lead by example."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job were the customers and assisting the bankers.  I learned to read and understand the mortgage and HE documents.  I also enjoyed explaining the customers escrow to them, and took great pride helping to give the customer a better understanding of it"
good,"High-performing customer and employee experience manager with more than 14 years of call center experience. Proven track record in account management within various roles of consumer banking and mortgage banking. Planning and sales experience, combined with staff development and training accountability, to deliver exceptional performance results."
good,"The company preaches about work life balance but does not encourage it. It is often ""frowned upon"" if you want to work a normal 8-9 hour work day. I hope one day they do. If so, I would be happy to continue working there."
good,"Hectick work culture on day to day basis, No proper process followed and less opportunity to career advancement and business exposure with politics from managers"
good,The company demands that you work a lot.  They talk about having a balance but during my time there they expect you to live at work.  The management was not very knowledgeable and caused much confusion.
good,"JPMorgan Chase has become very numbers driven recently, which is expected from such a company. However, some sort of balance needs to be found between numbers and Customer Service experience. Certain goals need to be attained for performance, but management doesn't always seem to be on the same page when it comes to which item should come first. Communication was somewhat slack, but when the right resources are used, solutions could be found."
good,"if you don't except any career advance, it's a good job. The company is so big that lots of people are not doing anything work related. It's hard to advance your career even you are distinguished."
good,"Lots of office politics between branches. It's best to focus on yourself, but make sure you don't step on anybody's toes in the process. Building a core team of partners is imperative to success because you're primarily getting business from referrals and your partners closing the referrals you send to them."
good,"Responsible for originating and processing loans while maintaining client relationships"
good,The job can be extremely slow but there are numbers that you must make and deadlines that must be met. You can control your own path throught the company however you must be willing to relocate at times.
good,"good place to learn and get exposure, really stressful when busy and customers can be rude. they provide really good benefits packages for part-time employees."
good,"I'm sure other parts of the company are exciting, but the specialty assets group in the private bank is beyond boring.  The level of bureaucracy and regulation within bulge brackets is also difficult to deal with."
good,Awesome company with great benefits but not a lot of opportunity for advancement. Most enjoyable part of my job is my team and management staff. I've worked in some great lines of business but trying to transition from an Admin to another role is has been hard and it's the motivation for looking outside of the firm for opportunities.
good,Professional atmosphere and friendly work nature with supporting hands of the company president. One can learn and grow with company. Good Salary and attractive incentive structure which pays on time.
good,Chase Wealth Management offers brokerage and investment advisory products to individual and business investors.  The business is very collaborative across departments and it is easy to work with others in this business.
good,I don't have anything to say about the company it was a place to work.  It ultimately depends on the department you are in and the connections you make.
good,"Directors and VPs do not appreciate the pressure their leaders in the call center experience.  Promises are made for upcoming initiatives to take some adminstrative tasks off of our plates, but nothing ever comes of it.  Time for coaching our specialists suffer."
good,"The company is awesome , the management of some departments not so much...the diversity is amazing. I have learned alot while being there..most people are helpful and friendly"
good,Benefits and pay very good. Could be stressful...some customers mean and rude...sometimes very short handed and at times management did not support employees. We were like a family and most employees had been there for a long time. Hardest part of job was dealing with rude and mean customers.
good,"I truly enjoyed working here as a manager. My team and my colleagues were inspirational to me. There was a lot to learn everyday in the position I held. Workplace culture can be competitive and quick-paced because it was part commission based. The better your sales, the better the work environment. There was a lot of focus on employee attrition rates...there was a high turnover for sale/customer service agents in the call center."
good,"I really liked working with my team. We all had different personalities, but I think that working together got us through the job. I think we needed to be more up to date on policies and procedures though."
good,"Demanding, strict, a tough place to work, but boy are the benefits worth it! They do make you work your little fingers to the bone, but they do make up for it come pay and bonus day."
good,Hours are from 9-6 M-F and 9-4 for Saturday.  Great vacation system and work/life balance.  Recommend going into sales if you're looking for a better career advancement.
good,I have ben with Chase for 13years and the salary and the compensation is not great. The hours you work is very long. I enjoyed my joy cause I love what I do.
good,"Good work and life balance. Good healthcare and corporate benefits/discounts.  Good internal job transfer opportunities,  Competitive, Low salary compare to other companies."
good,You'll never be more proud of your CEO but your immediate manger will be a pain and also upper management are pretty much out for their  own bonuses and things...also you may have to go out of your comfort zone to advance  or be in the many layoffs...sorry
good,"taking 120 plus a day inbound calls, being cursed at one minute and talking to someone nice the next. "
good,Requires a lot of overtime.Ability to manage multiple projects and work on different assignments. Working from home is not available anymore except rare situations
good,it was a great experience but there where no profesional advancements. they expected alot from the employee and we really didnt get nothing in return for example we didnt feel motivated enough.
good,"Customer service"
good,Great company to have your first job at. Helps you understand the banking world and trains you for future accidents. Helps you manage your finances. Has great benefits. Although advancement is very hard
good,"review my emails, troubleshoot tickets, train new user in unix and EIDRS, write documentation, attain meetings, reset and modify user account password,"
good,"I enjoyed working as a teller and I began right before many changes happened. I don't approve of all the ""tweaks"" to the systems and the policies they constantly made. It was making the job impossible for tellers because we had to be everywhere, but we were also short staffed. We would mention it to the manager, and it was in one ear and out the other. Nothing ever gets done with management and those in higher positions."
good,Working at JPMorgan Chase has been a great experience; being able to work independently with the day-to-day of your personal work load and group projects. Management was always available to answer questions and be supportive of our work load. The best part of working at JPMorgan Chase was my team members.
good,"Let's get one thing straight, the pay for administrative staff SUCKS! They have the lowest salaries compared to other companies.   "
good,"The company does allow for one to maneuver through the retail bank. You can start off as a teller and eventually become a manager. However, this is where your career come to a halt. That is  if your dreams are to become Senior Management. The roles are far and few between. You may ask why not jump into the corporate sector. The honest answer is that for someone to cross over from retail to corporate is a rarity. To the firms credit they are attempting to promote inclusivity for all of its employees. The problem is they are still a ways away from achieving this goal."
good,I enjoyed my co workers and the benefits. the job itself was not bad It was highly complicated but I learn quickly and the give you plenty of time to learn.
good,working as a supervisor to assist with disputes and helping with concerns with processing chargebacks or rebills to visa/MasterCard rules and regulations reg Z
good,"Great place to start and gain experience.  Typically have to accept a unwanted position in order to advance.  Employee must meet unit metrics to remain employed.  Senior management is very good. Employee must multi-task, have excellent communications and persuasion skills in collecting."
good,"Definitely a company where growth is possible. Work culture is based on the team you're working with. Management is hit or miss. Initially, I was fortunate to have great training and management. Later, the management team was shuffled and priorities seemed to be switched."
good,"•	Facilitate semi-annual and annual reporting, close the Fund’s books, prepare year- to-date proofs and audit Workpapers, prepare the Fund’s financial statements and maycoordinateprintingandmailingoffinancialstatementstoshareholders."
good,I maintained a serviceable work queue and had a 100% internal and external audits.A fast paced workplace and plenty of vailable classes and several mandatory. Overall I never wanted to leave.
good,"If you like being told if you can stand or sit, this is your place. Typical call center environment.  If you like working in a cubicle setting this is your place. Medical benefits are great though. No complaints there."
good,JP Morgan is a great Company and great place to work. The people are nice with the willingness to train and assist you in anyway to achieve your career goals.
good,"Jp morgan chase is a difficult place to work.  They monitor everything and the regultions are really strick.  However, they do pay well and the benefits are great."
good,"Started out in the call center, it was horrible all around, management, training, etc,  However it is easy to move your way up if you work hard.  And their benefits are amazing, as far as vacation and 401k match.  Also its like high school working there, everyone is talking to and about everyone else"
good,"The technical aspect of the company was complicated due to the fact it incorporated many other banking institutions, but was striving to consolidate many applications and programs to a more uniform structure. While working for Chase, they did take care of their employees with advancement, pay, and activities."
good,Company with very little work/life balance. Tenured employees are not valued and almost always taken for granted by management and employees. Senior Management does not consider how changes will effect every one. (Employees and Customers)
good,"Chase is a high turnover place with a lot of stressful daily calls taken, the opportunity to help cardholders is a great payoff for the influx of calls that come in for what may seem mundane calls to pay, ask for late fee forgiveness and international travel warnings is the bulk of it. While there are chances to change and make a difference in peoples lives at times with offering new products and services that make being a Chase cardholder a valuable thing."
good,"I've worked for JPMorgan Chase for over 12 years and am still stuck as a Banker. They promise career development programs for advancement, but once in the program, programs dissolve and career path ends. It seems like they have these ""career development"" workshops when the company needs to focus in sales on certain areas, give false hopes and dissolve once they meet their numbers. It might not be like this in all regions, but this has been my experience. They string along. However, the incentive plan for RB's is great and get paid monthly with unlimited earning capability and are not super demanding when it comes to reaching monthly incentives, they are very relaxed and do not put a lot of pressure towards meeting numbers."
good,The culture is great and getting better.  The benefits are the best. You are able to educate yourself and be reimbursed.  The volunteerism in the communities are always a priority.
good,Great opportunity to learn more about mortgage and banking products.  I wish the mortgage loan process was better but overall a good company to work for.
good,"Lots of service, not enough focus on sales. Work days are longer than most other banks. Great benefits and paid time off. Need more salary to keep talent."
good,"The branch and company cultures were good, the sales goals are very attainable, and the work is not difficult. "
good,"Productive workplace that provides some stability and structure. A place full with a wide range of professionals from various educational backgrounds, who work together with cohesiveness across departments."
good,The work environment was stressful. Strict controls on every aspect of the job. Employment metrics were gathered promptly. Very unorganized. Policies were changed weekly with little accurate communication.
good,"In my opinion, Chase is a great place to work at as a teller, if you are a high school graduate. I would not recommend it as a full-time type of job based on the hourly pay. When I first started working there, My managers were AMAZING. They were so much help and they understood when life circumstances didn't allow someone to make it to work. I then had to relocate due to moving to a different city, and the managers there were horrible! they would write down even the littlest mistake, and they had favorites. It was so obvious because I witnessed some colleagues making mistakes way worse than I ever did and the manager would let it slip. When I was pregnant things just went downhill. I think the best thing about working with the company was interacting with customers, and being able to help them with their financial needs."
good,"Modernly nice and clean facility. Typical call center culture. Aging building."
good,The company has a competitive culture which was good given it drove people to do better.  The main negative of JPM was that typically one would work 60-70 hour weeks.
good,"Good learning."
good,"i enjoyed working here somewhat, for the most part the worst part was having a job 1 day and not know the next. they take u from one position and place u in another with no notice."
good,"Great opportunity with great management and co-workers. However, Chase is layoff heavy, be cautious. Worked from home as an auto finance underwriter. Technology for a large bank is in the dinosaur ages. However, dealing with our client base was fun."
good,"Customers are always very rude. It's extremely fast paced, Chase does not hire enough Tellers, so it's always short staffed and the bankers and managers have to help behind the teller line. Being that you're handling people's money you have to be VERY careful and accurate while at the same time working and moving VERY fast to complete transactions."
good,"Wamu was a  great place to work but has been taken over by chase. I transferred to my new position shortly after they switched over, therefore I can not accurately rate my employment there."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a solid company that offered rich learning opportunities.  Job instability is an issue due to company moving and downsizing.They offer very competitive salaries.
good,Working for JPMC was a pretty good experience. The pay and benefits are great but overall the management was not. I would say take the opportunity if you can but I was not happy there.
good,This company acquired the bank that I previously worked for. Overall I miss a larger companies dynamic. This company went away from good old customer service.
good,I loved my job at Chase. I held many different positions in my 14 yrs there and learned a lot. The last 5 years I was able to work from home which I loved and it helped since my mother was elderly and I was able to be home in case she needed me. The down side to Chase is that they have several lay offs every year and it doesn't matter if you are a good employee or not.. If you pull the short stick your gone.. Losing my job at Chase almost cost me my house and it did cost me to lose a lot of money with having to modify my loan.
good,A typical day at work is very busy since staff is so limited. 'i love my co-workers but it always felt like I had a long list of things to do and never enough time.
good,"I take in calls for banking needs of  US based customers if they want to ask their balances for their account or any other banking concerns. I learned to be patient and listen actively to the customers. The management is good they strive for excellence. Workplace culture is very competitive and kinda strict because we are dealing with actual bank account and a great sum of money. The hardest part of the job is the volume of calls, I averaged at least 80 calls per shift and it's also hard to being in the night shift. Enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and the activities outside of work as part of their work-life balance activities."
good,"If you want to work with the best technologies, this is the place to be. Health care benefits is among the best if not the best in Financial industry. Great vision."
good,the job isn't hard however it depends on the management that you have behind you. If management isn't right then the staff will fall as well. Securitas has to be the worst company I've ever come across beginning with HR who doesn't communicate and constantly mess up pay checks.
good,"It's a big bank with everything that comes with it. Its core competency is its size. I wouldn't go back, though some of the people I met while working there are lifelong friends."
good,"Very productive company that continues to make good decisions but you still have those bad apples in leadership. Pay is lower than market in several departments. Same Old story, its who you know if you want a successful career at Chase. Control freaks in many areas of the company."
good,"This is a fantastic place to work, everyone is professional, helpful and highly intellectual... Room for advancement.  JPM Chase is a totally collaborative experience and environment.... It is a firm where you can grow and excel without limits"
good,"You don't have great work life balance at JPM, that is the American IB culture.  You do have job security though and they offer excellent benefits for you and your family."
good,has good insurance.  hard to balance hours to fit your lifestyle.  hard to get to know co-workers as you are hooked to the phone in your ear all day.  good training and preparation for the job and they keep you updated on regulations.  Hard to prepare for advancement
good,Management was not visible or very interactive. Little interaction with people as all were focused on the inbound calls. Day consisted of outgoing and inbound calls for collections purposes.
good,Good job security. Demanding high speed work environment that benefits those who can multitask and perform under pressure. Company seems resistant to promote from within and looks outside of company to fill roles
good,While i did have a Great schedule which allowed a great work/life balance the pay wasn't enough to sustain my family and i was forced to find employment elsewhere.
good,The Culture was not a team environment and not a lot of room for growth.  There was a lot Work/Family Balance.  I also enjoyed having the wellness program as part of the health benefits.
good,Lack of guidance and ordinance with minimal resource for staff attempting complete medical reviews with little to no medical knowledge. Skills needed to perform job specific duties not provided to the staff.
good,"Great environment for learning and skills growth, but very corporate.  Firm is huge, you will feel insignificant no matter what your actual job is.  Great Managers. Great Coworkers"
good,I love a company that can assist with allowing myself to grow within the company.  Having a great range of options for an employee. A big key for me is that of benefit options.
good,"*Not all areas function or interact the same, with that being said its best to view a specific area that you are interested in and do some research. Be prepared to work over 10 hours per day (depending on area/job title) as well as working on weekends at some point. People are typically friendly and work area is inviting."
good,"slow job, they want you to be able to type quickly. They do have community events sometimes and they also allow you to listen to music. Production area is clean and air conditioned."
good,Great company to work with when i started 11 years ago but got rid of incentives and provides expensive poor healthcare benefits. Management is mostly unprofessional and not trustworthy.I will miss helping card members.
good,"Team in which i worked needs a lot of  patience and hard work. Long working hours in peak cycles and concentration. Otherwise people are good, work environment is good. On weekends if you are working you get complimentary snacks or lunch. and comp off for that."
good,Great place to start your career. Truly great people within the firm. Challenges are trying to navigate how to get to the next level. Evaluations are inconsistent and your manager truly determines your ability to move up or around in the firm.
good,Great company to work for. Working directly with the group on a daily basis was really great experience. My colleagues were great to work with as well.
good,"Good company.  Challenging but fair.  Great people at many levels, with good support from local teams.  Fast paced with tight deadlines and deliverables from multiple sources."
good,Not a bad place to work. I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with on a daily basis. I didn't appreciate the massive amount of H-1B IT workers (80%) at JPMC. It seemed very non-American for an American Corporation.
good,"diverse company.  with great benefits and good work life balance.  However, hard to advance within the company.  sometimes its who you know, not what you know."
good,"Chase has been a good place to work with great benefits.  However, the opportunity to advance has been impossible.  The company has a good work culture and very diverse."
good,"This is a high pressure job, the time on the phone is long, you are confined to a cubicle, schedules breaks and lunches. friendly co-workers, management micro manages. Generous benefit package."
good,"From my experience Chase is a great company to work for if you want to spend your life in banking. If you would like to go to school while working, Chase is not the place for you."
good,I enjoy coming to work and helping people day to day. I also come and help manage the staff.  Everyday dealing with customers I tend to learn something new everyday which I can share with my coworkers and share my thoughts that can better the branch as a hole. Management can be a little more professional.
good,"After working several years in the Spanish Credit Card department, for the most part, I enjoyed my experience there.  Unfortunately, their ability to retain good talent is hampered by their process for people to enjoy possibilities of advancement.  I would have loved to stay, but after requesting to transfer at least once a year, to other areas and increase my knowledge base, I had to leave to be able to do so.  "
good,Irvine office had small opportunities to grow professionally. If wanted a promotion needed to relocate to NC. Management was supportive. Work load was reasonable. Pay and benefits were good.
good,"People who work in JP can't manage worklife balance, especially yearly 4 releases back to back wont give any break to feel free. no work statisfaction and full of politics by mangament."
good,"pay scale  pretty good at 65 + 15% shift differential for working evening hours. management better than most as well as benefits.Like most large companies, layoffs are imminent every other year or so."
good,Hard to get promoted . The changes going on at the bank upsets the customer . Not a bad plate to work but not the best . Great benefits .
good,I really enjoyed working here as a part-time teller because all of other tellers that I worked with were around my age so we were able to bond. i made friends while working at Chase that I am still close to many years after.
good,"The work at JPMorgan is extremely demanding - I've heard this echoed from colleagues in various roles and depts. Late hours are often required, work/life balance is very hard to achieve. Pay structure is on the lower end of avg; the pay isn't bad, but the avg salary here for a given role is often below the industry avg. The employees are very friendly and welcoming though, so people wise it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Great Company to work for and great benefits, not much room for advancement.   I learned how to be great with customer service."
good,"working at chase will give you a lot of opportunity. the people there are great and are always willing to help you, but the management  are not good at all."
good,"they offer free drinks, hot and cold for all employees. they have a specific comfort room for pregnant and differently abled employees inside operations."
good,Depends on your management hierarchy.  Reorgs are highly risky.  Current re-org is favoring a very flat organization.  They have brought in new folks
good,"Typical day was 7am to 6pm. I've learned a lot of assistant skills as well as became certified in trading. I did not pursue trading but I found it helpful to understand the business better."
good,I take escalated calls for online issues when customer are having difficulties log in to their online banking. I do trouble shooting steps and try to assist with our website. I have learned that patience is a huge role and lots of empathy. Co-workers are great team players I know I can reach out to anyone for help when needed. I enjoy the satisfaction I get when a customer is happy that their issues/concerns were handled properly.
good,Was able to work independently. Had my own accounts to work with deadlines for tasks. Use many computer systems daily to update each account. Worked well with co-workers. We kept up on our deadlines and helped each other to maintain a successful team. Enjoyed being able to work independently and still have co-workers or a manger to assist if needed.
good,"I started at Chase as an Associate in compliance, straight out of law school. In 2012, the legal job market was tough and I thought JPMC was a great place to be out of the gate. Today, I still think that: I met many of my close friends at Chase and the work/life balance was great. However, I learned quickly after two years that compensation was significantly below the market rate and advancement was difficult; rather than promoting from within, they regularly brought in external candidates to fill mid-level positions."
good,Become involved in company networking organizations and have your efforts recognized by upper management for advancement. Must go above and beyond. Not the best on work life balance. This is based on the division in which you are employed.
good,JPMorgan is a great place to begin your career but unless you are in a major profit center business it is easy to get lost in the large company.  Many people leverage the great name and move on to other company's.
good,"Chase is a large bank, there is opportunity there, you just have to match the management culture.  the salary was good, however the life work balance did not fit for me."
good,Company did a lot for its permanent employees including free lunches and raffles. Associates were informed of any changes in time.
good,"Loved my Branch. Co-workers were awesome! I love helping people, so I was able to do that there. The company started making huge changes in 2015. They didn't want you to help the customer, they just want people to be in and out quickly. More pressure with selling."
good,Its a large bank. Lots of opportunity to grow.I was only working on a contract basis so its hard to describe the whole experience since we had limited access.
good,"A typical day at work was extremely busy, we dealt with  lot of risk on a daily basis, worked with extremely competent and helpful co-workers. Most busy times of the day were market open and market close"
good,There are lots of talented people in the firm. And there are always new projects and challenges to work on and learn. All the floors are recently renovated and all the equipments are brand new.
good,"Very productive place to work. I learned how to handle $25,000 in my drawer, process vault transactions, load and manage ATM's. Eveyone I worked with was very friendly."
good,Working at Chase is nothing special. You can have fun at your job or you can detest it but it basically boils down to who you work with.
good,"The level of work was good, a typical day went fast because of the level of production.  Chase strives to get things right the first time therefore it was a good place to work overall"
good,"Projects roles thought me to cordinate and handle stakeholders from various locations and expectations. "
good,Jp Morgan chase bank is a good company but there is always room for improvement. There is room for improvement on cummunication through the chain of command and support from leadership.
good,JP Morgan is an very well oriented corparation with the potential to be a better business. JP Morgan has thousands of employees and signiture perks that make employees forget about the now.
good,"Hard to Advance Internally. Any move within the IT department is considered lateral and reviews can sometimes be very questionable. There are a lot of benefits from being in chase, but they seem to loose you in the mix a lot of the time."
good,The department was a team environment. Most employees worked well together.  Some issues with communications and timely announcements.   Flexible scheduling was the greatest asset of the position.
good,"I learned a lot about making relationships with the community, trying to meeting set goals and the importance of triple counting money."
good,"The working environment is good, however the work assigned is high and there is lot of stretching in working hours. over all it is good place to work."
good,Great company with great benefit however low on work life balance an training needs. Senior management has clarity in vision howevrthe middle management may tend to focus on tactical tasks
good,Work is very interesting. Get to learn new things every day. Great team to work with. Difficult to manage certain dependencies on the other teams. But overall good experience
good,I enjoy working at JPMC.  The business is always evolving. I enjoy working in a high paced workplace that helps me keep me busy and getting the task done.
good,"Very challenging environment, high stress and need to constantly deliver and aggressively meeting all - you can't just sit on the success of your book of business, but need to bring additional relationships to the firm, year after year."
good,"The pay is lower compared to the competition and in my department, Compliance, there is a really high employee turnover rate.  Personally though, I was recognized for my performance and was treated well."
good,"Chase was a very customer oriented brand, but they compensated that with amazing benefits and bonuses. Before i left, they decided to change everything, took away a lot of the bonuses and not before long, all the unneccesary things we would take daily, became not  tolerable.... at all. The bonuses and benefits was pretty much an exchange for us being drilled to the ground and being ok with it."
good,"Starting with the positives, Chase pays very well and its benefits have always been good. I have been pleased with all of my managers here, but there is only so much they can do in the environment they have created. Which is one where everything is done retroactively, and every day feels like you are just putting out fires and making up for the lack of proper  foresight, staffing, or planning by upper management. Jobs comes and go with the wind, along with employees, and training is mediocre at best for what is supposed to be an industry where all things are accounted for. I was literally told ""just jump in and mess some stuff up and figure it out"" by a manager. To me this is unacceptable as the work is of high societal value and dealing with thousands of dollars and peoples homes. Because of the high turnover, and lack of retained experience there are varying degrees of accountability and understanding of how things are supposed to operate. Ask 3 people doing the same job what should be done and you will get 3 different answers. This becomes exhausting and stressful as you attempt to do your best for the company and for our customers. ""too big to fail"" often comes to mind for me, as its the only reason I can see that Chase does not fail is that it has massive amounts of assets it can us to cover up its egregious mistakes, lack of proper business controls, and high employee turnover. A typical work week is 50-60 hours of intense, high stress work, with basic job responsibilities requiring at least that 50 hours."
good,"Management was very inconsistent. From one manager to another you'd get different levels of support and coaching. Some were really success and skill oriented and some just wanted to talk numbers. I never kept a manager or team for more than a few months before they were moving us all around to new one's and before I left, I'd already had 6 different managers. The pay was great and the benefits were amazing but the idea of being stuck doing the same thing with no hope for progression (because you couldn't keep a manager long enough to set up a plan for advancement) just wasn't appealing anymore. I loved the people I worked with and there were always fun things going on, but the management ruined it for me."
good,Great place to work with a great team environment. I have gained a lot of customer experience within this position and was able to build my resume with some opportunities given.
good,"I liked working for this company , but it felt like they lost sight of the employee's in the process sometimes, but none the less its a good company"
good,"I would rather not say, the telephone banking was excellent. Of course working hours - not your typical 8-5, if that is what is expected"
good,It can be a lot of work for not much pay in the beginning of your career working up. Under staffing can catch up on you while being underpaid isn't always something easy to deal with.
good,"I haven't hated my job, but I don't feel very appreciated. 7 years without even a cost of living raise has hit me pretty hard. If I was a slacker, I'd understand, but I've been the highest producer in my department for the past 3 years and have twice the responsibilities that I had when I started."
good,"A typical day at work at Chase will be taking phone calls in an inbound call center. Although Chase claims to be unscripted they are quite a bit as such as they will require you to say certain things in a call a bit more than in general and a bit micro managerial."
good,Heavily staffed by temporary/contract employees. Gives very little indication that a permanent offer is achievable. Will temp/contract employees for years before making a hiring decision.
good,"The team is very good! You are able to learn a lot within a reasonable time frame. I recommend for a career-starter, depending on the end goal."
good,"The job consists of constantly making phone calls, while working through a workflow on the computer. I enjoyed getting to know my co-workers as well as improving my multi-tasking skills.Having job security was a huge benefactor to the job at JP Morgan Chase."
good,"I made a lateral move into the banking industry when I joined JPMC, and I've certainly learned a lot here about conducting AML first-level review. My basic work does involve a bit of analytical thought, but it does end up being a lot like data entry, in the sense of endlessly documenting things. Necessary, but very repetitive. When things are on track, there is opportunity to take on special projects to vary one's day, but lately that's been hard to come by. The biggest drawback is the lack of opportunity for advancement. Management has effectively told everyone that the only way to move up is to move out. They over-promoted at some point in the past, leading to people with titles that exceed their responsibilities and no place for them to move into the correct role, which puts a lid on everyone trying to come up behind them. That said, the environment is very collegial, my co-workers are great, and it certainly can't hurt to have the name of one of the Big 4 banks on your resume."
good,"When a company has the opportunity to choose people who have already encountered success, continued success is inevitable.  This place vaunts itself up and provides an environment in which the few truly exceptional make the losers who have something to prove feel good about themselves.  The PB position is important at the company, but some bankers are a bit full of themselves and over-complicate the complexity of their roles."
good,"I began employment with Washington Mutual Bank as a Collections Specialist.. I worked with wonderful people, the employees were treated with respect and made the work environment a pleasure. Unfortunately due to the financial collapse in 2008, the bank was forced into a takeover by JP Morgan Chase, the housing/mortgage situation became extremelyvolatle/defaults rose in large numbers. The President instituted home modification programs and we were trained to become Mortage Default/Modification Specialists.....My entire team was laid off over a 2-3 month period in the fall of 2011/2012, as changes were made in staffing...The West Melbourne office was sold to a third party company that worked the client mortage applications. There were 150 employees remaining. layoffs began and the company closed.."
good,"Opened accounts and cross sell banking products based on customer's needs.  Assisted in the teller area, vault and cash counts.  Acted as manager when manager was absent.  Provided overall great customer service."
good,"Okay to work for.  Learned about the business through training, once on the job however it is kind of sink or swim.  Nice coworkers but extremely high turnover rate."
good,"Very fast-paced environment.  Constant pressure from senior executives to develop functionality built to automate and self-provide our end-user base.  As a result, I spent a lot of time brainstorming and bouncing ideas off my peers and pitching projects to management.  It was an atmosphere I thrived in and the positive results garnered from these efforts gave me a great sense of satisfaction with implementing a change that made a difference.  Ideas were encouraged and fueled me towards greater efficiency."
good,A typical work day is fast paced. Business needs are very important. Coworkers are awesome. I wouldn't dream of bad mouthing this company. I've been with the company 10 years so something must have been right!!
good,I performed research on clients and determine if their activities are normal and consistent with their nature of business.
good,"productive job, work hard long days, not much life outside of the job. I worked a long time, but you have to find that balance between the both."
good,"At J.P Morgan you walk in to work and are expected to know your job, no one is constantly supervising or monitoring so you get to work independently which is good. The only thing is you need to know your job really well because many a times you have to make a decision yourself of-course keeping in mind the company's policies and procedures and customers satisfaction as well."
good,"great company to work for, excellent benefits, supportive managers, excellent work life balance, promotes career development"
good,"I was part of a Global Reduction but would go back to work at JPMorgan Chase immediately if asked."
good,"Recovery representative, responsibilities included, but were not limited to, contacting clients with past due accounts and subsequently negotiating terms and arrangements to bring their accounts current or make offers to settle them. In addition, conducted skip tracing when required."
good,"This is a productive and innovating workplace that is forever growing and forever stable if job is done, management is horrific and thus causing some issues with career growth. They offer career growth opportunities and promote it well, however to actually do the process is opposite of fun or good. the benefits for working with JPMorgan Chase is what keeps most people interested."
good,"Love working with a team, teaching, coaching, building talent."
good,Great company to work for. Excellent benefits. Good pay. Would recommend to anyone. Good hours of operation. Great co workers.
good,"Chase has a great working environment, but it is difficult to advance in such a large company.  A lot of hard work goes by unnoticed.  A good place if you want to be temporary or part time."
good,This place is a decent start as far as back office level jobs go. You will learn a lot and fast so you have to stay on your toes.
good,i worked in a very busy branch. so managers there did care about the employees. or show interest in helping them in the company. it was very busy and some times very stressful.
good,"JP Morgan is a good employer, with great benefits and chances for career mobility.  However, in the past 3-5 years, pressure from outside regulatory agencies, have caused the leadership to become more apprehensive.  Additional downward pressure from continued low interest environment added to the significant threat from cyber attacks have greatly influenced the culture.  Top leaders continue to expect more than what is possible from employees.  A 70 hour work week is considered average.  Working weekends and during vacation is expected.  It is the price you pay for working for the largest bank."
good,"Great people.  Demanding and challenging environment, typical for Financial Industry. Focus on Controls and Compliance."
good,"Tellers primary responsibility is to process transactions and accurately in accordance with policies and procedures. Identify customer needs and refer financial products and services. "
good,"Don't get me wrong, I had a great experience working for Chase. My co-workers were great, the benefits were great, and the resources Chase had were awesome. The actual work could be very frustrating at times because the policies changed so frequently, and the flow of new work would tend to slow down at times. I found myself going back to old work often because new files weren't being distributed, and the old files often had missing items that could not be obtained because the customers wouldn't respond back to our calls. On top of this, senior management would often cut off overtime, which would have really helped our productivity. The structure of our work was competition based, and our compensation as well as job standing was based upon how well we did against the rest of the department. The hardest part of my job was having to keep up with all the changing standards, often day to day. That said, my favorite part of the job, especially early on, were the meetings with our VP where he would review where we are, where we need to be, and the contests that would be set up. I would recommend working for Chase, but hopefully they have improved my particular job function since I was there."
good,"Not a bad place to work over all, change control is chaotic and I don't like being ""just another number"". My management was on a completely different floor and there was a lack of direction."
good,as long as you do what your asked dont make to many requests to take time off in a short period and keep your personal life to yourself you will be ok but if you let management know whats going on they move quickly when they can to get you out of the company
good,I've learned a lot about managing people and working with clients through my day to day experiences.  The company does not do enough to help it's employees advance and further their careers.
good,"Worked with customers that were unemployed to help them keep their homes until they found employment.  Proficient in the government Help for Homeowners programs, along with JP Morgan Chase unemployment forbearance and modification programs.  "
good,A typical work day includes processing checks individually at your own workstation. Management requires us to process a certain amount of checks by the end of the day. Coworkers are helpful in that they can offer advice if they have encountered a similar situation. Hardest part of the job would be ensuring that the deadlines are met before lunchtime. Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to listen to the radio or mp3.
good,Very fast paced changing environment. Great experience if you are up to the challenge.  Learned alot about Mortgage Banking from many aspects. Hardest part of job was leaving due to relocation. A lot of emphasis on work life balance.  Overall good place to work.!!
good,My manager was a very inspiring leader. He brought out the best in his team. I learned how to keep my own pace while working with little supervision and was able to well surpass department expectations
good,This is a fun place to work for but the pay was not good. I met a lot of good people. I was able to balance with work and personal life.
good,I worked at a subsidiary...and the management was horrible.. the best part about the job was the possibility to move around to other departments...
good,"Going to work on time, very helpful to customers and coworkers not hard at all and coming to work and leaving work knowing I assisted customers"
good,My time in this position was a solid if unspectacular. The direct management teams are veteran and knowledgeable. Most take on the role of managers and mentors. The typical day is mostly routine and the pace varies on the branch needs and location. My location was in a downtown suburban area. We provided a wide range of products and services to suit the wide spectrum of our customers needs. Advancement within the company was always possible but hidden agendas and corporate politics proved to be a derailing agent far too often. Most employees will tell you that to find further opportunities of career advancement would we require searching external of the company. The training and ability to acquire further knowledge about your position and others was easily accessible. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing our customers.
good,"Not everyone has a bad manager, but I've had many bad managers at Chase. They care about the bottom line and will drive anyone who isn't producing out of the bank. Great college job!"
good,Challenging projects. Intelligent coworker. Environment encourages development for junior staff. A great place to start your career
good,I have managed for JP Morgan Chase for the past 14 yrs. Enjoy my job and would recommend it as a place of employment. Flex work hours when needed.
good,"big firm, lots of opportunities, very good infrastructure, top software and tools.  good benefits, human resources and help desk very helpful"
good,"Great benefits. The company is so large that your experience with your manager, team, or company culture will vary greatly."
good,"JPMC looks to place together exceptional teams who's members work hard to do the right thing for their clients, internally and externally. They are most respected in each of the levels of financial support globally and can offer a rewarding and challenging career."
good,Nice company to work with. However balance between work/life is bit impacted otherwise it is dream company to work with
good,"It is a lot of who you know here to get hired. Great company to get me through college. The benefits are great, good paid holidays and great insurance programs."
good,"This site is a great location and convenient for any one working around Dallas/Ft.Worth. "
good,I think Chase is a good company to work for in general. The work life balance is dependent upon the role and department structure.
good,There is a very long process to implementing changes in the company. This is in part to the size of the company. Advancement is mostly based on seniority and not on skill set. This is including the management of people.
good,"Currently work in Auto Finance Collections - management is very secretive on things changing until the day of. Nothing is planned out. Seems like supervisors are not on the same page, even when it comes to policies and procedures which affect the agents. Department has become very stressful and poor moral over the past year. Job itself is not hard, pay is decent. If the internal components would change, it would be a great place to work."
good,"Being a teller at chase was ok. Unfortunately the management is very weak. I saw 5 managers go by in a matter of 4 years. Not much room for growth as they rather hire external candidates. I was the best most productive teller in my location. When looking for an opportunity to move up and be a Banker the managers would make promises that I was next in line for a promotion but always ended with an external candidate"
good,This is a good place to work with a great work/life balance.  I work in a collaborative environment to analyze complex contracts for the bank.
good,A typical day was putting your customers first and I learned different strategy in doing so. Management was engaged and supportive to ensure you were able to succeed.
good,"A typical day at work was productive and busy"
good,"A typical day at work is meeting scheduled deadlines. I reconcile millions of dollars with reported fees prior to reporting the monthly balance to the Investors. I have learned and improved my time management skills in order to complete the volume of work and be accessible to co-workers if additional manpower is needed."
good,Good work life balance and benefits.  Smart management that executes goals well.  Frustrated with turnover of staff and although they achieve there large goals as a cog it can be very bureaucratic.  Everything has to be done a certain way and leaves very little power for staff at the branch level to solve problems and help customers.
good,"The work is unexciting but a competent organization. If you like software development but don't look to advance your career, it's a decent place to be."
good,I worked with many great employees in all the branches that I worked in.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping our customers be more successful with their financial needs.
good,"My work at Chase bank was very competitive. You required to constantly be selling and being proactive in trying to increase your sales numbers. Being on the phone, constantly talking to customers really helped in building my sales skills and was a very different experience than what I had been used to. The coaching and management was designed to help you do the best you can. All the tools are given to you and it up to you how to apply them."
good,"Chase provides great benefits with insurance and a 401k. Unfortunately, the current schedule provided does not fit the needs of a single parent. Also, the Auto Finance position is based on number of closed loans, but also bases numbers on what is actually booked. The numbers of booked loans is not in the control of the closer, therefore if they don't book the loan, numbers make the employee look unproductive."
good,"I enjoy my job very much.  We help find solutions for our Military Homeowners and work with all investors, along with Underwriting and various departments to make a decision and offer retention and liquidation options to our customers."
good,"The company itself tries to be fair to all its employees while being financially beneficial to its shareholders.  The atmosphere is pleasantly diverse. Yet, individual management styles vary greatly, and may contribute to an air of distrust among peers.  Being a member of the manager's clique seems to help one receive better compensation and advancement opportunities."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in having a branch huddle with employees that open, talk about successes and overall customer experience and what have we done to take it to the next level.  Then I sit down with my bankers and go over the plan for the day and what we need to do as a team to deepen our relationship with our clients and what is missing in our conversation, so we role play a few examples and then I sit and observe while they are assisting customers.  As they meet with customer, I go in and introduce myself to the customer to reinforce what the banker is saying and overall making my banker look very good, and on top of a pedal stoll. "
good,"Chase is a well known brand that attracts many customers to bank with them which is great because of the opportunity to help customers and create opportunities to make commission cross selling products. However, every branch is always understaffed and as a manager I would ask to hire more employees such as tellers and my manager would tell me to give out less hours, it didn't make sense. The compensation is very low according to industry standards. Depending on the position work-life balance can seem very hard as you often work saturdays and the days you work during the week are long 10  hour days full time sometimes. The employees you work with are always generally very cool, hard working and helpful. Some of the positives are that you gain a lot of experience working with real customers on real problems, get an inside look on the industry, how people make money, deal with there finances, etc. Also, the training is really good whether it's regarding, sales, policy, compliance or management development."
good,"Working at JP Morgan chase was a very interesting experience.  Its a good company, but not a great company.  It's good to start your career, but when you have the chance to move on to a great company.  Do it.  Some departments are ok, and some can be like high school."
good,"A typical day at work would be answering customer calls in a call center about their accounts and resolving complex issues such as unposted deposits, placing stop payments, opening and closing accounts as requested by customers.  Also collabarating with other departments such as debit card fraud, as well as check fraud and trouble shooting online banking/internet issues.  I learned to be a self starter,  multi-task, be a good listener, great communication skills and resolves customer issues quickly and accurately. The thing that I enjoyed most about my job was the interation over the phone with customers.  The hardest part was keeping difficult customers on track with their concerns."
good,"Typical day at work, I arrive i work, check my emails, answer the phones for 7 hours, take my break and lunch and then go home."
good,I really enjoyed working for Chase for over 10 years. My co-workers were like a second family and my work was GREAT. The hardest part about the job was being LAID OFF. I have with different managers and some were better than others. My last manager was delightful I wish I could have followed him to his new job.
good,A typical day of work consists of answering calls for branches located around the country to provide service for the customers that are with them.
good,"Job security at firm, mobility possible, demanding work schedules and pressures. Work-life balance can be a challenge. Enjoy working with colleagues."
good,"Busy branch with over 20,000 transactions a month."
good,"Chase has amazing benefits and compensation, but as for the rest its a very life droning job. You are told not to sell to the customers, but when you are doing what was told you you management would snap back and say you aren't doing good enough. i learned how to sell products, and how to have an amazing customer experience, but that is all I took away from the company."
good,"Good, but not great overall. The pay was reasonable, but longevity isn't rewarded. Advancement opportunities are rare and it seems that the focus on people shifted after the JP Morgan and Chase merger. People from the JP side felt that there was less cache about it once Chase and Bank One came into the picture. Folks from Chase felt that they weren't given a fair shot where there were redundancies."
good,Great place to build a lifetime career. Heavily focused on sales and personal production.
good,"Lot of new opportunities."
good,Becoming exclusive with all customers could be an issue with too many branches in a small pocket of town. retail banking is convenience first
good,"Sales was the only focus. I come from a sales background, but I was ;looking for more. It made for a stressful environment."
good,"JPMC has been a good firm to work for.  The office management here in Columbus has been helpful and insightful and the compensation is great.  The AML department is going through a transitional phase at the moment and the Columbus, OH jobs are being shipped to Brooklyn, NY."
good,"I have worked with this company for a year now and have learned a lot and met great people. Typical day at work was busy, management was nice and had time to see what we need, learned a lot about banking by shadowing bankers all the time and doing many of the tasks a banker would do of course to a certain limit to meet policies and procedures."
good,"Opportunity to learn. Many different roles to rotate. Experienced staff, poor promotion strategy."
good,Work is challenging and hardly finding time for other things. I have supportive co-workers and the management is also understanding.
good,"What can I say...its a bank!  The compensation was ""really low"", but there was plenty of opportunity to learn and expand your skill set."
good,"Although they have a somewhat well-run operation in Canada, it's really an 'afterthought' of their American operations, and managed as such (outdated tech, lots of bureaucratic layers, everything needs to go through the US to be approved). Not looking to expand Canadian operations either - more of a 'token' presence. Management is also top-heavy - very little opportunity for advancement."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers, the hardest part of the job is being able to accept that everyone is not always positive."
good,"Changing enviornment. Close net of management. Co-workers are excellent, culture of support."
good,"A typical day at JP Morgan Chase would consist of me doing customers transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and payments. I also have control of the cash vaults which is counting and verifying large quantizes of money and balancing it daily. Auditing and following policy to make sure that the branch has sufficient supply of cash. I have full control of the instant issue machine, which is where we print customers debit cards daily. Balancing my own cash box and both the day and night vaults. I have learned many different controls and how to manage a team that works with me daily. The management in the branch is basic there is a Branch Manager and an Assistant Branch Manager who I work with daily. There are not a lot of co-workers in my branch so working as a team works best to keep the branch running smoothly. The hardest part of my job would be the longer days or days when the auditors come to visit. What I enjoy most would be working with customers and problem solving to have a successful branch."
good,A typical day at work you will Research multiple systems to retrieve missing documents for loans. and Analyze documents to make sure they are correct before sending
good,Lots of training to keep employees up to date on new policies and procedures
good,"fast-paced environment where you are to be efficient, pay close attention to detail, and provide the best customer service, even if the branch is short handed and one teller is running a window plus the drive-thru. You learn to take your time and not rush through things because that only causes you to make mistakes and unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making great friends and interacting with different people daily."
good,"The day depends on what's going on that day such as the first of the month checks or shipment.... So 1st of the month is busy. When shipment comes depending on your branch we usually fill all our machines (TCD's ATM's Coin Dispenser's)"
good,"Very fast-paced environment, learned a lot while I was employed there. Also worked with some very kind individuals."
good,"6 layoffs in less than 2 years......The people are great, but job security and and advancement potential is dreadful."
good,"......n/a"
good,"1.Good place to learn and grow"
good,Strong Company and they provide all the training you need. Success at certain positions is  very dependent on the location in which you are placed.
good,Nice people with diverse backgrounds and a focus on community engagement. Great experience to learn about various businesses and network across many functions due to the large company size. Huge opportunity to improve employee experience if the focus on eliminating bureaucracy and silos is addressed. The politics and limited idea sharing across all levels stagnates the innovation opportunities.
good,"Every day I arrive at 9:00 AM and without even realizing its 2:00 PM launch time. I go out home around 6:00 PM. "
good,"A typical day at work is straight forward. I arrive, sign in and begin reviewing files that have been submitted for the day. I typically learn one new thing a day involving the way a review is graded. My manager is the best on the floor and tries to make herself available to our team in case anything comes up. However, we are more of a team base and rely on one another to work together and find any answers we may need. "
good,"Solid work life balance, and lots of opportunity within the company."
good,"Intense Regulatory Environment. "
good,"A typical day at work is 10 hours..Interesting Projects..vibrant environment. and the best of the banking products  top on the line putting customers first.. "
good,"a typical work day is that you would log into the multiple systems. Usually programs change so often and never work.  The company is built on hardcore liberalism which rewards failure and not based on meritocracy.  Most of management is untrained and uneducated.  Co workers are extremely hardworking and most have gone on flma because job will drive you nuts from poor management who are driven by goals and not building a company.  Most enjoyable would be the bonuses, if you are good then they will pay you what you are worth and some of the good managers try to change the way things are done but it is too hard that most of the good managers give up and become substandard as well."
good,"a typical day at work is not so busy at the moment so i just work on whatever files i have and do trianings."
good,"Great pay and benefits however everything can change over night, I resigned due to pay and misinformation"
good,Salary is great but sometimes workhours are longer than expected.
good,"It was an enjoyable experience, but we did work a lot of hours during the peak of the refinances.  Chase expanded rapidly and then cut jobs rapidly to keep pace with the market, so there was little security, but overall it was a nice place to work.  The buildings were great, the co-workers friendly and the compensation was also good."
good,If you are able to keep busy with changes and adapt well you will have advancement possibilites.
good,As a teller your at the bottum of the barrel.  I wouldn't recommend the teller position to anyone.
good,"A good learning experience that expanded my knowledge of banking and ability to serve a wide variety of customers.  I enjoyed the work environment and formed strong bonds with co-workers and management.  JP Morgan Chase is a huge company and offered great benefits and compensation that varies by position.  I disliked the ""retail feel"" of branch banking and was ready for more responsibility."
good,"training was good, but the work load and task were not evenly distributed. Compensation was not worth it"
good,Typical day included reviewing and funding loans.  Great co-workers. Overtime was required and there were many long dayswhen you ate lunch at your desk and sat at the computer for log hours.
good,".the company cares more for it's bottom line"
good,"Benefits are good, with great work/life balance.  Raises are not good as with typical corporate companies nowadays. Good opportunities for advancement if you live anywhere else other than Akron, Oh."
good,"At typical day at JP Morgan chase, I would Determine approval or denial of client’s mortgage loans according to relevant information being provided on their loan application. I reviewed the clients financial information (paystubs, credit report, taxes, w2s, monthly expense report) to determine if client was eligible for a home refinance or purchase, based off financial information that was given. Working at Chase I learned time management skills and the ability to multi task in a face paced work environment. Working with a team verses as an individual gave me more knowledge and understanding on my daily functions to perform my job properly. With a team of 8 we all worked closely together to make sure we met deadlines for loan applications in a timely manner. Working under pressure to meet deadlines when documentation was not fully presented by clients or mortgage banker was challenging at times, if deadlines weren't met by specific date it could prolong the clients approval for a refinance or home purchase. Although at times there was a lot of pressure to get loans done in a timely manner, I enjoyed helping clients refinance or purchase their dream home."
good,"answering phone calls"
good,"Typical big bank work environment - after the last merger, the commitment to employee development went away. Entire call centers were closed and processes that made Chase one of the top lean banks were scrapped."
good,"A typical day at Chase would start with my reviewing the reports and analysis for the previous end of day statistics. Provide my agents with their individual and team month to date stats for production and quality. Advise each agent of their individual proficiencies and deficiencies in order to maintain or obtain goal by month end.   Ensure Attendance and Tardiness records are updated with any new occurrences. Join daily nationwide Default Underwriting conference call to discuss department statistics, upcoming hierarchy or operational changes, client & customer focus, employee or team recognition. The most enjoyable part of the job which ironically is also the hardest part of the job is successfully juggling the needs of your direct agents while satisfying the requests and expectations of your immediate manager while never loosing focus on the customer."
good,"Excellent work culture."
good,"I work with one of the most Challenging team  & Project of the JP Morgan Chase , IB.  This Project is all about Agency clearing clients and the depth knowledge i gained as Tech lead was enormous,"
good,"Your success at Chase is completely dependent on your own work ethic and ability to locate answers.  Much of the management is unsure of the questions that you might have.  They will typically tell you to find it yourself on the intranet, but in short that is because they don't know either.  Be prepared for change on a daily basis.  Nothing ever stays the same one day to the next.  "
good,"Professionally run division, bright colleagues and good relationship between staff and management."
good,"A typical day at work is greet customers, service them with any business they may need, always with a smile. Delivery a great customer experience and thank them for their business. As for my team always have open communication and set goals and help with anything that may be requested. Being one of the managers at the branch your pretty involved in all day in and out and I've learned that you must have patients and everyone works at a different pace and way. The hardest part of my job is delegating. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new from all my coworkers and/or customers."
good,Few advancement opportunities - ended up being laid off after Washington Mutual merger.
good,"no comment  Great experience, Gained invaluable experience"
good,"*Profile customers to uncover assets"
good,"I monitor debit card transaction activity to prevent fraudulent activity while taking inbound and making outbound calls to customers. While assisting a customer, make sure the customer is properly authenticated, verify passwords on the account if required, verify recent or suspected fraudulent transactions, and close and reissue debit card if necessary. The most enjoyable part of this job when customers are truly satisfied by preventing the fraud from happening or their overall service. The hardest part is assisting irate customers, but this is expected dealing with fraud on one's account."
good,"My day starts with going over my pipeline.  I sort out which calls need to be made first, making sure I keep in mind time zones. Check my schedule for any training or meeting that I need to attend.  Keep in mind to have empathy for the customers and the situation that they are in.   My fellow team mates are good people and we all help each other.  Because Chase is so large I have not had the opportunity to meet all management.  During business trips I have had a chance to meet other managers from different sites and that part I really enjoyed during these past few years.  "
good,"	Since January 2011, employed with J. P. Morgan Chase as a Senior Transaction Processing Specialist, in the Securities Processing-Asset Services, Corporate Actions Enquiries, Operations department.  The job profile involves:"
good,"Solid company, good chance for additional compensation with commision program. Company is evolving to more customer service enviroment."
good,"Monitored daily reports for compliance and monthly goals, Worked daily with direct employees to provide coaching and feedback both verbally and written. Conducted daily meeting to implement policy procedure updates and set expectations."
good,"My typical day consisted of analyzing, reviewing and approving foreign tax elections, foreign currency elections and mutual fund transactions.  I also resolved the problems my staff had with calculating the aforementioned as well as calculating domestic cash dividends.  I learned how to lead a team to perform under pressure and avoid losses.  My director manager was a brilliant man who trusted the managers who worked under him.  It was a pleasure to work for him.  My co-workers were all who worked for the company including those who reported to me.  We were a team who worked hard to get the job done.  The hardest part of my job was ensuring that my staff understood that each and every transaction no matter the dollar amount was vital because it involved our clients.  The most enjoyable part of my job was analyzing and calculating the most difficult tax elections and  transactions.  I enjoyed meeting the challenge."
good,"First couple months excited to be there then goes down hill. Performance is based on a metrics. If you are unable to maintain percentage within a 2 month span, regardless of time there your done. If you miss something in the script you will know about it. Good co-workers most are down to earth and try to keep a good attitude. Nice bonuses but it won't come easy."
good,"This job was pretty much the same thing every day.  Open up, turn on your computer, run transactions until you leave for the day.  I learned many things about a banks process and about money.  I also met nice people but unfortunately with the good you have the bad.  In this industry you have to just let people completely disrespect you which is an unfair situation."
good,"Currently working with SCRA (Servicemember's Civil Relief Act). Assist in gathering required information for Audits. Research and analyze accounts as well as track issues with business units to ensure completion and validation of resolved issues. Create process flows, job aids and procedures."
good,JPMorgan is obviously a large banking insitution with many avenues for an employee to succed.  The technology that is used there makes every employee very productive.  Very limited funds are used to allow employees to enjoy being a part of the company.
good,"busy call center environment. did account maintenance,  "
good,"A typical day at work began with sorting mail.  Pull all the mail for the accounts we were opening and processing for the day.  I learned how important it is to put the information required on payments."
good,"A typical day at work consist of checking email trails to see current project in the works, restrictions, and scheduled vendor escorts during the shift I will be covering. Sometimes work can be slow since I might be up at 4 AM taking care of an incident on a server and that may be all the work I'll have on a 12 hour shift, sometimes the second I get in I may have a vendor waiting for me and possible several decommissions and trouble tickets to attend to.My manager is a very cool guy, who is understanding and patient as I made a few mistakes my first few months in he was very forgiving and understood that I wasn't accustomed to the environment, he is someone who is very dedicated and makes sure his teammates are as well. Overall, I enjoy working at JPMC, the work really exposes one to newer technologies and larger infrastructure sites, I do believe that it is very hard to get promoted in my dept, but aside from that the staff is great and laid back but hard working. "
good,In my employment with JPM Chase I learned a lot of new skills and brushed up on some skills I already had. In my typical day I handled multiple computer systems while managing a team of 14 employees. The hardest part of the job was a constantly changing schedule which made it difficult to achieve a work/life balance. The best part about my job was the people I worked with. 
good,They gave me the opportunity to advance. i did data entry. management was ok. I realy enjoyed working with the co- workers. the hardest part of the job was being let go.
good,Good starting point for recent grads. Culture is a little stifling. 
good,Cost cutting regime ever-present.  Worked in the enterprise technology finance.  Many rounds of restructuring.  Morale was low.  People are okay.
good,"Great people to work with, not a lot of chance for advancement."
good,Work is all done over the phones and using computers dialing out on mortgage accounts.
good,"This was your typical banking position and with low compensation and no respect for the tellers that do almost all of the work. I loved my co workers and the managedr, but the policies were not good "
good,"Great place to work, and the work life balance is fabulous, I learned the international Markets as well as Reporting in Excel, we are trained and developed in Chase, there is always learning. The one draw back is your job is never safe. Was displaced from over seas transfers 3 times in a span of 8 years with the company. The benefits are outstanding, as well as their HR department. Very professional"
good,Extremely busy but great people to work with and learn from. Chase promotes educations.
good,Chase Bank is a good place to work but the managers are not very supportive of career advancement
good,Employees were sressed management didnt work toward satisfying employee needs or complaints
good,Great people and a great company but has no work life balance & job advancement.
good,Chase is a company that has very competitive benefits and a great human resources team. These people work hard to make the environment fun and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is the lack of commitment from managers and job security/advancement.
good,"I would come in and scan all day.I learn to be better each years,some boss was good and some not.I get along with everybody. I love working and love to SCAN."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a company that serves best clientele professional and serves excellent to all people worldwide. With large scope of Banking and Financial scope around the globe, JP Morgan Chase and Co provide financial and excellent solutions to all various client around the globe to deliver all the best services that can put their client into their best foot forward status in the field of Banking and Financing. As a former employee, I learned how to manage my time in work and how to schedule all the work deliverables on time. The Management seems to be the most prolific team as they will back up you and will support all the necessary training and all comprehensive tools that will enhance all the talents within us. The hardest part of the ob is to meet all clients' perspectives in terms of Service Level Agreements, as well as those work the requires critical thinking to provide best solutions and answers to all hard to find questions."
good,Providing exceptional service and extensive financial knowledge to both personal and business cliental. Maintain competitive benchmarking against other bankers successes and equivalent goals in the branch and market. Assist management in strategically developing long-term objectives to implement changes in order for the branch to achieve and exceed sales goals and customer service experience scores.
good,A typical work day is never really typical but for the most part involves helping customers manage/understanding their accounts including deposits/ withdrawls. I have learned that you can never control how people will react towards you but you can control how you react towards people. Everyone wants to be treated with respect and not everyone is on the same level. You can't speak to everyone the same meaning some people you will have to have more patience and explain things over and over. The best reward is knowing that you did everything in your power to make a customer leave happy.. Management for the most part are ok i think they could do a better job accomidating everyones schedule needs. The co-workers work hard at times but have the ability to work better as a team. The hardest part of my job is the fact that i stand on my feet all day long and have to stay in the same location. The most enjoyable part of my day is when the customers thank you for your service and give the managers compliments because of the hard work i put in.
good,"I am an assistant manager and my daily duties include open/close accounts,maintenance of accounts, managing sales goals for the branch, coaching and counseling of staff, mentoring upcoming employees for the next step in their development. Monitoring P&L and branch losses. Maintaining a positive and happy work enviroment for my staff."
good,"Normal but working so many hours per day, like a minimun of 13 manitimes."
good,The job itself was very easy but the Vice President was a very self centered person she never had anything positive to say to anyone
good,"Productive work environment, learn how to use our FITS inventory system. Work well with co-workers. I like my schedule at work."
good,1. Better place to work for ladies as they have job secure.
good," Work with customers on a daily basis, help them meet their banking needs and in either answering or referring their financial questions to the appropriate supervisory individuals"
good,". A typical day at work would be challenging, and fast-paced."
good,"Enjoying communicating with people of all cultures and diversities, making decisions to benefit the company and satisfying clients and their needs. Fast past environment, being able to multitask and make quick decisions."
good,Field phone calls about client credit card accounts
good,"The pay is average and the company itself claims they help people advance but in reality - they don't. If you want to succeed, are passionate and want a REAL career then DO NOT work here."
good,"A typical day deals with lots of transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and payments. Meeting daily sales such as opening a checking account, savings, IRA'S, and CD."
good,"Working at JP Morgan is just OK. Its a strong company with great benefits, but management is lacking in motivating their employees. They definitely make you work hard for your money. The working environment could improve to accomodate their employees, such as having managers not micro manage so much. They should let their employees have the ability to make their own decisions and feel responsible for their work."
good,A very good work atmosphere. Always a constant flow of information from managers regarding changes and its impact.
good,I sit at my desk most of the time & get as much work done as I can. JPMorgan Chase pressures us to perform nothing but 120% every minute of the day. It can be very over whelming sitting in one spot all day doing the same task over & over. I learn lots of information where I am with the company. I learn new policy updates every day & apply them to my work. I educate myself by reading & researching lots of information about my job & others that I work with.
good,"Check for employees attendance, reviews and who needs coaching sessions with regards to departmental procedures."
good,"Laerned alot about the Financial Industry. I was taught to be empowered to help the consumer through verious products and services by examing the consumers financial situation from the inside out (mortgage, car loans, payroll, hospital Bills..etc.) familurized myself with experian, trans Union, Equifax. Co workers were Friendly. As our Collection Portfolio ran dry because it was being outsourced to other countries we found ourselves becoming more and more like a family. Managment was Friendly they assisted when they could they set before us our financial goals for the fiscal Year, and broke it down to each agent. and I did ok for myself collecting about 4,000 a month in my final year got promoted to Collector Advisor II and also had good review from the previous year in regards to policy and Procedure. The Hardest Part of The Job was not being able to have the tools to help some consumers who financial situation just flipped"
good,"Chase is a very large company and you feel that way at all times. Accomplishments are not generally recognized except by peers. Pay increases are generally not impacted by performance. Positions are often changed. My role has been ""repurposed"" 3 times in 3 years. 2 of these 3 position changes were made at the site level (moving from one division to another). The job is relatively reliable. I expect that I could still be employed here in 25 years if I chose to."
good,This company has great opportunities to advance if you have the time to wait for them to come available and for you as an employee be eligible for the job. I am in the Air National Guard and have been having conflicting issues with schedules for me to meet my required responsibilities with the military.
good,"Working at Chase has allowed me to grow into the the responsible adult I am today. When I started working at Chase, I had just graduated from college and had just moved in to my own apartment. Being a part of the aggressive Chase team and transitioning in to adulthood made me realize that I was ready and willing to take on what my parents often referred to as ""the real world"". Chase was my first job I had that could actually be a ""career""; an actual 9 to 5'er with benefits and a salary. If I wanted to I could make this my life. Fortunately, I've realized before it was too late, that's not something I want to do."
good,"Chase bank is a great job. The managers were great the Team Leads were outstanding and is a company that takes care of their employee's. Not much room for advancement with job security. I liked how teams where set up allowed you to grow in a team environment. Chase had a high turn over rate at managment six managers in eleven months with different perspectives, but where all good people."
good,not much room for growth. it was mainly having to leave the company and come back later to promote. or promotions were given mainly to those new to the company.
good,bonne condition de travail .....c est un nouveau challenge chaque jour ...différent compte chaque jour ...faire comprendre au client que le solde est juste ou une erreur a été commis ....les plaintes ....les retour d apelle consernant le sold ....
good,Great people from all backgrouds
good,Sell
good,If you don't know someone its hard to advance. Raises are minimal.
good,"High customer traffic, constant customer interaction, security highly important, high risk environment"
good,While on a different shift- I absolutely loved Chase. I took the position I have now and dread work.
good,"Daily ""huddles"" before the bank opened to prepare a sales plan for the day and to set goals. The workload is quite repetitive; mainly solving customer issues and trying to cross-sell products within the bank."
good,"Accurately and efficiently process and record routine transactions for bank customers including cashing checks, accepting deposits and withdrawals, processing loan payments and money transfers. Promote and advise on the bank's products and services."
good,The job level doesn't match the pay. The benefits are pretty good and good job security.
good,"Managed the business and consumer banking relationships. Formed lucrative partnerships with team members in different departments to offer a vast array of products to meet client needs. Took time to learn each customer with the goal of becoming their primary financial adviser. The hardest part of the job was trying not feel too bad for customer who were suffering from financial hardships. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping my clients reach financial success by educating them, providing them with the right tools and resources, and always following up."
good,Typical analyst position. There really isn't much that stands out on the positive side or the negative side.
good,A typical work day while i work at chase was hard but very rewarding also. Handle incoming calls for most of my shift. work hand and hand with good mangers. Had a wonder relationship with my co-workers. exellent team work. One of the hardest things was online accounts. walking the customers though their online bank accounts. not really being able to see their step by step moves.
good,Wonderful Company to work for if you know the right individuals.
good,Great place to work if you like to be micro-managed. Challenging environment for helping customers. Best computer systems and great advertising.
good,"Just an average place to work. Managers were not interested in any suggestions for improving our service. The compensation is average, perhaps less than average."
good,"Good perks but highly fast paced and more technological changes."
good,If investment banking floats your boat then JP Morgan is the place for you! They pay well and have good benefits but there are downsides such as - the employees are not diverse at all - around 95% Male. Aged 25-35 on average. Very little training. The culture doesn’t encourage fail fast learn quick. It’s get it delivered - next project!
good,"Fast paced environment, back to back calls, there is managers that have favorites, If you work in the Houston corporate center you must go to the cafeteria and try the CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP!  You will thank me later. It's hard to keep up with their policies they can change every day. But make no mistake the bank will always protect its self no matter what."
good,Work environment and compensation depends on LOB.Frequent management changes when I was working there bringing frequent changes in policies.HR have very limited role as most of the decisions are taken by leadership.
good,"Work performance closely measured, i.e. quality, quantity, proficiency."
good,"Depends on how good your team is. Highly sales oriented. "
good,Hard to contact the right team or person on a consistent basis. Very silo orientated. People watching people and reports on top of reports. 24 x 7 x365 including holidays. The bank never closes. Everything is monitored and restricted. Takes over a month to even get all the access you need to perform your job.
good,"Positive workplace culture, dedicated employees and always a high volume workload. Flex-time is offered, which allows you to have and maintain a work/life balance."
good,"Great company to work for once you find the right group. When they hire from the outside, they tend to hire over qualified people which leads to the inability to grow and learn. "
good,"It has its pros and cons.  excellent benefits but pay could be better.  you will learn a lot, but it can be stressfull and procedures are always changing.  Overall a typical large corporation."
good,I learned how to work in a very stressful work environment with little help from management. I was able to gain useful skills to use in future employment. The hardest part was the stats being able to meet the goals that were set. I enjoyed my coworkers and the team builders.
good,"If you are looking to have good work life balance and ability to work from home, you will not find it here. As an exempt employee, working long hours on a regular basis is an expectation...and what’s a lunch break? Maybe time to run to the cafeteria to grab food and bring it back to your desk to eat while you continue to work.  On a positive note, I loved the people at JPMC. Great benefits, paid time off, on site medical clinic , and large cafeteria"
good,"The company often changes departments to different states every 2 years, creating job insecurity. Company has a great work and life balance; and endeavors to promote its employees. The pay in general is below market except if you work in the Investment Banking."
good,"Even though Chase is a fast-pace goal oriented company, one can find it very rewarding to work there. The team I worked with in my last branch were simply amazing, helpful and fun to work with."
good,Good seasonal work. That job helped me to stay sharp on my data entry skill set. The productivity and fast past work load made the work shift go by quickly. I appreciated the opportunity and enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,A good company to work for which takes care of its employees. Moreover it conducts yearly free health checkup for each of its employees in India. Overall a good work-life balance
good,"JPMorgan has a positive work environment, that is driven by the employees working at the company. "
good,I loved my job and my clients. My attitude was to go to work ready to conquer the world.  I was able to help clients with credit and investments. Management was all about himself and how he looked
good,"The first year of working there was a struggle to get the hang of things and management. After that things went smoothly but the management Constantly changes so very difficult to always feel grounded, there are Constant changes in policy’s and management and coworkers."
good,Nothing special . Not a great experience. Didnt like it much. Management is too hierrachial . works in old fashioned way. They put mba into operations
good,"I hated it there. The amount of stress is due to things out of your control is terrible. I wouldnt recommend unless you like call centers, i really couldnt do it"
good,"Great company to work for to understand a corporate structure. Promotion opportunities from within with multiple lines of business to specialize in. Retail, commercial, and private banking lines of business."
good,Until the company chose to eliminate 250 jobs in Rochester NY it was a great place to work.   The employees had a positive attitude which made them easy to work with
good,"Open/ close the branch. Wait on customers. 1 hour paid lunch. Excellent benefits, health, vision, dental, paid maternity/paternity leave. Part time is either all 4/5 hours or two 9/10 hour days."
good,"Learned a lot about my field working here. Hard to network as there is a lack of upper management in same city.  Long hours, no recognition and no development. Flexible work arrangements (working from home) are a plus. Job culture is stressful as to complete as much as you can quickly with zero errors. The firm promotes work life balance, development and diversity but does not carry down to individual departments.  Ping Pong table on site"
good,The day started with Stand-Up. During the day we have several meetings and scums ceremonies. Now you can study new technology. The most enjoyable part of a job study new technology and solve a challenging problem
good,"Eventually felt like a dead end job. Pay is decent and benefits are great. Loved my coworkers. Some managers were good, but many were incompetent with no experience in the department. You’re better off asking your coworkers for help on a call. Started becoming extremely micromanaged. They mainly care about service levels than their employees. Always finding something to put employees down when it came to stats. Unless you’re one of the lucky ones that gets promoted to a better position (they don’t really consider if you have an education or have been with the company for years), I’d say work here to put it on your resume and then find something better."
good,Chase is a good place to work with a lot of opportunities to move up within. I enjoyed my time there. Biggest challenge was at times meeting performance metrics based on peers.
good,"I've been with Chase for one year. I was recruited by a market director for a private client banker position. I've been in banking for many years, I knew what I liked and did not like at my previous employer and knew exactly what to ask. I was told I would help a book of business of clients with high balances at Chase or elsewhere. If a client were to walk in and need any kind of service request ie debit card ordered, statement printed etc it was to be handled by a personal banker, or a relationship banker if PB not available. So not the case. Tellers (excuse me, associate bankers) do not ask clients who are waiting what they need. This creates extended wait times for clients, half the time we can't fulfill their request in the branch anyway. You get one hour a day to focus on your book of business and the other hours you're opening high school checking accounts, spending one hour, yes one hour, on the phone with auto finance department as your client puts in a car loan application that is going to get denied anyway. Oh and calling and emailing your partners to follow on referrals since communication is lacking to say the least. If a mortgage or home equity line application is turned down that's it. No one looks at the file to dig into ways to help the client make it work now or in the future. I'm assuming this is because its Chase and they have so many clients it's just on to the next file. Customers are not at the center of this company and I have such an issue with that. If you are in the financial industry and your goal is not to change people's lives then you're in it for"
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great place to work, but there are more and more issues with the lack of pay integrity between managers and staff. Gaps for bonuses are huge and most often, a regular staff employee does not see a bonus, whereas upper management will see over $10,000 in bonus income, not to mention the CEO gets over $25 million in bonus income annually. Additionally, executive management only looks after themselves, it can be cut-throat and extremely competitive. It is a typical corporate setting with isles and isles of cubicles."
good,Very very large company. Can be very overwhelming. Multiple different teams and organizations that can make communication and partnering confusing. Everyone with 5+ years experience in IT is pretty much a VP regardless of job function.
good,"not a bad job at all. hours are very inconsistent. you might spend 7 hours at work or 10+. there is no in between. some instances of stagnancy. you have to really push for promotions. "
good,Good benefits. Lots of good people work there. Fun meetings at times. Sometimes very serious meetings which were actually helpful. Lots of different departments to work in.  Training needs improvement.  Hardest part of the job was customers who were good people just going through hard times that saw no hope. The most enjoyable time was when I could find programs to help them in their time of need.  I truly enjoyed speaking with my customers.
good,"Friendly working environment. American culture, many hours, people devoted to their job, not counting the hours of work. Worldwide company with colleagues all over the world."
good,You can’t even go to the bathroom because they’ll penalize you. No feedback for months and then out of nowhere you get hit with red alerts from weeks before. No follow up on calls and no proper coaching.
good,Chase was a good employer.  Some of the management had issues.  The positions I worked had more than adequate training and support to perform the job well.  Chase provided exceptional benefits.
good,"What can I say, your in a position and you love it and then Boom we have re-named your job and are placing you in a completely different position with hours you cannot possibly work doing something you no longer like.  They did this twice so when I had the chance to relocate I jumped and took it and moved.  The pay was good, the spiffs were good the bosses sucked, not trained very well and thought they were superior to everyone."
good,"management was awesome I loved my manager"
good,I had worked as a Senior loan processor and later became an auditor. There was a lot of training that was given. My co-workers were wonderful to work with everyday.
good,"The company has a lot of opportunities for mobility.  They promote job fairs, career moves and promoting from within the company. A typical day consists of trying to complete work around a fair amount of meetings.  This can cause you to very quickly get behind if you let it.  Workplace Culture is probably the same as everywhere else: mettings during the day and trying to complete work in between.  Most difficult thing I noticed is that with teams spread across multiple locations, critical information is not always distributed as needed or on time.  This causes costly mistakes and internal struggles for the employees and management."
good,"Very competitive workplace and extremely long hours. It offers a good career advancement; however, at a cost. You have no life and you have to be a tough person to deal with stress and not unfriendly people."
good,This company believes in the menatlity what have you done for me lately. It is conflicting messaging on what today’s priority is. The branch environment is not worth the income.
good,"Chase was a previous job, its an entry level position. I would recommend this job for someone who is looking for a first job. If you have a college degree there are much better jobs out there"
good,"The Team was fantastic.  There are parts of the job that weren't in your job description that you had to do.  Paid time off, paid sick days, flexible scheduling.  I personally just did not care for the job itself."
good,Independently determine course of the day based on remit. Not too difficult to navigate technical org. People are generally helpful and responsive with technology org.
good,"Chase is a large corporation, so there are positive and negatives that come along with that. Your employment experience will depend heavily on your local management. In my area, they were lacking, communication is horrible, standards are low, and there is no sense of urgency for anything at all."
good,"JP Morgan Chase didn't get to the top by mistake.  they have a culture of success and expect that culture carried on from top to bottom.  If you produce you will make it far.  If you come in watch the clock and collect a paycheck you will quickly be weeded out.  Word hard, play harder."
good,"Good, stable company, but their timings for calls do not allow for proper customer care.  Managers unable or unwilling to help when issues where brought to their attention."
good,"learned about securities, depository accounts, credit and everything related to the financial industry. Talk to customers for the majority of the day and keep a good relationship with  them"
good,"They provide you best training and good work place environment."
good,Requires patience. I learned plenty about the financial aspects of large corporations. Management was a lot to bear. Even when you are surpassing the average workload exponentially there is always a push to do more which makes it difficult to feel accomplished. The various shift availability was the best part of the job.
good,Chase is a good company to work for and they do a lot to promote respect and diverse working environment . The hiring process is very slow and can take months.
good,It is a very competitive culture in the vault.  It was always freezing.  You are limited in what you can bring into the building.  The hardest part is standing on your feet the entire time.  The best part was my co-workers and even management were nice to be around.
good,"Great place to work for but you must be adaptable and accepting to change. As long as you following regulations and procedure you can succeed. "
good,It was a fun environment very fast paced. Training was fun and they did everything to try and keep it simple so we can learn. Overall good company to work for
good,"Prepared correspondence to address and resolve customer questions, concerns and complaints of moderate complexity. "
good,"banking is a really nice job and in chase was a wonderfuul experinece, the only bad thing for me was the payment, was very low for me as a personal banker."
good,The technical staff are talented and hard working.  The workplace culture is understanding of work life balance.  The pay is below average for the area. The best part of the job is the people.  They also offer extensive training programs.
good,"The retirement asset division of JP Morgan was sold. It is no longer located in Olathe, KS. It was awesome, though. The benefits were the best I've ever had."
good,Good team environment but not very often recognized for doing a good job. Most recent job duties were the same every day so not much of a variety. A lot of opportunities within the company but not easy to get.
good,"Chase is/ was a great company to work for, higher management seems to care about their people, but having terrible Team Leader will have a huge impact. Job is at a desk so you do have to remain mentally focused and is not for people who like to be active, or constantly in movement since you do work in cubicles."
good,"My hours are 8:30 am to 5:30 pm Monday through Friday and I occasionally will work a Saturday which is 8:30 am to 1:00 pm. I am responsible for the basic operations of the Branch and Teller operations. I conduct teller transaction and approve wires, close accounts, train new tellers and keep existing tellers up to date on all required training. I assist the Branch Manager with anything that may need to be done.I do all of the ordering for supplies and I make sure that the building is kept in order by submitting work orders for maintenance of the branch. I am also the sole custodian for one of our Eatms I settle it weekly and fill it with money as needed and am subject to surprise audits every quarter."
good,This was a very routine job that required my full attention as I was responsible for customer transactions and handling a lot of money. Management was always helpful and the customers and I had wonderful conversations all day at work.
good,"A typical day at Chase was always busy. Learning something new everyday with customers on the phone. Have to have a good memory, be upbeat and to be alert and motivated to be the best at what you do in putting the customer best interest first. Management was always keeping the representative up to date on daily changes. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with my peers  keeping each other encourage and motivated and sharing ideas on how to do better on calls."
good,"Decent place to work with good benefits. But too many big changes in direction, processes and compensation. Culture is good in recognition of people and awarding things like free lunches.."
good,Chase is a great bank to work for and to bank. They take care of their employees with great pay and flexible working hours. The also provide the tools that you need to succeed.
good,"JPM has a heavy IB culture. Large bank which requires a large bureaucracy to operate. Compensation and career trajectory is great as long as you’re in the right role in IB or Markets. Most senior leaders across lines of business and functions are former Investment Bankers. "
good,"No Worklife balance but good compensation, chaos on who should do what. Too much politics. If compensation is the only criteria go for it.               Otherwise its a good place"
good,During the time I worked for Chase I went through about 10 managers and only one was actually an exceptional manager. They only hire part timers to place you where needed and have you work the hours they want including almost every Saturday.
good,Failure to meet minimum calls per hour and maintain minimum customer score results in write-up followed by dismissal if not corrected within deadline set at time of write-up.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you are looking for a career in baking, finance and investments, however majority of the jobs here in Tampa are call center."
good,JPMorgan Chase is very diverse with opportunities for advancements. My duties were extremely stressful; fast-paced but overall the job offers many challenges.
good,"As administrative assistant, a typical work day would consists of supply orders, expense reports, travel arrangements, front desk coverage and many other clerical support duties."
good,"A very restricted workplace. Lack of supplies in the breakroom."
good,"Very fast paced environment, the policy is constantly changing and being updated, being monitored at every moment, the benefits and the paid time of is excellent, as well as plenty of room to grow within the company"
good,Working here has helped me get better skills. My efficiency has improved as well as working long hours under pressure. Benefits are also very good and staff well taken care of.
good,"It was a call center so I took back to back calls always stayed busy.  I dealt with a lot of mean customers, however I had to remain my cool and not take anything personal which is hard sometimes but I always received good feedback on my calls."
good,You must drink the kool aide in order to survive. Everyone I knew would switch jobs in the company every 3 years to survive. Only senior management was capable on making decisions.
good,"goals were expected to be met each month in different sector of the company. Overall, call center focused environment. Need to be able to work under pressure."
good,Working as a teller at Chase can vary depending on the branch location as some are ridiculously busy while others are terribly slow. There is room for growth and opportunities to make extra money through sales but it seems to be all the company cares about as it is greatly stressed.
good,"I can't say the office life is that great. Most of us are too busy or stressed to build good work relationships. There's little chance for career growth unless you're competitive. On the upside the benefits and pay are great which makes it easier to accept the aforementioned. With that being said it's a great place to start your career, however, most of the employees that have spent theirs with the firm transfer to a different line of business after a few years."
good,"management team was excellent and very supportive of employees, Great health benefits, flexible schedules, paid holidays, PTO hours per year. Systems are ahed of other banks. Company tries to be progressive and it constantly improves operations. Sales commission is where you make the money."
good,"JPMorgan offers great benefits and competitive pay, and they are generally pretty flexible with those who have other obligations (school, 2nd job, etc...). If you have an interest in the banking field, there are ample opportunities for advancing or transferring into other parts of the organization. Local management are fairly reasonable and understanding, but the division heads are another story. Too much bureaucracy has resulted in persistent supply problems and slow response times to employee feedback. Processes are at times annoyingly inefficient. Overall, there is more emphasis on protecting reputation than on actually doing the job to the best of our ability."
good,Banker are not happy with their pay so they usually leave after a year or so.  Too many physical locations.  JP Morgan is a well known organization and has good reputation.
good,"In my time working with Chase, I met and communicated with some of the most interesting people. I was able to sharpen my skills with inside sales, and as a customer service specialist. What I enjoyed most of Chase, was the work environment. Everyone got along very well. It wasn't uncommon for all of us to meet up after work on Friday for dinner. The opportunity for growth was surely there, and I encourage anyone willing, to go in full force. If you work hard, you'll get where you want."
good,"Working as a personal banker, I get to meet wonderful customers and build long lasting relationships with them. On a daily basis, the goal is to sit with customers and provide them information about what chase has to offer. Better ways to save their money. Help with loan applications i.e auto and mortgage. Refer customers to our financial advisors. The workplace is very friendly, we all get along which makes it easier to get through the day."
good,The clock is managed to the minute. If you are used to working a job that employees are closely monitored by management then it's the job for you.....
good,Chase had a high-paced working environment with the ability to gain experience in a variety of positions. The harder you work determined the size of your pay check.
good,My last job at JP Morgan Chase was participating on a large cross-functional team as part of the implementation of a new system.  This team included JPM employees and was supplemented by consultants.
good,"Overall, Chase is a fun place to work if you are on the right team. During my time there, nearly every day was fast-paced and stressful, but the team members helped to get through."
good,They are too strict. Your always being told different information. Do your own personal research far as policy and procedures. Very friendly environment.
good,"Chase was a highly competitive company, but I worked with some excellent people. We were all willing to stay late and work hard. Our Manager would order in lunch or dinner if we worked nights and weekends.  Everyone worked on a Saturday once a month when it was crunch time"
good,"Excellent firm to work with but salary is very less as compare to market standards. Long working hours and huge volumes to process."
good,Great company to work for.  The environment is very diverse and employees are provided with many opportunities for advancement and professional growth.
good,"I enjoyed working for chase, I learned a multi facet program as well as meeting the daily requirements for production. My co-workers were always helpful."
good,"very busy but collaborative"
good,good benefits very fexible i wish that it was more advancment inside the department they are good withnot micro mangment the people I wish that you didint feel stuck in one role.
good,"pro's -Organization where the policies are in place. "
good,"JPMC is great company overall and perfect on paper; The compensation and benefits are fantastic and the company is very great with work life balance. However, if you come from a fast paced environment, it can be very boring. The company is so large and has so many controls, which I appreciate as someone who banks with Chase, that it can be very difficult to collaborate and can feel isolated. I would definitely recommend it to most people, but it's not for everyone."
good,Ok but as a banker of 6 years never got a raise at all they said that bankers do not get raises and to advance they just put you on a development plan for years and tell you what you want ti hear
good,"I am not sure of many things we did. I will have to talk about this in person."
good,"Repetitive work day.Learning new things daily. Workplace was fairly stable. Hardest part of job,management .Enjoyable part of job,friendly co-workers."
good,"I started working at JP Morgan for a project, as a contractor. It was a great opportunity to learn and to use my networking skills. The hours can be long at times as it is a very goal oriented place to work"
good,"This job was a great place to start with training and good benefits. There is a good work environment  and opportunities to move to other departments. "
good,They provided good training for new and existing employees. Management was open to discuss career advancement for high performing employees. Great place to work.
good,"Chase has a lot to offer compensation-wise.  The benefits are good, pay is decent, incentives are great and there is lots of opportunity to learn and to perfect your skills."
good,"Overall my work experience was great at Chase.  I had some great managers during the early years.  Nonetheless, there are some departments where people are given positions in management that have no business being in the position.  Chase as many of the other banks lay off people after they have been there for some years.  The experience I got there was great."
good,A very slow paced and average working environment. It has great benefits but the pace of career advancement is painfully slow. Great for anyone looking for a nice temp role or simply looking to settle.
good,"Diversity in entry and mid career, good benefits and decent mobility"
good,Typical day of work was 8 hours a day or shorter. Learned to work with a large group of people. Very large company and could be a very c.old place to work. Hardest part of job was constant change
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a competitive and cutting edge financial organization, with a strong commitment to expanding their global footprint and providing the best services possible to clients and customers around the world."
good,"Independent management style"
good,"Chase is a great company to work for but not flexible, I need more of a work/life balance.  I need to also be able to move around you are required to sit for long periods of time with no exercise."
good,Great working environment. Excellent benifits. Clerical duties organized. Able to adapt to weekly changes. On site security and safe working area to all
good,"Provide services, "
good,"During various technical and management assignments at JPMC, the  genuinely strong partnership between business departments and IT made for the ongoing successful technology startegies, and the growth of the company.  JPMC's results speak for themselves."
good,"Fast paced, fund accounting based work, challenging and great for those with a mind for figures. The culture is very make dominated which can be challenging as a woman. You need to have a thick skin and be an effective decision maker."
good,The environment was very hectic but the people friendly.  Would recommend but need to keep on toes as the culture and the positions seem to change frequently.
good,"Great company to work for with substantial benefits, however there is little work life balance depending on your role - very long hours are expected and are considered normal as part of the culture. Lots of bureaucracy as expected in a Tier One bank."
good,"Unfortunately, you are always in fear of being laid off once the backlog of work is completed.  Chase does not have an atmosphere of stability.  Very nervous work environment for production or loans department."
good,"Experience was interesting, environment friendly, management stressing, salary unfair. Management was interested in loading staff with responsibilities not so much a raise or a promotion."
good,"Ultimately, there no right or wrong words to use when describing your company culture. The most important thing is that they’re authentic and aspirational – that they accurately reflect what you are and where you want to go. It helps to think about words that describe the characteristics you’re looking for in prospective hires. Companies are built on people, not products, and nobody can embody and develop your company like your employees."
good,"Not going to give a summary review"
good,"Not a relaxed work environment, need more skilled and professional managers to lead teams, no room for advancement within the company only throughout the call center."
good,"Over I've give them a B. Great management. No micro-managing. If you need help, someone can find it for you. There are some people that slack, but for the most part most people are good folk."
good,"Great entry level job, minimum hours, taught me great experience with handling cash and interacting with clients. In order to make a career for yourself you must be very patient."
good,"Very difficult to move up this company, it's a great fit for college students needing a job while paying their way through school. This was a good experience but not a long term career choice."
good,productive work  will be expected every day. Good Scope to learn new technologies in turn helps to grow faster. work and personal life balance is not very good.
good,"JP morgan is a good company. The employees are great, managers are kinda inexperienced but as an Assistant manager, I managed alot of assets with little help from managers."
good,"A typical day at Chase Bank was helping customer with transactions of deposits, withdrawals, transfers, cash/coin exchanges, payments, and cashing checks. What I learned is how to better deal with people face-to-face. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are irate. The most enjoyable are the customers who are appreciative and also my co-workers. The workplace culture is by the book due to the fact we are dealing with people's money and it is important that we not make any mistakes and if we do we de-escalate the problem as soon as possible. The management is by the book for the same reasons as a previously stated."
good,"Great benefits and senior leadership, lots of diversity/acceptance and promotion of work/life balance. Experience at this company varies where you work and for what line of business. Lots of lateral opportunities but not as many vertical."
good,"There is job security and good benefits and good compensation. Depending on your department and/ or manager, things can seem unorganized and unclear as to what is your actual role within the company."
good,Employees can sometimes feel neglected if not shown that their interest is a priority. Enforcing more involved career-driving tools could change this.
good,"Very strict company to work for. Not much leeway when it comes to your job role. Great incentive program for now. With right management and team, success is easy."
good,The benefits are very good; however the salary pay is not. My previous position had a culture of micromanaging and using fear tactics as a way keeping employees in line.  I was transferred into a new department and the management team was completely opposite. They embraced creativity and openness toward making the department better.
good,"•  Substantial experience in performance reporting, in-depth business and data analysis, reconciliations, data management, "
good,The Loan Processing Department is in a constant state of flux.The culture is not indicative of other departments within Chase. Felt like a sweat shop.
good,Workplace culture was typical of a large corporation - some employees were lazy and did sub-par work and were rewarded for it while others were hard-working and excelled at their tasks and were never recognized for it. It was more boot-licking for advancement than advancement by merits.
good,"its sucks someday and someday its laid back "
good,"Constant calls and very slow computers "
good,"Each day is fast paced, primarily due to the team being short staffed and you typically take on a large workload. Great place to learn client servicing on a higher level and develop problem-solving skills. The overall management is great, they do a lot of coaching. Opportunity for advancement is low, mostly because the entry-level position don't fill and it would add to the short staffed issue."
good,"JP Morgan does not fairly pay its internal employees compared to external new hires."
good,"My workday consisted of calling attorneys to ensure compliance with state and Chase regulations on Home Equity accounts in foreclosure. What I learned was more about working with a team and wise time management than specific skills, as we were shuffled around too frequently to gain mastery of any one in particular. The culture encouraged teamwork among the floor staff, as until the last year I was employed with Chase there was very little internal promotion - a failing bank would be bought out and their managers would become our manager. The hardest part of the job was keeping tasks straight, as in the interest of cross-training we would learn a task just well enough to pass muster before moving to a new task, during which our previous training would wither for lack of practice, and then the process would repeat. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with coworkers, who were eager to help."
good,"learning from managers "
good,"Although the company holds weight with its name alone, unfortunately there is little room to progress in your career or grow with the company. Great benefits but low pay."
good,"As with any call center environment, expect a heavy workload with very little rest. entry level positions require you to deal with customers and their banking needs that range from simple debit card activation to escalated complaints. "
good,"It was a good place to work as far as the benefits and corporate structure. However, management in the retail banking side tends to stress out the bankers with high commission quotas."
good,"The branch that I worked at was quiet and slow. The customers were always very friendly and never gave any problems. My coworkers were all outgoing and made the branch feel as if were a second home. My manager was very sweet and promoted growth. The hardest part about the job, was the slow work pace and little hours we would be allowed to work."
good,"too much work. not be able to live my life at all. due to the workloads, you wont be worry about the job security. However they keep using the very old technologies which is not good for long run."
good,"good company to work for it depends on each individual, department  and management that you  may be reporting to. overall the culture and company is good"
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a heartless corporation , Did not believe in helping the customer, the upper management did not believe in empathy or sympathy when it came to the customers."
good,"Each department is different and each manager is different. Working at Chase isn't about what you know it's about who you know. You can easily advance if you know someone. Your manager has to like you personally in order for you to advance. Now you may run into a manager who sees your potential and you as an employee and that is amazing, but rare. Good luck."
good,Pay is great and benefits are excellent. Management is hard to get into unless you know someone (nepotism and cronyism). Almost 2 months off per year if you have been there 5 years.
good,"I worked at JP for 10 years and overall the culture was great , but the amount of controls and regulations made it difficult to navigate through work. Compensation wasn't great and merit increases were not sufficient,"
good,"Chase is a great place to start, gain a lot of knowledge and branch out in your career. They make sure you know your job and that you able to perform to greatest potential. The managers are great at helping you move on."
good,"I personally had not the most supportive management.  Because of the relationship between branch manager and market executive, my BM was intimidated going to them with a lot.  So that would sow the seeds of miscommunication and create a lack of pperceived investment.  Those things aside, I was not once offered any other position than the one I had, and when inquiring about other roles usually went nowhere.  Great benefits and holiday pay policies, but the lack of upward mobility really hurts.  Very incentive-sales based (which shouldn't be a surprise), but how the incentive changes every year can be annoying.  All-in-all, a decent company to work for if you want a solid job that offers a respectable work life balance.  You will have to fight tooth and nail for advancement, though."
good,"The culture of the company is definitely attractive. But, you do not get pay fairly for the businesses you bring and there is so many regulations that you can""t make exceptions with clients and you feel that you don't have authority at all. Building relationship with clients takes time and bringing their business too. Bankers and Relationship bankers should be pay a lot more for bringing thousands of dollars to the table. The structure of the Incentive plan is so poorly developed that there is not incentive/motivation for the Bankers to sell ."
good,"Formerly Washington Mutual, Chase Bank is a great company to work for. It's leadership communicated the company values, vision and goals clearly."
good,collections nothing special make calls get payments cure delinquencies offer mortgage assistance. financial interviews over the phone discuss foreclosure
good,"Sales focused, very intense environment, goal oriented team environment . Customer service and satisfaction. Good company to get your start in banking."
good,Good place to work for longevity. Great opportunities to experience other areas and advancement. Job security always a issue. Downsizing and layoffs.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a fast pace environment that requires proper planning, interpersonal skills and cultural intelligence. At Chase I have been able to improve upon my speaking and understanding. My management team is very motivational and informative. I have always been able to rely on the team in questionable situations. My co-workers are very team-oriented which is a reflection of the management. The hardest part of the job is keeping every customer happy during peak times. The most enjoyable part of the job is the comraderie amongst my colleagues."
good,"After being with Chase for over 15 years, they decided that the entire department for which I worked should be moved to Mumbai. 7 people, with a combined total of 113 years of experience, lost their jobs in my department."
good,"The pay is good, but the expectations are very high.  If you work anywhere but NY/NJ, you're not part of the club.  It's a big corporation and there are many strange rules (your LinkedIn is monitored and they will tell you what you can/cannot share).  "
good,"I choose to not participate in reviewing this employer in detail. Overall JPMorgan is a good company to work for, and, their compensation is comparable to the work required. However, JPMorgan has very poor management in Albany, NY with inexperience and micromanaging tendencies. The workplace is very tense and unprofessional at times."
good,"TCS is a Great Company to work with ,i have enjoying working with the Professional Colleague and management team was very helpful to me. I recommend to those people who need to work with TCS please go through."
good,I   take  inbound  calls    from  customer   on   their   mortgage and  escrow  as   been  home  owner  myself   I  learned  about  mortgage  and  escrow   and  the ins  and  outs   of  the mortgage  world.  the  people   that   I  worked  with  we  become  like  family  .
good,"ok place to work, would recommend if not working in the mortgage industry too many layoffs and only hire people that have been laid off in the past. Great Culture"
good,A typical day at work is spent talking to customers regarding their mortgages payments or mortgage assistance programs.
good,"The role has its limits, and once your in this role there is not much else to do with the company but it does make you good money but expect long hours from 830 to 615 a day."
good,Its a working environment that you could grow in being productive. It became a family of workers that really gave themselves to achieving the best for the company really because of the management they had in place.
good,"Busy call volume, mgmt staff always helpful. hardest part of the job is trying to ensure to meet the handle time while not breaking any federal regulations. "
good,"Great benifits. Great Working environment. Very Diverse. Clean, and professional. The time that I've work there, it was always pleasing. The only downside was the departments with sales are always aggressive with goals and sometimes makes you feel like if you're walking on eggshells."
good,Chase has been a great place to network and grow. The best place to be get to know people and to be known. You are always able to see growth.
good,I have worked for this company for about 9 yrs. A lot was learned in those yrs but it was rough. The nature of the work is stressful and monthly stats are set way too high. I feel better not being there at this moment but will miss my coworkers because most of them were good folks. I learned a lot in my time there and appreciate the opportunity but so ready to move on!
good,"Overall I love the environment due to the fantastic and lovely people i get to work with on a day to day basis. However, the work is not challenging enough and there is limited growth opportunities."
good,Nice people and work life balance. Somehow I feel they don't value developers like other tech companies. Don't expect to have free lunch or snacks.
good,"Co-workers were a pleasure, was on phone most of the day with customers.  Helping customers stay in their home was the best part of the job."
good,"Great Company, but Infrastructure Management needs improvement as well as entry level training. When facing an issue many times Management is unable to assist with getting a issue resolved in a timely manner. SLA's at many times are not met."
good,"difficulty in getting data related to requires. Time management,completing  work with in time slot given by client. management is good and supporting to employees. Reaching client requires maintaining documents   changes that effort prices of shares of particular client.enjoying work with time members"
good,A typical productive day started with a huddle that comprised of daily objectives and what is needed to achieve monthly & quarterly goals. Co-workers performed as a team and willing to help to ensure that customers were treated fairly and provided accurate information.
good,"1. Made outbound calls to C-Level executives outside of the Chase footprints. "
good,"Great company, however, management is indecisive and compensation to keep talent is minimal. To get ahead you must move around or leadership potential is limited."
good,"Good Working Environment."
good,"Working at JPM can be rewarding, but not necessarily financially.  Work life balance is good in my role, but the promotion process is not very well structured."
good,The job was very stressful and the management was not supportive.  Breaks and lunch were short. Employee has to be able to learn a lot of material in the role in a very short amount of time.  Not a good working environment. Best part of the job were the people that I met.
good,"Pay is great, politics are very fluid but company remains somewhat unstable. Executives have been either leaving or moving quite often."
good,I enjoyed my job and the face pace environment.High call volume was nice because the day went by a faster each day.I worked well with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was 12 shifts 4 days a week but it was nice to have 3 days off each week.
good,Job location close to home no real travel time to get to and from work. Constant change with policy and procedure related to daily collections activity. The best part of the job was interacting with co -workers food days contests etc. The most difficult situation was not reporting to the same management team  from more than one year at a time constantly shuffling employees to different managers and team leaders. There was a fair amount of politics and red tape which made the job very challenging
good,This is a fast paced environment where you need to wear many hats and your plate is always full. Truly good and selfless managers provided learning opportunities to acquire new skill sets and high visibility projects for career advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job were my numerous colleagues who shared a wealth of knowledge and were selfless when providing assistance in the execution of tasks and resolution of anomalies. The hardest part of the job was that some managers have God complexes and are self interested in their own advancement - always have an exit strategy as a contingency plan as a result.
good,The company had undergone some really big changes while I was employed. i started with Washington Mutual which was later acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase in 2008. I worked with the company through the acquisition and learned a lot about commercial finance first hand during this time in banking.
good,"Training was not nearly enough to be thrown into the job. The person who trained us had never done the job and was hired for the sole purpose of training multiple positions within the company. A lot of learning on the fly. Good benefits, good starting salary, just needed more a base for job knowledge."
good,Chase is up to date and innovative when it comes to technology and training tools. I was able to develop a great understanding of the banking world through Chase. The benefits through Chase were very nice but the rate of pay was not what one may expect from a big bank.
good,"Good place to work, you really feel like you're working with the best but it can be difficult to move around, even laterally, within the company."
good,"My typical day was sitting at a computer and reading. What was really nice that any training needed was available online and could be done at your desk. As with any other company management varies from the best boss you can ask for to the micro manager. Co-workers are the same. Some of the most dedicated and helpful people to the ones that you don't want to go near. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changes that occur, while the most enjoyable was there was a new challenge every day."
good,The colleagues are great people to work with. Management needs to change. Phones are very busy. Not a big opportunity to grow.
good,good management awesome pay great systems and lots of resources for information to do your job and they give great incentives  to employees
good,"I worked here in 2002 when big banks just started outsourcing more and more of their work to low wage economies.  This provided a benefit in that it made off of their people more global immediately having to deal with call centers and train different regions.   Good culture, expect to learn fast or sink."
good,Working at Chase provides many opportunities to advance professionally. The environment is dynamic with supportive management with diversity.
good,"Back off job, overtime compensation is fabulous given that you don't have to use your brain too much. Office is large, and opportunity to potentially move to NY."
good,"A good place to work with good people who genuinely care about supporting their clients and customers. There is always red tape and politics to navigate, but this is acknowledged and the company does what it can to provide you with resources to help work through it."
good,"Very fast pace, friendly and they prepare you very well on any position. Work environment is good. Opportunities of growth are many."
good,"Good benefits and great work life balance at JP Morgan Chase & Co."
good,great company to work for if you get placed at a great branch with team work oriented people. The schedules are flexible and you get paid vacation and full benefits.
good,I enjoyed the seasonal work that they oftern provided me with..i just worked seasonal for the bank during tax season only. very diverse company that treated me with respect.....
good,"I think working there was great. It was my supervisor who wasn't great. He never kept us updated on everything, being that we were the fileroom workers. Good atmosphere though."
good,"Great team and work atmosphere. Learned new softwares like Essbase, Extrasheet, etc. Nice work life balance,Cooperative team members."
good,"A typical day was calling many attorneys and title companies, helping homowners make a new transition in their lives."
good,Working for Chase taught me how to be more financially responsible and aware of my credit score.  I learned the difference between long term and short term financial goals.
good,Working for a large corporate financial institution was a great start  for my business career.  Learning about the world of finance and completing the various training programs prepared me not only for my roles with the bank but has influenced my day-to-day operations.
good,"Good Organisation,with a good opportunity to work with good people and learn more things,productivity and good work environment,employees are given privilege like transport facility, maintenance of high level of hygene"
good,Great ability to move around to different aspects of the business. Large in the community for charities and giving back.
good,"Worked with some intelligent Database admins, application support programmers and operate professionals whom worked around the clock.  We supported the trading systems and applications."
good,Scheduling was very flexible. I learned good mathematical skills working as a cashier and bookkeeper. I also learned the importance of cash handling.
good,Typical day at Chase is inbound and outbound calls. You can get anywhere from 80-300 calls a day and only talk to about 30 people. Very uptight environment due to the company always changing. You have to be able to adapt to anything and fast.
good,"At JP Morgan India the day would start early as we were serving Australia. I learned a lot from JP mainly teamwork, working under pressure and still how to delivery the correct outcome on time. The co-workers were very help full."
good,"I would go to work, take a step back, and prioritize my day! I would make sure to a lot enough time for each task that needed to be completed. I multi task well in a fast paced environment. The people I really enjoyed however the company began micro managing which became an issue."
good,It's a pretty good job except they won't give you a good annual review just because they don't want to pay and they expect you to cancel plans to convience them.
good,not a very good place for starters financially. U get to learn a lot though but its always work here. More of work less fun.
good,"My typical job at Chase was looking over accounts and trying to detect fraud trends. I worked hand in hand with GSI and filled out the SARS reports. At this job I learned fraud trends, and stayed up to date with regulations."
good,"Conduct meetings with project stakeholders, track progress, implement needed changes, develop strategies to meet deadlines."
good,I have no complaints they just downsized like any other big company. They didn't want to meet the cost of living regards to relocating
good,"Although I believed in the mission of educational learning, the company continued to hire upper management that didn't value its employees and cared little about paying the average wage for the position or retaining talent."
good,"Phone calls"
good,"I worked for this company for years.  In the beginning, I loved it.  They offer very competitive benefits, even for part time employees and the pay is decent as well.  Or at least it was.  sadly, all good things must come to an end and eventually, the incentive plan here has pretty much gone away.  They also emphasize a service culture but many branch managers push sales so hard that it's often uncomfortable for many employees.  some are lucky enough to get a manager who understands a healthy work/life balance, but those are few and far between.  Great way to start off in the banking industry though.  Great technology, probably the best in the business and they do everything they can to make sure employees have the tools to properly serve and help customers."
good,"My time at JPMorgan Chase was very busy from start to finish. I enjoyed the amount of responsibilities I had there which ranged from managing the teller line, balancing drawers/vaults, auditing processes, creating schedules and more. "
good,"I have great managers, and amazing co-workers. I've gained life long friends at this job. It was my first job, and I'd say a very good start to my working career. "
good,"I hear the culture has changed since I managed. However, Chase will consume your life if you let it. Bleed Blue"
good,"Trade capture of Derivatives - Swaps,CFD,Options,CDS"
good,"Surrounded by more than 100 employees in an operation area, where most colleagues know each other- It was challenging, brain-wrecking and fun to work in a company where you are equipped with tools and applications to do your job, supportive managers who uplift you with your strengths and encourage you to be more than what you are capable of doing, co-workers with different personalities and varied opinions but who are willing to help find solution to complex customer issues."
good,"JPMorgan Chase has a great benefits program. I have really enjoyed my time working here, and the opportunities that I have received while working here."
good,"On he day to day basis detail job is more on supporting infrastructure that has been established on their BPO, monitoring and advances technology little by little for better performance."
good,"good company"
good,"Challenging, High Volumes work, Best working conditions, job satisfaction"
good,Great company. Management is always trying to encourage staff to do better to move up in the company.
good,"When your role is 90% travel, you learn quickly to multi-task in different environments."
good,Over all great company to work for with the exception of stability.
good,"This job has potential to be fast paced or moderate depending on the location of the branch. My managers are excellent, however, it is hard to advance in this role. A typical day at work includes handling customer transactions, balancing and maintaining the vault, supplying tellers with cash, and making sure that the branch balance does not fall below or go above the branch totals. I have learned a lot from this job. I learned how to manage cash totals in a branch, how to audit a vault, how to handle customer issues, and when to utilize supervisor override. The management team currently consists of a Branch Manager, an Assistant Branch Manager, and may or may not include a Manager On Duty. My team was a great team to work with. My managers were laid back and understanding with their employees. They are flexible and try to make it a good place to work. My coworkers were generally enjoyable to work with. However, some had fairly demanding schedules and were unwilling to change that in order to assist the branch. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep track of all of my coworkers inquiries while trying to maintain my own cash box and customer transactions. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the coworkers."
good,"Direct managers often do not care about employee welfare. The hardest parts are the long hours & having to work on Saturdays. The most enjoyable was educating customers & learning new skills, especially about investments."
good,"Pros: Great atmosphere and great place to work for (esp. for college students). +Benefits and paid holidays. Breaks, and management with work with you on scheduling"
good,"very good management team"
good,"Working in a high volume environment , reviewing several credit request which includes credit line increases, new credit card applications, and existing accounts to determine credit worthiness and risk factors.  Adhering to service levels and avoiding high abandoned department rates."
good,A typical day of work consisted of assisting customers with issues with their credit cards. From processing payments to helping the resolve an issue.
good,"Company has great pay and has a lot of opportunity of advancement. A typical day at work is basically opening up my work space for customers to come and inquire about new accounts and/or existing accounts. Also, my day consists of constant interaction with new and existing customers, which is the most enjoyable part of my job. Another enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers and helping them as much as possible. The hardest part of my job would probably be not being able to help a customer or co-worker enough. Throughout my years of working for Chase, I've learned how to problem solve effectively, how to help costumers manage their accounts successfully, recommend products based on needs for the customer and work closely and productively with my team members. The management can be very resourceful and professional."
good,"Ever changing. Some days you would be on mail opening machine, the next sorting mail. Never dull."
good,"Smart people, good mobility, emphasis on regulatory compliance has created a stressful environment which does not promote a happy workplace."
good,Overall: higher management should be more helpful and guide juniors
good,very underpaid if you transfer to a new position within company. almost impossible to get a decent raise to keep in line with market value
good,"I've worked at Chase for 3 Years and was laid off through a business reorganization.  The company allowed me 3 months to find a job within the company or outside of the company.  With the mortgage industry being so unpredictable,  I've experienced several layoff in the past few years, but never have I been afforded the opportunity to secure a position.  I am blessed.  This is a good company to work for."
good,A typical day at work involves investigations revolving around Anti-Money Laundering and account analysis. I have leaned the different typologies in regards to anti money laundering. The management understands the ways things work in regards to each case taking a certain amount of time and only push the workers when a deadline is looming. as well as my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the tediousness of the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers.
good,"Lots of change and a very fast paced environment, good learning experience"
good,"Typical call center work.  If you aren't the type to be chained to a phone for the work day, this may not be for you."
good,"Payday for customers was the best days. I would buy enough money to last for long period of time without going over my drawer limit.  I love talking to  co-workers about what time particular customers would come in.  When the customer gets there, if surroundings permit, we tell them who was right or wrong about the time they would come in. It let the customer know that they are important to you."
good,"found the work most enjoyable"
good,"Highly professional, long working hours being the hardest part of the job."
good,"Had more than enough training to succeed in the workplace, disagreed with management."
good,Washington mutual was seized by the federal government and we were purchased byJP Morgan Chase
good,"Good place to work but hard to advance."
good,"I started out here as a Personal Banker and have been attempting to advance into a career path which is more in line with my skills and interests, but have thus far not been able to advance due to changes within the company.  It is a great company to work for in that every day is different, and there are an unlimited amount of resources to help customers with various issues.  "
good,"pretty standard corporate company with a twist.  Chase is a typical corporate company, however due to the penalties the government has given, It has become more difficult to do business.  Only certain bankers can open business accounts, which can be an inconvenience to the customer.  If the branch is not staffed properly, a customer will need to wait or go to a different branch.  The people are good but not all branches are created equal.  Management is hit or miss."
good,"Otimo lugar para se trabalhar. Ambiente profissional muito bom, com estrutura completa."
good,On a daily basis I work with my clientele to determine business needs and solutions.  The managers are there to help you succeed and empower you to make great decisions.  The work environment is high paced and very competitive.  What I love about the job is that it is local and flexible with my personal life.
good,"As a processing specialist/OIC, I am handling at least two process and a project initiative. I am the mediator between my team members and the management. I provide updates to my team members on standard operating procedure, daily reminders and management. I am reporting to a supervisor. My team is the most responsible team I worked with, they are up to date with their process and projects. They taught me a lot of things on hard work and team work.She provides me feedback on my performance on a monthly basis. She taught me the importance of initiative and thirst for excellence. The hardest part of the job is being responsible on a process that only one person knows, which is not ideal due to there is no contingency plan if only one person is familiar with a process. The most enjoyable part of the job is the possibility of being trained abroad."
good,"The staff are excellent people that are hardworking.  The management team varies.  Some are wanting to effect change, while others are disengaged.  The most difficult part of JP Morgan culture is the resistance to change."
good,"poor management "
good,I thought this was a great place no serious complaints just  happy to of had the opportunity it was a good experience for me Monies would be delivered by armor trucks I handle mostly larger orders mainly fed bag size. the people I worked with were very smart about any question you may have.  we didn't really interact everybody was in a separate room my room was off by it self. lifting the fed bags was the big down fall. best thing was you were able to put input freely.
good,Working with other peoples money so you have to be careful. Lots of training which helps and management is always supportive.
good,"Meetings, supporting the clients internal and external, managing staff, relaying new developments, responding to policy and procedures changes, system implementation, finance and budget reviews."
good,"Very busy work, dynamic environment.  Constantly approaching new projects and challenges.  Team members and managers are open and work well together.  Decent pay and benefits.  Not too many raises or promotions.  Big company with alot of smart, talented people."
good,"I enjoyed analytical, the company gave great tools to conduct research."
good,JPMorgan Chase is a great company to work overall. But I can't say this is the best company I've ever worked for until I retire and look back on all the jobs I ever had.
good,I worked as test engineer in tis project. Iam happy with everything diring the project
good,"A typical day at work involved getting to access and log into the computer the night deposits before the branch opened. Since customer service was the bank's top priority,the branch was opened 10 minutes before the scheduled opening time and remained opened 10 minutes after the scheduled closing time. Logs were reviewed and updated. The Vault was accessed for cash for the day. Customers' transactions were processed in a timely manner. The coming weeks work scheduled was prepared.  Timesheets were reviewed and approved. There may be a few customers waiting to have a document notarized. The ATMs may need a cash replenishment or replace the receipt paper. My manager may ask  me to process or complete a fee refund for a customer. My co-workers  were a diverse group. We worked well together most of the time. The hardest part of my job was having to discipline or coach an employee for not balancing or coming in 3 minutes late. I always believed that if they agreed to improve their performance, in time, they will do a better job. I was happy when I got to learn something new, like a new procedure or a different process and I enjoyed sharing what I learned with the staff. I learned that even tough you may think that you are doing everything correct, there is always someone out there who does not agree."
good,"At the present moment, we have to look for work after the little work we had is done. We have to make the most of what we have in order to make production."
good,"data entry patriot act law, follow guildlines laid by the goverment regarding foregin account holders"
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for however they tend to do alot of layoffs. My entire department (Mortgage Banking) was let go in September 2013. Great benefits
good,Supportive environment but need to know someone to advance.
good,it was my fqavorite palce to work at but since I moved from that area it was hard and getting expensive to commute
good,"A great company to work for if you are looking to work in a fast paced multi tasked position. The hardest part of the position is that while your main position is processing loan modification applications, the center maintains a call center atmosphere, so on top of managing and procesing mortgage modification applications, there are times when you are covering high call volumes and taking overflow for main call centers. Handleing both at times are stressfull, but the reward is helping people.. saving their homes and helping families."
good,As a Salary employee it was hard to balance work and life. Especially with the long hours it was open. Great for clients.
good,Always on the top for the clients. A lot of work. Clients always first.
good,Ahead of the market.  Great culture and leadership and vision.
good,I loved the incentive plan with the company but i did not love the charge backs.  I didn't like that i was capped on the amount of the bonus each moth i would get.  I dont like the long hours they have especially for banking.  Chase seems to forget that many of their associates are parents and they dont have the benefit of having extended hours for childcare.  This job is best suited for single people or for parents with children that are older and can tend to themselves.  Chase also needs to diversify many of their branches and have various languages represented not just one culture.  i think the best part of my job was the extra money each month i learned and the hour break i got for lunch.
good,"I was a Teller at Chase and my shift was from 6:30-10:30. Opening was normally easy and the manager allowed you to listen to the radio until the main lobby opened. There was some communication issues between the workers managers a lot of the time, and unless you are a banker, you'll most likely be a part time teller. The people you work with are really nice, and you meet all sorts of people that come into the bank to handle their finances."
good,"Many hiring frenzies and then lay-offs when it comes to the mortgage industry, which is why I am seeking employment in another industry."
good,I enjoyed the work and my co-workers. overall the company lost morals due to the size of the company.
good,"I worked at Chase with a positive attitude. The pay and bonuses were top notch. The products and services were fantastic, but management was horrible. From the start, I noticed a revolving door effect on management. There were constantly trainees being whisked into one door, and burned out managers out the very same door. As a sales person it wasn't the type of thing that would normally bother me. When upper management decided to come down on the sales people because of lack of resolve or lack of a structured branch, that was when working became stressful. A typical day was not as call heavy as you might think. There was an emphasis on relationship building; of that I will give Chase credit for in recent years. But lets be honest, a salesperson is there to make money, and when you micromanage every aspect of their job, who do you think it is really helping? We know how to sell, that's why you hired us. We know how to talk to clients. Want to keep us on your payroll longer? Here is a simple idea: Give us the opportunity to do our job, and if we don't perform, put us on the chopping block. Constantly hounding us only makes us feel like children. With 10+ years of sales behind me I took my experience elsewhere and although I miss some of my co-workers, the only loyalty most salesmen will have, is to their paycheck. I appreciate the time I was there, but my last two weeks there couldn't go by any faster."
good,"run of the mill "
good,"overall a great company to work for , allows for advancement and mobility within the company"
good,Chase is a great company to work for but unfortunately there have been 100's of jobs lost and more to continue as they start to downsize their workforce in the Mortgage Banking division.
good,"Senior leaders could be more in touch with the front line employees' job responsibilities.  Company would benefit from more transparent processes and fluid communication flow among departments. "
good,this was a laid back job and something i loved coming to everyday.
good,"While working for Chase learned a lot about default servicing as I worked and assisted in several departments. I liked working there, and the benefits were great."
good,"Chase offers a lot of great benefits for it's employees; however, there are some major drawbacks.  The hours are absolutely terrible.  They don't like to give you a set schedule, so it's hard to make plans to do anything a month in advance as your hours can range from starting at 8:00am to ending your day at 6:30pm.  They are also open on Saturdays.  It's hard to get anything done, or go to doctors/dentist appointments.  The uniform rules are also pretty strict.  There is a lot of room to grow within the company though.  If you are a hard worker, Chase rewards you.  However, their compensation rates/scales seemed to change a lot even within the first year that I worked there.  If you're lucky enough to have a great manager like I did, then you will make it far.  The company does try to push ""being friendly to the customer"" A LOT.  Sometimes it comes off as a bit rehearsed and fake though."
good,"Best part of the job is liaising with clients on trade needs and mentoring direct reports."
good,"i learned puntuality and working hardly and smartly."
good,"A typical day at work for me is built around mortgage origionation.  I work with the current book of customers and coach Personal Banks on profiling to uncover customers needs. Needs they either are aware of or needs they may never have considered."
good,"•	Collaborate with team to certify that internally developed and third party applications are not subject to unauthorized access, malicious code injection, inappropriately executed changes, and other unsavoury events, in threefold: on the application level, the database level, and the operation system level."
good,"•	Over 8 Years of IT experience of which 4+ years of experience in BPM Technologies and 5+ Years of experience in JAVA/J2EE Technologies."
good,"It is a great place to gain professional development however the culture of the company lacks transparency throughout. I think that employees are valued but with spending cuts and this post recession market they are doing the bare minimum to show how much they value their employees. "
good,"At JP Morgan, I learned about corporate setting and what it is like to be in a business work place.  I enjoyed being able to assist individuals that help the business grow, and also love being part of a stable company.  The hardest part of my job is fitting all the work into one day, and the most enjoyable part of my job would be meeting new people every day."
good,"Accountability for all aspects of service delivery for 100 client relationships within the Pension, Endowment, and Foundation segment. Lead team of client service account managers, responsible for client satisfaction governance, project management, problem resolution, and risk management.  "
good,Working at Chase is great but there is no better opportunity to move up the ladder quickly
good,"Customer Service all day with Staff and Clients. Huddles: Team Building: Account Balancing: Mortgage Loans: Personal Banker goals: Feedback: ABM scheduling: Mentoring all employees in job responsibilities: Checking accounts, savings, loans, Investments, Business Analysis: Writing Business plans with Small Business Owners: Cold calling: Educating all day is what I learn thoroughly to build a great rapport with employees, customer base. The hardest part is leaving at the end of the day. There is so much that customers need financial advice to financial goal planning, when you schedule appointments how important to stay on track to be successful to all."
good,"Strong company, focused on controls and compliance in all aspects and all roles at the firm."
good,"I didn't work for a JPMorgan branch, but I was part of a contract for the US Government.  The work itself was easy and repetitive, relatively mindless, but overall it wasn't the worst job I've had. I enjoyed my co-workers for the most part, and my manager was very good to us.  The reason I give them a three star rating is because, just like with any other big corporation, you really are just a number, and the company's needs are always more important than your own.  The benefits are excellent in comparison to most corporations I've worked for, but the pay is far lower than it should be for the amount of work I did."
good,produce checks for court orders. It was a tough place to work as work enviroment was hostile with high turn over. overall the company was great to work for.
good,"A typical day at the call center for JP Morgan was at times difficult. I was at the ""final stages"" of an attempt to help homeowners come to a resolution in default. Many homeowners were about 2 years behind on their mortgages by the time their loans would reach my desk. The process was suppose to work as follows: 4 months to make a decision with the information that was provided to Chase by the homeowners, if approved they were placed on a 3 month trial in which they were to show good faith by making those payments on time. This was a difficult challenge for many homeowners, but was very rewarding when the ""Save a home, change a life"" motto was fullfilled. I had a great co-worker/management support system for the most part which was also essential in making this happen for the homeowners. I've learned through this experience that with strong organization and 100% communication through every step of the process, most to all of my customers were very satisfied with their results. Whether they were approved or not as long as the communication was there most were not unhappy and prepared for the outcome."
good,"Was very hectic environment, learned to be very diverse. The hardest is part is getting the job done timely and depending on your co-workers to be on the same page. Time and deadlines played a very important role. The end customer satisfaction and company recognition."
good,"Overseeing Sub prime Collections dept. Hiring, Training, in compliance and collections. Set schedules and forecasts"
good,it was really mostly a daily schedule so everything was done over and over everyday
good,"I loved the ""team oriented"" environment at Chase. Coworkers were friendly and helpful. Goals were taken seriously. Great computer resources available. I enjoyed working with Chase Teams across the country. Overall, good work experience."
good,"but what I found they let the people with the most value, longest worked and most compensated and replaced them with younger cheaper ones, Loyalty meant nothing to t hie company!"
good,Very stressful environment working management who need people skills
good,"Typical call center, keep moral up with themed days for example food days, days to play board games, sales goal games"
good,"My experience with Chase/EMC Mortgage lasted about 5 years. I had an opportunity to work in various departments and I enjoyed my time with them. I got a chance to work with some very knowledgable people, very professional people who i remain friends with today."
good,"Unless you are friends with management, its hard to advance, monthly audits are not accurate and you are not able to use sick time when you need it."
good,Lots of responsibilities --good people to work with --No room to grow with degrees
good,"Overall, Chase is an ok company to work for. There flexible, great work life balance which is perfect for a working mom. But they are a bit disorganized no real structure. Lots of Manuel Process. No centralized data warehouse. Pulling data is a nightmare. Bad communication. They are efforts going on now that should correct this problem in a few years. If this gets taken care of then it would't be a bad place to work. It has a lot of potential"
good,Meet with borrowers face to face to gather documents and provide guidance as I walk the borrower through the modification process.
good,a typical day handling 35-40 calls averaging about 10-12 minutes in resolving merchant problems with terminals or with billing or deposit questions...
good,i am working as payment processing of JP morgan chase Bank. I have learned as how to payment one company to another company.
good,Very structured. Fast paced training and work environment.
good,"banking, working in a brach, is a good job for somebody that wants a career in customer service and sale. You basically solve issues that customers have with their accounts and try to sale financial products to them at the same time. If you want a sales career with a fancy title working at a brach is the way to go."
good,JP Morgan & Chase is one of the financial services companies offering wide array of financial products and services. A software application called Taser system was developed to help DCFP Risk analyst who monitor customer actvity to catch fraud on CM accounts.
good,Computation of Daily Nav's
good,9 hrs a day
good,JPMorgan Chase was a good company. The trainers were always there to help you with customers and navigate through systems. A typical day included 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. You had gotten to learn more about people and how to handle different customers. Co-workers were very motivative. There wasnt a hard part of my job but the most enjoyable was working with different people.
good,a typical day at work was not fun. It was collections so not a positive enviorment.
good,Chase is a good place work overall. There you do have job stability and the company moral is very high. Customer service is the number 1 priority.
good,"Good company to start you ur career,can learn a lot of things from this company..it has good job security,which is one advantage .."
good,"Started when company first moved here and would've given them 5 stars across the board. When company merged a lot of things changed, decreasing my opinion. Such as the importance of taking care of a customers issue vs telling them anything as long as you sound empathetic!?"
good,"At the larger branches, it was very busy. Before you knew it the day was over. I found that working with the customers can be very difficult at times but most rewarding."
good,"Multitasking"
good,"Chase overall is a great company, however they are experiencing a lot of change and business units are restructuring frequently.  Job security is not what it ones was there."
good,Has excellent work culture and transparency. Is employee centric. Management is good and transparent. Work life balance in Mumbai office is bad. Encourages diversity
good,Management that I was involved with was very receptive to new ideas and suggestions on how to improve procedures.  I was always a part of a great team.  Made collaboration easy.
good,"Although the company is good, they don’t really care about the employees. Everything is always changing. After a while, you realize you just want to leave and find something better. The only good thing about working there are the benefits."
good,"Being a Personal/Business Bankers has its perks. Yes, it looks great on your resume, you meet tons of people, and Chase is a great company to work for. The issue I had was the inability they had to give raises to Bankers. About 2-3 years ago they took away yearly bonuses we would get based on our performance. You will get paid salary plus commission. Which yes it sounds great but as a Personal Banker it isn't enough. You'll average about 1000 PVC's per month and only get $700 after taxes. After being a banker for 5+ years and asking multiple times the only response I would get it ""The company isn't giving raises at the time"". But its total bull cause other employees were getting raises."
good,"This was a good work environment, very friendly coworkers, and the atmosphere is always positive. The work is fast paced and demanding, but it is fun at the same time."
good,"I was working temporary position was told I was going to be hired, management hired another person which their family member may have known or had a family member working at j p Morgan chase bank, I felt it was fair then I was told that my assignment was over."
good,"- Answers inbound calls and emails, provides excellent customer service."
good,"i accepted the job due to the fact couple of friends had worked at the company for 13-15 years, so i thought there would be some stability; however, those days are gone. I was also told during my interview and hiring process that there was a pension plan and college offered after 1 year of employment. After I qualified for both, the pension plan was terminated, and the college benefit was changed to after 2 years. There is also a double standard of in training we were taught one thing and on the actual work floor we were ""red-flagged"" for doing things in the call that the trainers taught us to do, making for a very inconsistent and frustrating job experience where myself and others felt we were always on eggshells in regard to our employment status.  There is also a wardrobe standard which is very inconsistently enforced with the management often not following the dress code policy while strictly enforcing that on the people working on the phones who in fact never see a customer."
good,"The company provide good incentive and environment is clean and friendly."
good,"Coworkers were cool. The pay wasn’t good for the amount of stress and work you have to do. Was a lead teller for a year and performed well, they only gave me a 10c raise so I left"
good,"There was no work to life balance, always on-call and not too many days off, unless you fought for them...  The expectation was within 6 months you knew the entire Cards Services line of business, which typically take at least 2 years to learn.   Diversity was a joke, for African American Men."
good,"A typical day at work was actually awesome. If you are able to work and get the job done independently and as a team. Management was available if you needed. I loved that my team was basically my 2nd family. I actually miss working with them. We had our challenging days; that is when the team came into show support. In the 14 years of employment I started from originations- to Modifications. I wish i could be there today. My site was one of the best still not sure why we were laid off. This was a life changing opportunity for me, it allowed me to grow within the company."
good,"People were amazing, recently got a new manager and the whole culture of the branch shifted and made it uncomfortable to work there. Did teach me a lot and gave me a lot patience and customer service was key. Enjoyed working there but felt stagnant."
good,"Great place to work.  Great people.  Amazing people working for that company.  Sad to have left  The coworkers that I have met throughout the years have been incredible.  I'm sorry that I have lost a few, but the people I have encountered there have been utterly spectacular.  And I wish them the best in their careers."
good,"I  Loved the medical benefits.  And the early hours.  Don’t agree with score cards they use to rate you.  It is counted against you if you get  off the phone if you have to use the bathroom.  Don’t pay enough for the stress they put you under.   Depends on what manager you worked for,  on policy and procedures."
good,"Traning could be better, supervisors, were friends of management that got promoted, supervisor would tell you one thing and management another, hard to advance"
good,"stressful environment, poor management, salary is not fair for the job performance done on a daily basics. benefits are a great plus for employers, a great company to grow within in."
good,"Little to no advancement opportunities at the branch level.  Pay remains stagnant.  Calls are micromanaged with new system.  Management and other branch staff are usually fun and make the working environment a good place to be.  Working Saturdays typically gets you a day off during the week which is a plus.  Benefits, discounts, and 401k are good.  If applying to Chase try to get into JPMorgan investments or corporate."
good,"I started as a debt collector which was so stressful because part of my salary was based on my performance to get credit card holders to pay their minimums or entire debt. This position was held during the economic recession so most people were struggling and did not have money thus they often yelled at me and it was extremely frustrating and more-or-less verbal abuse each day. The workplace culture was great because all employees were able to help each other and talk whenever. Schedules were customized to each employee. Advancement was slow and it was sort of a dead end at times. I did learn about managing money i.e. savings, how credit scores work, reverse mortgages, and much more. It was great when I could get someone on a payment program so that they could payoff their debt."
good,Constant threats of layoffs and it was a long way to drive. Management did not seem to have a real direction.  A lot of things were said but never came to fruition
good,"I had a good career. However, many jobs have now been transferred out of NY. The pay for the remaining jobs are good but they lack good management and appreciation"
good,"Always making sure that you and your co workers are safe at all times. "
good,"The reason why I've rated the company poorly is because there is a high turnover which in the future does not offer everyone a fair opportunity to getting promoted within the firm. Management is biased and do not work closely with all employees just those that they favor and like. Can be a bit bureaucratic, work/life balance depends on group you work with excluding management."
good,"friendly people, easy work loads this place allowed me to work at my own pace and easily adjust to the departments.I would work here again if offered."
good,"JPMorgan Chase being one of the largest companies in the world gives its employees amazing benefits and the tools to succeed. The only downside is the fact that you are working a 9-5 standard job in the banking industry, which can be ridiculously over-regulated and somewhat boring."
good,The hardest part of the job is the back to back calls with the Average handle time per call average being at 4 minutes or less. When dealing with a customers finances many times customers do not want to feel pressured or rushed.  Chase tries to create a good workplace environment by doing many employee appreciation promotions.
good,I enjoyed working there but they kept reducing the work hours making it hard to make a living while working there but besides that it was an easy job  where you learned about so much of the banking business.
good,JP Morgan Chase provided me my first opportunity to underwrite mortgages on a full time basis.  Retail underwriting is a very fast paced environment that will help build the foundation for a new underrwiter.
good,"was a good place to work, repeat customers and co-workers made the job even more interesting. Enjoyed my time i spent working with this company. Just not easy to move up."
good,Chase is a great company to work for with excellent benefits.  A typical day at Chase would be answering calls to assist clients with updating their accounts. I learned how to listen more affectively and be patient with people.  The culture is very nice and everyone seems to get along well.  The hardest part of my job is working 3rd shift. I actually love my job at Chase I simply no longer wish to work 3rd Shift.
good,"If you get with the right management and marking director, you will have fun at your job. It is not always fun and games but they do have the best benefits but does not pay you enough for what you have to do. The raise is nothing and it is not worth for what you do everyday."
good,"Chase is a good company, but the pay is not enough and I feel like, because the pay is not competitive with other companies that sometimes the moral is down. You do have the ability to move up really fast in the company."
good,Great place to work just hard to work somewhere that your work doesn't speak for itself. To move up anywhere you have to be in with the in crowd. Doesn't matter what you have to offer someone with less qualifications than you can get the job just because you dont like to kiss ***. Sorry for the language.
good,Face pace productive company sending the best quality product to the customer.monitored department queues to ensure work was completed on time. Always looking for process improvment to perfect the process.
good,Back office operations great environment. At any given day the workload can be really hectic. We as the back office team are willing to jump in and help each other when we that one of our colleagues seems to be overwhelmed. It gives a new word to the meaning of teamwork.
good,"Not a bad company, I'm just looking for something new and exciting! JPMorgan Chase pays extremely well and they provide great benefits. They don't however issue raises every year even when you are a meets employee. So cost of living goes up and you get nothing in return for working hard all year."
good,This company has amazing opportunities depending on what department you are in. As an entire company they are great. Be forewarned though if you cannot meet the specific number they want you to you are replaceable.
good,Day to day is enjoyable within the workplace but it is very difficult to advance within the company. It also feels like tenure is more important than actual production when it comes to end of year review/bonus/raise/etc.
good,Chase bank is a great company to work for. The benefits are stellar and they really listen to employees needs. Chase bank cars about its employees and well being
good,Stressful place to work but great supervisors and co-workers Hours were great and the location at stoneoak was convenient. On location cafeteria and walking trail around the 3 building complex.
good,"JPMorganChase is a very successful company that offers numerous benefits to employees and share holders   Although successful, opportunities exist to improve the culture."
good,Company was it was good to work at chase and very cooperative team to work with . project was not that stressfull to work on and very nice team in chase bank.
good,"The risk associated with working for a bank, at the time, come from economic governing, and financial hurdles that account for job stability. Merges can cause lay-off; but, also account for new job opportunities."
good,It was a nice work environment however they move you from place to place constantly. Typical day at work come in get computer up and running and start assisting customers
good,Managers dont micro manage. You learn alot! Great training. Work place culture is competitive depending on which branch you work at. Hardest thing is finding time to make calls and he help clients
good,The company was good to work for overall.  Salary and benefits were great.  The only downfall is that your just a number and it is hard to advance in positions.
good,There aren't many advancement opportunities. The work life balance is not worth the salary that they give. They do a good job at making it appear to promote but don't in reality.
good,"I love talking to different customers every day. It is a sales job so you have to focus on your sales goals. If you don't meet the minimum, you are in trouble with management."
good,"Long draining Work days 830-6-30 M-F and 830-230 Sat"
good,I received so much training and loved my job.  Unfortunately there was so much re-structuring internally my manager changed 3 times in 2 and half years.  Little unsettling.
good,"De fato é umas das melhores empresas que eu trabalhei,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are helping a customer. Because the job is analytical, you learn that every application will be viewed differently."
good,"This is a great place to work, but be aware that there are extensive channels and procedures for the simplest tasks.  Everything is done by committee.  Extensive meetings are commonplace and rarely conducted in person (often via conference call).  Much time is spent on preparing presentations to deliver to other employees within the company."
good,"During the time I worked at Chase, it was a learning experiwnce for me. Supervisors and co workers very helpful. They gave a lot of encentives to employees o make our jobs enjoyable."
good,A company with content changes. Test Adaptability at highest. Good Working environment and follow best practices. Growth orient outlook of the bank helps find lot of opportunities.
good,Life at Chase is very fast paced and ever changing.  Chase is so big that it has a hard time of focusing on employee engagement.  There are several departments in one building and each one is doing something different.
good,"Opening the bank can be extremely stressful as you have to be aware of your surrounding, you also do not want to put your tellers in harms way.  once inside it becomes pretty basic as you want to initiate conversation with all customers to see if you can interest them in upgrading their account or bringing substantial new money in.  The hardest part of this position is the pressure they put on employees for new accounts as they work on a point system. Most older adults are comfortable with their routine and you don't want to confuse them in any way."
good,"It was okay, the job security was there and I couldn't complain. Management was kinda off, hard time staying in their own lane. But the company overall was great."
good,"Typical day starts around 10am - you start on the phone, you get screamed and cursed at all day by disgruntled customers.  You get two fifteen minute breaks - definitely not enough to recover from the lack of job satisfaction. Lunch is one hour long, by the time you get to lunch (after 2 pm), the cafeteria is closed so you always need to bring your lunch.  You have to be back on the phone before your hour lunch is up, to get screamed at for the remaining four hours.  By the time you leave work it is dark out... I hope you have no plans because everything is closed so you can't get anything done.  The lack of job satisfaction and the lack of having a work/life balance is certainly not enjoyable.  This is definitely a job - not a career.  They expect you to be on the phones 2-7 years before you can move into a position that does not require consistent phone activity.  This is perfect for someone who is looking to get paid decent until they can find something better."
good,Always afraid of layoffs I made it thru 7 layoffs at this job and one at the other position.   Should have job placement instead of layoffs   would save company money.
good,"This particular location was busier then some of the other locations because of location, and had some of the more unpredictable customer base which made it interesting but also hard to accommodate for.  All in all Chase has great benefits and career opportunities, but I feel like tellers are being given less and less hours unless you want to be a lead teller or operations manager."
good,based on corporate policies it is very stressful work place. work and life balance is very difficult to maintain based on experience.no other comments
good,Good Place to work with. Low on Salary though. Few Saturdays are working. Dress Code for all the employees. Need to improve on salaries a lot and look for more profiles to work on.
good,"A very well-compensated position for individuals who are dedicated to their work and motivated to grow in a corporate culture."
good,"Customer calls can be stressful. Rigid expectations to meet. Inability to walk away as needed because of time adherence requirements. People are moved frequently to various work units-- no team coherence as units, but a sense of belonging to the larger team evolves. Relocating customer services specialists from Polaris to Westerville was detrimental. Polaris architecture softened the stress impact from the job. In contrast, Westerville building's architecture lacks the restorative gardens, water features, natural views outside windows, amenities... Coming and going from Westerville's back parking lot was a very long walk down a concrete block corridor looking at a concrete block wall at the end. It was a reminder of my job at Chase --  I long boring haul and I'm heading straight to a solid black wall. Nothing to draw attract one to move forward. Westerville windows looked out over parking lots and other brick walls. The move from Polaris to Westerville reminded me of the lack of concern Chase has for Customer Service Specialists. It is a point of entry, networking is vital for job movement (it's all about who you know)."
good,"the job is competitive and enjoyable. the auto collections side of chase is fantastic place to be to get experience, and I would recommend. friendly workers, but a lot of issues that are still being worked out"
good,"The pay, and overall benefits are great. The downside was being made to feel lazy if you stopped working before 6pm or came in to the office after 9:15am."
good,The management is vey good they help us to create the Goals and objectives and we have quarterly review meeting with manager. We have been given opportunity to lead the projects and participate in the sports committee.
good,Great Benefits!!! A lot of responsibilities. Base pay can be good if you already have customer experience. Get Licensed to maximize pay!! Staff are great people.
good,"- ""Do things right the first time."""
good,Taking phone calls all day but I've learned how to have patience. Don't take every call personal they are just customers who wants a answer to a problem.
good,"Most days I feel like I'm chained to my desk and unable to leave even for lunch. Most of the people on the team eat lunch at their desks while working. There is a lot of freedom as far as not having management look over your shoulder constantly, but it is a stressful work environment. We get on average 250 emails a day from clients and back office staff. We work with Financial Advisors, Bankers, clients and back office through the application process. There is a lot of disconnect between back office and our team so it's like treading water when working with them and a lot of babysitting to ensure the applications move along. The most enjoyable part of my job is my teammates."
good,"JP is definitely a good place to work. What matters is the process that you will join , the process i worked for is good but the management is becoming bad , also its becoming more like a BPO where there is rotational shifts and off's. "
good,Great experience with management. Poor experience with compensation and feeling recognized for my efforts. Great work life balance. Great job security.
good,"Generous pay and paid vacation but you have to work hard for your salary. They seek active employment diversity and are always  opening up opportunities for protected groups, but employment diversification can be more robust."
good,"Good Place to work, Great Work Culture, Dynamic environment, Excellent pay master. Challenging technological advancement and growth oriented. Bureaucratic"
good,"•	Number one Private Client Banker in district (#3 in Southeast market) for select group of Chase’s affluent clients ($.5M and up on deposit); "
good,I was responsible for measurement and improvement of quality of process delivery. My responsibility involved critical analysis of processes to bring improvement in efficiency and assist in reduction of cost.
good,"-On the phone all day dealing with rude people while listening to their problems"
good,I love my work schedule. The issue is no consistency with required goals to meet performance reviews. Like any other work environment it also depends on the type of manager on has. New managers are not trained very well if at all once they are placed in there new position. But overall its a good company.
good,Chase is a decent place to work starting out. They have great benefits and good people working there. You will definitely make friends right away.  The job is satisfying and the pay is decent. If you want to move up in the company don't hold your breath. They generally seem to hire people outside the company over people from within for higher positions.
good,Typical day is reaching out to clients via phone. Extensive client interaction handled with utmost care as to keep privacy. You learn several different approaches from platform to operations. coworkers rely on team work to succeed and achieve goals. Hardest part of the job is updating collateral as to stay in compliance with updated products. Most enjoyable part of this job is helping people achieve their goals and finding a middle ground to connect with them.
good,Passing down crucial job information seems difficult for lower level management. Teams are very disorganized and unaware of goals each employee is working toward; explanations seem like it's difficult to receive at all levels. Poor passing of delegation and missions... in awareness via management and disorganized with missions and employee placement.
good,"In my opinion, JPMorganChase as a company is rather impressive because they created a streamline presentation across all banking products and services while adapting to a client tier system that delivered greater service offerings for higher balance clients and most importantly, the staff from teller to banker were coached and groomed to sell the brand to get clients to the maximum tier.   It's a brilliant and well executed process that accelerates household asset capture.   However, as the title hints at, JPMorganChase does have an undesirable high turnover rate because there is minimal emphasis placed on maintaining employees for long-term.  I feel the turn-over does create resistance for clients' to entrust their wealth when the faces change regularly."
good,I did basic teller transactions everyday. It's a great part-time job. I loved my coworkers but the job just got boring and repetitive. I thought I was going to get promoted after I graduated but sadly did not.
good,in general i have really enjoyed working for the organisation and only a few things frustrate me about working there.  most notably the wage and career progression
good,I enjoy the people I work with and feel challenged day to day with the changing work environment and tasks I must complete. The downsides to working at Chase is the compensation and the lack of career planning initiatives.
good,"I love working here and I have learned so much during these past five years. They gave out a lot of opportunities for advancement. Only problem is the management. but other than that, I absolutely love it."
good,"When you are offered a position that is higher on the pay grade and more responsibilities, you are told you will make a lateral move and not get a pay raise.  You are then told they will review your promotion and salary increase at year end, only you don't get compensated enough at year end."
good,Typical work day involves producing minimum of three case. Learned how to drafts SARs Management was OK but focused mostly on number of cases completed. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of job was first couple of weed learning job
good,Nice place to work with good work/life balance depending on your department. The benefits are great as well. I love working for the company but sometimes management makes it difficult.
good,9 to 5 job opening and closing bank accounts for customers.  Unfortunately Chase is big on selling/opening products rather than looking at the customer's needs.  Every month you start over (you're only good as your last sale)
good,"The lines of business operating here include the Corporate and Investment Bank and Private Banking relationship management, which facilitates access to a global team of dedicated specialists. The Abu Dhabi office conducts business in the UAE by providing consultation services and by acting as a liaison with the J.P. Morgan offices abroad."
good,"Can be very busy, constantly in contact with customer. Lots of interactions bad and good. You learn great communication skills and also learn how to play by the rules. Very good company to grow personal knowledge about financial products, regulations, and procedures on how a branch runs. Lots of job positions available. Must be willing to sell by phone and seek out new business through electronic communication. Must be willing to sell, sell, sell."
good,"I love the comradarie at Chase. Upper management has room for improvement. I enjoyed my four year at JP Morgan Chase, up until they laid me off."
good,"Good company to work in , the only drawback is the salary increment is not really good.Work life balance is good. Good facility of food and transport."
good,I had an awesome manager. The department supervisor was not as informed or pleasant though. The job was stressful at times but I did enjoy my peers and made life long friends. The pay was amazing but sometimes I did feel I had more responsibilities than the average employee without extra compensation.
good,Fun place to work. Great hours and the staff is amazing. Vacation and pay is great and they work with your schedule. I would recommend any one who is looking to gain the best experience in todays banking system.
good,"The Middle Office in the IB is a good place to start out and learn about Sales & Trading.  However, the learning opportunities will plateau quickly and there isn't much opportunity for career advancement."
good,"You gotta be about the dollar to make it here. Family may get shuffled to the side, so its can be a challenge to find a good balance."
good,"Paid good for easy work. Management will find reasons to write you up. easy to move up if you can maintain a good scorecard. take calls for balance transfers, opening accounts, debit cards replacement etc"

good,The typical day involves meeting with development team in an Agile like environment.  Development is collaborative and the dev team is experienced.  Management is a little transient at times and the objectives change frequently.
good,"This is such a collegiate environment.  JPMorgan Chase is progressive, in the sense that it fosters remote / flexible schedules.  The teams share and nurture a cross-discipline sharing of data, which allows continued learning and a greater knowledge of one's own subject matter expertise, in addition to ancillary industries."
good,A typical day of work consists of opening the bank with one other co worker. We make sure the bank is open on time for the customers and follow the opening procedures. Over my 3 years of working with the company I have learned a lot from my managers. I am now comfortable with replenishing the ATM with no assistance. The hardest part  of the job is not having enough help behind the teller line when the bank gets busy.
good,"I made excellent money and received great benefits while working at Chase. Too bad those are the only good things I can say about this job. There is no wiggle room with anything at this company. It's by the book all the time with no room for your personality or really to get to know your co-workers. You can advance far at this company, but in the end, you're just a number."
good,"Dealing with a diversity type of clients on a daily basis."
good,It is a good company to for full time employee but not good for contractors
good,"As a full time student, I am offered a lot of services when it comes to my school and work balance. they are very accommodating."

good,"Working for JPMorgan Chase was nice when I was hired, but the cutbacks are making it entirely too stressful and frustrating."
good,"A typical day at Chase is very productive.  I've learned a lot of excellent customer service skills and so many things about the banking industry and its policies.  Management is just OK, definitely not the greatest.  My coworkers were always great hard-working people.  The hardest part of the job is the long hours.  There is  no time for a personal life because of the extended hours and amount of time it takes to travel to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,I have gained a lot of things of being working in a MNC especially dealing with HNI clients & their servicing.
good,"Great place to work for in terms of advancement and other company benefits but it drains time from personal matters. Chase does not work around you, you have to work around them"
good,"Typical day at chase bank consist of me login  into my computer in my cubicle, process inbound calls of client delinquent credit card accounts, inform clients that they are at risk of credit being damage and coming up with solutions base of clients hardship or reason for not making payment on time. By offering either program or making a payment over the phone free of charge."
good,"A typical day at work coming in going over the work to see what we have, I learned more skill in this deptament with this management. My co-workers were wonderful people to work with, the hardest of my job is not being on time for work. working with to people in my deptament."
good,"Great health benefits, and great pay if you're a banker a great sales person."
good,The Management has changed over the years and make an employee uncomfortable with their job. I have learned a lot from the company on how to better my skills in customer service.
good,Get to engage with customers on a daily basis. Good environment to be with and co-workers are really helpful.
good,"Each day is often busy and demanding, though rewarding. As much as the role is unchangeable the challenges are varied and interesting, each day brings different challenge so no day is the same."
good,"productive and fun to work."
good,"not stable, lots lay offs and poor management acumen throughout"
good,"When I worked for JP Morgan Chase I was just starting out from school.  I got lucky to have been selected for this job.  I would count a lot of cash on a daily basis.  I was in the Vault, not only would I count cash coming in for customers but i would also fill outgoing orders.  with that I would debit and credit accounts.  I quickly went from a teller to a utility teller.  Being a utility teller I was in charge of verifying other tellers' cash when they were out of balance.  Within a couple years after that I became a Unit lead.  A Unit lead would help out where ever needed, with opening and closing procedures, putting together vault transaction that would be going out to customers, verifying coin deposits that would come in.  Also working on tickets that were out of balance due to human error or deposit ticket error.  Management was good at giving people that worked hard and if there was an opportunity for advancement they would offer it to them.  The hardest part of this job was that we worked with no windows and sometimes you just need to look out and see a great view every once in a while."
good,High stress and high reward. You get out what you put in. If you put in the effort you should be able to do receive decent commission. You work hard to compensate for the small salary. A lot of phone calls and micromanagement. I made more commission than my salary if that gives you a good idea.
good,"Management wasn't what I expected, not very clear or professional, but laid back atmosphere was a nice bonus and very little quota or number tracking. Good mix of backgrounds on the team and plenty to do. Training could be longer but it was enough."
good,"Depending on the type of management team that you are used to, my management team was great. Everyone got along with everyone. Great team tow work with from tellers, to the partners (mortgage officer, relationship manager, financial adviser) to management."
good,"Chase was great in the beginning. The hours were good when I first started working at Chase. The main issue was that our job happen to change about 5 different times. We as a group of 24 staff members in my group, all in collections of past due credit card accounts. After working that department for about 7 months they ending up closing the department and had us all retrain in a different Department. That new department lasted about 4 month and, moved us into yet a different department after again retraining in that new department. This went on time ,after time, still moving us to different departments. The staff in our areas kept changing. We always seem to have so many different area managers because the turn around was too fast. The main issue was that we had too many Chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,"My time at JPMorgan Chase was beneficial. It gave me the opportunity to learn more about processing loan documents, thus adding to my skills. I have no complaints about coworkers or manangement, all was fine. I went in did my job and went home and school (was finishing up my grad program)."
good,A typical day would be servicing customers with deposit holds.  I have learned customer first. Management.... I love my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve a customers issue due to having to follow policy's that have recently changed contradicting what I was taught about customer first. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have one and hearing the joy of a customer/banker when i am able to resolve an issue after they have made multiple attempts with no success.
good,I was a tempt and had not work there long enough to have a solid review. My direct manager was very efficient and took me under her wing.
good,"Solid place to work, with pretty good compensation, flexible "
good,"A typical work day consisted of performing duties that various attorneys around the country have requested."
good,"They have great health care , dental , vision . Good benefits . "
good,Chase was a great place to work for but due to the systems crashing made it hard for you due to the high volume of loans that would be dropped on your plate
good,"come in, set up work station, sign on computer.Learned how to assist customers in a friendly and accurate manner. management was fair and dedicated. Got along well with all of the staff. The hard part was making sure what you did was accurate.And I totally love assisting customers."
good,Chase is a nice place to work. The people are easy to get along with and willing to help.
good,Every day was a new experience and opportunity for me. I've enjoyed my time with JP Morgan Chase and working around a good enviroment with others.
good,Typical day on the phones in a call center can get a little stressfull but there was alot of help if needed.
good,"The culture is great! I am been working for Chase as a teller for two years, and I've received nothing but a great experience. The managerial staff is friendly and willing to help you further your career. If you are willing to work and provide a great experience to customers, you can gain responsibilities. Chase is great about promoting from within, only if you can impress your district manager, they can provide career mobility for you."
good,It is a busy and challenging job.
good,I joined the firm as a modification supervisor for a special project that was to last 6 to 9 months. We were promised to be placed somewhere after the project is over but we have not gotten any guidance on placement. The project ran longer and still no help with placement. I love working here because of the training that they give you as well as the knowledge that can be learned. I am a little disappointed that they have not helped with job placement as of yet.
good,•Ability to analyze multiple sources of information to determine best course of action.
good,Excellent company the mangement I have encountered have been a joy to work with. Benefits are good.
good,"Application level access assignment based on approvals,"
good,"Chase is a huge company. Working directly with them, meaning, if you need something from HR for example...they're great."
good,"Extra busy about two times a month, My co-workers were the best, and I even had pretty great managers before they moved on, If you are not into selling this is not the job for you, they have selling goals they must meet, even if you have no customers, and sometimes even if the customer doesnt need it."
good,"A typical day is a fairly long day, dealing with juggling existing customer issues, new accounts, incoming phone calls, and making follow up phone calls. I have learned a great deal about customer service and interfacing with diverse clientele. Also I learned a lot about the financial industry. I worked well with my management and coworkers; it is a team environment. The hardest part of the job is being inside one place at a desk all day. The most enjoyable part is solving a customer's problems and helping them with their finances."
good,Oversee a full spectrum of business migration projects. Worked with overseas business controllers with their business expansion needs. The challenges of the position made the job very enjoyable. The team I worked with are very professional and dedicated. The hardest part of the job is the environment constraint in getting projects completed on Schedule. The most enjoyable part is the team work exhibited by my colleagues.
good,"A typical day at work entailed me coming to work, sitting at my computer and begin developing my SQL queries. In the morning we would have our team meeting with our off-shore developers. Then later in the day we had a meeting with the business users of the project to make sure that our deliverables met their needs. From there i would stay in constant communication with both the offshore team and the business team. I learned that constant communication between all teams is very important in order to successfully attain the goals your team as a whole wants."
good,"As an Operations Unit Manager, I am responsible for planning, organizing and overseeing the day-to-day activities of various units within the Workforce Management team. I develop, recommend and implement specific procedures and operational guidelines to ensure maximum effectiveness and efficiency of services; coordinate with Lines of Business managers to ensure we provide outstanding, ""best in class"" customer service."
good,I got along well with co-workers and management. Running hi-speed mail sorting machines was challenging but fun. I enjoyed going to work.
good,"The company itself was great, but the temporary assignment too short."
good,Very hard to move up in company. Seems they would rather hire an outside person over an internal employee.
good,"In order to meet deadlines, the work was fast paced and close attention to details had to be paid. The work place was open,and allowed plenty of room for movement.Thus, the job could be completed in a timely and comfortable manner."
good,"The job pays well and the benefits are good. The call volume is extremely heavy, and you take about over 2000 calls a month. The job can become very stressful but they help you with techniques to deal with the stress. I would recommend this job to others"
good,When the office closes in the downtown tower I thought they could’ve done a better job and finding the employees a position with in the company  but I did enjoy my time there wish I could’ve remained there met a lot of great friends
good,"8 hour shift, high call volumes, quality review on calls and polices and procedures. Diverse workplace. The hardest part was maintaining the goal for handle time on calls."
good,"High paced environment. Very stressful ,do too how much security you must have as a teller. Multi tasking is required daily. Fun co workers. Be prepared to be standing long periods of time. You have a lot of stress because of the responsibility of customers assets. Details are very important. Greeting everyone the same with a polite and cheery tone. Remember customers name and details. Always go a step more. Make customers feel at home and comfortable. It has great benefits. It's still has a lot to develop as a company. Great place if seeking growth in knowledge. Great place if you want to move up in a company. It has a good path for people to develop their talents. They help you out a lot in there training program although the online training could be better. It all depends what branch you train on. There some branches that have enough time to train you and dedication."
good,Nice co-workers and laid back work environment for the most part. Slow software development due to bureaucracy and only having quarterly releases. Good compensation for the amount of work that you need to do to keep your job.
good,Chase is a good company to work for however the room for movement is non existent in some areas. Also they don't seem to value current employees and would rather outside hire. Pay is not consistent with cost of living.
good,Working for JPMorgan Chase was challenging and stressful at times.Primarily because the goals changed mid year or the policy and procedure changed each quarter.I did however had fun working there because they made it competitive and promoted a great employee experience.
good,"I didn't really like the internship format, I understand that there was security risks, but I work on a stand alone project that I doubt that people continued to use after I left."
good,"This was a great place to work. Our team supported the entire firm. The thing I enjoyed most was that I would learn something new every day. The hardest part of the job, the work was endless."
good,Chase is a good retail bank but very long hours and only 30min lunch breaks. Which is horrible being that we were there from 8:30am to 6:30pm. There were relationships that managers had with employees that got in the way of work. The incentive changes so you work more for less pay every year and they do not give raises!!!!
good,Chase is a great place to work if you do not have many financial responsibilities and are looking for a fixed schedule. They usually give you what your  schedule will be a month in advance.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for JP Morgan Chase were the benefits. Amazing medical, dental, the whole package was very nice. They defiantly know how to take care of their employees!"
good,"Once you develop an understanding of the full breadth of J.P. Morgan products and services they offer work becomes an enjoyable part of learning, while you're earning money along the way."
good,My day consisted of cold calling current and potential clients to drive  my business goals. Often times we were required to assist bank clients needing other products and services. This would allow me to make another contact to develop business
good,"this company has been great to me ,, im seeking growth and unfortunately chase is limited to growth and advancement is very difficult and non existent"
good,Very demanding but interesting job.  Teamwork is emphasized and management has an open door policy.  Juggling work responsibilities with personal life can be challenging
good,Wonderful benefits were provided for this role when it comes to PTO and other general benefits. They truly go above and beyond in this realm of assistance.
good,very nice state of the art facility to work a lot of work each call is about 45 minutes long. You will take about 80  to 100 calls daily. No food places in area so bring food.
good,"Oversee the Post Closing Operations.  Strategically improve the overall operations, implement new processes, capacity planning, trending, offshoring, and efficiency gains."
good,"The people I met at JP Morgan Chase were all outstanding. However, the lack of communication or attention to career progression for myself was a big let down for me and made me feel unimportant."
good,"on the most part Chase is company that pays well, the stress level don't have any words to say how bad it is, the processes are not people friendly. n"
good,Chase provides great benefits and pay. There are not enough advancement opportunities in Springfield. A major downside is being tethered to a desk and having every minute tracked.. The stats you are expected to meet are not realistic most of the time. Leadership is great.
good,"busy work day"
good,Alot of turnover in the company. The management needs better training. Many managers overrated bullys. They treat you like a parent instead of a boss.
good,"hours of operations: 6-3, 7-4, 8-5, 9-6"
good,"Typically to spoke with people about their retirement benefit"
good,"No room for upward movement, so ensure you are applying for a well seasoned position. The Private Bank has new procedures forming on a weekly basis. The clients are usually dissatisfied."
good,collecting and resolving customer issues empathy and problem resolution. I learned to help customers resolve their financial issues.Management was ok. Needed to be less micro managed. The hardest part was customers not answering their phones for resolution. Resolving customers problems and resolution was thr most enjoyable part.
good,"Pros"
good,I  really enjoyed my time working at Chase. It was a good company with good benefits. hardest part of the job was the long hours standing up and late hours.
good,"I love my job ,but they are cutting hour's to 20 and i need more than 20hrs a week. Love working with the employees and with my daily customers love them."
good,"Chase provides a good environment , its a fun place to work at times. the job is very repetitive and the advancing  in the company is not as fast as I would like. the work can easily stress out anybody, and the management can be a little unprofessional at times but overall its a nice place to work."
good,"Working here definitely increase my awareness of details and concentration of what i'm looking at. Cool and chill employees management is awesome they actually care about you, no benefits besides air conditioning. Not a career job but to get you by in the mean time."
good,"Initially I loved my experience in the Fraud Dept, however once management changed and our responsibilities started changing and they started adding additional job duties (things that branch employees were initially doing like running credit apps for customers to get approved for accounts & determining the type they qualified for if approved etc... and more customer service focused versus fraud/risk focused) but failed to increase our salary."
good,Would not stay at JPM forever but a good internship to start my career at. If your looking for stability stay here. If you want to learn and grow and be challenged go somewhere else.
good,"Job follows retail hours, slow at times and then hectic and fast paced at others. Same issues you would face in a retail store you will find here. But it is a relatively professional environment. Main issue is that compensation changes every year and it seldom will get better."
good,my job started with washington meutal  and they were purchased by j p morgan. chase. They were a very busy company with mortgages. Months of extreme overtime. Pay was good with the overtime.
good,"working with J.P. Morgan was a great learning in a short stint. New people, various cultures, New team. The management was always at your disposal, should you need any assistance. It helped me strengthen my confidence, perseverance, my moral. At times it would be a challenge to live upto the enthusiasm level of the new joiners."
good,"Ce rôle exigeait:"
good,Working in JP Morgan helped me enjoy a diversity of culture and people that I would not have the ability to have met anywhere else. I enjoyed my time there.
good,It's an office job so it has some of the expected bureaucratic ills you would expect but the work culture is healthy and inclusive. They have two cafe's and a Starbucks in the complex I work at and they have provided me plenty of opportunity to try out new roles and improved compensation.
good,The U/W dept was not the best place to work.   Very high turnover due to lack in management skills and STRESS and always putting pressure on the employees.
good,Chase Paymentech is a wonderful opportunity to begin your career with Chase. They encourage promoting within and are eager to assist employees in mapping out their career path.
good,It's great to work at JP Morgan Chase as they always offer different kinds of training for career development. The benefits are competitive and the facilities are world class. The hardest part of the job is logistics because of heavy traffic but what enjoyed the most is when I need to attend different kinds of training/seminars as it help me build my character to fit in a corporate culture.
good,Working as a teller doesn't require much preparation in a day. Most of the work takes place when you're getting dressed for the shift. Most customers come unprepared so you really have to exercise patience in a day to ensure each customer can leave feeling warm and cozy. The team working with you are really the only people who regularly treat you with respect and understanding. The work you do as a teller isn't hard and most transactions just require you being decent at copying down numbers and keeping tasks in order. The hardest part of teller work is educating customers on bank policies which change frequently to stay current with today's technological advancements and preventing fraud. The opportunities for advancement are dictated by availability and seniority.
good,"This company was very strict with lunches and breaks, they also micro-managed their employees. They had a review system that was very strict. They did cross train and helped employee with personal development plans for your career. They did have a good bonus structure."
good,This was a good starting point for a new person in the industry. A lot of young people just beginning in the finance world. A lot of people towards the end of there career to learn from.
good,"Consistently busy as a banker/teller.  Helped walk-in customers and made appointments.  Branches in more affluent neighborhoods are more appropriately staffed; lower income locations struggled to meet customer demands resulting in numerous complaints. "
good,Great experience and asset to my skill trade to further my career exceptional environment the people I worked with were very awesome meet some wonderful people
good,"It was a small company and everyone knew each other. It was more like a family. We went by the term 'Work hard party harder'. I managed all modes of communication which was phones, chats and emails. Our managers were very co-opertive and motivating. We had pull off extra hours but it was all a part of the learning."
good,"Love my job. Great coworkers.  Learn every part of mortgage business working with Chase.  Wish it offer SQL classes , so I could further my mortgage knowledge."
good,During my tenure at Chase I have consistently received above average reviews however my annual compensation has not been inline with such reviews.  I have even been promoted and my salary did not change.  Chase has a great name but it is nearly impossible to remain there at current salary.  The health benefits however are top rated but do not make up for the difference in pay compared to the average for that position
good,"Chase offers many ways to grow within the company, but it does take a long time and sometimes you are given extra responsibilities with no extra pay.  The company almost always seems to be understaffed."
good,"Used to be a fun place to work, Chase claims department is all about the numbers 1st and assisting the customer with their issues 2nd."
good,"I would recommend chase to a friend as an employer and a customer. I believe Chase is truly a great place to work and a bank I'm comfortable doing business with."
good,"The job was pretty nice, management okay and helpful - just not always very competent. The pay and benefits are awesome!"
good,"good place to work at as a banker, dont expect a raise even if you exceed expectations on your review, Ive been a banker for 4 yrs and have gotten a high meets twice and an exceeds once but never got a raise in those 3 years. Benefits are good great 401k plan but dont think your hard work will be appreciated."
good,A standard workday may consist of plenty of great moments with co-workers and customers. One may walk away feeling quite satisfied with their choice.
good,"A good place to work your way up, especially if you start as a teller.   You can reach all the way up to a branch manager.  A lot of networking events you can attend if you want to grow your brand.  If you are not interested in retail there are other lines of businesses you can tap into."
good,"Highly visible leadership role within the JPM US Product Development and Platform Management group responsible for the evaluation and determination of the Funds’ accounting policies in connection with new accounting pronouncements, tax matters, new fund launches, new instrument approvals and other accounting related issues that arise from oversight of fund financial statement reporting cycles (200 plus mutual funds, commingled funds and hedge funds)."
good,Nice company to work for ....love working for this company.
good,"Loved working in there"
good,"Enjoyed working at Chase"
good,"The most exciting part of my job is helping customers, I found great fulfillment in that."
good,Big company with a lot of room for advancement. Can be very stressful. Constant pay cuts. Great management and co workers
good,It was a great atmosphere to work. The co-workers were great people and the customers were pleasant but management would put a lot of pressure to make sales.
good,I would make outbound calls to members in a effort to collect a payment on past due accounts.
good,The day at my work place is good & fun to be with. Still i feel after spending 5 plus years i am not getting much to learn about product. Management is supportive & co-workers are good. In terms of learning i feel it has became stagnant & i want to explore new things.
good,"My typical day was to update borrowers on staus of loan, review loan package, title , credit report, request payoff's. Daily submission of loans to underwriting and closing dept."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working with numerous people. There was hardly any privacy because we did not have cubicles; essentially we worked in an open space. I did however, enjoy gaining all the experience loan administration. I learned global loans and commercial loans."
good,Jp Morgan chase give you the pieces to the tools and tell you to figure out how to put them together and how to use them effectively. it is steep learning curve.
good,"Great Culture of advancement in company, clear distinction between JP Morgan and Chase."
good,Underwriting of mortgage loans and evaluate customers income. Management was not involved at all in the daily tasks of employees. Most supervisors did not know the job functions of guidelines to which their employees worked on.
good,"I enjoyed working at Chase but there was unecessary stress. I would change a few things, if i were able."
good,I was able to learn how to work on large projects. The best part was working with employees in different states.
good,I started to help resolve client issues. After our initial training we were told the process was changing and it was more of a call center and we would take on overflow for Customer Service. I learned the credit rules and regulations and Visa/Master Card standards. But I wasn't what I wanted to do.
good,always had good typical days at work. I also learned in and out on how to become a better working person in the a fast pace environment
good,"A typical work day involves sitting on a computer, initial review of work, breaks, rare visiting with coworkers. I learn something new every day. Anywhere from a new kind of fee, or new places in a state. Management is usually very pleasant as well as most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is making sure you've done everything right, that you have no typos and have followed procedures and dotted your i's and crossed your t's"
good,"Plenty of opportunities to advance given you work hard, and have good work ethic. Opportunities to get licensed and move up in your career. Bad thing is like any other retail position you are pressured to deliver in numbers and also now they are pushing the ""osat scores"" which is a new survey on overall customer satisfaction. basically if your branch is not rated a 9 or 10 you get a 0 which isnt fair. your then up against other branches in the district. if your not getting good scores your manager and district manager bite your head off and make you go through torture staying late in meetings or coming extra early on why your not getting 9 or 10s! the incentive changes every year and gets less and less. the ceo is a nice guy but is young and one day this is the law and then next day that is totally wrong and you have to do it this way! My advice to management is think about your employees appreciate them and put yourself in their shoes. not every client rates you a 10 and that is random and out of our control. you cannot please everyone no matter how nice you are not every one thinks your outstanding especially if every other branch they walk into is doing the same thing how can you stand out? allow us to get our score as the customer rates us and do not take your employees incentives away they rely on that to feed their families."
good,This company cross train employees to become more efficient in their job duties. Management doors are always open.
good,Bad place if you are looking for more money. chase promotes without compensation but has a wonderful culture and value structure.
good,great company but the pressure for sales are stressful. customers aren't put first although they appear to say that
good,Work Pressure is high in this Organisation. Of course this may be the reason to be a Market Leader for JP Morgan.
good,Daily I work with business customers to manage the financial aspect of the business with Chase financial tools. I generally meet with 3 pre-set appointments per day and then about 15 people that might walk in with questions about their personal/business accounts. I primarily focus on relationship building with thorough customer service with the promotion of fee-based services that Chase has to offer. I am a liason between business banking and branch employees. Keeping the staff aware of recent changes and policy updates. I help my clients' make financial decsions based off of their current needs. I constantly get unsolicited referrals from prospects. I am aware of bank government policies.
good,Working here has taught me a lot and provided me with rich experience.
good,Good place to work - they squeeze every last drop of work out of you.
good,Chase has a very diversity work staff and I always felt I could speak up with out being judged however compared to other companies the pay is very low.
good,"This was a great job to work at while I was in college, the hours are very flexible. It’s a a great jumping off point into the professional atmosphere I wanted to eventually attain."
good,Working in an operations role in JP Morgan Asset and Wealth management provides an excellent work life balance but offers few prospects for career advancement within other areas of the company.
good,"Was a nice work environment with friendly staff and extensive training program. I really enjoyed my time working there, and felt it was a valuable experience for all future opportunities.  Great benefits."
good,Overall a good company but company dont Acknowledge and medical issues employees have that work for the company and i was not satisfied with that at all
good,"incoming and outgoing calls. Handle any fraud on customers account"
good,working at Chase is fast paced and each day is a different day. It can be stressful but you have to make the best of it. The benefits are outstanding if I had my current pay and JPMorgan benefits i'd be set.
good,"great place to work, just no job security. the job currently put its employees at risk of having to find other jobs. The management was nice but a little lost at time o what to do with the employees"
good,Great work environment. Management was very receptive to employee request and made it their mission to accommodate the work life balance of the employees.
good,I enjoyed my duties at JP Morgan. Auditing was always a challenge in a good way. I liked dealing with investors and other entities we had to audit. The moral was good.
good,"Maintained the day to day business to adhere to the set procedures"
good,"Cons"
good,It was great experience to work as a family with your managers and co-workers. Love helping co-works/managers/customers to my best ability. The stressful part was procedures and policies changed about every week and it was a struggle for me to keep up on the window they gave us to not get dinged for the adjustments.
good,It was my first position in the within the company. I learned a lot about customer service and providing customer with information about their accounts.
good,"Work here is very stressful, your day consists of back to back calls. "
good,"Nice secure job....just need more hours.....fast paced....sometimes stressful.....great customer service experience...I love the Banking world and I love the job, all I need is more hours."
good,"Quotas required, very stressful, goals are too high and difficult to meet which causes stress. Management, job culture compensation, work life balance is good."
good,The cooperation is a great company to work for. I'd recommended JPMorgan Chase bank to anyone to work. The reason I left is available up on request at interview.
good,I worked at a call center and it was torture. I had a hard time working 8-10 hour shifts sitting in one spot all day. The only time I enjoyed my job was when I was able to help and train New Hires and when I got my paycheck. it is great pay with fantastic benefits however it takes a special person to be able to sit in one place for an extended amount of time.
good,"The employees here are great, but the work itself required very long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing clients and doing analytical work."
good,Working at chase was a great experience I really enjoyed the employees that I worked with.This job is hands on one of the best companies to work for and with.
good,"No loyalty to employees.  Quite a number of employees were laid off because of mergers over the years.  During the last massive round of layoffs, individuals in mid-management roles who had been with the company for 15 - 30 years were laid off.  It is very difficult for individuals with that amount of experience to find replacement roles, either because of age or because they are over qualified.  The firm should have offered options - such as a freeze on salaries, lower bonuses, even a 1-to-3% cut in salaries at the VP and above levels.  I think that individuals would be willing to take a reduction in compensation in order to preserve their jobs.  Sometimes M&A isn't always a good thing."
good,"The job isn't very engaging. Just phone calls all day dealing with angry people concerned about their accounts. My review may be biased because I hate customer service jobs. Management was nice, though. They give their employees a chance to succeed. Very strict attendance policy during first 90 days. Pretty good benefits and training program."
good,"Its been 9 months and I'm still working here, there are a lot of avenues if you are interested in getting into Job that specializes in Finance and Banking"
good,"This job was very stressful at times, but I felt I was greatly appreciated with my performance and attitude toward the work place.  There was often a substantial amount of overtime which was required to meet our daily task. The toughest part of my duties was handling the phone with persistent adherence.  My experience with inbound calls included contacting each borrower within a 3 day time frame which was very challenging.  At times I felt like I had failed in the timely process in helping the borrower.  I definitely enjoyed helping the homeowners with their loan modification paper work."
good,"I reviewed the branches dashboard every morning, made sure the branch would run efficiently with staff, money, and supplies . I learned how to multitask while assisting several customers at one time and still make sure everyone was satisfied with their experience in the branch. I loved my manger, he cared about each employee as if we were family. My co-workers were all team players . They were easy to manage . The hardest part of the job was different policy changes. They made changes monthly. Also to develop in a new role."
good,"When i worked for R Fleming are day was none stop it was the time the city of London boom the day flew by. There were twenty two of us,this is where I learnt all about messenger work internal and external.We were trusted with dealing with large amounts of valuable items ,most of us worked together for twenty years,we all socialised together after work,weekends with are families.management was very good. It changed when we were taken over there work ethic was totally different. Even though we had gone from dealing with six thousand people to ten thousand they wanted us to do less work and the job became not enjoyable we were quite pleased when they offered redundancy with pension."
good,I would recommend this employer. There is a lot of career mobility however pay is not fair for the amount of work you are expected to do.Management is good and co-workers are like minded people. This job has taught me how to multi task efficiently.
good,"top organisation to work for, best culture, all young and energetic people, lots to learn and have fun."
good,"Did my summer internship there. Great company to start your career with, quality of work is an issue and the shift requirement is not good"
good,worked in a team and independent too. Have always worked in a client relationship and customer facing and was always the first face of contact. Very productive and always a quick learner.
good,Taking call after call after call. Its a good place to work and will always will be only thing is it just becomes repetitive.
good,Chase is a good company overall. It is hard to get raises or to move to another department without them trying to low ball you. they have great benefits and vacation time.
good,"I liked to work there.  We all have a deadline to finish at the end of day each day.  The department I worked in was Mortgage Department that have loan files, copy machines.  I sent original documents in custodial files with copies in original files.   It was good and little stressful but not bad.   I did all the work by the end of day."
good,"I m happy that I have been a part of Chase for the last 6 years"
good,"a typical day at work would be coming in sitting at your station and getting straight to business. Co workers are nice management very strict, there is room for advancement if you kiss the managers butt."
good,Being a Personal Banker can be very rewarding if you like talking to people and enjoy sometimes long hours. The pay is ok but you make most of your money in commission getting people to open accounts and get mortgages or Home Equity Loans or Lines of Credit.  When I was there you needed to earn a certain amount of points by getting new clients in the door. That was how you earned commission.  Unfortunately for me I was in an employee only branch and most of the employees did not need to open accounts as they got one when they were hired and didn't need to be educated about Chase products as they worked there and received emails and other communications about special discounts and offers for employees. This made getting new clients harder.
good,Assisting customer with legal information regarding holds placed on personal and business accounts and working with  Telephone Bankers Along with Branch Reps.
good,"I learned to handle irrate callers and management skills in the process. My co workers we're great team players, The hardest part of the job was not having enough time to talk to the seniors and some of the management team were not professional"
good,"Best part time job ever."
good,"Excellent position to give you flexibility in your personal schedule. Like running your own business with JP Morgan support. Endless call lists to choose from and lots of marketing options. Love the flexibility this job provides.However, its a constant battle with closing dates. Processing is always against us, most could care less if we close on time because it doesnt effect them. Cant build relatioships with realtors because we never meet closing dates. Everything falls on the loan officer- which makes it a very stressful environment."
good,"Good company to work for, excellent benefits, low salary. Hated the uniform, and irate customers."
good,I have worked here for a while now and think its a good business
good,"The Commercial Banking team at JPMC is top notch. There is no shortage of very intelligent and hardworking people. Tons of upward and lateral mobility."
good,customer comes to the teller booth and tells you what theyre there for and i would proceed by assisting them
good,"My typical day at work was always very busy, with many task going on at the same time.  There were always ad hoc responsibilities that would arise on a daily basis. Regardless how busy the day was, because of the relationship that was had within the department there was always time for laughs.  Being part of a team was a large aspect of Quality Control.  Many time you worked together as a team to get task completed in a timely and accurate manner.  "
good,"managed a large group of consultants and client employees, many of which were my own sub-contractors with diverse levels of experience"
good,"Professional environment to be around, I learned about different mortgage documents and more about the service the company provided for customers who need mortgage assistance"
good,"Good company to start your carrier"
good,A typical day at work was reviewing wire transactions with a team.
good,"A good company to work for, but pushes employees too hard to achieve results. Employee satisfaction is not looked after much."
good,Work to build relationships with clients
good,"The call volume was very high sometimes taking about over a hundred calls in adays time I learned a lot about the banking industry, manangement was ok but definitely need training great co workers. Hardest part of job was trying to calm an irate person., Most enjoyable when everyone came together as one big happy family, my most memorable moments,"
good,I would still be at Chase if I didn't go ba k to school! I couldn't balance both!
good,"Overall call center is clean and quiet with excellent co workers. However, the training is not good"
good,The primary reason I enjoyed working at JPMorgan Chase were the people that worked there. It was a great environment to worn in.
good,A typical day at work I meet new people from many different backgrounds.
good,Not much possiblity to go full time from a part time teller. They've taken away full time positions within the company for that job. I would love to stay with the company if they offered that still. Many others feel like that as well so I believe that's why there's a large turnover rate. Great pay(recently there's been a pay increase) and good benefits
good,Love the people I work with. Amazing team I got lucky with. Pretty easy going people. Strick no overtime and part time tellers have no way of increasing hours. No Saturdays for my location which is a huge bonus.
good,"pros:"
good,"Call Center position is fast paced and very stressful. Very good trainings, and benefits. People are very friendly and respectful. Very nice facilities to work in."
good,"It a great place to start out of college. Mostly starting as a part time position with a long wait to move up to full time. The branch I worked for was amazing with a great staff, but there was no place for advancement, and that created my desire to leave."
good,Learned so mnay things from starting till end of the day.services provided were really thankfull. Magagemnet tries to identify the hidden takents in you and help in guiding things get done.
good,"Job is great, great ppl to work with. Great benefits the problem is who they have in charge. Management is greedy and show too much favoritism. Everything else is great."
good,"Here at this job I was able to meet all types of people from different demographics.  Some people spoke different languages, some even wore different clothing, I also had a change to meet 2 famous people working here. It was an exciting job, you never knew what or who to expect."
good,"Answer over 150 calls daily, the job is really repetitive, the work is unfulfilling and no sense of accomplishment due to high call volumes.  Hardest part of the job is repeating almost the same task all day but management is understanding and helpful."
good,"Work was good and you pretty much knew what you had to do each day when you got to work. For the most part, no one bothered you management just let you do your work. Work load wasn't bad but this is driven by the economy so the job can come and go. But that is the industry"
good,"My typical work day consist of focuses on Chase internal relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers, different lines of business while sorted and filed loan documentation for multiple Chase business departments. "
good,I enjoyed working with chase. It is a team based company with great benefits. End of every month they held contests for eom as well as contests just for fun with team leads against team leads.
good,I learned ways to keep energy at work because I worked night shift. I learned from the previous employees that have been there way before I was hired. Many of my co workers always spoke when entering the room and gave compliments and also shared treats with others.
good,"was a good environment to work in. Meeting and working with diiferent people daily, The hardest part was dealing with customers that were hard to work with."
good,"Have fun with a lot of new people and not get bothered as long as you do your job. No one threatens, just a fun overall place to make the best of having a job."
good,Chase Bank call center was a fast pace environment. Calls are always back to back. Great place to work if you like good benefits and plenty of paid time off.
good,"Chase was nice, coworkers were nice and friendly. Not alot of customer flow so you will have alot of free time. Very customer service based. Bonus regularly very good compensation."
good,"Chase is a great Company to work for, it just gets very challenging as a Teller dealing with rude customers and dealing with scams and fake bills. Every ABM I've had, has always been horrible as well."
good,"A typical work day for me was consolidating files and scanning."
good,"Great place to start a career right out of college, you get a powerful brand name on your resume.  It was too slow moving for me, but great for some people."
good,JPMorgan Chase is an amazing company to work for. They truly value the opinions of their employees and appreciate the hard work that is given on a daily basis.
good,"Completely enjoyed my job. Job consisted of multi-tasking. Accounting, reports, analysis, projects."
good,"Unfortunately I cannot disclose the work I did,"
good,I love the benefits and how free you can speak with you managrs if you have any issues. They also have a work life program onsite doctors and counseling if you need it. The hardest part of the job is staying on the phone especially if you have a difficuilt job. The management watches everything you do on and off the phone. The best part are the people you get to work with. Everyone has each others back if you need someone to help you.
good,"I currently work in Wholesale Loan Operations for the Commercial Banking sector within JPMorgan Chase. My daily duties consist of reviewing/completing of loan documentation, sitting in on compliance calls and testing, help train/guide new hires learn the process of the job at hand."
good,"I learned a lot about being a team player and giving more and more what my customers needed. Trying to understand human beings from their perspective and not only mine.That will take not only myself but my customers, a long way. Just trying your the best that you can and really trying to help, is the key, every person like to feel that someone took good care of you and understood your situation and did their best to try and help. I believe that's what custome service is all about, and at the end of the day, most jobs come with dealing with people and being helpful. No matter what the job is."
good,Tellers and Bankers are great. Management-not so much. Always a problem with the schedule and going to school
good,I worked for 3 years and the years that I have spent there were awesome and the benefits you can afford. Nothing but the best trainers and awesome resources materials to be knowledgeable to customers and everyone is a team player and willing to assist
good,Very easy plcae rto work at low room for advancement though.
good,"Chase will move you to another department or totally different jobs before laying you off. This is awesome if your concern is job stability. But if you are concerned about building a career, you may be disappointed because you have to be open to change in Chase and staying in your set career is not an option."
good,"great benefits,great pay,too much call volume team environment is good,work under pressure,enjoy team activities.no lunch,time off work hours good.salary great"
good,"Initiated creation cost centre mapping."
good,"I review mortgage documents and data information on desktop. I assist co-workers  and home lending assistance. I do not wish to explain any further of job, duties or the environment."
good,Made outbound calls on an automated dialer system to collect credit card debt. Provided payment programs for those that qualified. Commission based job. First job in banking which was a great learning experience and opened many opportunities.
good,It is good place to work.Employee friendly and room for career growth.Good pay with lots of benifits.very good training for career advancement.
good,it was a fun and easy job. I loved all my co-workers and there was never a dull moment.
good,"Chase is a great company, with great benefits the only downside is that tellers only get 20 hours which isn't fair at all. They should be more understanding that most employees do enjoy their teller position and would want to pursue that as a career. In order to grow you must sell yourself to get up there, which I think isnt fair either. The location I work at isnt a safe place. Customers are constantly coming in just to get coffee and curse at the employees, and give us bad reviews if there's no coffee but yet our OSAT score goes down, and our branch manager is up our tails wanting a fairy tale experience."
good,"good company to work with . Good learning. no peer programming . fast paced. long commute for me. Enjoyed working there, they let you choose the technology."
good,"I'm a new teller at chase, I learn something new everyday. People usually always come in to make deposits, withdrawals and payments also transfers so its always the same routine everyday. The environment at my branch is different at times with different diversity but I think its good cause I get to meet different people everyday and help them with all their needs. Management is good, helpful and understanding. I enjoy working at chase"
good,Provide assistance for loan officers to qualify new and existing clients for refinance on 1st mortgage and home equity loans.
good,"it's a good company from what I recall. Of course, things have changed since I worked there.Make sure your reference line up to the day.While in training alot of people were fired."
good,Large company with many opportunities but you have to FIGHT for your salary. You may perform the same role as your co-worker but you salary will differ greatly.
good,"Working at Chase it gave many opportunities to learn new things as of how the banking system really works. There I learned how to make deposits, withdraws, make payment on property tax, and much more. I learned how to add money to ATM's and also to the TCD's. I always  balanced at the end of the business day. Customer service was a must in this business."
good,"Was with company for 11+ years.  Started as a teller, then was promoted to SSA, then Persona Banker... all within a year.  Was one of the top bankers in the country, in the top 100, and was able to attend most of the ""reward trips"".  "
good,The job was ok. There was alot of micromanagement going on there at the time. It was not really organized as far as management was concerned.
good,"Very heavy work loads but productive place. Work days began at 8 AM end at 5 PM. Learned to do your best. Great team of workers, the hardest part was leaving the company. I really liked it."
good,Useless company. Hire and fire rule. One needs lobby and network to be survived. No respect to people.
good,Allowed for growth and learning. Great experience in an intense environment.
good,"There is much to like about JP Morgan.  The company not only has a very large footprint and leadership that is extremely strong but they are investing into the site to make things more enjoyable for their employees.  The CEO is excellent, incredible leader.  "
good,"Chase offers good benefits, but the job can be stressful more often than not. I enjoyed working for the company due to the benefits and the staff were usually pleasant and I enjoyed making others feel appreciated."
good,The environment is tough to navigate some expectations are unrealistic with many middle manager's not trained to understand the proper protocols within a proper environment.
good,"The work was fast pace, interesting and extremely busy which was great and rewarding."
good,It was a wonderful company to work for but it offers little incentives for people to stay with the company.
good,A typical day was busy and we faced many different issues on a daily basis when assisting the public with their financial needs.  Co-workers were pleasant and helpful.
good,"Good Place to start a career.  Not good for the long term as the work life balance sucks. However, the compensation is competitive, as well as the benefits and amenities on site.  Very top of the line."
good,"management does not respect there employees "
good,quite long working hours on weekdays and OT is required on weekends frequently.
good,Working environment required attention to detail in a fast paced environment. No real opportunities for advancement. Hardest part of the job was eye strain. Fun group of people to work with. Little time for social interaction.
good,I enjoyed working at JP Morgan Chase. It was retail lockbox where we process payment for a number of different companies. They did have room for advancement. I started as a processing clerk and worked my way up to supervisor. the staff was will to help you advance as well.
good,customer-focused and extremely dependable individual with Functional knowledge of performing specialized tasks such as personal money orders
good,"I enjoyed working for chase for the most part. I am very flexible when it comes to change but when Chase changed your job title they also changed our pay structure. We were paid half of what we were making in the previous position and moved to commission. I myself wasn't interested in Sales at the time, but glad I was able to obtain sales skills."
good,Fun work place
good,Poor management and bonuses and compensation is terrible.  No work culture and cooperate sponsor events.  Employees are treated as numbers.  Emphasis are paid on metrics.
good,Open branch could take an hour. which is a waste of your time. then you have at-least two meetings one group one person to person. then you have either walk in clients or appointments. The hardest part is when someone has fraud you are doing a lot of work for no compensation. Best part is when you really connect with a client and help them grow from a little account to a complete relationship
good,"Worked over nights incoming call center, the 6 months I worked there I saw my kids maybe once or twice, most of time consisted of working or sleeping. management was not helpful with time off needed for husband military duties. My manager was a new manager and was horrible she spent more time with work gossip then actual work. your coworkers will be like highschool groups I had certain people I only talked to and that was how everyone was."
good,You can learn many languages and absorb many skills. Work/life balance is precarious as you work 12 hours a day at least plus weekends from time to time.
good,"Chase is a good company to work for. They have great benefits and a great tuition assistance program. They do have many lay offs, which is a not so good."
good,"was a good job at the start, but the longer I worked there, I got no management support, which is the reason I left the position"
good,With JP Morgan we faced red tape around each corner especially when we implement new rules on our matching criteria. Management had very little interest in staff. Staff turnaround was a concerning factor and create uncertainty.
good,If you stay with the company for too long then you get underpaid. Management sucks and they still hold true to the culture where you don't feel comfortable leaving until your boss's boss and then your boss has left the office. This makes for a very uptight work culture where people feel obligated to stick around the office even when they have nothing to do or have finished for the day. Not conducive and lowers morale.
good,"I have found that the culture of JPMC is to move as many jobs off shore as possible and in my time there I saw very few black men being retained / promoted.  I can say that there were only a handful of black men in the office that I worked in that consisted of maybe  6000 people.  Of course there were black men in the cafeteria and the mail room, but very few in the offices."
good,I worked at JPMorgan for 16 years and met a lot of great people there and also made some friends.  I've learned a lot from my time there - it was generally a positive experience.
good,"I started off working with MHT (Manufacturers Hanover Trust) and survived many mergers -- Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan, JP Morgan, Bank One and others."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, just wish they compensated their employees better. Pay raises are a joke. Company needs to spend less money building and more paying employees."
good,"Working for JPMorgan and Chase was an eye opening experience. During my time there I realized how society viewed banks. While working there, often times Occupy Atlanta came by to protest during the end of our shift leaving us hostage in the bank until enforcers came to break it up. This was during the time families were losing there houses to Chase because of mortgages not being paid. It was definitely a learning experience but I still found ways to enjoy the job by making connections with my daily customers."
good,"I worked here as a fresher and it was a great opportunity to learn as a fresher."
good,Benefits are wonderful. The amount of work and performance expectations are exceedingly high..Pay is not competitive and yearly increase is very minimal if at all.
good,"Decent salary 55K. Working at the tower is better. Working at the site near union station is horrible. It is a good place to be while you are deciding what your next career move is. The people are ok overall. If you are looking to learn something, this job will bore you. You will spend the majority of your day transferring money and responding to emails. Seems to be a place where a lot of smart people given up on trying to go further in their career."
good,"I was one of the first 6 staff hired to be system SME and assume the day to day operation and enhancement of a mixed platform (mainframe, web, client server) securities custodian data warehouse application. There were approximately 2,500 jobs run each day and 1M intraday transactions processed in multiple CICS regions. "
good,"Overall a pleasant experience, could use more family friendly managing staff."
good,"I feel as though management really did not care about what other situations people had going on. As long as we did the work that they provided for us that's all that maters is what we were shown as far as getting the work done for the day. I love working with my co-workers we always had fun and did our work at the same time. When I say fun I mean we told each other funny situations that we were put in with some of the other jobs that we had or anywhere else that we were at. The hardest part of the job was working 3:30-12am Monday through Friday, trying to go to school and take care of my son at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I could get alone wit my co-workers and did not have to worry about unnecessary drama."
good,I currently work at Chase Bank in the Benton Harbor area in Michigan. I enjoy coming into work every day and helping our customers with the guidance that may be needed when handling their transaction or questions they may possess.
good,"out sourceing is common, but a good team enviorment worked there 5 years and my dept got out sourced"
good,Had to work all 6 days and open to close quite often due to staff shortage for long periods-3 to 6 months at a time. No floating staff to support and most branches were in the same boat so could not help.
good,"Unfortunately the wages a not extremely competitive and the company will do what's best for the company not necessarily the employees."
good,The firm offers great benefits and has stability in the industry. Technology is slow to change and management is not high EQ. Overall a good firm but needs to modernize
good,Company looking transform by hiring from the outside and bringing in more interns to train and hire. Many managers coming from Investment Bank and looking to transform Commercial Bank.
good,"The normal day is setting appointments while assisting walk in customers of the bank.  I enjoyed the educational side of teaching customers about products and learning about their long term goals.  I did not enjoy pushing to make sales goals.  It can be a great environment, like anything else it takes a good leader."
good,"No matter how hard you work & what you accomplish, you are still at high risk of losing everything & every day may be your last one. We would get thanked for working so hard to achieve the impossible, but always told it was not enough. The CEO laid off thousands in order to downsize the company & gamble on himself to turn a large profit for the company. In the year I got laid off, his salary jumped from $12/mil to $20/mil while we ground our fingers to the bones trying to crank out the numbers. I spent years working my way from contract to contract to finally becoming a full-time employee. I was saving for retirement & began thinking this was the home for me. Then, they brought in 20 new people from India & we all began to be phased out one by one. All of my coworkers had bosses that were local, while my boss was 1600 miles away & had no input on my daily duties. He was ultimately responsible for besmirching my name on my performance review that cost me everything. When I was called to be released, I honestly thought the talk would be about me getting a pay raise. They do not care for their people & we are treated as playing pieces in a game. I was married to my job & did anything in my power to build our team into IT juggernauts & I am forever scarred from my experience there & am still unable to cope with the loss."
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work.  The environment can sometimes be very stressful.  The job isn't difficulty, it is the management subjective views of people that make the job hard in my department."
good,"The environment is good.  No room to grow once you are in your position.  Upper management agrees ""It's hard"" to move up.  Job stability also is a bit on the volatile side.  If you can negotiate a good position, title, and salary upfront as an external applicant - you will love it.  For those internally looking to grow... far and few between succeed.  It is best practice to move to another company and come back a few years later and start the negotiating again with your new found experience as leverage for higher pay and title. A real shame the company makes little to no effort to retain good, hardworking folks and allows for new people to come in with higher pay, higher titles and no experience.  Or is it?  This does leave it open for the external candidate to thrive in the application process.  Cheers!"
good,"Not offering anything, I have nothing bad to really say about the company, the job relocated and there was not a cost of living increase or any type of compensations to assist those that live far out."
good,What started as a growing department with excellent opportunities ended up losing all ground due to poor management and lack of procedures to avoid errors that hurt customers in the end.
good,"JPM is a huge organization, so there is even more variance from group to group on the quality of management and employees. The name attracts smart people at all levels, and some areas (Asset Management, Commercial Bank and Private Bank) are truly good places to work. However, given the size of the organization, inevitably some rotten characters get in and ruin group dynamics and work processes. I learned a lot in my time in compliance there (the group went through 3 remediations in less than 122 mos.), but ultimately had to leave because the quality of the employees steeply declined and the group's management changed to inflexible, disagreeable individuals who ""talked out of both sides"" of their mouths."
good,I was able to come from Chase with lasting friendships and able to provide good customer service. Management could use more help with showing their employees more appreciation. The lack of knowledge from management was unbelievable.
good,"You kind of know what you're expected to do but not with much detail. Communication is not consistent across the board. Different levels of management provide different rules that contradict each other. Unrealistic goals and deadlines. However, somewhat peaceful environment with little supervision."
good,I worked for the company on a temporary project.  The assignment was for 6 to 9 months but lasted over 2 years without benefits.  The work environment was demanding but not overly stressful.  We were kept informed and workers consistently helped each other.  We were told that once we were hired it would be easier to move to other departments once the project ends but that did hold true for the majority.
good,Working at Chase is fun but challenging. There is not much room for advancement in terms of moving up with the company. There is alot of cold calling involved.
good,Management is amazing but the late hours and the customer's are not pleasant. If you like call center work chase has one of the better call center environments.
good,"As an L1 client support managed all the incidents and had to move to the relevant teams accordingly."
good,"The job culture is very bad but only at this site, I have worked at another site and department and enjoyed coming to work."
good,"I was supposed to have a 6 month contracted position in they company with opportunity for advancement. Instead, my employment was terminated early because of lack of call volume with no warning."
good,"Difficult position dealing with customers with fraud activity on their accounts.  Customers are not friendly, yell if they do not like the results of the investigation.  Customers Claim fraud when it is a family member then get upset if the analyst tries to have the file police reports.  Management is difficult to deal with, not all managers are trained in fraud scenarios."
good,Hired to support their client JPMC therefore growth and opportunities are hit and miss. If you're needed and available then all is good; if not you essentially start over somewhere
good,I enjoyed building working relationships with my staff and co-workers
good,"Loved working at Chase"
good,Louisville Loan Center management team was horrible!  I guess why they are no longer in Louisville.
good,"The JPMorgan work environment is efficient and productive, yet comfortable and family oriented."
good,J.P Moran being a multi portfolio bank makes it a great learning place to work & learn.
good,"I processed payroll and provided confidential administrative support to the Call Center Directer and Management Team. My position was eliminated when our entire department was relocated to Salt Lake City, Utah. At that time, I was moved into a call center roll servicing credit card customers for JPMorgan Chase. I became a top seller in a very short time. The most enjoyable part of this job was working together as a team to achieve whatever challenges that were presented to us on any given day as it related to performance and sales."
good,"Working at Chase taught me how to manage a day that has too much in it. I was a Sr. Processor for over a year, and had a pipeline of about 70 loans. Staying in contact with these customers on a daily basis, while waiting for our underwriters to return a file was challenging. The computer systems were below average and always had issues. This job prepared me to take on anything I set my mind to and taught me a lot about the mortgage industry."
good,"learned hoe to work all the different system, making the necessary adjustments to get used to the work flow and managers are very helpful."
good,"There is no advancement opportunities at this company. They post jobs because they have to legally but they already know who they desire to work in the position being posted, applying for jobs internally is waste of time, education or not you will not advance here unless you know somebody who know somebody."
good,"Micromanagement here was terrible branch manager sit behind with a clipboard so annoying like we did t know now to do our job seriously. Pay was ok if you sold a lot , terrible salary compared to industry. Other banks pay 10 to 15k more salary for same position."
good,I enjoy meeting clients and helping them with their financial needs. I take great pride and love helping clients plan for their short and long term needs.
good,A typical work day was: Sorting and filing immigration applications and checks. I learned to work as a teamplayer here. Management was strict but kind. My co-workers were from all walks of life and ages too. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the work load. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with co-workers in a relaxed atmosphere.
good,contract in house; make sure all document is correct before closing the deal. Answer incoming and outgoing call everyday. Make sure your teammate is update to date.
good,Process monetary transactions daily. Slow during the day..
good,The recent location strategy has displaced many without giving them a hand in finding another job. Uncertainty started in 2019 and continues into 2020.
good,"Working at J.P. Morgan chase was challenging, as far as getting the work done in a timely manner, making sure they are posted to the card holders account correctly and accurately. The most enjoyable part of the job was me posting the customer payment on time to keep them happy."
good,I worked as a part time teller in a fast paced branch. There was little opportunity to obtain more hours or advance to another position within the company.
good,"Work life balance is lacking, however opportunity to learn about middle market lending is high.  Often you are directed to complete analysis vs. using your own knowledge and experience."
good,"The organization as a whole was good to work for. I wore many different hats, from working with everyday clients and opening accounts to business, mortgages, & investments as well."
good,"I enjoyed working at Chase..  Other than WAMU , it was great."
good,"Pro- Great Company to work for. You learn a lot is useful information that can take you far in your career. "
good,Management could make you or break you. you have to uphold this fake way of acting so your management won't cut your hours. I loved my job but the team and branch I was in didn't have any good leadership and didn't know how to take care of their team.
good,Lot of opportunity to learn new technology. Lots of hackathon and they also have sessions that you can attend and learn new technology. Lots of help offered in technology side of things.
good,"Very slow paced as a teller it is very boring and not much to do for tasks so a long shift is very boring, managers are very stressed, very efficient that you can not make any mistakes at all otherwise you are at risk of losing your job."
good,Just wish they would invest more in there employees. Analyst training in cross lines of business would help daily job function by 100%. Better resources
good,"Very hard to advance within the company. Alot of politics involved, it is more of who you know and not what you know. Alot of the management do not belong in the role. They don't hold the common skill set and seem to take there positions as a way to do and say what they want to people. If you are friends with the management you are more likely to get somewhere."
good,I like my Paid Time Off and holiday pay. I like all of the on site perks except the fact that we don't have a gym. I'd like my education and experience to be better utilized.
good,"Internal customer support for applications, phones, passwords, etc.  24/7 staffing.  Management was not open to opinions that were different from theirs."
good,Top quality institution providing a consistent environment in which to operate and excel. Areas of the bank are top in all categories while others continue to work year on year to achieve the same level with varying visions.
good,"Company has culture where employees avoid responsibility and blame others for lack of customer service.  If customer complains, bank has culture of placing blame on which dept is at fault for the unpleasant customer experience. Other employees will be quick to throw you under the bus."
good,"Because the hours change weekly, very hard to have a home life. Weekend hours are hard also when you have a husband and children at home.  Working until 6:00pm weekdays, also makes it difficult to come home and have dinner with your family"
good,I'm ok with working at chase bank. The atmosphere is good. The pay could be a little better. management is really hard on you when it comes to phones out on the job which I understand but they treat you like you're a child though.
good,"Pretty much, cut and dry, in a call  center culture. A banker was gated to receive online support, branch banker, business customer,  and consumer customer calls."
good,"There were amazing People at Chase. The employees made coming to work worthwhile. Some of the managers had secret agendas and favorites creating tension at times. Otherwise I found Chase to be a great place to work, I learned and grew substantially there. The culture was a tad bit stiff but otherwise a great place to work!"
good,A work environment that required lots of focus and diligence on a consistent basis. Management lacked vision and/or transparency with their employees.
good,"Not every position within JP Morgan Chase has this same practice. I think the company is a great company to work for. However, the position I'm currently in treats its employees as a number and not a person. If they can get that under control it'd be great. Management does not relay pertinent messages to the higher ups for fear of their responses. The job is not hard, however because we are treated as a number and not an employee that makes for a stressful, less exciting job. The most enjoyable part of my day is when the clock strikes 5 pm and I can go home to my children. I personally feel that when you are at work 80% of your day it should be a place you love going to."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the work place is to have lunch together with friends, the hardest part of the job is the insecurity of the job. The culture and experience at the company varies greatly depending on which group you work in; some groups are more relaxed and the managers are nice, the others are just the opposite. Therefore, it is hard to generalize things, it all depends."
good,"The short time I was there I enjoyed it."
good,I really don't have a lot to say for this company.  The overall structure of the company is good but its so large that all the middle and lower level management get lost in the mix.  they do what they want and there isn't very good oversight.  the vacation time is great getting 4 weeks although I hear this is standard for banking.
good,"Great benefits is what it holds me here. Could be better at promoting good long timers , paying more long timers, managers just think about p&l. Still here until something better."
good,Very stressful and unfair management. High level of competition and long hours. Commission is hard to get because of too many employees and not enough business.
good,"The trick to succeeding here is navigating the web of work and sponsorship. The work itself (portfolio management) was not technically complicated, but access to the best work opportunities was not clear."
good,"Ensuring correct payment and benefits are provided to the employees of Australia JP Bank. "
good,"It is difficult to be promoted even when you are doing the job of a VP, you still need to wait, sometime years, to get promoted to the title and pay.  Increases are at best minimal."
good,"It was a great place to work, the job was interesting, but it was temporary.  Would love to work for JP Morgan, but I need a more permanent position. thanks"
good,"Very well organized company with very kind employees.  Office equipment, clean atmosphere, company events and nice work culture.  I would go back to work there if I get the opportunity."
good,"I have been at JPM Chase for over 5 years.  I started out in a retail Chase branch, where your job security and income are based on your production. Compared to other banks, their base salary is lower, which increased pressure for staff to SELL SELL SELL.   Its VERY difficult to transfer from retail banking  into the Corporate side, or Investment Bank.  Working in Operations or back office at JPM has a limited pay scale and future.  JPM considers everyone replaceable and turnover is high.  Several managers have suggested staff to change firms if not happy with a 2% annual raise. -At JPM back office, you get security and benefits, but low $. The best opportunities would be front office, which provide good growth and income."
good,"I found this career to be a rewarding one and working for JPMC broadened my skillset and allowed me the opportunity to play a major role in the performance of the organization. Where I found a tremendous need for improvement was the need to go back and 'clean up' from years of this, like many other, financial industries pitfalls in customer products and experiences."
good,"Value Creation became a metric worth almost half of the monthly scorecard, but no one explained how to meet or exceed the expectation. Management was slow to recognize individual achievement, but lightning fast to punish any infractions."
good,"I uused Excel spreadsheets to Manage the cut over of IP/SIP&RTP Phones.  My eavning duties were traveling to different JPMchase locations and replace/renew hardware such as. Network Swiches,Routers and servers."
good,standard every day i.t. work. management was good and appreciative. started there as an intern. hardest part of the job are the stock exchange floors and dealing with the clients.
good,Great place to work with families and children. many different locations to chooses. There is no room for advancement. A lot of nepotism in workplace.
good,JP Morgan Chase is a good company to work for but advancement is strictly based on popularity rather than work ethic. I worked at this company for just shy of 10 years and in the end meant nothing as far as my sacrifice and being one of the first in and last to leave.
good,"No work life balance, low salary, long hours, management only cares about their positions, no support for growth no a good place to work if  is a branch environment"
good,"I worked there for 18 months as a contract employee.  I learned a lot there, especially coding for Sentinel. I liked the culture and the company and although I liked the atmosphere and the people there was no option to become permanent and the commute was very long (2 hours plus door to door)."
good,Co-workers willing to assist with helping one another with completion of task and input for making position more efficient.
good,"The TAP program wasn't particularly good, but it was a fun environment to work with peers similar to you. Every team does something different, but sometimes you see a lot of people doing very little."
good,Great place to start for entry level. You will learn numerous skills that will assist you later in your career choices. The training is excellent and prepares you for the next step. The downside is you are rewarded more if you leave the company and return from a competitor vs staying loyal and working up the ranks. Outside of the executive positions you are a number and replaceable (no matter the number of years you have put in).
good,"on desk from 8am to 730pm ........"
good,"Great way to start in banking and learn all about large banks. They pay your investment licenses and pay for your training. As a licensed banker, they pay your first 6 months as a minimum commision."
good,Good Brand Name to work with. Nice learning experience. I am currently working in Cash Operations Team. There is a lot to learn & explore new opportunities.
good,not much opportunity for advancement The people are enjoyable to work for Scheduling is  an issue and with a big company you can be just a number and lost in the shuffle
good,"Most day consist of logging in and completing your assigned region, ranging from 35-45 accounts. Micro management was not an issue, but management involvement was scarce. The company did not offer much to advancement in career. Yearly salary increases were very low."
good,"I worked Mastercom disputes, Assign Cases, phone audits, projects, meetings,fraud analysis, SME for New accounts, payroll cards, and worked Fax Service."
good,Compensation/Benefits Job Work/Life BalanceJob Security/AdvancementManagement all are good except work life -worked over 70 hours a week and weekends pay is ok -travel was to much
good,"I am blessed to work with JP Morgan CHASE overall it is a good company and one of the largest and known."
good,"Worked in a fast paced team environment, while prioritizing projects/searches with cold calling, sourcing and recruiting candidates for various client facing positions.  I have learned the entire recruiting cycle, the pitfalls and compliance/regulatory requirements firm wide."
good,Typical work day includes much of your standard day-to-day bank activities.
good,A top notch company in need of a culture change within certain lines of business.
good,"A typical day at work you respond to all emails by end of day  confirm you have completed all tasks  due on your daily report. All phonecall, emails and  transactions are scored.You must have total score of 94% at the end of each month"
good,"Great benefits and learning experience"
good,"A typical day at work was Mortgage servicing Short Sales, Foreclosures, Forbearances, Collections, Loan Modification, Repayments and Deed-in-Lieu etc."
good,A typical day for me is coming into work with a warm welcome from different employees and sometimes they are not directly in my department it will be from someone in a different building. This company has made me understand and learn different job duties and functions where I can move throughtout the department. The hardest part of the job would just not being there for example if im on vacation or out sick I will always have an employee to help out with my work along with there responsibilities as well. I enjoy working for a company who will take the time out to apprciate your work and ethics.
good,§Responsible for 100 % accuracy in ensuring customer information is not compromised by extensive research of mortgage loan documents.
good,The only thing with this company is the insurance used to be great they have since downgraded.
good,"Chase is a great place to work and get your foot in the door. "
good,JP Morgan Chase has always had a high ranking and been a reputable institution.  I have worked there off and on for several years and would continue to work for Chase Bank if the economy would allow it.  Too much instability in the banking sector.
good,"professional environment "
good,"You can move up if you get a long with the right person. If not you'll be doing a lot of work to walk in place. If you just do what you are told and don't take the micro managing and baby talk to heart it's a great job. Working with the people are great, clients have many different products available. It is a great place to be able to help those who need it. Managers feel a lot of pressure  that they manage down. The good thing about it is that you can move branches and reset and create a great atmosphere again."
good,"The floor is always active with fun and work, where as managers are always behind employee to focus on work. The work culture, standards of life is really good."
good,"Its a good company always there is work to do."
good,Got a wonderful opportunity to work in a newly migrated process called ACH.
good,Most challenging is working with others who are not as dedicated.
good,I enjoyed assisting my customers with their needs. I also enjoyed being a part of the peer coaching program to assist new hires.
good,Business is slow this time of the year without having to many runs to make any money.
good,growth driven work site. Productive and fun workplace. Employee focused.
good,"Chase offers 3 weeks of vacation and a week of sick time. Match 401k contributions up to 5%. Healthcare includes Health, Dental and Vision. Employee discounts available."
good,"Great company to work , alot of dept to learn from . the leaders are always availble . the growth is not restricted . the benefit is great. I took some classes and the complany paid for it"
good,Unfortunately once one leaves they dont want you back very difficult  to get back on. I have had many  friends try and its no use to get back on with Chase
good,Chase is a good company to work for. However each Department seems to vary on how they handle things. My current department is definitely stressful and can be a hostile place to be.
good,"I was a great example of the opportunities afforded at JPM - multiple roles in multiple cities, including Europe.  If you take charge of your career, you can have interesting opportunities potentially.  However, those opportunities often depend on knowing the right person, and being able to work connections to get jobs.  And especially -- work the connections before the job is posted as by the time it is posted, the candidate has oftentimes already been found.  The managers are average - oftentimes managing up instead of managing their people."
good,I've interviewed with Chase twice in my career and fortunately I was hired both times.  It's a fine place to work.  Solid benefits.  40 hour work week.  If you need a job and can't find anything else then take this.
good,"Chase as a whole is a great company.. Their benefits are far much better than the other companies, so I've been told. Advancement opportunities are based upon who you know rather than being promoted for your experience and/or knowledge. This is the number one complaint amongst employees and reason that so many leave the company."
good,"Great company to work for but they do not follow their own rules. People are treated differently. If you are a white male you will have more opportunity than if you are black or brown. Its a tough situation because the benefits are great, the money is good, but the culture is tarnished and job security is very low."
good,"An amazing place to work if you have good leadership. fast paced, great coworkers, does not pay like other banks do, lots of work and your days go by quick"
good,"My day starts by me identifying my workload and timelines by the most important to the least. What I learn daily is every customers personal or financial situation is different. My management style is to treat all customers with dignity and respect.The hardest part of my job is  knowing I cant approve all customers for mortgage assistance. The most enjoyable part of my job is receiving appreciation letters from the customer to say ""Thank you"" for getting them a modification and for a job well done."
good,"JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., offers excellent benefits. "
good,Difficult to get work life balance due to shift timings overall the xo is great to work with facilities provided by the co is fantastic ... only hope if I could get better work timings
good,"Eye-opening on how banks are operated."
good,"* Provide analysis of complex security issues and develop process for remediation ensuring minimal impact to production services"
good,"Most of the work is ok, but you need to spend long hours to succeed, management dont provided the perfect training to succeed, the training consist of shadow a person,and after that you are on you own. Management think that you will succeed in two weeks."
good,"Chase has a lot to offer, but you cannot always expect job security. My layoff was proof of that.. I started in mortgage collections to moeup within the company, but my department was let go."
good,"Busy, I learned how to batch file, management was easy going, work culture was ok, hardest part of job was heavy bins, most enjoyable was meeting my co-wokers"
good,"Having worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co as consultant for close to 7 years, it was quite beautiful and adventures. Every quarter new technology and challenging stuffs to overcome."
good,"I do not want to rate this Company at this time. I have applied several times for various positions. I have not had any luck with the process. "
good,I worked with a good team.  I was very quick paced sometimes.  I didn't get very good bonuses (when I did get one).  The manager was absentee most of the time.
good,Great Exposure to World's biggest Investment Bank.Good Flexibility in work timing. Work life balance is good. exposure to work with most diverse culture of people across globe. Transport is the best in Mumbai.
good,"Althought the company is great and offers a lot for its employees and helps a lot the community, the wrong manager can really make you hate the job. Hours always depend on your location but you are expected to do a lot at once"
good,"Overall, JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for.  There a variety of locations so you can move throughout the country. The call center I work for has a tough grading scale based on performance throughout the year. The call center has a lot of departments to get into though which is nice."
good,"The only thing i can say needs improvement is in management / upper management.  Not personable at all.  This is for the dept I currently work in.  Other than that, I feel it's a good company that takes care of their employees.  Just too many layoffs.  You are nervous most of the time employed at Chase."
good,The leads can sometimes be obnoxious but when you're finally left alone to sort mail its actually pretty nice. All you have to do is understand how to sort the mail sent into the IRS and sort it appropriately.
good,"Chase is a good company to work for as long as you're in the correct department."
good,"I have very high ratings for this bank.  I enjoyed my time there.  My position was on the help desk answering questions from internal employees about problems with computers, accounts, and status of access requests.  I was very happy there, but at the end, the whole department was outsourced to India including the VP"
good,"Did not receive enough guidance and support from management. Otherwise the use of he Agile Methodology in projects was quite efficient, Did not find enough time for my own development, such as training classes."
good,"I like the actual job itself.  The work is fun to me.  The culture and work environment, however, is tense.  The morale is pretty low.  Management could do better with training and motivating employees to be empowered.  Train them to view themselves as professionals so they can take ownership in what they do.  Instead, you feel more like a sheep that is told what to do and must stay in line no matter what. Your every move must be tracked.  Some of the metrics, in my personal opinion, are completely pointless and only seem to be in place to control you.  They do not effectively contribute to the overall goal the company is trying to accomplish....which ultimately is... process a high volume of work with little to no errors.  All of the excessive micromanaging just causes disgruntled employees and decreases morale."
good,"I really enjoyed working here i learned a lot doing the short time of employment the staff ,lead staff was awesome the made sure all was treated right"
good,The challenging work was a great experience but the extended hours were not good for family. Management did not present changes to help with the balance and removed the flexible options.
good,I was just a temp there and wished I had been an actual employee.  The environment was very stressful and I felt overworked.  My department was only concerned about saving money.
good,"Doesn't Recommend"
good,"High stress, too many people in small spaces, poor training.  Management not properly trained.  Lack of communication, and direction.  Center used to be a WAMU center, same management after it became Chase, should have been replaced, not a good representation of what JP Morgan Chase is really like."
good,They do care about their employees and make sure that they are safe during times of emergency. They have an issue with making promises and not carrying through on them
good,"The work environment is good for the most part.  There are many departments,  a lot of work which means you are busy all the time.  The work is not hard but accuracy is needed."
good,"In my role, the work's learning environment is good at first, but it becomes very menial and repetitive. The management does not place an emphasis on helping me grow, and internal advancement is limited. Many colleagues have mentioned better chances of moving up once you leave the company and come back."
good,"Current position in a satellite office has no ability to advance. Job security is not secure due to outsourcing. Additionally, because of the cut throat culture, it does not lend to being a stable position."
good,"Branch banking is secure, but hard to advance upward with goals to improve your career path. Working in corporate is much different and easier to move upward and or around."
good,"Strong leadership, focused on building a long term, sustainable market leading business.  Client focused, looks to be #1 in every market they serve.  Ethical."
good,"not available,  it would depend on the role.... however I have too many manager changes to tell a good way of telling I really see things in a different way that othere did not"
good,I only worked one temporary job through Adecco.  I didn't really deal with them very much.  The staff that I had interaction with was friendly and helpful.
good,JPMorgan is typical of any other financial institution.  Growth is geared toward college graduates.  Lack of minority growth and a stuff shirt environment.
good,"Fortunately for me, i am adaptable to change, always the first at the counter to find out what is new and upcoming. "
good,"Big company, jobs are very strict and limited to what you can perform within your role. good pay, good experience. Gets boring after awhile, doing the same thing everyday"
good,Working for this company taught me alot about the line of business. They were great in offering programs for the employees such as many volunteer opportunities and the EAP program tending to the employees as actual people and not numbers.
good,Form relationships with people you enjoy working with. You work as a team and help each other out. Will build relationships that can last a lifetime even after you leave the firm.
good,Kelly Services was very easy to work with.  When I was let go really felt that it bothered them and were quickly looking for me a new position. I would recommend this Temp Service to anyone that is looking for a job.
good,"Stressful, no work life balance, room to grow and mobility opportunities available. Fast paced environment. Its great working with global teams. Expected to work a lot."
good,"This was a data entry job where everyone was expected to sit quietly and type.  There were not many opportunities to communicate with others, so it was a very anti-social environment."
good,"It provides a good exposure in terms of touch basing various aspects of payment banking. It's competitive in terms of remuneration. However, I am looking forward to a change."
good,"J.P. Morgan Chase has managed to remove the fun out of whatever little fun there used to be left in the merchant services business.  The business sales leaders are looking for ways to fire people, vs. finding a way to help them grow and succeed."
good,"JP Morgan is a very good company to work with."
good,I got no comment it was busy and i like being busy at work and challenges that's why I had fun and learned a lot of things like customer service because mostly I served are directors and clients of the company yeah it's an experience.
good,"company changed over the 4 years I was there. They went from caring for the agents to treating them like a number. "
good,"Aml investigations. Conduct research over available bank systems,the internet and databases consistent with the resolution of investigation."
good,I was an Intern i had no benefits but it was a great learning experiencing. They had a game room and a good cafe. I learned so many skills and meet great people.
good,"Good company to work for. Work life balance depends on work and team you are working for. Established, stable company. I wish they had overtime like other banks. Hardworking people"
good,"no work life balance in a branch environment, too many phone calls to do, complicated services and, good coworkers everybody do the best regardless the environment"
good,"Busy"
good,"serviced approximately 50-65 credit card accounts a day. The work was alright, not exceedingly difficult, but wasn't a fan of management. There were often mixed responses with certain questions I had regarding how to better do my job. Training was not sufficient, but its not incredibly difficult work."
good,The job timing and work culture depends on the team.They won't provide laptops for contractors and there will be lot of security restriction in getting access to each and every application.
good,Cashland is a growing company that generally employs people of all walks of life. You learn many things very fast because there are multiple responsibilities on a daily basis.
good,Overall i have been with the company for 5 years and make more in my first year then i do know . They have had so many lay offs and bosses nor HR does anything about any communication problems you have or lack of training you get for how big the company is. Its a very sink or swim environment with tons of politics of just who they like not how the work gets done.
good,"JP Morgan in the operations side of things seems like a nice employer, the reality of working for this bank is once you are in the door, you are stuck. Despite the propaganda promoting mobility, nothing could be further from the truth."
good,"competitive work environment"
good,"Great place to work but, the hardest thing was work life balance, worked 12 hours a day for 5 days a week. It was mentally draining but, I loved my team and company."
good,"Middle Mgmt (District Managers) at the Retail Branch level are clueless. It is a very tight in-group that controls upward mobility.Once in the Branch, it is almost impossible to move outside the branch to other banking ambitions. "
good,Fast paced ever changing environment.   Encourages team members  to look for process efficiencies and improvements to the customer experience.
good,"Large corporation with many options to move internally"
good,"As a leader, JP Morgan Chase should concentrate more on keeping the levels of customer service at peak level, by hiring/promoting people who actually understand the business of banking and customer service, in addition to having leader/management skills to promote a positive atmosphere within the banking centers."
good,Upward mobility is limited but company does make efforts and strides to move technology in a forward fashion. Card and Auto Groups are dynamic and opportunities are plentiful.
good,I come to work not knowing if I have a job or not. We have a lot of turnover in the work place. I learn how to have a positive attitude. The hardest part of my job is not been able to move up in the work place. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-worker and their positive attitude.
good,"As a teller you are left alone many times, you do not receive a break some days, but if you are lucky to have a nice manager and LTOS then your experience wont so stressful."
good,"I really Enjoy working at JP Morgan.  I enjoy what I do but the CAU as a whole is broken.  Management is unclear with what they want from the teams. Many employees are leaving the company and many employees are being let go."
good,I excelled at my job. I worked both with groups and being self motived could also work alone. During my time with chase they had many education programs. chase even send me to special classes for Word and Excel. while there  I rose to mentor and trainer and Lead Collector.
good,"I love my job, my coworkers,  and my customers. However, the direct management system is not stable. Hours of business are too long to have a work/life balance. Everyday is a new challenge. I love it. It seems like my team and I can never do enough although we are the top 3 teams in the whole area. We had achieved highest goals, and had the best bankers and tellers in the NW regions. I myself had earned three solid M.V.P (most valuable player) voted by all co-workers and team players. Consequently, we don't feel like we are valuable enough to the team neither to the company."
good,It was a pleasure working at Chase in their mortgage department.  I enjoyed my job a lot.  When they closed our branch down it was devestating financially and personally to me.
good,For a start in Banking it was fine and I enjoyed the experiences at JPMorgan. No compliants and was a good grounding. I would recommend to others.
good,Supported seven junior bank bankers in the are of expenses and travel; greeted clients; liaison between facilities management and department; inventory control.
good,"Making sure that customers can access accounts through ATM's, and on line sales working . Managing computer systems for accurate data is the hardest part."
good,"I process transactions for customers, as well as stock up on supplies throughout the week. Once a month I order supplies needed for the branch. "
good,Good company with free transport and food. One of the best companies to work. Love the job.There is lot to learn. Rating system is good.
good,"great place to work but horrible managers and opportunity to advance, the team leaders that were in place didn't care too much about the employees"
good,"Fast paced environment. Many changes happening at once. Management changes quite often. Long delays on critical projects, pressure."
good,"I had the opportunity to work in several areas of the bank, such as , FX investigations, US and FX payments, OFAC, ACCESS training and customer service.  I learned several areas of the business."
good,"All the work that my team and I did, and they were very cheap!!! Hardly any free lunches and the snacks were over priced! overall it was okay, but knowing any day could be my last was not cool."
good,"The bank has low staff levels, making work/life very tough.  The training was strong.  It would have been better if you had some experience there for prospective."
good,"Such a good company to work for. I learned so so much from my managers. It's not easy to get promoted hence the saying "" It's not what you know, it's who you know"" . This happens to be very true for Chase."
good,"Working with JP morgan was great fun have learned a lot."
good,In order to do well in this role you have to be a very quick thinker with very strong analytical & communication skills - the day is hectic & the deadlines are very prominant. Good money & great experience.
good,Lockbox is an area where everyone is very friendly and willing to help. The associate are always willing to help one another.
good,"Good to work, but not a better place to continue.Co-workers are not co-operative. Here the employees don't make difference, they follow one particular pattern of work, due to this the work gets streched."
good,JPMC in general is a great place to work but just like any place you will also find some political situations.
good,"Good Salary but  long hours. Great employees to work with but turnover is very high, Promised bonus is unrealistic."
good,"Overall JPMorgan is a nice place to work. At times it can be a difficult place to navigate, overall it's a good company to work for."
good,"very cut throat"
good,Great benefits and pay.  No life work balance for managers.  Assistant mangers spending 98% of their time in a teller window running transactions.
good,I worked in JP Morgan.  My salary was paid by HCL.  JP Morgan have not reviewed about HCL.  I got several appreciations internationally for my performance as IT Specialist.  Appraisals and appreciations were excellent.  Pay package is very bad and Top Management of HCL who paid my salary are not bothered about employees welfare or pay packages.  That's why I resigned my job.  High technological talents have no weightage and HCL Management is blind on this important aspect.
good,I worked for Bank One/Chase for 15 years.  They lost sight of the big picture... Their employees and how they add value to the banking industry.
good,"Chase is great bank overall, but the Business Banking group lacks stability. There is a lack of consistency and support throughout management, which makes it difficult to be successful."
good,"There is lack of management support when it comes to career advancement/professional development.leave policy doesn't really matter bcoz the total number of leaves never gets exhausted as most of the leave requests are turned down citing ""lack of backup"""
good,"I worked for JPM for 3 months and unfortunately did not have a good experience. I was one of 3 recent hires as an executive assistant so there was a lot of change happening which made the transition very difficult for all of us. Management did not manage very well and had unreasonable expectations. I had never been an executive assistant previously and made this clear on my resume and in my interviews however I was given little direction and even less leniency while learning not only management's expectations but the office expectations as well. I met some truly amazing, hard working and encouraging people while I worked there but overall the experience, environment, and management were not a good fit for me."
good,CAF is not a good department to work.. over JP Morgan chase is a very good company to work for
good,"A typical day at work for me is already planned out the evening before. "
good,"helping customers was the highlight of the job, I was able to learn a lot and move up in the company with them sending me to licensing."
good,"Wonderful people to work with, heavy and complex workload 95% of the time. Undervalued and no career advancement unless you were part of the ""favorites""."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great company, it's just not a very stable job."
good,Fast paced Mortgage Lending environment.  I have enjoyed my tenure here.
good,Provided good support system and hands on tools for guidance difference senerios.  Provide monthly updates on changes in mortgage industry and guidelines.
good,It's a bank.  There isn't much of moving up in the business.  They don't pay well for as much money that is brought in.
good,"Fast Paced"
good,"Great place to work, but does not promote work life balance and no job security since jobs are getting shipped to India day and night"
good,Daily international contacts. Interesting assignments. Matrix management occasionally created conflicting schedules/goals.
good,"A typical day with chase requires a lot of structure and planning. you begin with planning for a morning huddle, then you plan for the morning conversations with the bankers regarding what their day would look (appointments, making calls, etc). Followed structuring simple scripts to review with the tellers and bankers in regards to what a typical conversation would sound like with their customers. there is a lot of listening to their conversations and coaching the employee, in an effort to make them a little better everyday. as an assistant, you are pretty much running the show. a good assistant manager aims to assist the branch manager in as much as time permits. there are many reports that have to be worked, customer issues that need to be handled, employee questions and concerns that need to be addressed immediately, as well as assisting customers when needed. assisting customers on the teller line when rush hour hits, as well as assisting customers that need sales and service assistance. upper management is there to ensure that work is being done efficiently and that the plan of the day is working. the most difficult part of the job is the balance between work life and your personal life. being on salary can have its pros and cons, mostly cons. a normal day consisted of a 11/12 hour shift, not to mention the times that you are interrupted during lunch and the fact that you really dont take any breaks. other than that, you have to make the best out of your day, being that you find yourself spending more time at work than you do at home, you have to keep yourself sane, so"
good,Everyday is Different but all the same when you kow your role and your good at it.
good,I enjoyed working at Bank One but the culture change when they became Chase. The employee never seemed to matter after the merger.
good,It was okay at first but the company started making changes and my job was eliminated
good,I really Enjoyed working as a Banker. My BM was unreasonable!!
good,"After arriving to work and accessing your pipeline, your manager shows up 30-60 minutes after your team. S/He comes in on a consistance basis providing a different atmoshpere. As a manager, for the people that yo supervise, you are supposed to boost the morale not degrade or deminish it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managerial staff. Coming into work learning how to do my job and bringing joy to my clients was the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,As a personal banker I was in charge of building new relationships and deepening current relationships. This was a difficult task but it taught me the importance of sales to a company and also the best conversations that facilitate sales. I also used my organizational skills to keep on top of client's information. My co workers were pretty cut throat and so work wasn't the most fun and the hardest part of my job was making someone bank with Chase that didn't want to.
good,"Good place to work, but no appreciation from management for long hard hours. Extremely competitive, with minimal job security."
good,"I was excited to work for JP Morgan Chase because I respect their position in the banking industry. I've admired Jamie Dimon and his leadership skills in the industry for years. Unfortunately, this exemplary leadership and culture did not translate into the branch. There were no opportunities for advancement and the environment was not focused on customers it was a retail sales environment. I was a student while employed at Chase and had a difficult time finding cooperative managers with my schedule, this is eventually why I began pursuing other options."
good,At times my department was very poorly managed due to the head of the department having way to many duties.
good,"Don't bother trying to build confidence up from a manager or team leader, there one day & literally gone the next. During my 3.5year tenure, I endured 15 Team Leads."
good,This company is great to work for. Its a great steppingstone into the banking world. The job is easy and straight forward and has great benefits. Company has easy work hours as well.
good,"Decent experience. The culture is pretty good, and you have great benefits . The company is so large that it is difficult to sometimes receive the information you need in a timely manner."
good,I was mvp for 3 quarters however the call center is extremely stressful for the amount of stats survey required to meet goals each month. Team leaders monitor calls and do coaching.
good,In my 5 years there they had 4 division CEOs. None of them committed to living full-time in Dallas. 100%+ turnover of the PMO staff in the first 3 years. Good colleagues who were hard working and capable but most were overlooked in favor of those who came from other divisions of the bank or were friends of the incoming ED.
good,Overall Chase is a good employer with opportunities to grow and develop. A typical day is dependent on your job function. Chase does a good job in recognition efforts but still struggles to stay competitive with compensation. I learned how to manage multiple protects while still driving business results.
good,Good place to work if you are mid to late 50's looking for an easy life to get to retirement. Place is full of keyboard warriors looking to get one over on each other. Very slow in progression even when you get a promotion money is very slow in following.
good,Big companies can easily forget that employees make the company go forward everything was great until I needed a Leave of Absence due to family iisues. After 8 yrs I was forced to walk out. Hopefully I can come back considering I literraly had to go to aniother part of the planet.
good,"Chase has excellent benefits. I get about seven and a half weeks of paid time off. Health insurance is excellent, haven't paid for a prescription in years. However, the jobs are stressful. Favoritism is rampant, and nepotism is a Thing as well. I think that very high up leadership is completely out of touch and unaware of what those of us in the lower echelons go through each and every day so they can have millions of dollars of salary."
good,"Pros: Mon to Fri hours.  The most enjoyable part was getting along with the management and coworkers and helping customers. Paid vacation time and good benefits."
good,Production is difficult due to the amount of hours requested to work. My supervisor is excellent however communication is non existent from upper management.
good,"Hard working environment, consistent change, flexible, my manager was great in leadership and development, seems like a small company to work for even though there;s over 12,000 local employees"
good,The one consistent environment with JPMorgan Chase was the consistent inconsistent changes which did not make sense nor did it often work at the customer and employees expense.
good,"A strong and robust work culture where everyone wants to make an impact on what they do. However, this becomes a bit harsh and competitive with people end up risking their jobs."
good,High volume loan review with minimal management support.  Required 10 hours a week OT with mandatory weekends.  Ability to work OT from home.  The work environment was high stress with minimal support from management.
good,"There is not enough staff to keep up with the customer traffic flow. There is never enough time in the day to complete our call list, due to, an overload of customers."
good,"If you have a great manager or a few seasoned employees who are customer focused, it is fantastic and you feel like you make a difference in families and business's financial goals."
good,"JPMC is a massive organization- which results in more operational, control, and project management kind of work than the actual technical function. Having said that, your colleagues are among the best in business, and there are a lot of things to learn."
good,"Good place to work but because it's so large (over 240,000 employees), it can be difficult to maneuver in terms of getting answers to questions, locating information, finding someone who has expertise in a particular subject or area, etc.  I was proud to say I worked for this company since it and the CEO are well-respected, and the corporate culture is focused on treating employees and customers with dignity and respect and doing the right thing."
good,"Company is great.  Some branch managers are not very good.  They lack customer service but preach to staff to ""love on your customers ""  "
good,"unhealthy culture, superficial management .  spent more than 19 years at the company and worked my butt off and hadn't had one day of appreciation.   Elas !"
good,"Wants technical staff to work only in specified offices. Frowns on employees working remotely. Promotes a Reduction In Force policy  for older employees. Does not allow U.S. consultants to be on contract for more than 1 consecutive year, but allows unlimited renewals of off-shore contractors."
good,"They have plenty of opportunities for advancement and skill building. You can be limited to using any new skills developed based on access. There are very few assigned seats, you may be sitting in a different seat every day."
good,"There is a difference between the firm and the organization. As a firm, JPMC offers a lot to a prospective employee, from competitive pay, benefits, flexibility, and resources. Some locations also provide recreational rooms with video games, pool tables, etc to get some downtime."
good,Gain what you can while you can. Use the knowledge to get your further. If there’s no advancement by the 3 year look to move out and advance somewhere else.
good,"I feel like they make a lot of money off us but they cap us and make it impossible to move up, they would rather hire from outside. I am capped at 250k on investments so if I get them 2 million. The person one step above me that literally sits in the meeting I have personally set up gets like 5 grand plus and I get $500."
good,There is a lot of potential with the role but takes a long time to get things going. If you have patience this is the role for you. It is highly stressful both when you have a full pipeline and when you dont
good,"the job is great in terms of bonus but you need solid management , the bonus are paid monthly and can really be a great boost if your managment supports you and guides you."
good,"Great place to work with tons of friendly people..... as long as you get assigned a good manager in the right department. Pays well and benefits are wonderful, but unoptimized workflows and disorganized management who never agree leads to real problems."
good,fine organization. very much a machine. You will really need to known how to navigate a cross functional org and make yourself know if you want to do significant real work.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was when i got paid for my vacation times. Also, when the manager would be very sincere and nice to me.Other than that, everything else was horrible."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Chase. The work balance was good and so was the overtime when offered. Management was fair and I loved the offsite  team building outings.
good,JP Morgan Chase is an excellent organization. Culture could be demanding at times depending on your role. A clear line is established between employee and management which causes for a tense environment. Overall a very strong organization to grow with if relationships between coworkers are good. Great benefits.
good,"Its a bank, toe the line and do what is asked and its alright.  Feels risky to express any sentiment not in line with what management preaches.  If you get a good immediate manager and one or two levels above it can be good.  People tend not to think outside the box because of the amount of regulations and policies that are part and parcel with being at a bank."
good,Very big company to start your career with. Limited exposure and below average remuneration. Not much opportunity for growth with lack of communication from management.
good,It was good but the pay wasn't high enough. Benefits were good as well. Culture was fine and so were my colleagues. I would like to go back there. I miss working there.
good,"New to the company, teams working with are in discovery. teams are trying to identify priorities and build processes around teams identity. Hardest part is balancing shifting priorities due to teams identity crisis"
good,"A typical work day was fun at times and intense at others. My team was easy to get along with which helped build lasting relationships. Mangers at times was intense, but i feel that the team is a reflection of management."
good,"JPMC is a decent place to work and get some great experience.  Definitely worth giving it a shot if you plan on going to work there.  Some manager are great and some are the worst.  Its a hit or miss.  Overall, its a good place."
good,"Enjoyed the day to day challenges.  Never worked in mortgages before.  Training was phenomenal, and coaching was beneficial.  Management was usually available to assist with any issues."
good,"Chase is a nice place to work.  Not great on advancement, but there is an ability to learn many skills in analysis, reporting and data mining. The hardest part of the job was management not supporting the team."
good,"Good day at Work"
good,"Management is inexperienced and does not follow rules for administering projects even if they are their own rules"
good,"Decent place to work if you can overlook the constant handholding from upper management. Communication was lacking in my line of business, however from talking to others, more often than not, most managers have an open door policy and are less over bearing."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful in the management role"
good,"As long as you understand that every role within the bank is a sales role, you can be successful. The supports are very good people who are looking for that type of role."
good,"Provide knowledge and resources that are leveraged across the entire spectrum of the business. "
good,This position gives a lot of flexibility when it comes to working where you are most comfortable. The management team was always there to assist in assuring that you understood what you are doing.
good,JPMC is a company that appeals to certain personality types in the technology operations realm.  To succeed in JPMC requires the individuals to have a focus and clarity that must come form within themselves.  Those who succeed the most are able to turn that inner-drive into actions that meet-up with the corporate direction.
good,"JPMorgan Chase administrative assistant position is a high stress job where you usually cover multiple managers. The best part of the job were the other admins, trainers and other employees you shared with office with. The hardest part was juggling duties for multiple managers and branches in an 8 hour period."
good,Tough demanding culture that pays for performance. Need to be on your game to succeed and put the effort in to be prepared for both internal and external meetings. Company name is synonyms with leadership and success
good,"Able to move up in the company as long as you play the corporate game. You must conform to the corporate vision, but can not rock the boat. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers."
good,"Too long- had to get up at 4 am to catch train to NYC- got home at 8 pm"
good,JPMorgan as a company was good to work for. We were short staffed and had to find efficeient processes in order to keep up with job duties. The culture was a tight net group.
good,"Pay much attention to produce training and motivational programs."
good,I enjoyed the time I had with my coworkers at Chase.   They made it fun to work there.   It depends on the type of job you had that would tell you if you are goin to have a good work life balance.
good,long hrs with competitive environment. good for younger professional who can dedicate their time/energy to work/opportunity. would not recommend to people with family
good,"This is an excellent place to refine or maintain your skills for clerical duties, and production. The people are professional, nice, and laid back. The nature of the productivity is solely based on political agendas that effect the volume of work on a daily basis, thus effecting the amount of hours and consistency of hours. The problem is that it can change on a dime from hour to hour. My expectation is to expect the unexpected there. One must be willing to change with the flow and tide everyday and not complain about it unless you want something different."
good,Lots of process. very security conscious organization. Many time zones to overcome when trying to reach out to individuals or groups. Technically superior environment.
good,"Such a small office that career advancement was extremely limited.  When I asked to take on more responsibilities, I was told that was outside of my job title."
good,"I love the culture, but I left because of poor management and low accomodations and balance to personal and work life.  I learned very much while working here."
good,"The corporate culture is very much all about ""whose is bigger than whose"". Also, managers belittling subordinates in an effort establish dominace. Very alpha male. I found that 9/10 managers operate this way."
good,"Needs better Management. No chance to be promoted. Always making changes in ways to review applications, not allowed to answer sales representative phone calls."
good,really good place to work and amazing co workers. the only downside is the amount of positions available to move up in the company. the management is good and they really listen. the hours are small so be sure of what you're getting into. but other then that its pretty amazing.
good,"I'm currently working on a strategic initiative for our Capital Markets application stack on a completely new cloud based infrastructure and technology stack. "
good,A good company to work for. They promote work/life balance but I am not sure they understand the meaning. If you are a person who prefers comfort and being content this is the place.
good,"On a daily basis, we have a Service Level Agreement/deadline with the external clients as our work revolves around financial transactions processing in fund accounting side of the investment bank. With this, I have developed a strong skill set in transactions processing and it sharpened my ability in looking into details. It has also equipped me with strong technical skills as our nature of work entails inputting accounting entries and also reconciliation."
good,"I have been working at J.P. Morgan full-time"
good,"A typical day at work consist of taking inbound calls from Customers as well as coworkers to handle and resolve the more complex calls and customer , I learn a lot from different customer from all over the world . In the 11 years I was with Chase I learned a lot about banking laws and procedures I learned how to master my probing and sales skills . I dealt with aa lot of great Managers at Chase. The hardest part of the job was listening to customer's situation and not being able to help in everyway I can . the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with and the Customers ."
good,"It was an ok company to work for. I had no choice as Washington Mutual was bought out by Chase. Management was a hit or miss. Benefits were decent, Atmosphere was of typical call center. Some room for advancement and workload was average, not too little and not too much."
good,"Peers were amazing people."
good,A great experience learning how fraud can happen and what to do to protect a company and customers.  Management work with you to further your career at Chase by enhancing your knowledge.  Weekly meetings helped with understanding the changes needed to meet your daily requirements. Culture was diverse and fair. The hardest part of the job was to finish your call in a timely manner by meeting all the requirements to profile a customer. A friendly work environment with opportunity for growth.
good,"I worked in Default Escalations a n Lewisville Tx and I loved helping the borrowers.  Unfortunately our hands were tied when it came to doing what mattered most, helping and resolving.   It was extremely stressful because of poor management.   The benefits were fantastic though.  The pay was ok but because of an increase years earlier you were priced out of other departments unless you were willing to take a hefty pay cut.  I regret leaving though"
good,"Work on projects when needed. I learned about FATCA tickets, how to create and update 1099 forms "
good,"My group was very disorganized and out of touch with current/necessary technological advancements"
good,I have learned a lot at Chase. They have great benefits. I wouldn't be leaving if it were not for budget cuts. I have had great managers threw out my career
good,Great comapny to work for with great benefits. The salary does not really refect how much work is required. Not a lot of advancement without a degree.
good,Chase is a great place to learn and to advance your career.  The key to having a successful productive work life balance at chase is to have the proper manager.  A manager that understands your value and has your back as well as a management team that supports employee development and growth for all their employees.
good,"The company offers great culture with market-leading quality of work. Interaction with knowledgeable and well-rounded peers, also helps. Awesome place to work. Lot many perks for the employees like Performance Bonus, Loyalty Bonus, Family Insurance and many more."
good,"Risk of redundancies, work you hard and never know when you are able to finish, car parking is about a ten year waiting list. Plus side physio, shop and resaturants on site"
good,Growth potential is a core value in the technology organization. There are developmental plans and wide options to follow several technical paths to achieve desired goals.
good,Amazing brand to work for. Decent work culture. Just that the employers should express their expectations from their employees more. Salary and perks should be increased.
good,"vault teller "
good,Most enjoyable part of job is working with customers in person or on the phone.  Very rewarding when you can solve customer issues on first contact.  A lot of pressure due to being understaffed.
good,"productive fast paced work environment"
good,"This Company has always been in my opinion very forward thinking and always looking to be first and best in all they do."
good,"worked there for nine years enjoyed watching the monitors to see the bank robberies, learned not to go inside a bank just do the drive thru"
good,"great benefits (5% 401k match, pension). Need to be more straight forward with employees. There is a possibility our position will be terminated at our location but we are being left in dark instead of giving us warning for our futures. Need to rank people on same perimeters. Recently they moved our production based position around and department does not have equal amount of work as other peers due to the types of files we work, but we are all ranked on the same platform"
good,"I worked one on one with customers providing service to clients wishing to trade in derivatives, stocks, and options. It was a good experience for me but I just wish that more full time opportunities were available."
good,Great Company with great perks and benefits for it's employees. Friendly and helpful staff. Great work location with easy access to waterfront and public transportation. Many different dining options surrounding work place. Nice break room for employees with many gaming options as well to help employees unwind
good,"A typical work day will be going into to work and logging in grabbing breakfast and coffee and begin work. What I learned is that it's great to always be willing to learn something new outside your job title. The management were okay, but showing partiality and favoritism can bring confusion to a work place. The hardest part of work is not being recognized for going above and beyond. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the different type of people and learning to get along with different personality."
good,"As a whole, the firms culture is phenomenal, mobility is highly given attention but it is still hard for most to make successful transitions. At a lower level, culture varies depending on the team that you are part of."
good,"Good stable work environment but the management team needs better training and not be so political. Also pay needs to improve, life work balance for the pay doesn't make sense."
good,"I worked for JP Morgan Chase for 5 years. It is a successful bank, has Excellent Training, it pays well and has good benefits. However, many have to ZigZag in and out of the company to climb up the ladder at Chase."
good,"Had to sit a lot on this job, couldn't really get up only to use the restroom.  No talking had to be very quiet. Most of the managers and people were great to work with.  If you like to have fun at the workplace this is not the place to work, processing tax returns."
good,"There can sometime be some challenges, but there is always some one to assist you when you need to get over those humps."
good,Overall the environment is good for employees. Team work is there. Flat management structure helps the work culture. Salary is not upto the mark.
good,"Previous years' flexibility allowed for greater work-life balance.  As a corporation, moving away from flexible work arrangements means less time with family, more time commuting in traffic, which led to lower overall satisfaction."
good,Everyone loves the senior leadership at the CEO/Operating Committee Level... Leader below that is questionable... many of the people that work here have been at the firm for a really long time.
good,Bank has various lines of business that require 3 levels of management to obtain an authorization to do anything. Company has great benefits if you can survive the day to day culture of requiring a authorization to get to do just about anything.
good,"The workplace is a fun friendly atmosphere. Sometimes we get goodies like tickets to sporting event, free yoga/Zumba classes, tickets to entertainment, and fun team building events."
good,JPMorgan Chase has an unlimited amount of training employees can tap into. Everything from Harvard ManageMentor courses to previous recorded training sessions. The hardest part is navigating all the different prerequisites to engage various lines of business. What I like most about my job is the ability to work with a wide range of groups that help you view issues from different perspectives.
good,"Company is good. Management is little bit difficult. However, I can't tell same for other projects. Over all I can say good."
good,its and easy going job that has a chance to meat nice people and the work well with schedules. and you do also get a 10% discount and target that is awesome.
good,High volume job with government procedure over site. Unfortunately the job was moved out of state. Chase closed its main office in Chatsworth CA. It was a great work environment and location.
good,Chase was a very interesting but productive place to work. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with all of their financial and banking needs.
good,Ability to be an agent of change responsible for working with clients to transition to the Treasury Management system.
good,l'emploi en lui meme etait tres interssant et l'entreprise m'a apporté beaucoup.
good,Overal its good. Good Training and learning and development. Work and life balance. Job culture is good. Overal its good.
good,Great Benefit...A lot to Learn... If you are willing to do hard work.... then join this company... Different experience everyday
good,"Co-workers are wonderful.  Benefits are also good.  The scale of the corporation at times makes mobility difficult.  As with other companies in this industry, job security is not the best."
good,"They treat their workers well and all breaks and lunches are nicely spaced to keep workers fresh and improve synergy. Coworkers are generally pretty great. Unfortunately the company views workers as incredibly expendable and room for advancement (even from a temporary to a permanent position) is non-existent these days. They do lots of layoffs despite being a bank that makes billions every year. Also, base pay is not excellent."
good,"new staffing model leaves much to be desired, great benefits including medical, dental, vision, 401(k), vacation and uniform allowance (WA state), need to adhere to the family/work balance they promote"
good,What I learned was to appreciate your staff and communicate constantly. A lot of misunderstandings arise when there is no communication.
good,"Typical day: leverage relationships in a matrixed environment to achieve goals; review business practices and policy through a customer lens; identify opportunities to improve processes and reduce risk"
good,"Typical day at work can be hectic, but I am used to it after 31 yrs of experience. I have learned a lot, from being a Teller , Senior Financial Representative,  and then progressing to be an Assistant Branch  Manager.I enjoyed my working with my co-workers because we were liked family based. The hardest part of the job is many hours away  from my children . My most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the Customers on a daily basis and making sure that all their needs are met and being satisfied."
good,it's a huge company  ever work with. I would like to rejoin but the problem is the shift timing. the hardest job here is face the error which is you keyed wrongly for that you have listen from the team lead & also from the manager.
good,N/A. Great place to work and learn new skills. Great location in Brooklyn. The company is growing in many business areas but internal mobility can be a challenge.
good,"I take inbound calls from customers in reference to their banking questions and concerns. I also help with online banking, overdraft fees and refunds."
good,"I worked at JP Morgan Chase at a very young age and it was a good start to my corporate life. I learned how to behave in an office setting and learned how hard i can actually push myself. I believe that there are a lot of things that Chase can improve especially when it comes to HR matters. However, the friends I made at Chase and the experience is something I will truly never forget."
good,"This is a busy company, you have to be a fast learner to be in this role, It gives you learning curves each day, the co-workers are great ."
good,"I started my career at the old JPM, where we were small and were able to customize and cater to clients needs.  I hope my next career opportunity has a camaraderie within its teams and management that supports the needs of clients with the view of the long term relationship, not just constant focus on AUM and neglecting current clients."
good,Unfortunately the management and work-life caused me to rate Chase as less than desirable.  The high pressure sales environment with and emphasis on INVESTMENTS made this job miserable.  A very high turn over rate of employees is a key sign.
good,i love the job i do because i get to help people with their financial and love to help in their problem of course always following the polices.
good,"Chase is a very Diverse fun company to work for. Typical day would include managing account balances and uncovering new balances to deepen relationship with the bank."
good,"This is a great opportunity and a great company to work for. The benefits package is awesome! Managament sucks, advancement and internal transfers opportunities are always available BUT if you're NOT interested in excessive weight gain (call center employees), schedule changes every year, and daily changes in performance/ procedures of your job then this is not the place for you."
good,"Everything is ok with Chase but mgmt seems to be the biggest factor.  This is a never ending difficult it seems with large corporations.  You get adequate time off, vacation, sick, personal, floating holidays, but sometimes they can seem to underpay people."
good,"•	Investigated and researched escalated issues for customers, monitor “N.I.C.E.” call recordings, and review work to provide coaching, feedback and positive recognition to reduce legal risk and increase customer satisfaction through positive survey scores"
good,Customer focused work environment with the best systems and support in the industry. Starting salary is on the lower end but incentive compensation will more than make up the difference.
good,"This was a temporary contract that I enjoyed and in which I learned a lot about converting and migrating old Production applications to a new central application. The pace was fast. I had to learn how the old application worked and train customers on how to navigate the new application. <the co-workers were a great team to work with, as well as the Project management at Chase."
good,I have spent 17 years with company and am ready to move out of branch banking into more challenging role.  Great co-workers and management.  The hardest part of the job was no way to advance out of branch banking.
good,"Approach potential customers that enter the branch to identify needs and sales opportunities."
good,"A typical day as a Teller is delivering exceptional customer service, by ensuring their transactions are done accurately,and carried out in both a friendly,and timely manner. "
good,"Daily sales, calls and cash management involved. "
good,The position is rewarding and provides a wide variety of duties. There is growth opportunity if willing to relocate.  Work environment could be improved.
good,"A typical day at my particular branch is opening the bank, greeting customers, and assisting them with their needs. During this process, my goal is uncover outside funds and earn their business thus bringing over those funds."
good,"I was hired at Chase as a Small Business Relationship Manager. I was in charge of four new branches that had just opened and my responsibilities where to bring in new business relationships and their balances to these new branches to help boost the branches P&L. After successfully bringing these branches along I was moved to a couple of different locations to grow their existing books and lend credit. For example; equipment financing, office equipment, stand alone lines of credit up to 100K, merchant services and online banking platforms. Chase is a very conservative bank and in '08 the bank stopped lending all together and I took a $30k pay cut, hence the move to Wells."
good,"I did my job well for 5 years but had no promotion and little bonus during that time. Team members seem to notice that the company on promoted from outside in. The job was a good fit for my reconciliation skills, but I had plateau at that area. They could not find higher ground for me even though I had management experience. Also, sometimes there did not seem to be unison in management as to the standard operating procedure. Management was also strict on no changes made to the current way things were done, even though I had proposed dozens of macros and ways to make operations more efficient."
good,"Good company to work for. I learned various processing systems and customer service techniques, along with record management retention and secured destruction procedures. I worked closely with management and co-workers to help make the process more productive."
good,"JP Morgan is a highly motivating environment and I enjoy coming to work everyday. Although the company would benefit from allowing its employees a direction for career advancement, it is ultimately up to the individual to pursue his own success."
good,"Management and colleagues are extremely qualified;"
good,Good health coverage and retirement.  Lot of opportunity to move up within the company.
good,The hardest part was not being recognized for my the work I was doing. The most enjoyable part was helping guest entering the loading dock.
good,Chase is a great place to start a career and create contacts in the financial world that will last a lifetime.
good,Ad-hoc program intended to address post 2008 foreclosure crisis. Rushed and poorly executed due to the federal government's time constraints.
good,"Result oriented, highly driven, self starter. Detailed and open to learning new things."
good,Looking to transition away from JPM due to the amount of red tape associated with its new business structure.
good,"JPM is an incredible place that has been great to me for years, but it's time to move on."
good,"Responsible for maintaining and supporting a caseload of loans currently involved in litigation and for working with Home Loans Management and the Legal Department"
good,"My typical day was checking notes, modifications, and riders to the .notes. Making sure they matched our system for servicing. Changing any errors found. My coworkers were like family. My manager was great. She was a great mentor, she cared about all of us like family. She made sure we had the training we needed to do our jobs well."
good,"It's retail, what else can I say?  Good place to work at if you need the extra cash."
good,"The job always changes, so if there is something you don't like- just wait it will change! Always have work to do"
good,"Great platform"
good,It was a very good experience in mortgage. the work environment is ok but training needs to be more formal and explanatory.
good,"Manage portfolios for high net worth clients"
good,"In Whole JP Morgan Chase is a strong organization and I am proud to be part.  However, the managers are lack of management skill since their from a ""collection shop""  job ethic and professionalism are very poor at the operational level."
good,".good work experience, but no work life balance. its a best organisation for freshers"
good,Great company to learn retail banking.  Advance opportunities available to top performers and those able to relocate.
good,"Working at JPM was a wonderful learning experience. Each and everyday I was exposed to a new challenge. Whether it be a new market dynamic or a new responsibility within the desk, I have entered everyday with the same focus and drive to ensure my growth."
good,Good company to work for but the management teams are not what hey should be. At least not all of them.
good,helping customer with daily deposits and withdrawals. I had a few positions at chase but never felt like it was a career it always felt like a job.
good,In a typical day at work - there were none. Each individual that started off as a Temp agent as  i did worked hard. All of the processes that I've learned to keep me employed there such an amount of time lead to my tools of success.
good,"Pay and Benefits are good, I enjoy working at a fast paced, multitasking environment  so this is a place that offers that along with a degree of freedom to plan your own work day and schedule"
good,A typical day at JP Morgan Chase was fast paced.  I worked in  call center where calls came in back to back.  This job was interesting.  Was great assistant customers and handling their inquires.
good,"paralegal duties and banking skills "
good,"Overseeing the loan modification process had a major impact on me as an individual. I saw the pros and cons to banking and loans. I saw people get themselves into some very serious debt, yet I also saw customers just fall into hard times. That made me want to help and speed the process along. I wanted to be another positive part of what JP Morgan Chase was trying to accomplish."
good,"Loan review and submission. Contact customers to  clear stipulations and for underwriting conditions. Order the necessary required documents or items needed to facilitate the loans. Ex. Title commitments, insurance, flood certs, Trust approval, subordinations. "
good,Great company with very helpful staff on anything that may be needed
good,"a typical day at work: working 24*7 without getting extra money"
good,"I have worked for Chase for almost ten years. The benefits are great. The area I work in is really focused on production and meeting service level agreements. More recently I have been trying to advance, but I have not been able to. I would like to see more opportunity for advancement in my particular area."
good,"The job site closed, was a good work experience. Learned about banking operations."
good,"The desired production and quality numbers passed down from the Coporate decision makers can be very difficult to meet, and at times seem unattainable.  This lead to some team members believing that the decision makers for the company are not in touch with the working conditions for the employees."
good,"Taking ownership of other team members workload, provide support inside/outside of the company, Participate in projects when presented, and work with Banks & Market teams."
good,"A typical day at the Chase call center involved takings several calls in a day from customers and branch bankers alike. I would help with any problems or questions that were brought up and resolved them quickly and efficiently.  I learned how to provide excellent customer service on a consistent basis.  Management at times was good but for the most part they were not willing to be flexible with our needs as employees and individuals. Co-workers were great people who also had a mind set of striving for excellence.  The hardest part of the job was the peak hours or when some online systems would not function correctly for Chase on a company wide levels, which complicated solution finding extremely.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the team aspect with my co-workers."
good,"  The environment was charged, energetic and challenging. There were no two days that were the same. It was like swimming in a shark thank. One could not fall asleep or not keep moving at the expense of being eaten. The noise was loud and intense, the ideal place for an adrenalin junkie!"
good,"typical work day began with team huddle, then off to help fit customers into the correct products. Coworkers were always eager to help customers. Management was fairly responsive to issues, customer and employee needs."
good,"a lot of  tthings where you can learn"
good,Good Company to work for and make a career of it. Some management needs to be look at. There are managers who are not supposed to be. Liked that you could ask for help and anyone can assist. Co-workers are very friendly.
good,I Loved working for JP Morgan and enjoyed my job. I started at one branch and was transfered a little over a month later. At my new branch it was more of a spanish speaking area. I recieved the same amount of hours in the begining as I had at the previous branch but once one of the girl went on matunity leave it was all over the place. Some weeks it was more and the others it was less. I was hired on as a 20hr/weekly worker. I was okay with this until they planned in hiring on new people to work more hours than I would. I pushed for them to give me the extra hours but instead they hire a spanish speaker to have 10 more hours then I worked and wanted me to train him. I decided I didn't mind because I wanted to go back to school. When I asked for a set schedule they said it wasn't possible. So it was no longer for me.
good,if you apply yourself you will rise to the top. better chance of long tern career here compared to other banks
good,"I really enjoyed working here, but mainly when I was working with the actual customers. The hardest part of the job was actually going to work knowing that you were not making enough money for all that you do. Here it is all about politics and who you know, not what you know. I miss how much cheaper the benefits are."
good,"The pay is decent and you get to work with cool people. Nevertheless, it is a sales environment with an emphasis on customer service and if you want to make progress in your banking career, you better feel comfortable attaining your referral goals. Overall, it is a great starter to help you realize what you want to do for the rest of your life."
good,My day at work is always different with many new challenges from clients and from overall business changes. I felt that we all worked well together as a team to get the task accomplished no matter how big or how tall.
good,Typical day involves meetings.
good,i personally enjoyed my time at jp. morgan chase. as a part-time teller. The co- workers i have are very nice and respectful as well as the managers. I really enjoyed meeting new people and helping them solve their problems regarding the monotary problems.
good,"When you go in every day, the manager tries to up lift you with great expectations that are not realistic. Then you talk to every customer that goes in by working the lobby. Getting everyone that walks through the door to sit at your desk is the priority and if you don't you get talked to about it."
good,"A typical day includes data entry and customer service skills. Through my position here I learned different tactics to improve my goals, especially in sales. The management style differs from branch to branch, my coworkers were always positive and always trying to step up their game with customer service as this was the main goal for the company. The hardest part of the job was the constant sales pressure for the tellers especially. Many people know the name of the game and it made it hard to have customers meet with our bankers for more information on products we had to offer."
good,"High stress job with less work life balance, but the company provides excellent benefits."
good,I enjoy working at Chase. It is overall good company that offers opportunities for growth.
good,At Chase in the Branch Technology department the main priority is answering incoming phone calls from branch locations. We supported systems and hardware for the branches.
good,"A very Good learning environment. What I learned during my 5 yrs tenure is to be agile and adaptable, since my reporting managers kept changing constantly and so were the styles of managing the duties."
good,strong in the banking industry and alot of high paced work enviroment
good,I manage a pipeline of 130 loans. I handle probably 20% of it every day. The training offered by the company is really good. My co-workers are team players. Te hardest part of my job is completing all the deliverables in a timely manner everyday since the work flow is really heavy. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to changes people's lives saving their homes.
good,"Yes, i find this job bit difficult in the initial stage but later part i find that this job is already set just we need to follow the procedures later part the job seems to be boring because you cannot expect any new things in your work. But i am looking for the job which gives full information regarding the job that is end-end process where you can get all the knowledge regarding process.Anyway it was an good experience with jpmorgan i got confidence on myself that i can survive anywhere. Actually i had very good co-workers they helped me a lot and about management i do not want to say anything."
good,"I worked in the temp division of Chase in Mortgage Operations. It was flexible and I had great managers, until I switched to the quality control division with micro-managers. The rate of pay was pretty good, but there are no benefits for temp work (common). You have up to a year to work with Chase Works, but you can post out for permanent jobs after six months. Chase is just way too big of a company for me. Sometimes it's kind of hard to keep abreast of what's going on within the company. HR is kind of inacessible because it's kind of like a call center environment and it has automated functions too. The reps often times don't know what's going on and you're put on hold or transferred quite a bit. I wouldn't expect this from an HR department. Overall, Chase is good because it's a stable, reputable company that offers many different career paths. I think they are one of best companies to find a job given the economic climate."
good,The company is a great place to work. Management is strong and I have grown with the bank since I graduated college.
good,A typical involves responding to a multitude of inquiries from bankers on regulatory issues.
good,the work you did was rushed and had to be done with a specific percentage of accuracy. The management was horrible and very belittling but the surrounding workers were great. No advancement in the company within the last four years. The job stays temporary.
good,"Reviewed a portfolio of accounts, reviewed complaints, researched accounts to ensure all issues have been addressed. Enjoyed working with positive people, and learned to be an agent of change."
good,"typical day at work would basically include performing outbound calls to MLOs who have not fulfilled federal registration requirements, if applicable"
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working for Chase. I leard so much about banking and finance, and appreciate the time I had there."
good,Working within the banking and mortgage field has its ups and down. It was very demanding.
good,"A typical day at work, would consist of working at, Ontario Airport at a kiosk. We would, reach out to the public to meet daily quota. The hardest part of the job would be, Visa card sign up, in this economy. Most enjoyable part was I was constantly learning new sales tactics."
good,"Very strong company, that has a good compensation plan. Difficult to be cross-trained and promoted to new positions."
good,i enjoyed working at the bank for the past 3 years.. it is a fun environment and the customers are really nice.
good,"if you are a licensed banker (series 6, 63, life & health) your bread and butter will be investment accounts, mortgages, and business accounts."
good,Bank has the best products and systems. They spend a lot of money on marketing and giving a great customer experience. The one biggest problem is the company doesnt pay well in the salary department.
good,Being open to fast place environment that is production based first and family friendly second. Make sure also that you have a good understanding of what is expected from you as an employee and what you expect from the management
good,"The KYC team at JPM over the 9 years I have been in that position, has seen a large turn over of people due to poor mid level and senior management. Most managers do not know the average workflow of completing a KYC record. They were not open to their employees giving feed back on how to make the process work better and achieve efficiency."
good,I have worked for chase 10 years and I absolutely loved it I’m just looking to try something different chase has part time full benefits as well and health insurance too
good,Clear path to grow and get promoted. Surrounded by smart people and great networking opportunities. Very stable environment (most responsibilities are established)
good,Definitely a team effort type of job. Everyone is an important asset in the branch. The workplace culture is calm. Many opportunities for growth and great benefits! Helped me pay for college.
good,"Good exposure."
good,Selsoft Inc is a good company to work with. The management team is very approachable. Admin and HR teams are  open with prompt communications and reminders.
good,Was fired for speaking the truth. It's sad that you don't have a freedom of speech when something goes wrong within the company.  My own manager never submitted the documents inregards to certain information.  Manager informed me when will when she gets a chance but dont miss any more days of work which I didn't miss. The moment we had a town hall and I spoke up and asked questions I was fired the same night. It's sad but life happens. Met alot of great people. But life goes on.
good,A great place to work.  The company is very diverse excellent people to work with. I would recommend the company to apply for. Cons every quarter its a lay off never know if you going to have a job.
good,I learn a lot from this company how you needed to manage everything according to the demmands at the same time you wanna have a good growth in the company.
good,JP Morgan has a wide variety of career options available. They also have great benefits and one of the best vacation plans than any other organization out there.
good,I honestly enjoy working in the JP Morgan Chase compliance department I have learned many aspects of anti-money laundering and how it affect individuals as well as businesses.
good,"Excellent coworkers, but poor management, they don’t give you more hour their prefer bring people from other branch. Their put to work four hour per day."
good,Learned a lot about investment banking and fund accounting. Fulfilling work everyday. Grow and develop as an individual and as a professional. Would definitely recommend my friends to work there.
good,Had good working experience with JPMC which was productive and provided strong work experience in implementing enhancements to the existing commercial card products.
good,Great place to work. Great culture & a stable organisation. Great for long time career prospects with lots of opportunities to explore. Driven by great values & principles.
good,"The company is focused on process and control deploying the latest technologies to provide services and manage resources in a large, global technology environment."
good,"You have the ability to get as far as your choice in department allows. Before starting in a new role do research on the management and overall employee morale. sometimes no matter how skilled and efficient you are it may not be enough for the changes made to ""improve business need"""
good,"Most executives don't take the time to get to know their employees in order to adequately access their value.  In seeking employment with JPM, be sure to solicit candid feedback from existing employees about the management team you will work under.  Good managers do exist, but they are becoming a dying breed.  The new managers treat you more as a number, than a human being."
good,It is a good company to work for. People are respected as individuals. Merit is the only criteria to progress in the company. Firm also gives enough opportunity for the mobility across the regions.
good,"A typical day as a PCB will be going over the Plan of the Day with your manager, going over what calls you will be making and what appointments you have. Client Central is their new tool, it's a lead system that tracks your every move, even idle time. I have a great manager that lets me do my thing and I am very successful. I hear horror stories from other branches being micromanaged by unqualified managers. It's a 40 hour week sales job, great bonuses if you can hit them. Bad bankers make $60k, good ones make $80k-$100k. Chase is changing for the worse, converting traditional branches to ""companion"" branches, squeezing people out who will never make enough money to survive. Low salaries, under $40k base but they give new hires 1 year $1000 monthly bonus to get started. Market Directors are phony, never really hear from the upper management in South Florida. Benefits are decent, lots of time off and sick time. All products you sell have a point system called PVC's and grid payouts get paid monthly. Referring to branch partners other than the FA are useless, mortgage officers are being laid off and going to a call center system. Bring in investments and new money to the bank make you money, rest of it is a waste of time and no money."
good,"I had lots of fun working with peers and managers at JPMorgan.  I would strongly recommend people to seek employment with Chase.  If place and location became available, I would apply again!"
good,"JPMorgan was a great learning experience. There is an amazing team environment,. The management makes your work days very relaxed but still very productive."
good,Large environment with plenty of opportunity to learn more skills. Highly skilled people and a collaborative environment. They company has a very large IT staff and mobility is encouraged.
good,"It was a learning experience with knowledgeable staff and good leadership. Management where there for you at any time of need, open minded down to earth individuals."
good,JPM offers a wide variety of options for a career path. The company overall is a great place to work. JPM tends to promote a work life balance to encourage working parents and others that there is life outside of work that is just as important.
good,Can be difficult to get promoted. Depends on your manager. Smart employees. If you're in the right group you can gain a lot of experience. In some groups you receive too much work and don't have a chance to learn new skills.
good,"Constantly changing environment fast paced, need to be comfortable with change as it happens often never the same day twice.  Always coming up with new ideas."
good,JPMorgan is a great place to learn and build a career.  Entry-level employees have many opportunities to change roles and grow their careers.  Senior-level employees benefit from the high-performance culture.
good,Good place to build a career.  Company offers many growth and learning opportunities.  Great people to work with.  Opportunity for improvement for a better work/family balance and more work flex options should be provided.
good,"Meetings and follow-up.  Structured communications.  Large company, required strong communications, diligent follow-up and documentation.   Typical challenges creating and driving change in a large organization."
good,No Comment at this time at this time I am currently employed and although I like my job I have been in banking here for many years and am looking for a challenge as well as pay increase
good,Good place to work overall. High quality people.  Great upper management. Very political.  Nice office.  Think that all business is due to the JPM name.
good,"It really depends on what department you work, but overall it is a great company. Great benefits, vacation and health. You make more money if you are hired from outside."
good,"Great benefits package and pay. Change is frequent so you will need to adapt and adjust quickly. Overall great work environment, management fairly hands off once you have a handle on the Job requirements."
good,I am not going to write an actual review I am just typing in the spaces.  This should not be a mandatory component of completing this exercise and posting.
good,"Good management team."
good,One has to know what they want to do as a career when it comes to working at Chase.  The employment opportunities are vast as are the pay variances.  The jobs range from fair workloads with high compensation to almost sweatshop type workloads for nominal pay.  Chose wisely.
good,Very quick paced and intense job environment . I loved the challenge and intensity it brought to me. Management gave us that push and encouraged us to meet our monthly expectations.
good,Chase was good and bad during my time there.  I don’t want to over disclose information.   I moved on from Chase.  Overall I benefited from my time there.
good,"A very good company to work with, the people does not make me feel aloof. There are a lot to learn and so much time to spend. I will definitely recommend working for this company."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chase and learned a lot about myself and how to be a successful leader and roll model. I met a lot of people who I would call a friend, who helped me and become the person I am today. Chase is a good company and I am honored to say I was part of the firm."
good,The location in legacy west is amazing. The medical insurance is pretty good. Work life balance is pretty good. The location is so nice. The buildings are clean
good,"its actually an okay job (salary wise) for a single person like me but you have to be prepared for the kind of environment you have to be in every single day since my account is under the Claims Department. You have to have a lot of patience to some (if not, mostly) difficult clients every call. You also have to be mindful of your time as the account have a required maximum time per call to reach certain targets. At most times, it can be quite exhausting to receive calls from angry customers most of the time & even quite difficult especially if you have a TL who is pretty much bent on making your shift much more of a struggle (but of course, not all TL's are the same). Management is approachable and listens to feed backs but doesn't do much improvement on those opportunities which is a waste."
good,Productive and fun place to work! Truly enjoyed working for this employer. I had the opportunity to work daily with great managers and talented employees.
good,"The management team creates an environment that helps you grow within the company. Also, there are always multiple opportunities and ways to learn new skills."
good,Very dynamic and fast pace.  You get used to working with a very young group who are not that seasoned but they are full of potential.  It is up to you to train them and mold them in becoming good at what they are doing.
good,"good place to work, management is good, people who work here are good , customers are the hardest part of the workplace. Salary is good as well, good entry level positions."
good,Large company with many moving parts.  Smart people to work with. Benefits are ok but could be better given its wealth. Many locations to work from globally.
good,High paced working environment and competitive culture with smart people. Very good CEO with a focus on social impact and being the first in the industry
good,"Use tuition reimbursement to earn an MBA or complete the CFA if you want to experience substantial career growth and job security.  Otherwise, learn all that you can and move on."
good,Good place as long as you are work on controlled environment where you have to follow lengthy processes and red tape even to get a small change into production.
good,This company has great benefits and a good work/life balance.  Employees are offered benefits and flexibility that make it easy to find balance.  The dress code is casual.
good,"I have been working with Chase for over a year. Chase offers a variety of benefits to their employees. Flexible working hours, as long as you can finish your assignments."
good,A very innovative company with excellent benefits that provided me the opportunity to learn and apply my educational knowledge to assist my customers.
good,We had a cafeteria with a game room. You could play games on your lunch hour. I learned how to deal with angry customers. The hardest part of the job was when customers curse you out & hang up on you.The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers was happy that their issue was resolved.
good,As long as you stay on task and pace yourself everything is fine. I enjoy working there and the benefits are great. I learned a lot there and enjoyed the people there.
good,"Good working environment, lack of job security. Positive learning culture, limited exposure to other teams. Great for new hires and experienced professionals alike."
good,"uscis application ready and send to uscis location to mail out. all kind of application came to processing citizen ship, allien residance, h4 visa, Daca application, employment authrozation card apply and reniew . 539 application, and lot of different kind of code using for processing and mailing"
good,"Remote programming of security equipment"
good,the work is fast-paced and you learn a lot. everyday was something new and i enjoyed it from dealing with internal partners to investigating externally.
good,Great employees but overbearing management. Policies detrimental to efficient production. Company more concerned with being politically correct than rewarding employee accomplishements.
good,I enjoyed my time at Jp Morgan it was a great experience. Wouldnt say everyday was peachy but it was challenging and fun. Had frequent layoffs and management shifts  that affected the teams but overall it was a kool job while it lasted. I would work there again. and just like any other job its still corporate america. #playthegame
good,"During my time at JPMorgan Chase, I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge about investment banking, products and working with a variety of functional business partners."
good,"Since this was my first job out of college, I learned a lot about corporate relationships, time management, and specifics of the positions I was exposed to."
good,"JP Morgan is a wonderful firm. The firm provides educational and leadership opportunities, parental leave, paid vacation, flex and remote work opportunities."
good,Was a good temp job while it lasted. Was contracted through a company to work for IBM for support to JPMorgan. They pulled the plug after year and a half.
good,"Chase provides great benefits (Health, retirement and so on) but that's where it ends. Benefits for those under a certain pay are where they feel it balances out. There are certain people that treat you as more then just a number."
good,I truly don't have anything positive here.  The managers have favorites that can get away with doing nothing.  And get complimented for doing nothing.
good,I enjoyed working with New clients everyday. Very professional work environment with a vast array of financial products and professional support. There was too much employee and managerial turnover making it difficult to manage expectations.
good,"I love working at JPMorgan Chase and we all work as a team together . Though we have had short staff for sometime now, it’s hard to only work part-time ."
good,"Loved doing events at Bloomberg, because I understood clients as well as the staff. The hardest part of the job was the hours. It varied every week so it was very hard to maintain steady paycheck."
good,"Typical day @ work consists of marketing with Current & Prospected Dealers. Managing Individual portfolio with a great deal of success."
good,Good place to work at as long as you follow basic simple guidelines you will be fine. to really shine here you need to speak up and go above and beyond and sometimes that will get you somewhere.
good,"Typical bank. Lots of reports, data, travel arrangements. EA's never typically leave jobs like this. Normal hours, cafeteria on premises. Huge office, many divisions."
good,"This environment was a excellent working organization.  The workers are accessed against each other to see who were the weakest and strongest preforming individuals."
good,"Good leader and good structure.  High efficient even sometime lag behind than other international bank. Overall, very valuable company in the market to work on."
good,"I enjoyed my time working in JPMC."
good,"Its a great company to work for,  good benefits and good opportunities available to advance your career.  Networking events offered by the business resource groups"
good,"JP Morgan Chase Bank has been my favorite employer and favorite financial institution to be both a customer and an employee.  However there is much room for improvement when it comes to monetary compensation, advancement opportunities/access and direct management."
good,I liked that we were trained and had a class every single time that something new was presented to us.  If we missed a training class we were able to make it up.  There was a lot of transparency there so it was rare when we were surprised.  We had a few snow days where if we didn't feel safe driving we didn't have to go in.  The pay was lower than I would have liked and was surprised that most of us did not get a raise.
good,"Lot of bureaucracy which is lowing down nimbleness. Good platform and cutting edge technology. ED level does not have much insight of business, which I think they should."
good,A good place to work. Provides a positive work environment with opportunities for growth and advancement with competitive compensation.  a typical day is full of challenges.
good,Management staff is willing to work with you on what  hours you are available.  Able to leave early if there was an emergency situation with children.
good,"Great place to work with lots of opportunities. For anyone interested in banking, there are definitely many different types of roles to experience during a career with JPMC."
good,Working with JP Morgan was a good experience. I got to learn a lot and had really good and helpful colleagues. They have a good infrastructure and for full timers. there are growth opportunities.
good,JP Morgan was a exciting and challenging place to work.  Management gave employees a great deal of latitude and responsibility in allowing managers to run business teams.  I enjoyed all of my years working there.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed for this company ,I have learned so much. The job was very tough and the company expects a lot from you, however if you can deliver it can be very rewarding"
good,"I had a bad manager which made this job annoying, opportunity for advancement, Great benefits, easy job, pay is okay for the amount of hours spent at work."
good,"I left UBS Wealth Management in 2004 due to cummunting after the closure of Columbus, GA  office."
good,"Excellent benefits,dental and vision.Learned more about customer service and satisfaction.Enjoy assisting customers,and weekly meeting to demonstrate functions and responsibilities of each departments."
good,I enjoyed working for Chase Bank as an account manager. I didn't like that there were no options to advance and the pay wasn't appropriate for the position but over all it is a good company.
good,untimely left this position because my bosses were jealous of my rapid advancement and tried to put a stop to it by not giving the proper time off (per the family medical leave act) when i had my wisdom teeth pulled and they wanted me just to use pto. the pto had been used earlier in the year and this caused me to have absences and ultimately i had to many and they wanted to fire me. i literally had a doctors note and had talked tot he upper management several times about it but the didnt care. they tried to fire me and instead i walked out with my pride.
good,"Great place to work where management cares about employee experience, strives to provide the right tools for everyone to use and improve speed to market by breaking down barriers to success."
good,"Great place to work where management cares about employee experience, strives to provide the right tools for everyone to use and improve speed to market by breaking down barriers to success."
good,"Great place to work where management cares about employee experience, strives to provide the right tools for everyone to use and improve speed to market by breaking down barriers to success."
good,"Great place to work where management cares about employee experience, strives to provide the right tools for everyone to use and improve speed to market by breaking down barriers to success."
good,"Chase is not a bad place to work just very strict on quality. And they are always changing the rules. They have a saying that the ""c"" in Chase stands for change."
good,"Its a really good job, good company and good people. I would recommend anyone to work in this wonderful company. I have had a great time so far and look forward to amazing times."
good,Chase was a great bank to work for. I liked my freedom and outside better. I like to work hard and make great money. Growth and financial freedom is very important to me.
good,"it's really all dependent on who you know with this company. Many people hired are referrals from others, many in the same family or community. Upper management is pretty out of touch with most branches besides their top performing ones. They say they like to promote from within, but rarely do it unless you're a minority. Your best bet to succeed here is to get hired at one of the four to five top performing branches in the area. Otherwise, you'll blow in the wind"
good,Chase Bank aims to provide excellent customer experience. There is a level of trust which comes with the Chase Brand. They  focus on putting customers first and doing the right thing for the customers.
good,Energetic and productive work environment. Some long hours as per the role are there but manageable. Very strong employee oriented and approachable management
good,They offer some of the best training and are obsessed with personal growth. The most difficult part of this job is a lack of communication from the back office.
good,"Good base salary, but you are expected to push products to every client who walks in.  They have a very good training program however they need to emphasis more on ensuring their personal bankers understand the products they are expected to sell and there impact on banking customers as to avoid suggesting inappropriate products."
good,High demand and great benefits.. can be very stressful. The moral and culture is not the best. Definitely need to increase more minorities in management.
good,"Participation in major regulatory projects that have a business impact, ensuring that changes are appropriately embedded in the business. Ensure effective implementation of all new compliance policies."
good,"Our team made a unique working experience, we supported each other. Huddle or IM on a daily basis to share information and review our loans and request input"
good,Worked as a teller while finishing my degree. They are very customer oriented and overall great atmosphere in my branch. My first raise was 7 cents. All in all my raise was 50 cents in all the 4 years that I worked for chase. They do have great benefits for part timers. Dental and medical
good,"25 years working for Chase. Its always a moving target in the mortgage industry. Currently the market is missing inventory and it negatively impacts ability to produce loans. The menu is getting smaller each year, and even with hard work we are missing our personal goals. I love the industry, but want to do more."
good,The company doesn’t give raises to the bankers they think the commission should be enough . Not enough room for growth in California . Less workers and no raises .
good,"Love the work I do, but the lack of support from management is the unfortunate part of the company. More support from the people that you are working for would maximize the work environment."
good,"Maybe it's a thing for all companies, but JPMC does not provide any increase in compensation for internal movements. They promote, and very well, internal mobility programs, but in current environment, not paying well or providing increases in pay creates a tremendous amount of turn over. This might very well be by design, but out of all things, I feel that talent retention is something that JPMC can improve upon."
good,"I did a 1 week placement as work experience for JPMorgan. The staff there were all very friendly. The job itself wasn't for me however, the experience provided a good insight into the company and the surrounding economy."
good,"Chase is a great place to work if you’re beginning a career in banking. There is room for growth if management wants you to grow.  . There’s a lot of politics. Management uses employees to do their job, handling customer complaints and revising emails/documents. Most managers do not hold a college degree and hinder employees from furthering their education or promoting within the company. Some managers are lazy, incapable of doing their job and hardly spends time in the branch."
good,"By tune-out job, I mean it is something where you can learn to type what your eyes see while your mind is on other things or while listening to something on your ipod shuffle or cd player/radio."
good,"Good Company but slow internal growth. Need to go out of the company to get the required title, and better growth."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"The company offered a low pay relative to the cost of living in New York. In addition, upward mobility was limited in the role of Personal Banker at the company."
good,Great branch is key to success. Revolving door of managers with extreme personalities.  Do not count on management to actually support you however the internal systems with hard work you are able to control your own success
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for with great learning opportunities and a great management team to help you with whatever you need including friendship.
good,"work life balance is great and respect management style,  the most enjoyable part is the systems are great to work with . A typical day at work all about our clients."
good,"good work environment, i feel its a good place to learn basic skills and progress in your career, they give you opportunity to become whatever you want to be"
good,"I think the only real thing I am upset about is how I was downsized. I would have liked the opportunity to have tried another area but no matter how many applications I put in, I was never interviewed."
good,Most Days start at your own pace in an upper managerial position. below that you begin work usually right away very quickly and depending on your supervisor you have high to medium autonomy to conduct yourself according to your own ability.
good,great place to begin career in financial services; company expects a lot from its people but rewards all in the process; challenging work environment as the job comes first
good,"Brilliant place to work, would arrive with all the enthusiasm in the world and have a great day ahead of me to look forward to, working with very fun and supportive colleagues!"
good,I worked third shift. But it was pretty easy busy work for the most part. Co-workers were fun to get along with and able to socialize as long as your machine was running and you didn't over flow the work.
good,learned a lot. great company but some of the managers where not the best to work for but what can you expect. other than that i enjoyed my time working there
good,"Though I had to leave for personal reasons, I enjoyed my time with Chase. In the end it became hard to get promotions and job advances because of my salary, so I started to feel stuck in the position I was in because it was move and take a pay cut or wait until a position became available that didn't require a pay cut."
good,good benefits great opp to get your foot in the door. Great team work and leadership is fair; top level managment is scare and the company can run on its own for the most part
good,Very strong player in the financial service industry.  You always know what the expectations are and are asked to consistently perform at a high level.
good,"Great place overall, just a few minor issues within teams that did not allow all to be treated agents trained the same.  If there was an opportunity, I'd go back!"
good,"It was a significant project with challenges, which made me learn a lot from the project, such as analytical ability. In addition, I learned how to use different information and source such as Yahoo Finance and Wall Street Journal. I also learned how to predict the stock value of target company."
good,JP Morgan is an interesting place to work with a multicultural workforce.  A typical day is extremely busy dealing with all aspects of account opening.
good,Overall experience at JPMorgan Chase was good with opportunities for professional growth and development given ample training opportunities and mobility options across the company.
good,"Working here was not for the faint of heart -- long hours and intense pressure from bankers, but it was a great experience and I learned a tremendous amount in a short period of time"
good,hard to get promoted in company unless there for several years. work wit schedule for the most part but down size and want you to do more jobs than they pay you for
good,This place was great to work. The company and people in my group were great. The dept was well organized and we did our jobs without people micro managing us.
good,Professional and open minded management teams.  Open to process improvements and change.  Excellent  in maintaining monthly and annual reviews for all staff.
good,"I enjoyed working at JPMorgan Chase. This is a large corporation that is growing and provides opportunities for growth, advancement and a broad networking community."
good,It was a good company to work for but it would have been better if they had paid some of the employees a more fairer living wages and offered more time off for us. I enjoyed learning alot of different things there and felt I grew as a person as well.
good,great place bad management. i worked at jersey city branch off christopher columbus and everyone was great except for alejandro the manager. he needs to go so the branch and thrive
good,"Chase has been a good place to work. Work life balance has been a great perk of working at Chase. "
good,"100% phone work assisting customers with accuracy and proficiency. The company is family oriented and cares about employees. The management would assist and couch you for better team results. Work place is diversed. It is difficult to receive new updates daily but it the world of collections. the most enjoyable part of the job, was all of the nice people you talk to."
good,"just was interesting learning about 401K rollovers .IRA's and interacting with Financial Advisor, Chase Bank is up to speed with updated technology . had a great experience overall as a little stressful as every guest needs to be taking care in a timely manner"
good,"schedule appointments for the next day"
good,It's a great place to work. I was able to learn customer service skills along with gaining call center experience. I was able to have a flexible schedule so that I could attend school.
good,"Really loved this job!  Learned a lot from this company as I was there for many years. Back office support was just a phone call away.  Chase is very honest and does the right thing  with customers interests in mind.   The Chase atmosphere has changed and most days are spent performing several jobs which used to take two or three employees, therefore never really catching your breath.  Pay is not competitive which is rather unfortunate."
good,The company has great growth potential as training has become a big part of the companies goal.  This allows the company to do a lot of hiring from within.
good,"Administrative duties to Manpower (Recruiting services). Updated onboarding packets, handled large volumes of client and employee confidential information, worked with Bank on Tax processing during major tax seasons."
good,"Chase is a good company, but most of the positions are over worked and under paid. The Raises do not cover the increases in the cost of living. Overall, ok to work for."
good,"Your experience with Chase will depend on what department you are in.  The management in each department is completely different and so are the guidelines expected of each employee.  I stayed at Chase simply for the benefits, I was not compensated enough for the work I did, no one in my department was.  I remember having a team meeting and someone speaking about the pay and they were told ""well you can always go find another job""."
good,"Company is stable, offers resources for employee development, benefits geared for secure retirement,  extremely challenging environment.,  with extensive  diversity in workplace culture, enhances ability to be multi dimensional in job tasking"
good,"learned about bankruptcy and how to process PCN's, got good qc reviews on work and was able to learn how to do reporting. management is good can be tough but always wiling to help"
good,"Most areas find it difficult to progress in their career.  Employees find themselves leaving the company to get a promotion and having to return to get the pay the deserve.  Very odd business practice."
good,High expectation and requirement for working and production standards.  Requirement for dedication and working styles to be incorporated from company ethos.
good,"Very good company to work if you starting your career at Banking industry. Depends lot of Area where your branch is located,in order to get paid decent incentive. Base salary is low if you staying with company for a while, and growth within company is very limited ."
good,"The work assignment was unrealistic given that the management wanted to completely replace their Commercial Paper processing system rather than retrofit it to work in the Y2K."
good,Chase is a good company to work for if you are starting new career they train you to be the best at your position. They provide great benefits and perks.
good,"The job and the company were great they provide awesome benefits and great training. However management is very poor. They try and cut tellers with machines, yet most older clientele do not use them. Management is very demanding of quicker paces and often don’t remember how it is to be a teller and in charge of most of the cash transactions. I was hired as a part-time worker, but was pulling full-time hours of with none of the same benefits or wage. If you’re a student please be 100% sure your manager is behind you or else it will end wrong. Don’t be afraid to speak up. Managers often abuse your confusion on policy in order to get what they need from you."
good,It was 2008 when economy was already hazy and going down.  It was transitional time  from Bank of New York to Chase in an industrial area in the midst of many other competing bank branches.
good,Worked from home as consultant so many of your questions don't apply. Responsible for making deadlines and setting up my own travel which was extensive.
good,Great opportunity to learn but poor work/life balance.  Brilliant coworkers committed to quality but also off the chart on office politics.  Opportunity to do anything.
good,"Good company to work for depending on the department. Senior management was very helpful, direct management didn't foster growth opportunities or career paths."
good,Good company to work with compensation is good but the work life balance is not there they expect you to work for more than 10 hours or so otherwise it good to work with.
good,"The ""replacement"" management regime was keen to take advantage of the climate at the time and only seemed to care about college graduates with NO EXPERIENCE.  They routinely catered to, and placed these individuals in management rotation roles leaving others, especially long term employees to feel unappreciated.  This seemed to impact how consultants, contractors were treated when in most cases they were closest to the BAU projects and worked closely with veteran, highly skilled, and sadly highly unhappy FTE's."
good,JP Morgan had a wonderful benefit program. Paid time off was offered and there was a great compensation to start off with. I have would recommend this job to anyone who loves client service.
good,"Great place to work. Advancement is slow.  However if you stick with it, it will pay off.  More than likely you would begin on the phones, but after time departments move and other opportunities arrive"
good,Good company.  I have enjoyed my time at JPMC.  Great deal of internal mobility opportunity.  Competitive environment that requires a serious committment to be successful
good,Started my career with the company and held various roles.  They help train and develop employees so they can continue their advancement throughout their careers.
good,Lots of opportunities to learn and POC new technologies. Growth as an individual is place as a high priority with supporting efforts for team building.
good,"I treat everyone on my team fair, i am open minded. We try to make the work place a fun place to work. I pull daily production and quality reports for my team. We have team huddles 3 times a week."
good,"Worked there many years ago. Not too sure what today's world is like. Pretty busy workloads, flexible schedules, and provided decent work life balance."
good,"I worked In the Special collections for the auto loan department. Worked in a laid back environment, monitored accounts on our own and took between 8-12 incoming calls a day. Helped out on overflow calls for other departments when needed. Management was easy to get along with and was helpful for the most part. The hardest part of the job was to stay motivated, doing the same thing day after day in an out was a little hard. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with."
good,"Great hours but there was no room for advancement unless the leadership team liked you. The pay was great, training was exspectional.  It was an overall great experience and working environment."
good,"The supervisor was horrible but the branch manager was awesome.  I didnt mind working there, it was a fast based and wouldnt mind working there again with the exception of the supervisor"
good,"I enjoyed working there for almost 7 years. Got effected with Job Elimination. I would have definitely continued working for many years If I was not effected by my job being eliminated. For me personally, JPMorgan Chase was the best place I worked at."
good,"• Played a vital role in handling client calls, resolving issues at the point of contact."
good,Okay place to work still have room for growth team leads and supervisor can be very rude and mean for no reason want you to do things in a box belittle you for no reason
good,"Great job if you like working alone with little supervision & enjoy research and utilizing analytical skills. Very little phone time required but when outbound call necessary, must go by scripting."
good,A typical day in the call center is ran efficiency. You're expected to adhere to your schedule at all times and to make sure that's customers are the first priority. While working with Chase I've learned quite a bit but the main thing I will take away is to always go after what you want and not to settle.
good,"My day would consist of performing daily audits from my co-workers, receive phone calls from agents requesting to be paid for work that was done, and there were daily training."
good,"I don't have a review about my position at the company, other than it was fun to work there most of the time, The people that work there wasn't really friendly, until they saw you for a month, because of the environment they worked in.  It's fast paced and cutthroat at times"
good,"250k+ employees, a lot of talented people, but the org is not as agile as other companies. They need more flexibility and communication between leadership and regular employees."
good,"Culture is generally work oriented, competitive, and demanding. Performance is expected. Small cafeteria area on each floor has free tea, coffee, cocoa. ."
good,Good place to work! Follows their own processes. Is all about people growing and learning more. Very professional atmosphere. Management develops their teams.
good,They invest time and training for all new employees.   People are hired and all normally attend a formal training session so they understand their roles and how they effect other departments.
good,The type of work that I did required high performance levels in all aspects (individual and production). The pay is good but it it requires a lot from you.
good,"Managers were pretty chill with interns, very helpful in developing my skills and value as a worker. Took time off of their busy schedule for me to learn and grow despite it being more efficient for them to do it themselves."
good,"Days are long, average day is 845-630. On the banker side, the focus is moving more towards making calls to bring in new money. Meetings about reducing traffic and getting more money through the doors are a daily occurrence. There is a lot of opportunity to make money if you work at a branch that is high traffic. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job. We are always learning about new financial products and services."
good,"JPM is a financial company which has comprehensive services including investment banking, corporate banking, commercial banking, and asset management. It is different from Goldman and Morgan Stanley. The work-life balance is very good. However, the management still a lot of room for improvements."
good,"The people are great, that's what definitely keeps me there in addition to creating products that reach so many people. Design having a seat at the table making decisions with product teams and tech teams started off rocky but has gotten better over time."
good,Overall within the time that I was employed with Chase my customer services skills were greatly developed and I was able to deal with irate customers and handle escalated calls in the fraud department.
good,"Provides good benefits such as vacation, sick, retirement, tuition reimbursement"
good,Great company to work for if you do not mind being paid very little Pay does not allow you to retire. Pay is low but safe place to work if you want to not advance in life financially.
good,"Love to work at Chase, co workers are very supportive and the managers micro manage at Chase and are programmed to have brief and debrief all phone calls to customers with your manager."
good,"Everyday I monitor my teams progress to ward our daily goals for customer service, while being able to facilitate resolution of major incidents as they occur. I provide day to day feedback to my techs on the job they are doing and coaching for any shortcomings they may have."
good,Some work locations are better than others.  Associates are not happy about the compensation but the company encourages cross functionality and internal growth
good,A large corporate bank setting that exists in larger metropolitan areas and applauds entrepreneurship and provides first class research and execution for top tier sophisticated clientele.
good,"Commercial Banking products not competitive in start-up space. High quality office environment in Boston, yet not HQ in NYC. Excellent benefits and opportunity to learn and participate in company initiatives"
good,"Key parties from Resolution Trust Corporation commercial mortgage backed securities operations, the leaders of the ground breaking approaches and methodologies in the CMBS industry led the operations."
good,"There are people that are not good to work with, and people that are. There are perhaps more good-to-worth-with people here . Salary is market although benefits tend to be lean (i.e., no 401k matching)."
good,"The Good Place overall , no real room / opportunity for evolution ."
good,"Fast paced work day; aggressive daily work totals; overtime when needed."
good,Work usually began with a short morning meeting. I learned the many products and laws that affect the banking industry. Workplace culture was ok. The hardest part of the job is keeping up to date of all changing laws. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers but also getting sometimes the most irate customer to calm down so that they're able to be assisted.
good,The job environment is very competitive for advancement and sometimes they want you to do several job titles under one title without a pay increase. Management is not understanding depending upon what department you work and you literally are just a number and nothing else.
good,The teller line at chase bank is very fast paced. You have to be veery quick and accurate under stressful situations.  The management was great.  There are times when you work on weekends
good,"JP Morgan is great for someone starting out or someone with no other obligations.  It was not uncommon to work 65+ hours a week, which was expected.  You are paid very well for your time but doesn't allow for time to enjoy it.  You get a lot of paid time off but there wasn't a single day off that I didn't log into a call or do some kind of work"
good,"Good Company must learn environment. Potential to grow. Must be dedicated and willing to be stretch.."
good,"The numbers are everything when evaluations are done, this company evaluates the employees in a daily basis,and they are very strict on policy and procedures"
good,"They have great benefits, medical/dental and pay is okay but they have bad management. They pick favorites and ride with them until they are no longer useful. Middle management needs a lot more development."
good,"If you work for a line of business that is successful and has proper management, you should be happy and satisfied.  JPM is like any other mega-bank; when management decides to change focus, you will be targeted for layoff.  Be wary; many of the day-to-day duties described in a job position often are incorrect and/or require a different skill set than what the description says.  Ask to interview with a team member and don't go by what the hiring manager says.  Medical/Dental benefits are remarkably expensive for such a large company.  If your spouse has insurance through their employer, consider using them.  Your management decides whether or not you can work from home.  Most managers insist you go into the office every day regardless of your position."
good,"I worked here for almost 3 years and at first I enjoyed it because it was mostly customer service oriented and I had a good manager. Then after the first year they changed everything and gave us a new manager and forced everyone to start getting their financial licenses, which I did not want to do. I felt pressured to do things for the company that I did not feel comfortable with and when I spoke out against it I got bad reviews and was eventually fired."
good,very busy competitive and an always changing landscape. Every few week there was a new procedure or a new way to dot things.  The people are great but it too unorganized a bureaucratic.  Made it difficult to execute and get things done
good,People work well together.  Site locations have several events for employees throughout the year to help build out your network.  Mentoring and coaching are a plus.
good,A typical work day consists of taking inbound calls from business owners to assist with their payment processing needs. The hardest part of the job is not being able to properly execute your job due to some technical issues.
good,"Organizationally, JPMC is a wonderful place to work with plenty of opportunity to advance given the right characteristics are in place for a candidate. The specific ability to cut through organizational hierarchy, coupled with the right manager / sponsor, will allow anyone to succeed in this environment."
good,"I really enjoyed working for chase in the past, they were making cuts in the mortgage side and I did not get a chance to spend much time on the Mortgage side. I would like to get back into JPMorgan Chase."
good,A typical day included taking inbound calls from marketing pieces sent to the caller looking for life insurance.  Taking personal information in order to complete application for approval or denial.
good,"Enjoy working here, people are very nice a great to work with."
good,"typical day at work repetitive "
good,The customer's line got very long in the afternoon and customers got frustrated and angry. I tried to do my best on taking care of their inquires and kept myself calm to provide them a good service.
good,They lead the market in tools available for sales team. Benefits are good along with perks they give you. They have the training program like a well oiled machine.
good,JPMorganChase is an excellent company to  work for. They offer an excellent salary and benefits package. It is a very fast paced work environment but they provide ample time to complete task.
good,"Call center operations, team player, active listening skills committed to data integrity, negotiate delinquent accounts achieve quality control passing grades"
good,"This firm is top notch in the people it attracts and the caliber of professionalism it demands.  The organization demands a lot and the culture makes it difficult to balance work and family.  That being said, the firm is very generous in its benefits.  It is a culture of winning and sets a high bar for performance.  The firm also provides opportunity for employees to advance and move to different locations."
good,"Process default loans, non prime and prime, bankruptcy, litigation and PIF.  Foreclosure and balancing surpluses and deficits.  Request principal balance reduction on loans. Validate the borrower charges were assessed correctly per State Matrix. Regulatory requirements FDCPA, Privacy Act, HAFA."
good,"*Reviewing contracts for accuracy and following up with dealers"
good,"I enjoyed my time at JPMorgan, however, the last team I worked with was very cut-throat and management did not do a great job handling it, which is why I left."
good,"I've enjoyed my time working at JPMorgan. The environment is very professional and their benefits are competitive. I wish there was more room for advancement within my department, but they do promote mobility within the company."
good,ok not bad not great.  While there is a fair amount of work that amount is never overly taxing.  People there are great and seem overall to care about one another.  The company does a good job with work life balance.
good,"JP Morgan is great if you come from the outside.  If you start off in a role to get your foot in the door but have skills of more senior position, HR will never adjust your salary to competative rates.  It's known in JPM you have to leave and come back to attain competative pay rates."
good,I learned a lot money handling at Chase and how to deal with all kinds of customers. I would have like to move up within the company but it was not an option.
good,"I do not wish to provided a review other than I have worked for JP Morgan Chase for nine years as a successful Performance Manager in Arlington, Texas."
good,"JPMORGAN CHASE is a good company to work for but in my opinion, it is difficult to advance within the company without knowing someone.  The benefits are good and the overall environment is great but management make the environment stressful."
good,Working on leads and follow ups. A skill that can be used in other fields. Management is ok. Culture is good but a constant change in it. The hardest part of the job is the schedule. Products are great.
good,There was a lot of teamwork at this job. My supervisor was excellent at her job. I enjoyed working at this company except for the salary. I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,"Lots of opportunity to work with various groups. some collaboration encouraged, but usually from the perspective of the benefit receiving group, not so much from the skill provider group. Sometimes it was a me vs. they atmosphere, when being more cooperative would have been simpler."
good,"As a teller usually you run into similar tasks everyday."
good,JPMorgan is a world class bank with excellent products. Good marketing support and an excellent reputation that supports sales efforts in local markets.
good,I rally didn't understand what I had until I looked outside the bank for employment. It really is a pretty nice place to work. It is stressful and to move up you may have to move thru a few different depts. but it is well worth your effort.
good,Excellent company to work for. Excellent  benefits training and  career advancements available. Stable and friendly work environment. Overall good company to work for.
good,"Training was perfect. I love how they do training very hands on. Previous management were very caring, and gave me room to breath. If I needed areas of improvement they would tell me once. When transferred manager was so micromanaging, always on my back like if I didn't know how to do my job. Didn't matter if I had a year and a half working there. When I was done it was because he thought I was taking ""lunch"" break on a Saturday. All I did was refill my water bottle and use the restroom. Other than that health insurance was really good, 401k was provided, and almost every month or two we had training to go over. As far as the pay was so low regardless of working in stores handling cash, and providing customer service."
good,"Over all Chase is a great company when it comes to employee benefits, however, when it comes to comparable compensation in relation to other financial institutions, they under pay there analyst."

good,Great company to work with plenty of opportunity to grow. It's the largest financial institution in world I would definitely recommend someone.  JP Morgan chase have an ever learning culture with room for improvement
good,Very competitive and great place to work but very bad management. A lot of room for incentive but bad leadership and poor hiring standards made the environment harsh and not worth working there.
good,Company has a great core. However in the actual work place Management does not know how to balance company and employees. Causing all employees to have lots of stress and do their job under pressure or feeling like they will get fired. Highly stressful environment

good,Chase had many wonderful components. Tech at chase in the best by far in the industry. Leading the pack. Employee outreach could have been better. Chase was very high pressure sales and it was the biggest turn off. It made it stressful to no end.
good,JP Morgan is good place to work. there's a lot of work on daily basis and all your day is spend on completeing the day to day task. the management is vry understanding supportive.

good,"Worked with limited manager interaction"
good,"Long hours but exciting with daily new challenges. My self-taught skills were reinforced; there is not training for new employees.  Management, your direct manager, makes all the difference, if you have the choice, choose well. "

good,"Great environment and a great place to build a foundation for a career. Hands on experience and exposure to a lot areas in banking, technology, and finance"

good,"A good place to work, being part of a team is largely emphasized even with individual employee incentives, because of this its very easy to make a genuine friend here."
good,8-10 hours 40-50 per week.  Management was ok and had stable work environment.  people was most enjoyable. Hardest part was the constant change and focus on legal side of things.
good,Chase has wonderful benefits and paid time off. It was far from my home but it was right off the highway. There were a lot opportunities for growth as well.
good,"Challenging work in a very fast paced environment.  Often there is more work than can be completed.  This causes overtime.  It has the best culture for training, career advancement and managing your career of any company I've ever worked.  Management is good and is held responsible for the groups performance."

good,I would have a daily huddle with my team every morning and we would discuss what we would do to deliver a customer experience and meet our daily sales
good,"I learned so much about A/R, check and cash negotiations, Hipaa Regulations. Workplace culture was at times stress full, team leaders and management favoritism was obvious. Hardest part of my job was the last 4 years as the site I worked for kept changing shift hours. Most enjoyable part of my job was my position as a healthcare remittance processor. Overall, I loved and will always cherish my over 13 years at JP Morgan Chase Lockbox Receivables."
good,"We worked on a great number of reports in this department. We were able to work on our reports basically on our own without a lot of micro managing. On the negative side, we had to account for every minute of the day."

good,"Heavy call volume, high turnover. Available overtime but little advancement. Very structured. Great benefits, daycare location on site as well as medical center and cafeteria."
good,"Working at a bank, specifically JPMC, is a lot easier than it would seem from the outside. After going through the training provided, it is fairly easy to detect fraudulent transactions, or at least have a gut feeling that something is off. The hours are great, the pay is good, and the benefits are fantastic."
good,I loved working here and would have stayed if the compensation package to do so had been more acceptable at the time I was I layed-off. The area managers I had were very unpleasant to work for and very vindictive.  My previous area manager was wonderful and he was a great support to all of his assigned branches. I believe due to all of the company's fines they began working at ridding the company of valuable long-term employees to save money.
good,Chase has a good company that offered a lot of benefits it was a fast pace high demand environment but overall was a good company to work for. Just too many employees.
good,I started up the ranks as a teller then went to a personal banker and then went to work in corporate for their business banking department. The culture of the company is pretty good overall and they give you a ton of support from training to benefits.
good,"Diversity is well-practiced in the company. It creates a friendly environment for everyone, through the relationship of the management and other employees."

good,"A typical day at work was getting prepared for customers enter through the branch doors by trying to give the best customer service necessary and solve whatever problems they might have."
good,The people and lower management are great.  Upper management does not fully grasp the importance of good customer service.  Incentives disappear the better it gets and this causes discouragement.
good,"Temp job involving income tax forms. Very good company to work for, managers and supervisors were very nice and helpful with any problems that came up."
good,I was very fortunate to have great managers a.nd a great work environment for my short time at Chase. I really enjoyed learning the procedures for a bank. I had 2 great managers who i kept in contact with even after I left. The clients and my coworkers made the day enjoyable
good,"Working at JP Morgan Chase in the Collections Department was an experience I will never forget. This type of work is not for the faint of heart. You have to have an certain type of mindset when dealing w/ customers and their money, collecting payments."
good,"In JP the amount of knowledge you gain is tremendous. U will learn a lot of things. Package wise and work life balance wise I was not satisfied as i joined as a fresher and the no of hours to work was more. Used to work for atleast 11hrs per day. But work was good, i used to enjoy the work."

good,"I am NOT going to rate this company. There are good and bad in every company, since a company is made of people.  So if you are a person, and you are offered a job at JPMorgan Chase, weigh your pro's and con's and decide."
good,"Great team environment, limited in resources, old fashioned. I loved my team and we worked well together. We were often frustrated due to the lack of investment into personnel. This is a financial institution who has been around for a while and the company culture is great for those who do not like change and doing things the same way just because that's how they have always been done."
good,Depending on the department you work in and your manager determines your experience. If your manager is cool and knowledgeable it will make it a lot easier and a more pleasurable working for chase. Over all a great opportunity If you don't like your department after a year you can transfer.

good,internship was just learning new skills as a teenager. Was a good opportunity to see how the banking fiel worked. shortly therafter was offered a career with autozone
good,"I currently have no review for this employer. My experience is neutral and too long to post here. Experience depends on where your branch was located, your coworkers, and what position you held."
good,Enjoyed the relative freedom and co-workers. I had a really good time having great conversations. I learned many new things about banking and how people think.
good,"Extensive job consolidation in middle management has resulted in ""experienced"" managers clogging up promotion paths. There is very little room to for promotion/development in Chase Consumer Banking. Great place to work a 9 to 5, but probably not a great long term career choice."
good,had a good learning curve here. Work timings were suitable to my needs. At times would have to work in strict deadlines and work pressure. workplace culture is improving.

On a daily basis, we analyst were responsible for approving contracts for car loans.  We would have to contact dealers directly and their Finance Directors to get some additional information regarding the customers.  We were given ""scorecards"" based on our performance at the end of the month.  In addition to that, we were given a readout of our daily performances via email twice a day (12pm & 4pm).  This would allow us to know where we stood in regards to how many ""deals"" we processed individually.  We also had a Fun Committee.  This committee was responsible for uplifting the spirits of the entire floor with events once a month.  For instance, we sometimes would give out snacks.  And other times when we had cookouts or played a game or two on the floor in between breaks with other associates.  The managers would interact with us during these times as well.  What I liked the most was the comradery amongst the analyst."

good,"It is truly a wonderful place to work and I have enjoyed it thoroughly. Reviewing operational docs, running transactions, phone calls are typical. I have some of the best managers to work alongside with and some of the best co-workers out there. The toughest part of the job is trying to stay on task when also trying to provide exceptional customer service in an industry that has had it's fair share of criticism in the past. The best part of my job is knowing that people can trust in us for financial insight and be happy knowing that there are advocates between the firm and them and that would be us at the consumer and business banking level as well as investments."
good,"World class company to work with"
good,I enjoyed the years of employment at Chase. Suggestions on how to better serve customers often went ignored by management. Career mobility was very limited but they were looking to exit the Rochester area pretty much the entire time I worked there so I guess that is why. After 4 years I was let go when they closed my site.
good,Working for Chase Bank in the credit card collections I learned invaluable skills for dealing with problematic customers. But in the long run their business practices and the managers made it not a conducive working environment for one such as myself.

Lots of feedback on your performance, which does help one to improve."

good,Chase is  a great company with lost of opportunity and perks for their employees.  The pay is competative but workload and expectations are often times unreasonable during peak times.
good,"Experience Varies with the smaller team you end up with. I have worked with really smart helpful and hardworking people as well as the opposite. At such a large company the year end review process soley depends on whether or not your top manager is willing to argue your case, so the pursuit for greater compensation becomes as much about making sure the manager likes you as it is about being productive"
good,"First getting hired on was a great experience.  Had a great work environment until something or someone said something and then the gossip started and management was of no help.  I don't believe that all areas were like this, but at the time I left my ear was not a great environment."

good,"I was afforded an opportunity to be employed by a great company for which I have gained lifetime friends. The staff was great and the knowledge I have gained, has prepared me for a brighter future."
good,"I got myself onto a great project while working here (the bank discourages revealing the specifics) but I will say in terms of cloud, open source technologies, data science, the organization shows real growth this year and this should only be the beginning."
good,DEVOPS Lead role was challenging as I had to analyse all manual work and come up with a scope for automation. Define automation roadmap to team. We as a team had spent many hours in fixing things right for Development and Testing team. work used to be interesting and challenging. We also used to have fun at work. We had a very supportive manager who gave us complete freedom to explore automation options and gave design liberty. He used to review and understand the process better and was a good mentor
good,"Overall good job with typical workplace issues. A typical day included wearing many hats and constantly challenged to keep up with regulations, procedures and reporting."
good,"Great Company, good benefits, supportive managers, good incentive program, many opportunities for advancement and growth.  Amazing co-workers and highly skilled professionals in key positions."
good,"Excellent work / life balance; 4 vacation weeks, 3  personal days, closed on holidays.  16 weeks maternity leave.  health insurance is ok. Its hard to get a promotion, they prefer to hire external candidates."
good,I love what I do and have always felt supported by upper management. Leading a team is alot of work but is very rewarding. At times is it very testing of your abilities but is worth it in the end.
good,"it was fun working for this company"
good,Sales at this company is fun and teaches an individual team work. A typical day starts off with breakfast and coffee and you're already motivated to start working.
good,Good Work Atmosphere in the company and gave good work life balance. Normal office politics still happened but overall experience was good.
good,I have only worked for Chase Bank for 3 months but I noticed a substantial difference from the previous bank I worked at.  There are many more learning opportunities and everyone wants you to succeed.
good,"Managed 10 employees for after Foreclosure sale processing, e.g. 3rd party sales, disbursements of funds and cancellation of foreclosure sales. Processed government loans, ordering the title order and transferring title to HUD. Finalized the foreclosure processing, reviewing the entire foreclosure from beginning to end to ensure that foreclosure was conducted according to the state civil codes and executing the final Trustee's Deed Upon Sale and closing the foreclosure. Managed and process the commercial loans from beginning to end and interact with the asset management for Chase. "
good,"Jpmorgan chase is really a good organisation to work. It has got a  very warm working culture but due to long working hours it doesn't"
good,"Excellent Employer. Great team focused on delivering the best results."
good,"Typical day at work - Opening and closing of the department, taking care of my staff to make sure they have what they need to process quality work.  Providing excellent customer service, and resolving customer issues in a timely manner."
good,"the place was a very fun and exciting place to work, friendly people, always having parties, always doing drawings for prizes, made really good money, bonus every 3 months, no complaints, we got laid off"
good,"Good environment, very professional, speaking with customers about their credit cards and how to make their utilization of the care better.  Did supply tools to help them with their cards"
good,"Fast paced environment, good benefits, and friendly co workers, but management issues. In a typical day it's go go go and does not stop till shift end."
good,"My current position has high volumes for analysts to get through in a typical 8-9 hour work day.  Multiple conference calls and meetings daily. Along with multiple complex projects to balance with a variety of deadlines."
good,Overall great experience from the moment you start work until you end the day. Management were always with great heart understanding customers and employees. Definitely an great employee environment experience.
good,Opportunity to move throughout the firm but movement does not always guarantee higher pay.  Reorganization can be challenging due to lack of work experience in a particular field.
good,Many opportunities for growth & development. Supportive management. Great business. Great mentors. All over wide ranges of businesses. Great opportunities.
good,Working at JP Morgan was a great experience. I worked with the smartest and most talented people. Working with them and learning on the desk was a perfect start for my finance career. I enjoyed constant communication and dealing with people from various departments within the bank as well as our clients.
good,"Good company with excellent culture"
good,"Had a good experience, good culture for an investment manager. Just looking to change my role. Smart people involved."
good,"Depending on your role, work life balance will be more affected that in other roles but the employer requires a lot from its employees so I would not sign up if you have a young family or want to do 8 hour days, just not possible."
good,"Worked with management to assist in all trainings at multiple locations across Texas. Efficient cash  handling and problem solving. Worked for 7 years, very enjoyable and great company."
good,Too much change in management and staff.  Too many people going in different directions.  Day was long and the compensation was not industry standards.
good,provided great opportunities to progress.  Friendly environment and good leadership could be seen throughout.
good,An excellent company to work for. Provided great learning opportunities. Also working was fun in a pressurized environment.
good,I enjoyed notarizing documents and researching.  And Loved the people that I worked with.  At Chase I was able to grow and was able to help the community as well.
good,nice place to work and really great benefits. great team experiences work and all come together and it feels like family after some time.
good,"Loved my time here, I wish I could have balanced working here and school. Processes change frequently, but they do their best to keep the department on top of things."
good,"JP Morgan is an amazing place to start working because of the training they provide and also the value of brand recognition. Working at JP Morgan as the first job makes future job searches much easier but I wanted to look for better job stability and they are always outsourcing jobs and cutting costs without regard to employees and their livelihood. Compensation at JP Morgan is not the best and the workload gets worse by the year. I remember how stressful the workload can get and all the senior level people have depression problem. At anything above associate level, you are working above 50 hours per week with no extra pay. The 2 week paid vacation and the health insurance is great."
good,Nothing overly positive or negative to say about the position as it is fairly straightforward compared to the description
good,"I enjoyed working for Chase, but mostly because of my coworkers. The upper management left much to be desired, and smoke break were many. However, I found out that I had cancer while working there and they worked with me well regarding my surgical issues. I would gladly work there again if they still had the contract I worked for."
good,"Good company, but not well environment in the branch"
good,Great management. Great co workers. Great work environment. They really treat you with dignity and respect at JP Morgan Chase.
good,"After working a some of these other places, I feel Chase was a good company. There is a lot of room for advancement. You definitely have to be use to change."
good,JPMorgan is a good company to work for. it is hard to get into yet worth the attempt. The pay is comparable and the work life balance can be ok at times.
good,Strong company with great groups but the large structure wasn't a perfect fit for myself.  I also was part of the Bear merger which wasn't that great.
good,"The employees are the firm’s most important asset, so attracting, developing and retaining them in a culture that values learning and development is at the top of everything the firm does."
good,Co-workers are friendly and always there to help the best they can. Great atmosphere and the ability to grow. Good starting point to have customer service experience
good,"A typical day at work for me as a Personal Banker includes showing up at the scheduled time (which varies greatly), assisting customers with whatever their needs may be, opening accounts, generating and following up with leads, helping out on the teller line, showing customers how to complete transactions on their own (which is a VERY heavily emphasized part of every thing), and various other tasks.  I've learned a lot about banking and how things work in a bank.  My co-workers, for the most part, are awesome and make every day a little better.  I loved working here prior to some re-organizing and losing my direct manager and his manager.  I truly don't know how my current manager got hired for their position and I don't have anyone to talk to about my concerns because the next person up oversees seventeen branches spanning a three hour drive (without traffic), and has specifically said to to call because they are too busy to answer.  The hardest two parts of the job are dealing with a poor manager and having been robbed two times in less than a year.  I also don't see a lot of room for advancement.  The most enjoyable parts are working with customers and co-workers.  I am free to build relationships in a way of my choosing and control (to some degree) my paycheck via comission."
good,"Very interesting job and always something new to learn. My co-workers were great and if i needed help with something, they were there to help me and vice versa."
good,"I log in to accept calls at exactly 8 in the morning, US time. I learned about Identity Fraud. The management were good. My co-workers were awesome specially the three girls that became my friends. The hardest part of the job was the endless calls we received in a day. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the management recognized your work through awards."
good,"I work as a teller at JPMorgan Chase. I believe while the benefits is great, the pay is not so much. I believe tellers are not taken as seriously as bankers as we are only given 20 hours and they promote the ATMS and are trying to bring more eATMS into place. "
good,"Worked on a particularly stressful project and made good money work a lot of hours. Cannot complain about the people, did not stay with the company because offer of employment at the end of the contract was insultingly low salary."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance- yes"
good,Chase provides great benefits. I have learned so many things which helped me developed my leadership skills. They just need to work on their management style at least on the LOB that I was part with.
good,"Processing Lockbox with incomming mail"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers. No matter the task, we always made sure to have each others back. Team work makes the Dream work."
good,It's a great experience. The people you work with are very talented. There are many things I learned here. JP is a very diverse and dynamic place.
good,"this company had lots to offer employees from health and dental care to retirement plans and day care."
good,full time learned a lot about customer perception and listening to their needs morning huddles talk about the prior day go over goals for the day and daily tasks schedule
good,A good employer with strong management and upward mobility.  Significant training to ensure strong management and communication skills.
good,"The people I worked with were great. Everyone was a team player...for the most part. But the job culture was sell,sell,sell and this could drive a wedge between any group of people. The company also values sales over actual management skills, so often you have managers who were promoted because he or she was a great seller. A salesman does not make a manager. "
good,"Typical day at work includes soliciting clients in the branch and by phone to use additional products and services with the bank to deepen relationships and branch profitability.  Also engage in various managerial and operational tasks to ensure employee compliance with regulations.  Work well with coworkers to increase branch teamwork and branch profitability.  Learned how to engage clients and solicit clients.  Also learned how to understand branch profitability metrics to determine daily activities to drive profitability."
good,"A good starting place is TBC good people, poor pay.The job is easy but you have to be open to change a lot of it.The hardest part of the job was keeping up with frequent changes."
good,Learned alot about the banking system. Great people to work with. Supervisor was awesome. Great benefits. Location good and shift went by fast.
good,"At Chase the office allows you to work at your own pace.  When arriving to work, I start with emails until the daily reports are sent out.  As those daily reports are sent the supervisors are trusting employees to get the work done.  I've learned to balance projects while at the workplace and enjoy the challenge of completing projects by the end of a timeline.  It really makes you concentrate on what truly needs to be complete.  My co-workers are great people and when needed to work as a team we can do so, but if you want to be independent with your work you are allowed the opportunity.  Co-workers share their processes and shortcuts that help the job move quicker.  The hardest part of the job is having to keep in mind that all states have different rules and declarations that the bank has to abide by.  Making sure that we are asking what is truly needed and not just what we want.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility they allow you to work.  It helps when personal issues come up such as 2nd jobs or family events are occurring."
good,mangement team was very helpful and really looked out for their employees. they make sure that you understand your job role and help you be successful
good,The main thing that I like about Chase the most is the amount of opportunities. There are always many different of ways that you can progress your career.
good,"Some groups are phenomenal while others not so much. Large organization, a lot to learn - need the right manager that will guide you to succeed, otherwise you get lost in the shuffle. Overall great organization, with great leaders."
good,JPM Chase was a great company. I worked there for sixteen years.  I grew up at Jpm Chase so I have learned so much that has help mold me to the man that I am.   They provided a lot of opportunities for growth within the organization
good,good place to work especially if you want to go far in management. my so far experience is very well and it is very well organized.
good,take inbound call for existing business card customers. advise customers of the account information that they call in inquiring about
good,it was a nice work place. it's a big corporation. should try to network as much as possible if individuals want to grow within the company
good,"Chase was a strong community of knowledgeable individuals. The company invests in each employee hired, and thoroughly trains for the job. As a banker we held a great deal of responsibility but with the training and tools provided I can honestly say I enjoyed working in the banking field."
good,"I enjoy what I do,  the  great are benefits but the commute is too far."
good,"Worked on a small team with highly motivated employees. The employees were very good mentors as I was just an intern. Hardest part of the day, crunching work in short period of time. Most enjoyable, going into meetings, it was a good learning atmosphere."
good,Great opportunities to network. It is a global company. Probably some of the best leadership in the industry. Some people may have difficulty with the size of the company.
good,"The benefits are pretty good, espcially since they include eye and dental (some places do not). The hours can vary depending on the job your doing, but there is some work/life balance. The only downside is the lack of inconsistanncy in managment from department to department. Since each department can be run individually, some are more strict than others, so employees can see that difference and get frustrated. I.E. some departements are held to a very strict dress code and others are not at all - all with in the same building and neither department are customer facing. Advancement can be easy, but only if your network very well with in the company. If not, you might find it difficult to move around."
good,Working at JPMChase has been a great experience. Always active on the job and learning new things about the company. Great working environment.
good,"work life balance is lacking"
good,"Great place to start a career, working with the some of the best and brightest personnel in their respective fields.A standard for high quality work is set and permeates through each position. Given the size of the firm, having the ability to network with colleagues across different business lines is a significant benefit supplementing the regular day to day learning opportunities."
good,I have learned a lot during my employment at JPMorgan Chase.  A typical work day consisted of me ensuring our clients were happy.  This was done by ensuring their request was completed in a timely manner.  I had one of the best manager in the company.  I worked with some of the best team members. My team always worked together to ensure at the end of the day we have met the clients needs.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to complete a task for a customer in a timely fashion.  It could be because of a system issue or the fact that it was something that could not be done because wwe missed the cut off time. As a whole I enjoyed my job.
good,The Company provides good training and is a great place to enhance one's knowledge. It also has employee friendly policies and rewards hard work.
good,JP Morgan was always a positive to company to be employed at although there were constant cost cutting initiatives and outsourcing.
good,Lacks strong leadership in direction the company is going within various lines of business.  Groups are not really in synch with each other leading employees to have many unanswered questions. People hired/let go in large groups.
good,upper management not good place to work at.. learned to process commercial deposits and work a lot of cash on hand... chase is ok to work at
good,"On a typical day, my goal was to set appointments with premier clients to help with their retirement savings. With a team of some associates including the Financial Advisor we were able to help many clients with their financial needs. Many people are not aware of the different ways to save and the resources available to them, this made it enjoyable. Fortunately, our team was helpful in providing great service. We worked as a cohesive unit. I would analyze financial statements with the Financial Advisor, and others would help prep materials to discuss with the client. On occasion I would fill in for the Financial Advisor when he was out on meetings or out of town."
good,"JPMorgan Chase encourages and includes diversity which makes the company a pleasant environment to work. The bank strives the employees to hone in their skills, and make aware of their opportunities for improvement."
good,"Excellent Benefits, poor life/work balance, it is very difficult to advance as always all movements are horizontal. The management culture is awful, no true career development."
good,Working for the company was just okay . The company has great benefits and vacation packages for employees. Hard to advance up.
good,Although I do not work for them anymore. I would go back in a heart beat. I loved the company and what they did for their employees.
good,current management is not experienced in the automotive industry. currently internally focused. great co-workers. covering Nevada and New Mexico
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyabale part of tje job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew and it was more difficult to get to know the new people. There is a lot of variety in what I do each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting."
good,Work with a fun and supportive group of people. Colleagues are always willing to support and cover when needed. Great learning experience.
good,Excellent great first corporate position after transitioning from military service.  Company really focuses on giving employees exposure and opportunities to highlight skills.
good,I was hired by the company but was assigned to JPMC. It was only for 5 months and everything went well with my employment that I had with them. I was instantly absorbed by JPMC after 5 months.
good,"Started my IT carrier with Kanbay, later it got acquired by Capgemini. I have learnt a lot from this company, Supportive staff and ton of work to do."
good,"The hardest part of a job is to keep focused always, despite knowing that nothing could go wrong. It is that momentary lapse that can put one in trouble. Also, assuming things is very easy and it is always difficult to avoid getting in to that mindset..."
good,JP Morgan Chase Bank was a stellar bank to work for. I developed as an individual and an employee given the tools and expectations of the job.
good,A typical day at work would be processing claims and specializing with ATMs and high net worth vendors to settle claims and discrepancies across the U.S. I've learned a lot about ATMs & how big of a role they play in the banking industry. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my colleagues!
good,"Best part of my job was having daily positive interactions with clients and co-workers."

good,Helpful people around. Learned too may technologies and functional aspects of the system. Its a good place for someone to begin their career.
good,"Huge company with a variety of professionals, technologies and systems to get an opportunity to work with. Worked on projects that impacted many and had large financial consequences. Some amount of red tape by virtue of being one of the biggest banks in the world."
good,Great team poised for growth and prosperity. Management understanding to work/life balance. Company positioned as a leader in the financial industry.
good,"Company is making a lot of changes which has been affecting branch performance. Management acts like robot, they don't have any type of sense when it comes to different markets."
good,The company has good benefits and generous time off policy. There is advancement opportunity and volunteer activity.

good,"loved doing credit underwriting and customer service, sale's goals pretty high.love working and helping customers on a day to day basis"

good,"working at chase has always been a pleasant environment, and I learned many things from my current position."
good,Great team & good resources to learn and gain experience. Like most places you will find your good & mediocre leaders. If you are a hard worker and demonstrate iniciative you will definitely be considered for other rolls or promotions.
good,"Fun work place with alot of supporting cast."
good,"Fun delivering project results.  Employees were allowed to exercise creativity in project work.  "
good,I have nothing bad to say about JP Morgan.  It has been great to me the last 10 years I have worked there.  I am only leaving firm because they do not have a foot print in PA.
good,"A typical day consists of:"
good,"•	 Worked directly with Business Lines in Customer Care, Loans, Management Information Systems, Card Management to gather dashboard requirements for development. "
good,I cherish more about about the people I worked with and the team in JP Morgan. The work life balance was pretty good. I got the opportunity of being a team lead and was able to improve the leadership quality by handling a team. Got the opportunity to work with global managers and leads and there by learned project management techniques a bit being in transition office.
good,Very rigid environment which is standard for a big bank. Enjoyable colleagues that made day to day operations manageable. Able to manage subordinates well based on personalities and competency level.
good,"On a typical day at work I process customer transactions efficiently and assist them with other all their needs I do make product referrals to personal bankers. I also handle a high volume of cash on a daily basis and deal with a lot of business customers. I'm responsible for balancing my cash drawer daily. I'm also an Atm custodian which means I'm in charged of processing their contents and adding cash to the atm. As the Lead Teller I'm responsible for assisting tellers with supervisor overrides, guide them  and coach them as well. Overall I assist my manager and over see the teller line in her absence. I've learned so much from my current position from providing the best customer service to knowing how approach difficult situations such as customer complaints and make sure I always go above and beyond. I feel that I've grown a lot and have developed great skills. I have become more knowledgeable in many areas. I get along really well with my management team although I disagree with many things or decisions that are made but my input is usually taken into consideration. I'm a very easy going person and get along really well with everyone which is why I love working with the team that I work with. The hardest part of my job at this moment is the schedule and the distance. The part that I enjoy the most about my job is working with people and being able to help them. I'm great with customers and provide them the best customer service experience."
good,"typical day can be tiring, you may get paper cuts. Must be able to adhere deadlines. great place to work if you like challenging situations."
good,Good location for me to work at. Was too much about month end numbers without including additional things done. Such as text messaging sign up and Fraud Trend referrals.
good,"good benefits, opportunity for advancement.  strong sales culture moving away from customer experience focus.  management, like anywhere depends on the person, not everyone is perfect."

good,JPMorgan gave me the opportunity to learn a great deal on operations. JPMorgan gives you hands on experience and give a person the confidence perform well in their role when  given the opportunity.
good,"Initial hiring involves training on the relevant aspects of the company, i.e. mortgage banking group, how it interacts with other lines of business, and the regulations imposed by the various government agencies.  Working with outside counsel across the country was interesting and provided a great perspective of the country and the impact the mortgage crisis had on each State.  Having to meet the demands of each jurisdiction often involved needing to improve the perceptions of the company.  This proved demanding but fruitful in order to reach settlement good for the company and the client."
good,"Current role is very demanding but interesting. International team across multiple times zones. Typical day consists of heavy interaction with far reaches of our teams around the world."
good,"5 days working, learned many strategies, management, leadership skills. co workers are friendly. Amazing trainings to understand corporate ettiquettes."
good,I experienced great team work and leadership skills. I learned a lot about the collections via auto finance. The hardest part of the job was that there were some day the communication was at a very slow pace
good,A lot of people who had joined a particular profile have stayed there for a really really long time because the manager never really promoted them nor fought for their promotions.
good,Job Security is great as long as your stats are in line. People are great to work with leadership is a good group of people. Pay was low when I started and when base pay increased tenured employees stayed at the their hired rate.
good,This company was great to work for. I wish I could have continued and retired from there. Unfortunately my position was eliminated and could not find another position.
good,"Getting started is always a tough task, but my manager and great coworkers are there to push me to be the best I can be. The toughest part of the job is trying to please every customer even when they are upset with me. All I can do is provide excellent service to the best of my ability.  My team does a great job of showing care and support towards each other."
good,First job of a wall street firm great people and a great group of people to work with. It was a wonderful place to work. Until the closed the area that i worked in
good,"As in any large corporation people tend to fall under a statistic of being a number and no longer a voice to be heard. Chase has gotten away from rewards and recognition and focus is placed more on the investors.  Chase is advanced and under the leadership of Jamie Dimon continues to grow at a advanced pace. It is the middle management levels that manage to the numbers and have strayed away from behaviours, setting goals and expectations."
good,"A typical work day, was eventful. I learned a lot about Brokerage Accounts, conversing with Financial Advisors on a daily basis. Management was also productive and helpful. Great co-workers who were willing to help with any questions,."

good,"Good company to work for."
good,"I learned a lot from Chase:"
good,the atmosphere is great but unfortunately its really hard to move up. There's a lot f competition and many changes going on with the company. People are moving down so unfortunately its hard to move up in position and to get a raise as well.
good,"This is a good company to start with if you are ambitious and ready to hit the ground running. However, once you have maxed out on your skills (unless you are looking to manage others), there isn't much room to explore new roles/positions or opportunities. Aside from that it is a great company to work for. The management has gotten much better over the years but the downside is the company has been downsizing and reorganizing quite regularly over the past 2-3 years."
good,Demanding and challenging.  Competent co-workers.  On hand management.  Accountability for the assigned tasks.  Fast paced work environment.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a good company. There wasn't a lot emphasis on work culture, aside from that I would recommend this company."
good,"Daily Agile Scrum."
good,Oversaw key account and territory growth by performing financial analysis and risk tolerance assessments. Ensured regulatory compliance for each transaction processed while eliminating potential liability of connected transactions.
good,"	Resolve customer issues"

Once all the information has been verified, such as, proof of income verified, insurance verified, employment verified, and speaking with the customer to review the contract information is correct, I would complete the loan to load on onto the system overnight and request (via the system) to pay the dealership the amount of the loan."

The bank is now known as JPMorgan Chase and it was a great place to work.  If you were not successful there, you did not use all of the tools available to you to be successful.  The bank's webpage contained so much information and there were tools there to show you how to navigate the page for anything you may need help with.

good,"I was hired in September 2011 as a Research Analyst to work on the Independent Foreclosure Review project, an OCC and Federal Reserve mandate.During my tenure with the project, I have added value in the areas of development and implementation of operating models, process improvement initiatives, and operational efficiency. Through my involvement, I have demonstrated organizational and analytical skills, as well as the ability to communicate and process information concisely and effectively."

good,JPMorgan is a very large and leading force in finance. Its a pleasure working here and I have learned a lot from my time here. I have worked with various different sectors at JPM which has allowed me to make contacts and learn about the various services and products offered by the bank. I am looking to utilize the skills i have attained to take on a larger responsibility.
good,"A typical day as an intern at JP Morgan consisted of mainly analyzing data and researching market trends. I learned a great deal about what this office job was really about and what will be required of me when I start my career. The management here was extremely knowledgeable and helpful when confronted with questions. I feel like it was easy to pick their brain and gain from their past experiences. The hardest part of the job, I would say, was sitting in front of a computer for most of the day. I realize this is what I signed up for when I chose this profession, but I would prefer something requiring a little more movement."
good,Typical day - I serviced foreign company's that wanted to sell shares of their stock on the US Exchanges. Help set up operational processes to take them for beginning to end.

good,"Friendle work environment, serious most of the time. The managers are all helpful and willing to work with you. There are times when you do not have direction in some assigmnets that you are given and that is probably one of the hardest things about the job but I have to work through them and overcome obstacles. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing that all the new hires use the procedures that I created, I take pride in that work that I do."

I learned how to resolve in a timely manner as customer concerns, as well as offer any available services to meet additional needs.My management was an outstanding team. Very professional and attentive. The hardest part of my job were the times that I was not able to end a call and not hear my customer smiling through the phone. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fast pace, and certainly my co-workers."
good,I actually started with Washington Mutual and went through the conversion to Chase. I didn't work for Chase too long. Things are quite different now than when i was with them. It's fast paced and crossing selling is a major priority.
good,Always busy schedule.
good,I enjoyed working for Chase. I was a college student who took on a part time position and the managers were very understanding. They made it easy to work and attend school.
good,clean offices and clear products made the banker position enjoyable. Co-workers were like family and chase really appreciated their employees. constantly looked for ways to keep us motivated.
good,Typical day at work was tons of foot traffic and non stop customers.Management was very understanding and caring. Very supportive team. Co-workers treated me like family and were great. Hardest part of the job was working with homeless ustomers at time who were a bit agressive. I really enjoyed the team work and the atmosphere.

good,I loved working for Chase. I wish there was a Chase in every state.
good,"Nice workplace, good leadership learning, diverse learning platform."
good,Very nice place to work.Drove a brand new company car to work ever year. Great workout facility too!
good,"A typical day at my branch (all branches are different) are filled with processing transactions, making referrals to Personal Bankers and laughing with my co-workers. Management at Chase is really laid back for the most part (lack of much management) there isn't much coaching going on either. My co-workers are great to be around and have been a help with my training. There isn't anything hard about working at Chase."
good,• Part of a 15 member sales team focused on building balances and client relationships while promoting sales of financial products and services.
good,I am a temporary worker at JPMorgan. The client for chase works employees is not the same as for full time employees. I would love to become a permanant and full time worker at JPMorgan.
good,The is a great place to work and possibly advance in your careet

good,With the corporation having multiple lines of business it is to large to write a review on the entire company.
good,"Chase helps you to learn all about the mortgage industry. It has great pay and has unlimited opportunities for advancement within the company, if you work for it."
good,"Call center atmosphere, basically log into workstation and call the tasks that are due for the day. Follow up on loan modification documentation that is needed but yet to be received. I have learned the Freddie/Fannie/VA/USDA/FHA modification guidelines and procedures. Involved in HAMP/HARP programs. Communicated decisions to consumers, gathered documentation and was single point of contact for 250 plus consumers from start to finish (REO/Foreclosure/Mod approval/successful short sale/ Deed in lieu)"
good,"Chase is a good company to work for when building a career in any industry as Chase has a lot of options within its organization. However, my department experienced months of mandatory overtime on weekends. The pay is good, but it limits the free time you would have for other parts of your life."
good,"Verifying income, ordering insurance, determing DTI and LTV, quoting rates, main point of contact, ordering insurance, scheduling loan closing, preparing and distributing GFE and TIL, prepared final loan documents, prepared file for closing"
good,"Worked in an inbound call center, reviewed card member accounts,researched customer billing errors, handled disputed transactions, researched payment issues and handled other customer concerns as needed.

good,"It was a great job and also had great benefits. When coming into work you sat at your own nice sized desk, the management crew was nice easy to get along with."
good,I worked there with all sincerity and was promoted from Teller position to banker position . I enjoyed working in bank and all staff and customer liked me. But I regret that only on the advice of my manager I was laid off without giving me a chance to prove myself in another branch.My performance was as good as other personal bankers recruited along with me.My manager herself was inefficient and was downgraded to the post of asst branch manager but I was unnecessarily punished on her advice.Management must have taken the opinion of all other coworkers before taking an adverse decision.Training by the bank is excellent but it should'nt have been wasted..
good,People when at work are mostly occupied with their daily tasks as deadlines are pretty strict and there is mostly sufficient work pressure throughout the year with small releases spanning 3-4 mths.
good,"Fast pace, multitasking is a must in order to handle client requests."
good,I enjoyed every aspect of working for Chase. I learned skills to further my advancement in the banking industry.
good,Type of place where you have to do extensive research to find the correct answer to your question/questions. on the up-side it kept me alert and more knowledgeable. My co-workers we're a pleasure to work with and we made a great team. My day to day work was client oriented it was gratifying to have had been able to assist my clients and my goal was to

good,My newly created position has allowed me to use my training and development skills especially in the realm of scaffodling. I have had the amazing opportunity to work in two departments and establish myself as a dependenable and desireable employee.
good,"I took calls from customers wanting to close their credit cards, and offered lower rates for purchases and balance transfers so they would keep their card. Management started to leave after I came on board once a merger was announced. The hardest part was knowing our site was to be closed, and our jobs relocated other countries."
good,Good brand name that gives ample opportunity for advancement.
good,"A typical day working in the Solution 1 Support Center would always be challenging and unpredictable due to system updates or outages. It would cause an increase of inbound calls and open tickets to escalate to 2nd level support. While assisting the Support Center I would QA the agents calls through a system called NICE. I learned the support end of the mortgage industry because most of my career I have worked in sales. The people are diverse, creative and computer savvy. I would say my job is can be challenging not hard. The most enjoyable part of my job is resolving someone's issue seeing the team come together to get it done!"
good,Developed Applications for Credit line processing and fraud detection
good,The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and the multibillion dollar clients I manage. I enjoyed working with different partners accross the firm In different time zones and still being able to deliver my clients accounting reports by their due dates
good,the work environment is good for learning and growing.. Management can be overbearing at times. Good work life balance
good,"face to face interaction with clients about their case status, file copy and fax legal documents, prepare confrence room and directed client calls to appropriate department."
good,"A great place to work, however a little large for my liking; limited to small segments of the network. A great employer, however!"
good,"I think Chase is a good company to work for, but its just time for a change."
good,"Somewhat fast-paced depending on branch location, easy job as long as policies and procedures are followed. Great team of co-workers, management for the most part is good. Enjoyable part of the job is interacting with people and being able to help their needs. Although, it's not for everyone!"
good,Good experience. It was a good experience to develop the strategy from the scratch.
good,"I learned that working well with others, and going above and beyond the call of duty, are a core requirement for a good career."
good,I was given pages of transfers and I would enter them in the system. I would look for errors or possible forgeries.
good,I have only been at JP Morgan Chase a few weeks but I feel very comfortable there and feel that I am allowed to voice my ideas and opinions without hesitation or concern of being judged. The employees are all welcoming and hard working.
good,It was a great atmosphere with many contractors and FTE working hand in hand. We had many release stacked one after other and it enormously taught me to handle pressure.
good,Good business environment. lot of room for learning.
good,"-Helped plan technology events, travelled to sites for on-site setup"
good,JP Morgan is a great stable company to work for. They have a great benefits program and compensation.
good,"great benefits- great people loved the place, company is strong organized well ran"
good,THe people were friendly and it was a nice place to work. It was my first job ever so I learned a lot of the working field.
good,"How best can I define my typical day at work. My job is primarily based on utilizing my experience in the capacity or areas whenever and wherever necessary. Whereas the requirements and expectations are defined, the strategy or definition is never always ""typical"" or 'smooth"" in ascertaining results."
good,This work place requires multi-tasking and the ability to handle tough customers.
good,The workplace is a very nice place to work. It has good people and the work life balance is good.
good,"Great place to work. In the department where I worked, management seemed to have it together."
good,A very good company to work for. It is ideal for recent graduate students and veterans who are looking for an entry level position.
good,Working a I find the company to be very fair to their employees. Like any job you will not agree with everything when it comes to management.
good,this is a good place to work but might be stressed out some times that comes with this job anywhere
good,Chase is a good company with many good opportunities for those who wish to develop themselves and seek advancement.
good,I enjoyed with customers in 13 different states and helping them to complete the loan process was always rewarding.
good,"Great company and the limits to your career are endless"
good,"This could be a great place to work if you conform to the culture and are extremely ambitious. This is an opinion from working in the retail channel.  Other channels, corporate, back office etc...may provide a different work environment."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a very good company to work for and fairly compensated; they do lack internal promotion as it takes forever to move up and mostly bringing outside talent rather than promoting within
good,"Investment banking is a great division to work in if you are able to manage the numerous interviews and red tape to finally get in. Once you are in, the rest is up to you. The firm supports your growth and allows you to expand your horizons."
good,"I have worked in different areas in the bank. Some parts are very positive and have great management. In other parts of the bank, it can feel like you are in a cloud of negativity and management has no idea what your day to day actual consists off. The benefits are pretty good with generous vacation and sick time. I think what I pay for health and dental insurance is reasonable. I do feel compensation is a little on the low side."
good,"Good luck wading through the bureaucracy and red tape. Marketing isn't based on strategy or research. CMO's pick what they think looks pretty, not what is proven to be successful resonating with prospects or current customers."
good,"Since starting here, I have met incredibly smart and talented coworkers, but the change in management and direction, as well as the high performance work environment stifle productivity at times, and make it difficult to easily and effectively accomplish work. "
good,"When the work slowed down, quite a few of us were shown the door. Most of us had been with the company for years, but as with any large company, they find ways to do the same work with less people. Sad really"
good,If you are looking for a large company then this is it. Management is very disconnected and you can get lost very easily. They do have a very good flexibility program for parents. Its definitely worth checking out for the right role.
good,"Job Security and Advancement at the company is difficult for professionals and employees over 40.   Company has tendency to promote young, new college graduates, who are hired with low pay rates. Professional employees are getting low annual raise and no bonus."
good,"I'll start off by saying I've seen other people leave at five on the floor that I work on, however working as a demand manager and working directly with multiple areas to align a book of work can be very demanding. We plan quarterly so towards the end of the quarter becomes our busiest times of the year and for an accumulation of possibly half the year, you could find yourself not going home until 7-9 o'clock. I will add though, there is an attempt at J.P. Morgan to change the culture. They have moved us away from cubicles to a more open space atmosphere. There are also attempts to move us away from a banker mentality where you come to work in a suit every day or your judged by how long you work towards coming into work wearing jeans and t-shirts and there is a little more stress on having a work life balance.  I do think that J.P. Morgans top quality however is how easy it is to move from position to position within the company.  The people there are very open about what they do and it is very easy to express your interests and direction; and as an added bonus, most of them will help you get there. Overall, J.P. Morgan Chase is a good company to work for.  While there can still be some areas that still have the banker mentality and can be very demanding, there are many opportunities to move around, experience new roles, and expand your capabilities."
good,"Database PL/SQL Developer | Database Administrator"
good,"This was a new world for me. I've been able to learn new skills, while improving and delivering superior service and quality with every customer interaction."
good,Chase has come a long way with how they treat their employees. They take employee opinions whole-heartedly into consideration and make their best efforts to make it an enjoyable place to work with still being able to have fun and feel appreciated. Networking is a big thing they offer with their many BRG groups.
good,enjoyable part is working with different people to reach a common goal. Also the culture was a very rewarding in making sure I helped as many people to move forward in their career.
good,My day starts by checking my calendar to see what meetings I have that day. This lets me plan my day more effectively. Between meetings I can do my work in preparation for a meeting or work due in the future. My manager gives me good direction when I run into an issue.
good,Chase had different games set along the perimeter of the building to de-stress on breaks and lunches. Also when employee appreciation came around this was a big big moral booster.
good,Good company to work for.  Opportunities are becoming limited to advance in some departments. Good training classes and diverse culture is nice.  Nice facility!
good,"not too many accounts review, work kept dwindling"
good,"I enjoyed my job at Chase. I was a teller for almost 7 years. While i worked there, there was quit a bit of turnover though. I was trained to do everything which gave me alot of diversity in my job. I would definitely go back."
good,"Fast paced, stressful but good employer. Salary commiserate with abilities. Great people to work with. Ability to grow and expand your knowledge base."
good,"Big brand to work for.  "
good,Customer service a must. Professionalism in how you handle yourself and proper pronunciation on the banking language sets the tone of the institution you work for.
good,"Outbound calling to high balance (over $10,000) credit card customers to cure their accounts."
good,"I love JPMORGAN CHASE & worked there for 18 years.   I had 12 years of Loan Servicing experience when JPMORGAN Chase called me out of nowhere.   I loved working for Chase and would work there again.   It's a wonderful company, lots of benefits, great opportunities and people.   I miss it and would go back in the blink of an eye!!"
good,"Chase all around as a company stands for great ideas, advancements, and values. The lower you are on the totem pole, the more stress and insecurity there is. Most branches are understaffed or closing.  You never stay in one place too long, which can be either a good thing or a bad thing. Unless you have a strong team to support you in the branch, try to apply for a different type of role, like a mortgage or financial advisor."
good,"As long as you are willing to meet the standards, never miss a day, and work when they need you, this place is for you. They have great benefits. Poor management. Not enough communication between staff."
good,Joined in2007 as fresher and had no clue and path to go further and over the time with evolving financial world learnt to keep the peace to match the demands... It is in your hand to make it or break it.
good,"everyday experience was good."
good,Good company and great people but upper management is disconnected from the downstream personnel. The opportunity to move around is good but almost required for advancement.
good,"I got to work on very good Projects and Progress was very good for few years."
good,Held a contract position for a 1 year duration and as a consultant worked usual business hours. Overtime was allowed as and when required per workload basis.
good,"I enjoyed working for Chase. So much so, I stayed with them for over 18 years. Chase differs from the company I am at now because they are so much bigger. But with bigger also comes a more professional feeling environment. While they aren't quite as intimate that are structured very well and are the model that everyone else strives to be. there was a lot of opportunity at Chase to learn and advance and I enjoyed working with the management. The only problem there is that being a tenured employee has it's disadvantages with salary and compensation. Since they max out at a certain percentage of your salary, you aren't getting paid your worth after the 18th year. I only left because I wanted to pursue opportunity to find a job to where I got paid what i felt I should get paid after so many years in the industry."
good,"working at chase was a good experience. As a Hispanic male, I noticed that there were not to many people with a Spanish last name in high places in the company.."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Chase, in the beginning.  Then they decided to re-organize everything for no apparent benefit by stripping the commercial out of commercial banking.  Upper management was good, immediate management became a nightmare with promotions based on sales results and nepotism rather than leadership"
good,overall it was great opportunity to work wit chase company the only week point they don't have a good teamed that help you to find your way to claim the stairs
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a good company with great benefits.  However, management tends to lose focus on employee morale and makes everything based on production metrics and goals."
good,Dynamic and fun leadership team that doesn't shy away from pushing innovative people leadership ideas and ways to acclimate the organization to getting comfortable with change.
good,"Big brand name in financial services, obsessed with diversity hiring which is noble and good thing . However JPM maybe taking it a little to far and should strive for more balance and hiring / promoting based on merit"
good,"Enjoyed my time at JPM, company with great culture open to diverse backgrounds and inclusion. Many opportunities for mobility. Collaborative and friendly culture."
good,Working here is good. There are other institutions that offer better overall compensation plans. There are many skills that are lost given the fact that everything is handed off to different people in other departments. Losing certain skills makes it hard to transition to certain positions and definitely hurts when applying to outside institutions given the requirement to lend and have an understanding of underwriting. The strength of the company is definitely there and it shows given the stock market price and record revenue. The brand is pushed heavily and is well known. The overall environment is good and I feel it is enjoyable.
good,The day at chase can vary. You can have a very long day where customers are coming in from open to close or a slow day where u can not have customers for a good hour. It can be a fast pace environment depending on the day of the month.
good,Working at JPMorgan was a great learning experience. Worked with some brilliant people and interesting projects. Was overall happy with my experience there.
good,"A typical  day at work was actually awesome.  If you are able to work and get the job done independently and as a team.  Management was available if you needed.  I loved that my team was basically my 2nd family.  I actually miss working with them.   We had our challenging days; that is when the team came into show support.  In  the 14 years of employment I started from originations- to Modifications.  I wish i could be there today.  My site was one of the best still not sure why we were laid off.  This was a life changing opportunity for me, it allowed me to grow within the company."
good,"Fairly productive place, with lots of meetings. Typical day for BA consists of several meetings. All JPMC locations are shared spaces type of arrangement and get pretty noisy which makes it not very productive environment. BA role at JPMC is a fusion of PM and analysis"
good,"From working at Chase, I have learned much insight into people and their nature, especially when it comes to their finances. Depending on the department I was in, my typical day would consist of me taking between 60-150 calls per day assisting customers with credit card needs. Management was very involved and meeting goals and stats are an important part of day-to-day work life. Currently work with escalated customers to try and resolve issues that have been ongoing. Conflict resolution is a large part of the working day. It is most rewarding to actually be able to help a customer and have a resolution that works for everyone but is hardest when there are literally no options and you can't help to make someone's day better."
good,Does not give employees the freedom necessary to help clients or do their job to the fullest extent.  Employees are penalized for aspects that are out of their control.
good,"JPMorgan Chase has a good team above the manager system. The district managers that I have encountered were great. It seems to be a gap in the branch management role for some specific branches. Ultimately, Chase gave me a chance to grow even though they do not pay as well as other banks. If you can shrug your shoulders at the end of the day and understand how to keep client relationships held higher than competitive products you will be okay."
good,JPMorgan is very good and nice environment to work. I loved to work for last 10 years. All depends on project and Managers who you work for. It is one of the good company to work.
good,"With the changes in the economy, mortgage rates fluctuate wildly. While reducing staff is the usual step during these times, it tends to put extra pressure on the remaining staff. A good pay rate and an opportunity for advancement tend to be staples of companies with good reputations. Chase is very close to being one of the best places to work. The management situation leaves a lot to be desired, but the same could be said for any company."
good,"I worked there for 7 years. I worked in TS&S that moved from New York to Dallas, TX. This included mutual funds, trust, endowments and pricing. This is all."
good,"Very high standards are set for employees as well as the service that is provided to the clients. Well established company with a great reputation. "
good,"Have a group meeting before the doors open, base on reviews, goals, and more. Get in your position and everything that the customers need. Greet everyone and help them to the best of your ability."
good,"Chairman / CEO leads by example, all of the management team, down to Managing directors and below, follow leadership principals key towards the overall success of the firm."
good,Very political place with an insiders group that has been there a long time that watches out for their own. Very tough to come into the firm at a Senior Level and not be part of the group
good,"Great place with friendly staff. New location in Plano , Texas provided meditation rooms for employees plus on site child care. Opportunity for career advancement"
good,I would recommend everyone to work here.  They have great maternity leave procedures.  If you do right by the clients and the bank you can have a long career here.
good,Great company to work for and continue your career with. The compensation could be better but overall I will say the benefits and prestige of the firm outweigh some this downsides.
good,"Customer service environment, learn a lot from both upper management and peers in my nine years at J P Morgan Chase. Hard to advance in certain department because of salary grades"
good,"Great company to work for with very easy computer systems, uncapped comp is monthly but Chase offers a very low base salary and branch are most often then not very short handed with staff"
good,"its chase bank; good place, beautiful location right by the mall, great people to work at with awesome benefits when you stay with the company more then 6month or a year."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a good Firm to work for. It has strong senior management leadership.  The workplace culture is very collaborative and  competitive.
good,"Chase was a very rigid company to work for.  It was very sales driven and at times, I didn't feel comfortable pushing customers to purchase new products."
good,"Lot of learning opportunities  , very competitive , great technologies to learn."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a great place to work. They provide plenty of opportunities to find where you fit into their global plan. Management is sometimes lacking in direction, but they allow you to grow and enhance your skills."
good,a typical day at work was to come in and start up your computer. What you learned everyday there was something new to learn. Management-some worked with you others did not. The hardest part of the job was when someone called to get information and if the right information was not given they got angry. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people.
good,"Typical day of work would be coming in and checking emails, taking and making phone calls and multiple meetings in between. "
good,"I work part time at above location doing security, during off duty time from primary job with the Police Department.  Each of the above mentioned jobs treated me very professional and courteous."
good,It has been a good company to work for through the years.  Good opportunity for training and voicing your concerns. Hardest part is trying to get a head in the company.
good,"While the company itself had a great core value of beliefs, commitment, and benefits to their customers and employees, a large number of members in leadership positions at chase had a high degree of nepotism. Advancement generally only occurred based on who you knew, and who liked you versus your ability. This is only really based on the location that I worked at, because when working at other locations it was different."
good,Help customers navigate the Loss Mitigation process. Made outbound calls and received inbound calls from customers. Going over documents with clients to present to underwriting team for review.
good,"I loved working here. The people I met were wonderful. Overall, they are a great company to work for. Despite having to leave for a better opportunity, I will definitely miss their benefits and the atmosphere within the company."
good,An ideal work environment for me is one where there is collaboration and innovation . Management that allows their people to have an open forum to speak their minds. A huge one is work / home balance and having the ability to work remotely. The environment to allow for to expand outside your day to day role and maybe even out your comfort zone; perhaps stretch assignments or being a part of an initiative where you can have exposure.
good,"Plenty of room for growth, a lot to learn, fast paced environment, work/life balance depends on what department you work for, but definitely is good place to work for, especially if you are starting out in your career."
good,I love the branch I work at but customers are very rude. The chase employees are all really nice to each other and helpful. The environment is fun. The work is a lot to learn while training but after a while its not that difficult. The pay is better than other part time places I have worked but still not livable. I would recommend working here.
good,I was there 23 yrs and still would be but my position was eliminated.  I hopefully will rejoin chase and continue my career until I retire. Very diversified  culture. However when they are eliminating the positions more should be done to assist with job placement.
good,Culture is greatly influenced by leadership team. Training made available no matter how long or short of a time you been with the company.Wonderful manageriwith room to possibly move up
good,It was a contract position I knew what I was there for and for about how long. so it was a bummer when i got the call that my contract was ending but what are you going to do.
good,"Typical day at work was fine, not much to do with the declining mortgage markets right now.  Was a behind in the behind the scenes employee who helped keep the loan process moving."
good,"Most holidays are paid by Chase. You must be able to be open-minded with a lot of the rules that are placed by the company. Otherwise, you will frequently ask your manager many questions and although they encourage questions, it also impedes you from getting promoted."
good,Chase was a good company to work for but oppunitties of moving up is slow. Started at Cahse as my 1st banking job and love the people that I have worked with in the midtown area.
good,I was hired by a manager who was fired 6months later. That manager was no very good with policy and how to write commercial deals. he was nice but not effective. The managers that took over were all from WF and were all about numbers and very arrogant.
good,"Having spent a large portion of my career in this firm I can say it gives the right opportunity for learning, growth and career advancement. JPM is a great supporter of diversity too."
good,My time with JPMorgan Chase was a new experience in Mortgage and Home Equity. The training was exceptional and detailed so I was prepared to be hired on full time once I was on the floor performing my duties.
good,"Surprisingly well managed for such a large institution...but nevertheless, its size and bureaucracy make JPM Chase a difficult place to do business and to get yourself paid..  The balance sheet is so huge ($2.6 trillion now), they can literally fire half the staff and the balance sheet will make $1billion per week, so it's hard for individual humans to justify getting paid well for their contributions...  That said, the balance sheet allows benevolent managers to keep staff around for possibly longer than they're needed.."
good,"Chase was great in the very beginning , but they decided to make changes to everyone schedule and pay . We were not given much notice of the change. They didnt care about a schedule and whjat we had to do to get around it. we were told if we could not work these hours that we need to find a new job or figure it out. It was a great culture,"
good,"It provides a good work life balance and continuous growth opportunities."
good,"Great company came in a temp moved up along with companies expansion.  Great for development, not so great when it comes to being compensated.  There during outsourcing overall fun company, some discrimination."
good,"its an okay place to work, if you have nothing else really going for you and it gives you a legit career if you had no other plans. not a fan of all the change that happens but its understood in corporate settings."
good,"Chase is a good company to work for. The pay is better as there were recently a raise given for the tellers. The hardest part is coming into the company full time. Most full timers are bankers, managers or corporate jobs."
good,"All in all, JPMorgan Chase was a great company to work for. The company is driven by its mission and the incentives are good in that it is paid monthly. The only downside is that they pay a low salary. The bankers are driven by incentives so it really doesn't pay if you don't sell. The company does have corporate benefits. You have special discounts for different companies which include phone plan discounts and gym membership discounts. They give you tuition reimbursements if you further your career in a specific direction."
good,Company benefits are excellent and people that you work with are generally very nice. I do not agree with the amount of layoffs the company generally goes through on a yearly basis.
good,"While it was a good job, management made it difficult by keeping the group understaffed. Relied to much on part time employees to help full time staff when work levels were high."
good,They allow you to want to move departments and proceed with what you enjoy. Great benefits for your family.  Training last for 4 weeks so there is good training time.
good,I traveled for over two and a half hours by buses to get to work and sometimes when I got there no one was there. Some of the other employees were rude and disrespectful and because the had years on the job it seemed as though nothing was done when these incidents were reported. I was late 8 times over the course of a year and a half due to unforeseen public transportation issues and there was no sympathy for my situation but other employees who had been there for a long time would call out of her scheduled shift at the last minute and still continued to be employed even after I was fired. There are too many different rules for one set of people than other.
good,"Learned how to decision a credit card or Home lending loan, approval, deny or misdirect/no change.  Hardest part making certain all the wickets were met. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours, 06-1430 hrs.  Management set a pass rate of 95%. This is hard to maintain."
good,It has been a great opportunity to work at JP Morgan Chase. Learnt new skills every time I moved to a new Team. Each position gave different kind of experience and learning. Workplace culture was good. People are nice. Hardest part of the job is that they keep re -organizing too frequently and hence very hard to focus on stuff.
good,"Enjoy my coworkers and my clients, I enjoy working with my business clients and helping startup businesses get off the ground and running, I enjoy helping people achieve their financial goals"
good,"After many successful years at the firm I was asked to return in a new position as a contractor.  As I had previously, I truly enjoyed returning to the firm.  The Global Philanthropy Division was a great environment to see where new minds and ideas were embraced."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for my company is the relationships formed during the normal day to day activities. I am grateful that I have such met such an incredible group of people during my tenure.
good,If there was more opportunity for advancement and more flexibility with the schedule. Perhaps implement longer break times and lunch to make a more comfortable time frame.
good,I was introduced to accounting systems conversions.  Management trained us well and we were able to finish the assignment a head of schedule and received excellent reviews by the CEO
good,"The benefits are great, but you are under paid for the amount of work required. A lot of work is done outside of scope of current role."
good,"The benefits are awesome. I felt like the company tries to take care of their employees in order to take good care of their customers. But like all call centers, raising the bar meaning getting more cutt-throat and micromanaging."
good,"I started working for Chase back in 2012 in Manhattan Beach, Ca. I loved my branch manager and assistant branch manager then. They were amazing and we started with an amazing team. I then left to Las Vegas October 2015 and worked in a terrible area, nothing compared to Manhattan Beach. I worked on a location on Charleston and had nothing but bad experiences there. The team, management and customers were terrible there. No opportunity for advancement and it was a very busy location with poor scheduling for the teller line. My other co-workers there had told me they tried becoming personal bankers and that the managers never supported them and never gave them raises. I left that location after 5 months and went to work at a call center for Bank of America."
good,Answering phones typing filling paperwork greeting people that came inside the building made sure all paper work was done and all calls was answered in the right way
good,"The people you work with are great but nothing ever stays the same.  One day your in one team next your on another, changing policies making it difficult to understand which to follow.  I just wish they cared more for their employees."
good,The sales culture changed to aggressive and one sided towards first time investors.  Investments became main focus with no customer service help.  Reduced staff.
good,Call center was always backed up so that made it stressful for me to stay there. I wouldn't recommend that type of work to any good friend. I am glad I no longer have to feel dragged to work.
good,"Helping high flow customers on daily basis. Coaching and training employees. Work with others on achieving a company and branch goals. Work with sense of urgency, follow policy and procedures."
good,"it is a good bank if you are performing well due to their incentive plan. if you are not good, then paycheck wasn't enough compare to other bank. My whole career in banking so I am very interested software for banker. This bank invested a lot for technology so it is so easy to learn the system even if you are not good at computer. Even customers learn online and mobile banking easily"
good,"The team works together to provide the best service to everyone that walks into the branch. Respectful, friendly, and supportive coworkers to work with."
good,Great place to work and to assist clients with there financial needs in terms of retail banking and investment opportunities. This bank is a one stop shop.
good,"The company provides optimum benefits, 401-K, ability to work from home depending upon your position, job advancement opportunities and competitive compensation."
good,"great benefits, vacation, sick time, etc, very hard to get promoted and management is not great, very clickybut overall a pretty good place to work- the management is just not 100% invested in their employees"
good,"First job out of college.  I was very green and learned a lot.  Team was very warm and inclusive.  They had free lunch and encouraged people to eat together in their cafeteria.  You needed a VP’s approval to grab a free lunch and eat at your desk, it was discouraged.  They knew the value of making relationships."
good,"The banking industry offered a lot of variety of working skills. I learned how to assist customers with various inquiries. The workplace culture was very competitive. The hardest part for me was meeting the challenge of a variety of customers. At the same time, that was also the advantage of learning a lot in the business and banking world. "
good,Great Training program. Great systems but it is a one size fits all mentality. Things that work in other markets don't really work in small towns but there is is no flexibility market to market it's a one chase philosophy which ultimately hurts both employees and customers. They need to change their policy on the 10 min rule no employee likes it and it causes overtime in situations where they could be avoided. All new hires should have to work in an instore an have the opportunity to be promoted out of one. Instore employees feel punished for having to work extended hours in some cases with no real opportunity to get better at their job because some client's don't want to do their financial planning in a desks 2 feet away from the next client in a grocery store.
good,"Good people at the ground level.  Somewhat disorganized, and minimal training.  MUST be a self starter to survive.  Overall positive culture and ethical."
good,"a typical day at work is coming in and already knowing what i am supposed to do, know one is looking for me, i have my headphones and im working away. if for some reason i have a question that the person i ask can help and get back to working, i enjoy advancement opportunities. if i have learned all that i can learn i can hope that management could refer me to a better position. I so enjoy recognition, potlucks, games and great relationship between not only management but my coworkers"
good,"The CTO justifies JPMC's poor track record by saying, ""It's in line with the industry"" as if mediocre is good enough."
good,Overall JPMorgan is a good place to start in the finance industry. The AML compliance world can provide great entry level skills that will lay a good foundation. The employees are expected to stay in the department for more than 3 years. The company is known to pay below market value.
good,Great place to work with a lot of opportunities to grow and move internally. The culture is great and the company believes in career growth and talent development.
good,It was a good place to work and the days were always the same with the work flow. It was always very busy but not to stressful. I learned to work in a very tight space. My supervisor was very helpful and easy to talk to. The hardest was working for a bank is very stressful.I learned that I can work anywhere and with anyone.
good,"Was a contract employee building out the virtual data center servers.  Processes were not well documented at that time, but some of the processes were new.  It was a great experience seeing how the banking sector worked and how tight certain security was."
good,"JPMChase was a good, sometimes great place to work.  I made a lot of good friends and acquaintances during my tenure there.  The work was sometimes repetitive, but at times was very engaging."
good,Typical day working at JP Morgan Chase to me was great. I worked a  some great people and my supervise was an awesome person. He was always helping and supporting his unit. The company did at times provide lunches for special occasions and holidays.
good,JPM is a great place to work. You get out what you put in. Getting recognized isn't managements strongpoint. It is still up to you to make the most out of your opportunities. The best chance to move ahead and make more money is to leave the company. Upward mobility is easier for experienced individuals from outside the company. Once you are employed with JPM it can be difficult to advance.
good,"This company meets expectations for a global company.  I've enjoyed working here.  "
good,"Set the schedule for a day. when to make calls have a game plan for every client cross sell products and do not forget about investment referral, forget about lending."
good,"Working in the mortgage department there were clicks and if you weren't in the click you were not treated very well by your manager.  My manager never liked me, she didn't have any problem showing it, and was upset when I took parental leave for the adoption of my son."
good,"Worked in a relaxed setting, with co-workers management and customers. There were picnics during the Summer and parties during the Christmas season, to which we were able to invite our family and friends."
good,Larger company with good compensation.  As is typical for a company this size there are too many layers of middle managers. The job procedures are overly complicated due to multiple systems that have too many glitches.
good,Global banking companies in general have a very rapid working environment.  It is not uncommon to have people take leave due to the stressful working conditions due to operational business pressures.
good,"If you are a high ranking, soon to be college grad, the programs offered are a great way to start your career, with a focus on placement in a management position when completed."
good,Enjoy working for Chase.  Great Company to began your career.  I would recommend this employer to others.  They really appreciate their employees.  Great opportunity!
good,"I worked for Washington Mutual until in want bankruptcy when JPMorgan Chase took over. Didn't have much choice about working for them as it was a take over. "
good,Overall good collaborative team work across businesses and functions.  High performance standards for jobs and job advancement and compensation is meritocracy based.
good,great company to work for. Benefits are middle of the road. CEO is excellent. Culture is becoming less formal. Management can be a hindrance to growth.
good,"Good place to work with excellent benefits, There is room for advancement, can be a stressful, fast pace, with company perks and great network opportunities."
good,Collaborative workplace with opportunity for growth and advancement. Good benefits. Brand new state of the art facilities with the latest and greatest technology. Open seating.
good,The culture can be great and there is lots of diversity. However the local leadership needs more organization. The company offers great benefits. Fantastic CEO
good,"I enjoyed working at JPMC and it was the first job I got out of grad school.  I was able to move around laterally, but it was very hard to move up.  I would work there again."
good,Fast pace Agile environment. Be prepared to always work on innovation and process improvement. Team members often start and close meetings with ideas and challenges to push the status quo.
good,the hardest part of the job was phone time requirements.  The most enjoyable part was talking with customers.  At the end of the day I could walk away from the job and not take home stress from the day.
good,"good place"
good,"They are a strong company and I have ultimate respect for them, they can improve the sales culture in the branch but other then that they have a strong R&R department and as a whole I believe they are pretty solid"
good,Working for JP Morgan Chase taught me the fundamental principles of building solid relationships from the ground floor.  It enabled me to use my abilites to develop a clients fiancial standings comensurate to their risk tolerance and goals.
good,"I worked several roles under JPMorgan.  I started out as a supervisor at a collaborative project for OCC.  We did good work, but it was not a permanent job.  I did eventually get transferred to a processing department and did decently well.  I had to take a pay cut to secure a position, but unfortunately was laid off approximately a year after.  The human resource department was lackluster in terms of assisting in transition.  I attended a job hiring event and one of the department coordinators flat out told me that i shouldn't even apply.  Asides from that many positives and great benefits for working at JP Morgan."
good,"It's good and full of challenging tasks, meet interesting people and build connections. It also provided a lot of internal team transfer opportunities."
good,I loved working for chase. They provided many oppertunities for advancement. Their concept of work life balance was superior to any i have ever experienced.
good,"Spoke with over 100 customers a day , collected past due amounts and also provided assistance to those facing financial hardships and needed assistance."
good,"Limited opportunity for advancement unless you're really passionate and really good. It's definitely a ""what have you done for me lately"" culture.  If you have the most productive month of your life, they'll reprimand you for not repeating it every month."
good,I worked at a few different locations and experienced a few changes with management here and there...the managers were always pretty horrible for one reason or another...not everyone who works their way up in a company are a good fit to be in charge...usually they were less knowledgeable and unfriendly with customers also.
good,"I was in more than one role at JPMorgan and I was in only one department. Depending on the role I was in, my day was either low-stress, or really fast paced.  I learned a great deal about back office operations and was given the opportunity to take on more responsibilities as I progressed in my roles.  The managers around me were willing to share their knowledge and help me to gain skills.  Overall, the workplace culture was okay.  The most enjoyable part of my varied jobs was the people I was working with.  For the most part, they were a very positive, get-the-job-done group.  Everyone had been in the same area for a long time, so we were more like family than just co-workers.  The least enjoyable part of my job was the lack of advancement.  Everything became a lateral move with little to no reward (increased income, upward mobility with job title change, etc.).  It became pretty stagnant, unless you were in the Technology sector, which is unfortunate.  The benefits were good, but the pay wasn't that great."
good,"Strong brand, ample training opportunities, great corporate responsibility. Bureaucracy, often too many obstacles to get things done. Many managers and senior leaders are just not good at what they do. Either not good at managing others or simply not good at leading. A title doesn't = effective leadership. I was blessed to have great colleagues and good managers, but that is not always the case for everyone."
good,"fun, hard work, great people, good culture and enviroment."
good,"JPMC Bank overall is not a bad place to work. Especially for those who have higher positions than the part-time tellers. They do promotions based on quantitative results and not based on the persons potential; which is not always great for those who really want to get promoted. However, the benefits that are given are absolutely rewarding."
good,Did a lot of things and learned how LTOS works. I was able to take days off and earned a lot while working as well. Everyone was friendly but customers can be mean
good,"Demanding job hours, clients and management. Great coworkers and benefits. I enjoyed working at Chase for the experience, my coworkers and the great employee benefits."
good,That managers were willing to hear you our the job itself was a nice place to work and it was something that could help you out in the long run definitely would go back
good,"Nice place to work, but compensation is sub par for Alternative Investor Services.  The culture in AIS is laid back, but simultaneously fast paced.  Unfortunately, work life balance is not a priority and flexible work arrangements are not granted."
good,"*work culture is good"
good,"Very frequent re-organization takes place."
good,quarterly focus changes from one product to the next..you're required to push those bank products and find ways to make them relevant to the customer.
good,When I worked at Chase I found the fast paced and competitive work environment was exactly what I desired. I learned a lot during my brief employment before I had to resign due to health reasons. The Chase work place is exactly why I desire to return to help grow my self and my employer.
good,The Home Equity role started off very well. But so many changes in pay and management caused the culture to shift and peers not to be satisfied and worried about making it by to the next month. Initially was a sales role and quickly became a typical run of the mill call centre.
good,A lot of management turnover for my particular branch. Overall pay was worth the work load. Workplace culture and training for position was great. Benefits were great as well.
good,Upper and Branch level management need to support and coach staff better. Overall compensation was worth the work load and lending and investment partners in branch were very helpful.
good,"No vivid complaints, very organized and office like atmosphere. Enjoyed my time here. Typical 9-5 job but some days I we had to be there earlier. Job description was simple to understand."
good,"The only downside I had while working for Chase Paymentech was a somewhat erratic manager. "
good,Working for JPMorgan Chase was definitely a great leaning experience. It is a fast pace environment and it was filled with plenty of competition. It was not micromanaged if you were taking care of your business. They were sometimes inconsistent with their policies and procedures sometimes and they would always tell us that C was for Change. I would recommend the job to my colleges but I would just let them know that it is very competitive.
good,The advancement is there but the politics are real so be prepared to play the game.  It's tough to advance with the layers of politics and it's who you know.
good,"The pay is not enough for the type of work they expect from you. It all depends on the market you are working and the Market Director as well, it could be good or it could be bad."
good,Place was filled with kids out of college or older people looking to kill some time.  No real place for career business people and difficult to find any advancement.  They are there to use you up and burn you out... then they move on to the next person.
good,"The place I currently work as is fun and laid back, but the hours are late into the early evening and staffing is very low.  The work environment is great."
good,"Encoded checks,money orders and bonds,ensured accuracy of debit & credit processes,successfully and efficiently handled up to 1,300 daily transaction,presented daily reporting of bank's financial activities to upper management,maintained fast and accurate encoding."
good,"Stressful environment. Worked hard, the team was small, not too much room for growth. I was disappointed by other managers interfacing with my group.  Otherwise, I would go back there."
good,"I started very well and enjoyed most of my time working for JPMChase. However, lay offs were implemented in every department and it was sad to see people go every 6 months and wonder if you were going to be in the numbers the next time. Eventually I was. There were people who even got good reviews that were laid off so it wasn't just performance based. Each department had to get rid of people. Plus they had let people work from home sometimes up to 2 days a week and then they stopped that completely. Only good side to that is when you got laid off you got 45 day notice to find another job."
good,"It was nice compensation and the workflow was consist"
good,"This is definitely a who you know culture. If you are in good with management, rules do not apply. There are unrealistic goals that are set, which creates a breeding ground for deceit. People who master the art of manipulation advance, while those who have integrity fall by the wayside.The most enjoyable part of the job, is the paid time off."
good,"Being an american bank in Canada provides a wide range of advancement and opportunities. The work involved:"
good,"Great benefits, hard to advance, below average pay. The work life balance is good but hard to get promoted due to limited opportunities for the staff size."
good,"Fast-paced, environment is to structured. No teamwork feeling. You feel like your in a bubble. Managers are great but team leads are unapproachable and seem to have a not so great spirit. Overall working for the company itself isn't bad. They need to work on boosting their employees up in the work environment."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a great company to work for.  Individual  departments can have it's own challenging aspects.  A typical work day in the mortgage department, has you working from the start of your shift to the end, there is not a lot of down time and also changing going on.  However, the positive is that I was able to learn to adapt quickly and even enjoy the ideal of change and what it could bring.  Yet the everyday change was one of the hardest aspects of the job.  Chase has great benefits and perks and does push to get the best work out of their employees, all while making people reach their optional performance levels."
good,Its a good ppace to work with but the management is really not upto the mark and there is very less scope of growth under same vertical. Work is majorly of data entry not much to learn.
good,"This is a nice company with great benefits! The hardest part is that you may work on weekends as the company operates 24 x 7."
good,Worked in the accounting department as a temp and did whatever task that was assigned for me to do.  Helped others with their work.  Learned more about the accounting process.
good,JPMorgan Chase is a very financially stable company. The benefits are very good.  There are plenty of opportunities to move around within the company.
good,I enjoyed working here and the great earning potential. My co worker were all friendly and helpful. Overall good environment. Some managers were on power trips and not interested in developing good team players.
good,"The project was a real pressure cooker; not everyone could take it. Those of us who did gelled into a genuine team and we developed a pretty high opinion of ourselves. Managing teams of techs of varying ability across three time zones can be like herding cats, but the technical challenges were fun."
good,"Learned a lot about financial industry, but felt pigeonholed in line of business. Did not feel like my skills were being utilized. Enjoyed working with fellow employees."
good,All my supervisors were very supportive in assisting in making sure that I meet all expected targets/goal. I learned that there are all walks of live that take on incredible amounts of debt and the company supports customer in managing payment arrangements if needed
good,"Chase is a good company to work for, however I did not work for the financial portion. I worked in the credit card manufacturing center, which is small, and opportunity was limited."
good,"Overall this was a Great place to work, Company expectations where For employees is to work more for less , Had Great benefits. At first than they started taking everything"
good,"Very good place to work.  Good benefits (health care, vision, dental, life insurance) and compensation.  Relaxed atmosphere as long as you are on the operations side."
good,need to pay employees more with the amount of work that is required by the top boss. working long hours so you'll barely have time to spend with your kids
good,"Managed client accounts, reviewed and processed account transactions, management had high turnover, training is self guided, culture of work involved continuous change of personnel."
good,"Typical work day collecting auto debts and meeting company needs."
good,"Depending on your job, you can gain invaluable experience working with employees from all over the world.  You will not want to stay in any one position for more than five years.  The only way to really get ahead and get more $$ is to move often."
good,"Daily tasks on previous role involves a combination of operations, sales and customer service. Operations is the top priority but sale mentality is always present. Customer treatment is the highest priority after operations."
good,"I enjoyed my time at JP Morgan Chase. Chase is very aggressive and very sales focused. It is all about the numbers and making your goals. Worklife balance is not the best. As a manager, I worked on average 65 hours/week. Benefits are great but base salary is on the low end."
good,"Great place to work.   "
good,"great people, good management.  incredible platform to work with.  understood needs outside of work when it came to family obligations.  was a great experience to spend 7 years there"
good,"I enjoy my time at Chase, but I find advancement opportunities difficult to come by for many employees. Technology enhancements require less face to face experience, so less staff is the likely future."
good,Good place to start work and keep things going must move around for advancement to different positions in the company. Opportunity is there just must seize the moment
good,"Found relatively quick upward mobility in terms of title and responsibilities, but experienced lackluster increases in salary to compensate for ever growing responsibilities. Work/life balance diminished with advancement. Colleagues were generally disappointing, had an aloof approach to work with very little culpability."
good,"Chase has unreasonable sales goals and an antiquated approach to attaining goals. Great benefits, rigid training. Agressive sales tatics is a major turn off to client"
good,Well run company . They could treat their consultants with a bit more respect at time but a well run IT shop with some great minds in the space. One of the more innovative financial institutions.
good,I spent close to 15 years working for this company and on my last day they treated me as if I was just a number. Pretty typical of corporate culture. did enjoy working with great people. Lots of room for advancement or cross training for the right employee.
good,Good place to work.. Professional work culture.. Long hours to work.. Job profile is very stressful at times. Important risky decisions to be made.. Customer satisfaction is utmost.
good,"Busy days, and ebbs and flows with the month.  Training was adequate, however opportunity to advance is slim, and job security was not great.  I was laid off, and my husband was laid off in a different position and department two years later."
good,It was a pretty swell place to work amidst the unfortunate time frame of business changing difficulties. The coworkers can drive you nuts at times if you let them get to you due to their desire to brown nose their way to keep their false sense of power/titles
good,Compliance week is once a year and allows time out of the office for fun activities.  This allows junior compliance officers to connect with senior compliance officers.
good,"A beautiful experience in a period of transition. Lots of space for growth, encouraging management. Through them, I've learned not to give up on my dreams, to stay strong and persistent."
good,"I love the job, pay is great as well as benefits but management could do better. i feel like they can do a little better on communication and fairness."
good,Chase has an extensive sales training workshop and classes.  They have an effective and organize system that gears to what ever the incentive program is made of.
good,"I enjoyed working at Chase.  I had great teammates.  My manager was approachable, and helpful.  I was given latitude to work my files with confidence and was not micromanaged,  Operational changes were constant but I learned to adapt and continue to perform within the circumstance to the best of my ability, I was able to produce to my own satisfaction and to that of management and customers. The job gave opportunity for creativity and growth."
good,"JP Morgan is a good place to work for the right individual.  I would recommend if you like to play in the big league. However, in order for you to advance, it all depends in what department you are working for.  Every department seems to have a different culture."
good,Great management but non-productive controls impacting the influence of management. Very bleak work environment. There is zero room in our budget for any type of team building or employee satisfaction.
good,Traditional corporate structure. Promotion based more on tenure than merit. The base salaries are low compared to the industry standard and the compensation structure has become more restrictive.
good,JP Morgan Chase is a good company to work for and offers many mobility opportunities within the organization. Overall I enjoy the people and the culture.
good,"JPMorgan has a solid offering of places to begin, change and excel your career. The company is obviously not going anywhere for a while and they certainly have something for everyone"
good,It was a good paying job with great people but at the end of the day taking complaints all day was stressful. Sometimes it was the banks fault and customer had to suffer because of that which I did not enjoy! Over all it was a good job and if I still enjoyed it I would still be there because of the people.
good,I liked working there it was a very good job to work at wish i could have stayed but it was only temporary. i worked on the computers all day checking what others had put in the system.
good,"JPMorgan has provided me with vast experiences and knowledge for the processing of financial data and file transmissions"
good,"JP Morgan is a typical large corporate banking entity that inevitably consists of a large layer of middle management that views itself as upper management. Within that structure, it is very easy to overlook many things that could otherwise be beneficial to the company if not for the lack of expertise of people in the middle management positions."
good,This job  included a lot of on the phone tasks and it was a lot of multi tasking between systems and software. I liked the training involved and challenges.
good,My manager was great. I made several suggestions on how I could bring value to the team and he let me run with them. I was able to wear many different hats.
good,"Worked primarily with branch customers assuring their account needs were met.  Also, cross-selling any banking products that the customers may benefit."
good,"Some days were more stressful than others. In general managers were skilled and knew a lot about the business and fund industry. "
good,Trabalhar no JPMORGAN é trabalhar com talentos com certeza
good,"Normal call center, quick paced and competitive. I enjoyed my coworkers and work environment. Learned about health benefits and life insurance plans. Also was familiar with COBRA and setting up benefits for those eligible for COBRA."
good,worked for chase 30+ years and saw many changes some good some bad. Great 401k package and benefits. Management did a good job with all the changes over the years.
good,Chase is a great company to work for and get your feet wet.  However your experience will be totally dependent on which LOB and group/manger you work for.
good,"develop for next project and continued changes in requirments."
good,"Good technology support, great reputation, good people to work with, multiple business partners to help with customer needs, many locations available to the public"
good,"It is a great place to work, helps you get mingled with core corporate culture. This place provides immense opportunity to learn and grow. its training and development thing is great for employee development. it is employee oriented company."
good,"I experienced a demanding workplace environment at JP Morgan Chase. The job/life balance was strenuous, however the time I spent at the site was rewarding."
good,"Too many mangers less staff."
good,"Good company to work as human being. Great work culture."
good,"Good company, loved boss and team.  Decent benefits and bonuses.  Vacation could have been better. Loved my department and my co-workers.  Everyone was nice and it was a great diverse company."
good,"It is a great bank to be part of. Being in retail banking has its challenges, you are underpaid and under appreciated. As for the bank culture it has a great name and great reputation"
good,"It is a great job to work at if you have the right management team. When that management team is not that great, that is when it is hard to go to work everyday. The only downside to Chase is the salary. They do not pay as good as other banks."
good,"The majority of Sr. Mgt live their jobs and the expectation is the same for direct reports.  Work life balance is lacking.  JPMC is a worldwide brand and the working conditions are fantastic.  However, the thought among the general population is that, to be adequately compensated for the job one does, they need to leave and come back.  This should not be the case.  There needs to be more emphasis on retaining the talent they have in the building currently and not allowing said talent to leave and potentially come back, simply because they feel compensation isn't appropriate.  "
good,"When it comes to working at an institution like JP Morgan Chase, most tasks that you are required to do can be easily completed with minimal effort. The downside is the client base that Chase offers. You have to prepare yourself to work within a financial institute, not because of the hours or the work, but the people you work for. People do not like to take ownership of their actions and blame others for their mistakes. This is what happens when you receive inbound calls, over 80% of the calls you take will be someone upset on the other line taking their frustrations out on you. In conclusion, this job is not physically demanding, but mentally and emotionally exhausting."
good,"I worked as a telephone banker; a typical day at work consisted of logging in to a phone taking calls servicing your daily banking needs; like reversing fees, ordering checks and debit cards, lots of transferred calls, and updating personal information. This job is not for everyone especially if you hate being micromanaged and you enjoys weekends off with your family."
good,"If there is one constant at JPMorgan, it is the fact that things are always changing. In just over two years I have had six different team managers do to either layoffs or restructuring of my department. The salary is average for a position, and other Banks pay more for the same job I perform. The benefits however are very good."
good,"A Corporate environment"
good,the company is always changing and adapting to its environment. They do a great job of looking into the future and changing before hand which sometimes is not understood but always for a good reason.
good,"Work can be around 8:30-6:30 M-F and 8:30-1:30 Saturdays. In-store locations have longer hours of operations, but work hours stay the same."
good,I have learned new things specially SAP CO.The company work environment is good and you can balance your personal life very well.
good,The J.P Morgan enterprise programme helped me a lot with future plans on how to start your own business as they walked us through what we need and why we need it.
good,"Chase is a company that not only matches up to 5% on a 401k, they are also one of the few, if not only, big banks that has a pension for their employees. Compensation is on par for the median market for the area I live in. I feel they just do not let their employees know vital information about their jobs. My location may or may not be around in the next 3 years. They will typically offer alternatives, but to know actually what is going would be preferred by myself."
good,I learned a lot being a Private Client Partner and loved coaching the other bankers on how to refer and increase sales opportunities.  I also liked the flexibility of being able to go to clients and meet with them at their place of business and traveling to other branches.
good,"Good place to earn consistent money and stay for long period."
good,It was  fast paced productive place to work at their Chicago location.  Their was so much to learn in such little time. People had such good work ethics.

good,"At JPMorgan I learned to deliver projects by working with a team, management and business on a common goal. JP Morgan also has a good work life balance"
good,"Protect and grow the wealth of affluent clients through customized investment plans. Through Bank of America, I assist clients with Deposit Products, Debt Minimization, and Credit Facilities. Through Merrill Edge, I assist clients with Stocks, Bonds, and Mutual Funds. In 2016, I was ranked 3rd out of 50 advisors in the New York Metro division for Deposit Growth, our #1 goal. In addition, I was awarded the ability to assist the Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Complex giving support to Financial Advisors, with books above 50MM, educating them on Merrill Edge products and services. In 2016, I was promoted to Vice President."
good,"great benefits, another place to work, has no personal life. managers not fair. long working hours , lunch tine very short and late. ignoring disabled workers ."
good,"It is a team-oriented environment, with the potential to make lucrative bonuses depending on the department. However, the company is known to lay off frequently."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a wonderful company to work for,  my goal in my career is advancement and while the company, and benefits are very well and competitive. My current focus is advancement which there is not much opportunity for internally. Attendance is a great attribute to this company, and they work well with you on a schedule to balance work and life. Benefits as well. It's a great plan that the company offers."
good,Great company. Great place to gain experience and learn how an efficient work place operates. One of the best banks in the world and a good place to start a career.
good,"A typical day at Chase has it's highs and lows if you are in a job family that work directly with the public great customer service skills is a must. In my many years with Chase bank I have learned to think fast and make prudent decisions in high pressured situations."
good,"Everyone is very helpful put they do not have the best mgmt in place. they have to many layers and things get stuck in the system."
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,there is no chance for advancement unless you are well known and liked by upper management not based on your ability. The management will train you on all you need to know in order make there job easy.
good,It's a lot of work and sometimes seems as though your efforts are muted by the process and procedures but I've been lucky to work with a good group of people.
good,"- Strict work culture "
good,"Strives to be the best,do the best in every possible way. Always wants to be the first in finding new way to do things. Started 11+ years ago in entry level position and worked my way up to managerial title."
good,I enjoyed my time with Chase. The reason I left was because they eliminated my position. Most employees were rude and snotty you learn how to put up with it
good,Challenging work that is at the forefront of the banking industry. Learned how to work in an aggressive environment on projects that directly impact the bottom line.
good,I like the training and the people I work with and the ability to move to a different department within company is great also.  It's fun to work here.
good,"High Quality IT Projects / Software and Hardware Tools-  "
good,"My time spent at JPMorgan was enjoyable.  I was fortunate enough to work with a group of individuals that became a second family to me.  During my time with JPM, I developed long lasting friendships and working relationships with so many individuals both internally and externally."
good,"good place to work to learn and teach, people with strong knowledge of products.Very easy to find and connect with any level around the globe"
good,"Assist customers with their accounts - opening, managing, closing.  Build relationships with customers to understand them on a personal level, find out about their financial goals, present products and introduce them to partners within the branch (Financial Adviser, Mortgage Officer, etc)."
good,Well paid. Great products. They can and do hire the best people. Skilful management lacking. Fear is a motivational tool. Inflexible business model. It feels good working there because everyone wants in. Very hierarchy focuses and a clicky drinking culture which contrasts strongly with how professional it is in the office. Young staff might find culture painful as very little coaching. They hire very smart people or very experienced people. Get on with your job or get out....
good,"With the large amount of layoffs in the mortgage department within the past 3 years, Chase has had the ability to hire every single employee back that was eligible. This makes for a somewhat unstable work environment. This company can sometimes be too quick to pull the trigger without completely evaluating the backlash."
good,"Responsible for providing quality audits, reports and feedback to the Mortgage Banking line of business in an effort to drive change and impact open action plans."
good,"The knowledge that I have gained from Chase has been essential to the way that I approach everything. Address a dilemma, think things through, be productive, be positive, & be helpful. Like a math problem, everything can be worked out. "
good,"Working at JP Morgan Chase was a great experience. Not only did I learn plenty about tax, I learned a lot of professional norms in the workplace. I started working at JPM around the beginning of tax return season, so a typical work day would consist of completing tax returns of mutual and hedge funds. My managers and co-workers were very helpful in my development. They trained me and the most enjoyable part of that was being around genial and well-rounded people."
good,This is a great place to work with room for growth.  I have learned different lines of business and some of the managers are very helpful.  My coworkers are pleasant. The hardest part about the job are the daily and weekly changes that are not always updated in procedures.  The most enjoyable is the culture of Chase as a global company.
good,"Very busy, but some co workers did nothing while others did all the work which wasn't fair to other employees. Management let it happen."
good,Good place to work. Opportunity to learn new technologies. Fun environment and very good work ethics.Daily standup calls with offshore and onshore.
good,"I run regular deposits and withdrawls."
good,"It's a decent place to work.  Although it does have its share of politics and 'Teachers pets'.  There are opportunities, but a little brown nosing is required to advance."
good,From joining Chase in 2011 with hardly any mortgage experience all the way to my last day on the job after lay off Chase was an enjoyable place to work and I learned a great deal. All in all I would recommend it as a place to work and I wouldn't change a thing from my 5 years with the company. Everything happens for a reason and I am looking forward to seeing what the future has in store.
good,"It is run so efficiently that everyone has to be on their A game.  Long hours, but if you are successful you are compensated well.  Since the company is so big, getting noticed or promoted is difficult"
good,Chase is a good company to get a start in the Mortgage Banking world. I have worked both on the originations side of mortgage and the default side. Anytime I have made a change in my job I was always supported by management.
good,"decent assingments"
good,"I enjoy getting into work early to set up the daily, get reports out and establish accomplishments for the day. This also allows me to be prepared to work with my staff once they arrive. I demonstrate a hard working supervisor which is contagious."
good,"Great colleagues, Great Experience. Culture is amazing in Asset management. Very experienced and skilled colleagues."
good,The company is overall good. I love my team mates there and my skills were honed most especially in customer service. It was worth my time working with JPmorgan Chase Bank and Co in the Philippines.
good,Chase is a corporate environment. The co workers are great and edger to learn and Chase rewards hard work. The company has great benefits and it pays well. The hours are great depending on the department they have tuition reimbursement.
good,"Most of the project on very old java version. Unfriendly co-workers,"
good,"My particular branch was the largest in all of Florida. It had about 35 employees total. Working there taught me many things about banking. Gave me a phenomenal base for the rest of my career. Also, I improved drastically in my Spanish since about 85% of the customers were Spanish. "
good,"•	Responsible for processing customer transactions through a program (Teller Express)."
good,"This is a good company to work for, I would recommend working for this company. The culture is constantly improving to create a good employee experience."
good,"Great benefits, normal hours, a lot of paid time off. JPM falls short on pay and bonuses. Not only that, the building is quite old and in need of some serious renovation."
good,Good place to start a career and learn while advancing. The company will also pay for additional schooling which is helpful.
good,JPMorgan Chase is a good company to build a foundation in your career with the banking industry. I have learned a tremendous amount in my time with the firm. My main area of concern though is the lack of mobility internally within the organization. Management is approachable and willing to help in any way they can for clients.The environment between colleagues is that of a team approach. The difficult part about working for a major financial institution is finding the right areas or departments to locate answers and help advise or complete your responsibilities. The positive though is with access to robust research and a significant balance sheet we are able to leverage expertise in many business avenues for the benefit to clients.
good,As part of the Internal Audit group at JPMC rigorous procedures were required to be followed to ensure work was completed thoroughly and accurately.
good,The company itself has a lot of benefits. It seems as if they want you to feel like they care. Poor management. Not as organized or advanced as you would expect a large company to be.
good,I enjoyed meeting the wonderful people whom I worked with. I learned a lot about diversity and inclusion while employed here.
good,"I have worked at J.P. Morgan full-time.(More than 5 years)"

good,"JP Morgan Chase provide a lot good learning tools and resources. I have learned lot from the company. If you do well, you will make a good money with the firm."
good,"A typical day included assisting customer lowering their monthly mortgage payment so they can stay in their home.  Also, working with attorneys, realtors, and home owners to sell their home.  I learned how foreclosure and  bankruptcy laws work for many different states.  I also learned how to do short sales, modifications, and repayment plans.  Direct management was exceptional.  Their were many different site managers to ever get to know them to give an opinion.  Co-workers all got along and made the job enjoyable to go to.  The hardest part of the job was when the Bank went to a database to enter your deals for a short sale and was approved by people out of State and this process slowed down the approval time.  This frustrated myself, along with the realtors, attorneys, and customers.  The most enjoyable was being able to help a customers and keep them in their home."
good,"I worked at JPMChase for three months in a contract position as an Incident Manager role.  I worked Sunday - Wednesday, 11 hour days. I learned that three months is not enough time to learn a new position and new applications with minimal training. "

good,Processing JP Morgan funds trades under the global investment management group in high trade processing environment. Completing tasks in a timely manner. Automating processes. Talented co-workers. Management can be irresponsible at times. Most enjoyable part is interacting with co-workers and learning new subject matter material.
good,"Typical day of work consisted of assisting customers with issues, helping them reach their financial goals, and helping co-manage the branch in sales and operations. Assisted tellers and bankers in reaching sales goals. Helped customers adapt to new technology JP Morgan Chase offered. Joined sales/operations calls. Kept track of cash targets. Audited tellers, personal bankers, and branch manager cash drawers to ensure everyone was in compliance. Company is highly focused on meeting numbers. As a team, we would brainstorm on how to get people into the new branch, so we could help them reach their financial goals."
good,"It might be very hard to get noticed outside of your department in J.P.Morgan, as in any other huge corporation. Work life balance is improving. Advanced programs such as mobility make it interesting."
good,"Great opportunity for growth, meet knowledgeable individuals and share work experiences. You have options to enhance your skills and gain flexibility within this organization."
good,"It felt wonderful working with a diverse team in India. Hardest part was the salary which wasn,t satisfactory. There was a lot of scope in Jp in terms of learning."
good,"Through my years at Chase bank I have enjoyed the work place and the people I have worked with. However more recently, a lot of changes have been going on and it has haulted the advancement ability of some positions. Good place to work, just as of right now, too many changes going on and hindering certain things."
good,"Gavea Investimentos is a nice company with supportive management. However, after the separation with JP Morgan there was no more space for a technical person to grow."
good,"Daily work various"
good,"Slow moving, old technology, smart co-workers, easy to promote yourself, good mobility.  Overall a good place to work if you would like a good work life balance."
good,"Very good place to work , but bad in terms of pay and salary with regards to the work load, good employee engagement activities, A fun place to work for"
good,I was the primary auditor on Check Processing functions and several other reviews. I was nominated twice for the Employee Wall of Fame and a 5 Key Recognition for Exceeding Expectations.
good,"Good company, good benefits, strict management. The morale is high, face paced environment where things are always changing."
good,"Overall the company is good , need to select the process you wish to work for or you will be stuck to the same work for years. The work life balance is good, lots of goodies, food, tea/coffee etc , free transportation, safety and security of self and family, the culture is good and feel like going to office."
good,"Fun place to work, more mortgage experience to add to my resume. Good environment. Nice benefits. Working for a fortune 500 company comes with quick turnaround sometimes."
good,Good Place to work.  Fun atmosphere.  Good for entry level to get experience in a business work environment.  Lots of activities.  Onsite Café.  Central location.
good,Awesome summer job being able to help save beach patrons and see pretty girls all day is not bad to get paid for doing that. I did take it very seriously but I had a lot of fun doing it.
good,This is a good company with room for advancement. They really care about you and make you feel like family. They will make sure that you have all the information you need to succeed.
good,"Its Large Campus Is great For breaks. Perfect for the first time real job, and because of that you want to stay with the company for a long time."
good,"Call all clients with any outstanding discrepancies with their trading accounts. Check the Global Commodities  markets to keep track of any exposed positions in various markets with connected issues of any clients accounts. Review and balanced any account with possible discrepancies in the trading markets while resolving all issues prior to the daily market openings."
good,"helping walk in traffic"
good,"Chase is a good employer to work for with many varieties of jobs available to suit a multitude of educational backgrounds. Its multi ethnic makeup allows you to associate with individuals of all nationalities--each bringing something new and fascinating to the table. "
good,JP Morgan chase is a fun an exciting place to work that creates an excellent work/life balance.  The only downfall for me was that it was hard to advance no matter how much credentials you had.  it was based on who you knew instead of what you knew.
good,love my team. we work collaboratively and are respectful of each other. there is no micro-managing and we are all able to work and perform well
good,My banking career began in California with Washington Mutual as a teller. I excelled in every aspect of the business and worked my way up to Assistant Branch Manager. I learned all jobs associated with retail banking. I enjoyed helping clients take the most advantage of every product the bank had to offer them and their needs.
good,"Good work life balance. Management seems to value your growth, but no action is taken when the opportunity comes. Typical day includes combing through emails and then working on financial models to input real estate property financials."
good,Lots of transactions. Random rushes through out the day. The pay could better. Heavily taxed. Upward mobility is based on performance not experience.
good,I learned a lot as a teller handling several roles. Management do not recognize a great talent to promote. Great company to work for. I enjoyed helping customers with their financial needs.
good,"Good Monitory benefits"
good,"after enrolling into career advancement programs there are too many road blocks for advancing."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with.  They are hard working, competitive, helpful, fun,and kind.  We helped a lot of people and we have excellent customer service skills."
good,"It was an amazing job! Loved every second of it, great team, great managers and very slow paced! However, i wanted something more fore filling on my end!"
good,"When I first got hired I worked nights 4:45 to 1:15 Wednesday, Sunday off. I was two months pregnant at the time. The attendance policy is no joke! You miss one day, your adherence is messed up for the month. Which is taken into account when bidding for holidays off and shift changes. It also will mess up any chances of you advancing in the company. As far as the work environment, I have never worked in a call center before. I've always had face to face contact so it's very different. I became very antsy and have to move around, I could only go so far because of my headset. I think people might be in better moods if they could see beyond the walls of their cubicle."
good,Overall I enjoyed my experience at this job. The only down falls were bad management that didn't pay attention to issues within the company.
good,Everybody is friendly we work on sorting mail for the IRS. I learned how to do Data Entry they have a nice break room. My coworkers are socialbe we work well together
good,"Internal controls review and audit prep."
good,Good experience into banking with High Net worth clients.  Exposed to lots of investment dialouge and different types of banking products.
good,A lot of pressure to meet deadlines and comply with many different reports. Takes time away from being productive. Which in turn affects bonus and raises.
good,"Pros: "
good,"The most important for this or any major bank is the bottom line and making money.  Management wastes so much money trying to convince themselves they are more advanced than the next bank, but in the end up spending way more than they needed to.  They are a lot of ways they need to improve, but overall they are successful."
good,"Great company with adequate training and competant employees, but not much room for advancement in certain desired areas. Sales is strongly pushed."
good,"Early morning job, overtime can be obtain for those who need it. Learned a lot about what jp morgan chase does as a company , team leaders and supervision were nice and helpful. The hardest part is taking on new assignments."

good,"Have to be flexible and adaptable within the department."
good,"Organized and clarity of work. Lot of learning opportunities."

good,"Customer service is at the utmost. which i enjoyed being a people person..Balancing currency. Negotiating sales and accurately registering mortgage, credit card transactions and automobile payment."
good,JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest financial service companies and offers stability and good benefits. The size can make it's policies and procedures a little rigid and it's difficult to implement any changes.
good,"This is a great place for an intern to learn. Over the months I have learn so much about investment Bank. It's a great place to work at as an student, however some management does not have any clue about  what they are doing"
good,it is a very good company to work for and there was a lot of learning in the company and they have good benefits for the employees
good,"Fast pace."
good,Good place to grow technically and it gave me an opportunity to work independently and build rapport with a virtual team spread across the globe.
good,"Productive and fun place to work, a healthy work balance atmosphere.Excellent corporate culture, opportunity for growth and development."
good,"JPM is very inclusive which provides for a diverse workplace.  It is easy to get lost in the mix if you are not looking to be an innovative team member and take opportunities when available.  The time off and ability to WFH can be worth it alone for some people.  The job can get mundane, it is important to move jobs.  Lot's of red tape, impossible to get promoted mid year, everything takes a year for promotion, raise, bonus, etc."
good,"processing home equity loans, customer contact, underwriter interaction, moving loans off to closing asap. helped out other areas as needed which helped gain knowledge of all operations within the office."
good,Collections for second Mortgage's also Short Sales and Deed in Lieu. Outbound calls to customers on charged off accounts. Negotiations with Realtor's for short sale.
good,Amazing experiance with JP Morgan. Branch Managers and District manger were great to work with. Co-works always had a positive attitude and great to work with. Opportunity for unlimited growth within the company.
good,"Resolve customer issues from sate to finish"
good,"Work culture is decent, pay is fair, people are fairly nice. The environment is fairly boring, no ping pong table, no perks."
good,great place to work depending on the manager it could be difficult place to be. The incentive plan is not the great for personal bankers. I would recommend getting licensed as soon as possible if considering working for this company.
good,"Typical work day was fast-paced and enlightening. I learned much about the company, environment and its brand. Management pretty much standard (open door)  and co-workers were young and lively. The hardest part of the job was trying to find time to be innovative and creative. The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant compliance training and the company's electronic guide and approach to information."
good,Training  and Development programs improves the overall personalities of the employee. lot of opportunity to grow vertically and horizontally for performers. Less time for office politics due to huge work pressure on all the employees.
good,Calling customers before grace period expires is the worst time. Calling the same set of accounts every month and being expected is tough.
good,I enjoyed the interaction with the people and the team atmosphere. The products and technology that Chase offers are ahead of the banking curve.  I learned to interact with diversified clients.
good,Everything about chase seems to be driven to be about the customer which a lot of companies lack now days. Another thing that i felt is they cared about me as a person. Extremely military friendly as well.
good,"Nice company to work"
good,"I handle specialized and high profile subpoena cases served on JPMorgan Chase from a variety of sources.  A typical day at work begins very early.  Throughout my work experience I have gained the ability to manage projects and get them done on, or ahead, of schedule."
good,"Great busy environment with upbeat co-workers.  Approachable management. Customer Service can be challenging, but when you can make a connection with a great customer, it can make your day!"
good,A very knowledgeable real estate closing team with a minimum of 5 years experience.  Closers worked on a national basis closing loans for various officers across the nation.  Closed loans from start to packaging for imaging delivery.  Reviewed attorney prepared documents to comply with credit approval.  Consulted with title company and other third party vendors.  Manager did not micro-manage.  A very successful closing team.
good,"Good place to work need more expansion in the work field, good culture, work life is good balanced, compensation and benefits a plus."
good,Review the firms engagements with external vendors. Look for areas of risk and attempt to mitigate the risk level. Meet with vendor relationship managers throughout the firm and review the relationships.
good,A typical day for me is fun and exciting working in the Infant or Toddler room. It's never a dull moment. My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of my job may be when we have a lot of Infants and more than one has to eat at the same time.
good,"Great temp role, where I was able to grow the role and take far more on than was initially envisaged for this role. Through change of management for facilities staff the role became permanent and 80% of my role was relocated to head office in Milton Keynes. Nothing was replaced, leaving me in a role that paid well but left me scratching for work to do each day. Took the opportunity to take a career break and travel."
good,"Even though Chase is a fast-pace goal oriented company, one can find it very rewarding to work there.  The team I worked with in my last branch were simply amazing, helpful and fun to work with."
good,"I had a fantastic experience working with this company, owing my good times to the great diversity in co-worker personalities and skill-sets."
good,The entire middle management structure lives in fear of losing their positions and therefore only looks up to who they report to and not down to who they manage. One has to leave the bank to either a competitor or vendor to have a hope of returning at a higher position and salary.
good,"read through the usecases/narratives/stories design, develop, unit test the use cases and delivery them. Learnt GWT and bit of sencha."
good,The industry has changed most of the changes are for the better but there is always room for improvement.

good,It was a great company to work for. Have since left the company and seeking new opportunities.
good,"The initial hiring process takes forever, but it is a good company to work for."
good,"As with most organizations of this size, the operational units fail to communicate effectively and often do not adjust with the agility that one would hope.  The training and empowerment to offer a culture wherein a self motivated individual can create a career with significant growth.  Because the accountability is on the employee to self develop, those without that mindset can struggle.  It is a fantastic place to work and develop. The expectations are high, but the result is a tremendous jumpstart in skill and experience.  This culture can create higher than usual performance variability at various hierarchy levels, pushing workload to the more skilled contributors.  The most challenging part of working in this environment is resource and technology.  Due to scale the organization is slower obtain necessary human and technology resources.  "

good,Great hours to work - available overtime often. Good direct managers.
good,"I enjoyed working with JP Morgan Chase.  I had a great relationship iwithmy Supervisor but we were moved from building to building, city to city and the miles to commute were difficult.  Before the lay offs, our salary was cut more than 60% and included incentives, which were very difficult to earn."
good,"An excellent company to work for however, there is an argument that it is top heavy."

I will go on the computer and pull all of the previous night reports and see if I have any items to pull from the checks that was just captured the night before. I will then scan in bags of checks from other branches and prepare them to go out with the mail. I will then then capture any bundles of checks the tellers may have for me.

good,"I performed the daily proof for the Commercial Paper Unit reconciling reports against incoming fed fund payments.  I was taught this process after graduating from college. The biggest challenge was initially learning the process, but after time I was able to gain valuable proof experience. The most enjoyable part was the knowledge gained and the encouragement from management to take my skills to a higher level. I moved on to become a Senior Proof Administrator in the Foreign Exchange Department  in 1994. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenges of resolving extensive proof differences for the unit."
good,"Your day to day responsibility is to sell checking and savings products. Once you become licensed, you are to bring in new investment balances as well.

good,"Training terrible, held to accountability standards not given, company is not for the employee"
good,"I loved the people (tellers, personal bankers) and would have continued to work there if not for one incident that the branch manager handled very poorly.  One customer said very racist comments about me out loud, in the presence of my co-workers and some customers.  The branch manager didn't follow Chase's policy and procedure with regards to incidents like that.  Per Chase's policy, the manager should have addressed the issue right then and there and contacted corporate security to give a report.  Corporate security will then close the customer's accounts as what he has done was a violation of the company's anti-discrimination policy.  The manager instead upgraded the customer's account and the very next day made some racist comment as well to me in the presence of the assistant branch manager and two other co-workers."

good,"Great coworkers, better need of manager responsibility. Learned how to do lots of things within my job description. Hours are great and vacation time was good too."
good,"Chase is a great company to work for but I am sure it would be better to be behind office doors than a branch. One has to be ready when working in an enviroment where favortism is tollerated.

good,Working at JPMorgan Chase can vary from department to department and mostly depends on the team leadership.
good,"I do a 18:30- 3:30 hours shift, I'm working in Treasury and security services, we are into FX Investigations."
good,"At the level where things get accomplished, Chase can be a fun and rewarding place to work. However, it seems like some decisions are made too quickly without forethought of the consequences, and then reversing decisions are implemented immediately after. For example, performing a move where teams get split and separated to opposite sides of the building and then interrupting business 3 weeks later to perform another move to bring the teams back together. Despite this drawback, Chase provides a fair amount of support. Job coaches assist in training to free up department resources, and the HR support systems are excellent."
good,"Chase offers a good working environment and allows you to grow, job advancement is kind of hard working in the retail side, the jobs are limited in the retail sector, I wish it was easier to move into corporate."
good,"Being the #2 bank in the US implies many things: big, steady, slow-moving, bureaucratic, etc. This can be good or not, depends on what you value. The most obvious upside is how it ended up arguably the biggest winner in the 2008 financial crisis. Even though it was a major inventor of some of the notorious derivative instruments, its conservative approach and sophisticated risk management saved it from the disasters befalling BOA and Citigroup, and pretty much survived the crisis without major layoffs."
good,Typical day was spent on phones calling past due accounts. We would usually have a short meeting in the afternoon to go over any changes or additions to policy. Co-workers were great and always willing to help. Management for the most part was very helpful and there when you needed them. Most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and helping them to understand consequences of not paying these debts.

good,"Overall, good company to work for. Great benefits and time off. Company also rewards employees with a monthly lunch paid in full as well as a competitive incentive program. The greatest opportunity is growth within the company. There isn't much opportunity and if so specific department goes for word of mouth and not particularly hard working employees who have worked their way up. Overall, JP Morgan Chase is a good employer and it may just be the department in which I happened to work for that had that specific area of opportunity."

good,"typical day was getting personal space ready for the day-pens, letter opener and emails read and taken care of. After the mail came it was crazy, but not over the top nuts. I learned that EVERYTHING needs to be prioritized from one day to the next. Management seemed young and slightly inexperienced for the responsibilities but all in all was up for the challenges. My co-workers, as I said above, were a cultural grab-bag...white, black, hispanic, male, female, married, single, children, no children, grandchildren; when it came to crunch-time, all helped in whatever capacity they could. The hardest part of the job? No part was ""hard"", just crazy. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet a wonderful group of ""characters"", although I do keep in contact with a good number of them. Would not have traded this experience for anything."

good,I enjoyed growing my career with the company. Great place to start.
good,Performed more work than job description stated. Went above and beyond as I usually do and it didn't get me no where because I didn't have the seniority.

good,"work was the focus always"
good,"Overall good place to work.                             "
good,Great compensation and health benefits. Company provides lots of training and development but mentoring factor by Management could be better and promotions to other areas of bank are available via networking not earned by sampling being a top performer.
good,"My experience was that the area, people, and job that I performed were all pretty good. I wasn't performing the job that I interviewed for but it was ok as I was being compensated more than the position is worth."
good,"The hours were very demanding with days that could stretch as far as 18hrs some days, but for a person that likes to see the finished product it can be very rewarding."

good,"Work Independently with little supervision"
good,everyone is nice and the work load as an associate banker is easy but an attempt to advance in your career is not that easy. You would think that being an employee of the company for several years would provide you some sort of benefit to move around but nope.
good,"I like working for JPM, the environment was stable and they gave me a lot of flexibility specifically a very good work life balance with flexible work times and the ability to work remotely when needed.  I found this flexibility to be very valuable in my personal situation."

good,"Throughout my 15 years at Chase I have seen Chase and it's management be the best and not the best, that's all part of large corporate environment. I grew and learned lessons from both and appreciate all the diversity Chase provided."

good,"A great place to work to for expierence in banking and if degreed can move up the ladder. There is opportunies for internships, enviorment is diversified and the benifits are some of the best I have seen."
good,"Many locations and opportunities.  Chase is a great company to work for because they invest in their employees.  In addition, Chase has a wide variety of people from various cultures and background.  I have learned a great deal at Chase about business, finances, and customer service over the past 17 years.    Presently, I am in a research position that does not require phone contact, which is both interesting and challenging due to no interaction with the public.  I am looking for a position to match my latest degree in psychology and to interact with people who need help in the area of mental health.  I have enjoyed working for Chase."
good,"I have had a good experience here with helping team and good, understanding management. I liked the casual work environment with an awesome campus here in Plano, TX."
good,"worked way up to asst VP in mortgages/ supervised a group of great loan officers.....was great job and worked with great people..then, the recession hit and our dept got canned, i was moved to another area where we were destined to fail..i got canned with a lot of other workers during the recession, they called it firing for low performance, but it was a farce, they got rid of like 2 thousand of us nationwide...i was very disappointed they did it this way..they put me in a position that didnt exist and it was destined to fail...i wish they would have just been a stand up manager and said, ""hey, we dont have a place for you any more now that the economy is in the crapper and we are getting rid of our huge mortgage department, and especially anyone we had working near subprime...that would have been a more respectful way to can us..."
good,Overall a great place to work at where you can balance both job work/personal life !                                                                        Great benefits and wining team culture.
good,"day to day work exciting but review process and constant change of management cause issues with performance rating due to politics."
good,"hours are a little bit long, but generally the work culture is in general good and diverse. Good for people interested in a global company and the company recognises talent and provides more responsibility to talented people."
good,Typical Corporate fulfillment environment.  Work your loans and conditions as independently as possible and as quickly and accurately as possible.  Meet service level agreements and be accurate in your calculations.  No further comment
good,Good place overall and bit more relaxed than most places I would recommend someone to consider Chase. You can learn a lot and get your foot in the door and grow your career
good,"A typical day at chase would be to login to all of the programs, check emails and messages, and make and take calls. The hardest part about the job was staying current on all new information. Information is key!"
good,"JPM is the type of firm where you hit the ground running. It's sink or swim, noting in between. Its great place to see what you're made of. There's so much going on at all times its impossible not to get involved in projects outside of BAU (business as usual). Benefits are competitive to other big banks."
good,"good starter job, terrible lower management, low salary, commission is taxed like crazy. Customers yell at you, you need to make calls or you aren't doing your job"
good,La Empresa excelente algunos empleados no profesionales
good,I have to be relocated with my own expenses four different  states and that's was not a very good. Besides no promotions and very low salary reviews. I was layoff in 2018 and thank you chase.

good,"The workplace culture was typical of a multi global, multi national business looking at its profit bottom line aligned to its global market standing."

Ensure risk and controls compliance for supported platforms. Manage Fee Billing applications in the Custody, Asset Servicing, and Securities Processing platforms. "
good,"Like the place, but need to move on."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a large multi-national bank with great benefits but opportunities for advancement are highly competitive. "
good,"As a Private Client Banker I enjoyed my time there. The company gives you a lot of support to succeed. Chase itself is a stand up company to work for, but the promotion opportunities are lack luster(depending on the area of work)."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"nice job but depends on the location "
good,"Overall very good company, very progressive, keeping up with the times by targeting trends to remain relevant and cutting edge with technology and marketing."
good,Great place to work. It takes forever to be promoted to a new position. You would have to be cool with Management in order for them to recommend you for promotion. Great place to learn about new Technology regarding banking industry.
good,"Great people to work with, solid company to build a career on, and get to serve a lot of great customers."
good,A typical day starts with a team meeting. I learned Ofac & KYC process working as a liaison between the banker and client. I worked closely with management to open high profile clients accounts in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is working within different markets.
good,"I have been working at Chase Bank for a year, and they are a good company to work for. It is a even paced work environment that gives you plenty of opportunity for advancement."
good,Working at Chase has its challenges like any company you work for however I have been with Chase for over 10 years. The benefits are great and there is always opportunity available to enhance your skills.
good,"Very demanding environment, but pay is competitive plus and the people are terrific.  Dedicated to the customer experience and on-going improvement.  The CEO is among the best in the world, and senior leadership is strong. There are however opportunities for improvement within the management ranks, not uncommon within large organizations."
good,It was never the same experience everyday that I came to work.  Every job you are on requires you to put in work but this one requires a little more dedication.
good,"I gained alot of exposure to investments; alternative investments was the most impactful.  Being part of the private bank showed me opportunities in investments that I hadn't ever been exposed to.  "
good,"Incident Management -  Priority 1 incidents, training on Service Now.  HP Service Manager.  Working with Great people.  Working with Great management."
good,"My job involves handling payments."
good,I love that this company spends a lot of money on their technology. Need better managers and tone down the micro-managing. It is nice to be with a big company but the downside is bureaucracy.
good,"I believe the majority of managers are very good at JPMC - my manager was terrible.I was treated unfairly and often not acknowledged by my manager. I was rarely given opportunities to grow and only wanted me to do administrative tasks when my experience proved I was capable of much more. And although I tried to get other roles, nothing seemed to work out."
good,I have enjoyed my work at JPMorgan.  They have provided me with opportunities to work from home on occasion.  That was important when recovering from Breast Cancer.  They are a very friendly and cooperatative team and we work well as a team.
good,"Role was specifically geared towards assisting Loan Officers and Appraisers during the refinance, purchase or new construction phase of providing timely evaluation of property value which (1) would comply with federal regulation (2) fall in the line of pricing considerations for appraiser/loan officer (3) Which provided a detail description of property characteristics through the use of Comparable properties in a geographical area/ consideration of flood zoning etc"
good,"Strong culture hampered by management challenges.  Excellent benefits and compensation, wellness programs and ability to work remotely.  "
good,Some banks are very good to work for and other banks are not.  I was originally with Washington Mutual Bank (a wonderful group of people and fantastic career advancement opportunities) but then we merged with JP Morgan and things really changed.
good,"Passed series 7 & 63 exams. "
good,"Great work environment, however can get out of balance at times. Need to have high energy and high expectations to work in a child environment. Have to love kids to work here."

good,"Fast paced environment with many development resources.  Very smart and collaborative workplace culture.  Great place to network, learn and grow while doing meaningful work."
good,Review customer contacts from previous day.  Review existing portfolio to create a daily call list.  Contact client by phone to uncover needs and schedule an in branch meeting to review relationship.  Refer client to business partners (lending/investments) to enhance relationship.  Recap daily activity and plan for the next days activities.
good,"It was a positive and fun place to work if the team members were all in agreement and hard workers. For the most part the customers and coworkers were very good to work with. They branch was very busy, so challenging was a big part of it. The hardest part of the job was being scheduled for a 10 hour shift with only a 30 minute break. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting and satisfying my customers and coworkers. A typical day at work involved helping customers as a teller both in the lobby and drive through, greeting customers and directing them to a banker, teller or ATM and making sure they were aware of the wait time. Also I would give them options of ways to take care of what they needed, if they could not wait to be helped. I learned so much about the banking and investing business. I also learned how to help with unhappy customers and coworkers."
good,"I definitely enjoy working in this company. Employee benefits and all very good"
good,It was great to prepare you for the world of sales. Working at the Chase will give you the step needed to work with consumer and business customers. Working from the inside out is a great way to learn about the intricate details of finance and customer service.
good,"I have nothing really to say about Chase Bank , due to there was a merger whereas they purchased Bank 1.  I thought that Chase should have kept the employees that were under Bank 1, but this is business."
good,"Very different atmosphere. Very stressful at times, as well as very comfortable. A lot of managements and regional management giving constant upgraded ideas on how to improve. Lots of support."
good,"- Worked in Canary Wharf - the heart of the finance sector in London. Was amazing to work in 1 Canada Square and get to see how life on the trade floors was so chaotic."
good,A good place to work if your interested in progression. If you work hard it will be noticed. Not the place to work if you're looking for just a 9 to 5 role.
good,Good work/life balance. Lots of interesting opportunities. The workplace culture is nice. You get to work to interesting problems. Intra company mobility opportunities are enouraged
good,Worked here for almost 20 years and then was let go because I got sick and could no longer come into the office (aka re-org/my position was eliminated)
good,"While the company CEO is excellent, department management is weak and uses favoritism to advance less qualified people. It's also unfortunate in today's environment that bosses can be recognized and rewarded for being office bullies."
good,"Cyclical changes in organisation become counter productive. A great place to work though, always learning. Internal politics are as you would expect but it's getting better. Work life balance is being supported opposed to it simply being 'lip service' from senior management."
good,Chase was a cool place to work. I hold several position there and at each position it was not that much as increase in pay. For me I was a little concern with because that was one of the reason for growth.
good,"This is a good company where you can learn a lot in a short period of time if you work hard, they will acknowledge your work, though sometimes they fall short. There are many opportunities and it's a place i would recommend."
good,I was employed at JP Morgan heritage organization for 40 years.  I retired in 2018 after working most of my career in Commercial Bank finance.  I enjoyed my job and had great co-workers across the firm.  I love working with people and my team mates were exceptional.
good,"Was a decent place to work until Chase changed it's culture and took away employment hours to opt. for online dependence. "
good,The co workers are all friendly and keep the pace fast. The managers know everyone by name despite not being in their department. Overall a good place to work.
good,I would see clients from the time the doors opened until they closed.  Management was very involved in promoting cross-selling to the point that it sometimes made clients feel uncomfortable.  I enjoyed the time I spent with clients.
good,Great place to work if you are looking for a highly competitive environment. Common for salaried  analytics to work nights and or weekends. Management is supportive of goals and tries to give workers the tools needed to succeed.
good,Working on the phones was great at the beginning. Then the company decided it would be a great idea to make the Private Client credit card service team take calls from every line of business and then it became awful.
good,"Winning culture, great benefits and competitive pay along with advancement for employees and acceptance of diviristy are huge benefits. Work-life-balance depending upon which LOB/CF you may work for."
good,"Muy buena escuela, es un Banco con una amplia cartera de productos donde aprender y aplicar es clave."
good,People I worked at JPMorgan Chase Bank were great. There was always this open communication among all coworkers and everyone always helped each others.
good,"I met some very nice people while I worked there. Lots of cold calls, cross selling, goals, and lobby control. The hardest part would have to be trying to control all of the work you need to get done in a short amount of time, You may have 50 monitored phone calls you need to make that day and set a certain amount of appointments but also have to control all of the walk in customers and it can get hectic depending on the location and day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of helping someone in financial need and really making a difference in their lives.Management for me wasn't always very helpful, but I was fortunate to have great team members who had been there many years to help with anything I needed."
good,"I worked her for many years.  THe position and compensation however changed yearly and the goals became more unattainable for loan officers.  Though I was constantly in the leaders club, the tools the company gave us to succeed became less and less"
good,"Company for the most part is a fair company.  The guidelines set forth by Chase try to be fair for all employees.  However, the practices are not always carried out by all of the managers"
good,I worked in JPMorgan in Sales and Structuring team in Mumbai. Great place to learn about the Capital markets. Work life balance was not good but the good compensation.
good,"An amazing place to work. The leadership cares about employees career growth. They also believe in work / life balance. Having been out of the work environment, my manager coached me so that I was able to succeed."
good,"Overall, JPMorgan is going through lots of changes and some things that worked for the company before are no longer part of the company and in all J.P. Morgan is a great company to work for."
good,"A great place to work with great benefits. Flexible, relaxed and production oriented environment. Lots of opportunities if you are willing to put in the work."
good,The reason that I am no longer with JPMorgan is due to the relocation of my job and my unwillingness to relocate.  I enjoyed working there for the past 40 years and had the opportunity to learn many different job functions.
good,"Poor management. "
good,BO support of applications I've learned the trade and its tricks in this place. A fun environment with great colleagues and management. Immense support for female talent and growth
good,"Management is demanding but reasonable. At Jersey City location, certain floors have absolutely no respect for others sharing the floor who need quiet to work efficiently."
good,Great company to work for. I gained great knowledge about financial fraud especially about debit card fraud. I feel i can still use this knowledge going forward.
good,"The new Plano Campus in the Dallas office is an amazing place to work. The cafeteria is one of the best I've seen.  The dress code for the Dallas office is casual, which makes for a relaxed working atmosphere."
good,"It is a nice company many to work for, but employees are underpaid, there are several positions all over the world and is a very big company, it has a nice work/life balance and management is pretty good"
good,JP Morgan Chase was a great learning experience. Management really care about their team and train and follow up closely. They have great benefits and compensation package.
good,"Day starts with stand up meeting"
good,"I spent 10 years at JPMChase straight out of university.  I enjoyed my time there, mostly because of the people.   My management was great early on however about 5yrs into my time there I started reporting to management that was off site.   That was one of the things I disliked the most about my time at JPMC."
good,"Currently working in Governance with a goal to reduce Engineers time spent working on risk items by 40%.  We are migrating all of IT to an Agile approach."
good,Exciting with a gaming area making exciting and relaxing place to work. I learned a great deal of networking meeting new people and learned a great deal of management which i am very grateful to experience as a manager. In my current position i can be faced with stressful situations that require me to work under pressure on a daily basis and i have since learned to manage stress now it's just part of the job that i do well. At the end being able to solve complex issue's leaving a smile on the customer's face finding solutions for our client's.
good,It wasn't much pay when I worked there but I loved the job. Every day was a little different and sometimes you would get rewarded and recognized for good work.
good,Chase has the potential to be a great company. But the things that make it great also impair change. The culture of pay by performance with no set guideline on how one receives a raise is spurious. There are too many arbitrary factors that go into the pay structure that as an employee it's a guessing game
good,Retirement services is a nice place to work if you do not expect to move up or advance.  They will do right by you if you have good attendance and perform admirably.  No complaints outside of advancement opportunities was not there.
good,"I work as a teller and there are a lot of positives. For instance, working part time you are eligible for benefits and base pay is pretty good. However, things very considerably per branch. I've worked in other branches besides my regular one and the environment is way different. It all depends on your manager and LTOS. My main complaint is that their is no real way to move up within your branch unless someone leaves or gets fired. I'd love to work there full time it's just not an option for me at this point. And it's hard to work two jobs because one is unable to offer you full time."
good,"Great benefits and good work environment. I enjoy working for the company and like our policies. The downside to this however, is that no one leaves so there is very little room for advancement."
good,"J.P. Morgan Chase is still a highly bureaucratic company, where decisions are not easily made or handed down.  Although the technology organization is moving to a very desirable agile/scrum and continuous development cycle - the business is still very much waterfall and performs poorly when attempting to prioritize work and accept timeline shifts.  "
good,chase always has the employee in mind.  Advancement is common within the departments.  Training/cross-training is frequent within the Job Connect framework.
good,"Its a retail environment that does take a lot of your time. They overload you with responsibility with not enough pay to go with it but other than that, things are high paced"
good,I have been to corporate and loved it. I just wished that more of the mindset was shared inside the branches. It is a great company to work for. You will work until 6:00pm every day and its a long day of sometimes some of the slowest days.
good,"Good place to take your career forward. Lots of interesting projects going on all the time. Culture of respect and inclusion. Excellent brand name. "
good,"1) Working culture is good but salary structure is not as expected."
good,"Get culture to work for. It really teaches you how to deal with all types of personalities. The time off for me wasn't good enough, After a couple of years I want my weekends back."
good,JPMorgan Chase provides a great opportunity for employees to learn about tax payment processing and the reasons for taxpayers using certain tax documents.
good,"being at Chase was a pleasure. the only down side is that the managers get use to doing the  best job and refuse to promote you based on that."
good,"JPMorgan is a great company, but I did not think there are many opportunities to grow.  Management is great and supportive.  There is a lot of movement of offices due to construction of the flagship building on park avenue."
good,Chase is a company that hires with a desire to build you up and give you the skills needed to advance in your career. If you are willing to put the work in you will be able to build a solid career here.
good,Work across multiple teams and constantly changing demands. A lot of internal investment in IT infrastructure to make communication between teams and systems work better. Definitely is paying off on efficiency.
good,"You are able to learn from multiple jobs and different departments within the company, they are flexible with family/work. Enjoyed growing within the company over 20 years"
good,My experience at JP Morgan was amazing as I was able to learn the basic skills In the office environment for the working world.It was also very helpful for interview skills
good,a typical day a the calling center will start taking call from jp morgan Chase customers.  It was a very high volume customer service environment. Management offered enough training.
good,"It appears getting rid some of the personal for some reason or another. Making working difficult to enjoy and feeling unappreciated. However, did enjoy working from home at times."
good,"Good company. Good health benefits. Management is ok. "
good,Working with JP Morgan Chase was a challenging opportunity that I enjoyed for the most part. Once they started with lay offs they kept going with not a lot of opportunities for movement into other positions in order to stay with the company.
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a great company to work for. Amazing benefits offered like medical, dental 401k and pension. I learned a lot in my time there, I was with the company for 11 years.  However changes with management led to concern with regard to the culture of the work place."
good,"lots of opportunities for junior employees, but week middle management which prevents growth for mid-level employees. The company provides a lot of training and education opportunities which are really great for personal development."
good,Not a bad place to work. A bit of a backstabby culture that existed at the time. Lots of rumours flying about the trading floor but that is what it is.
good,"It is hard to move positions, easy to move locations. A lot of glass ceilings at multiple levels. Basic financial sales work. Team and managers change often."
good,"While working at Chase, one gets to learn what it is like to work for one of the most respected firms in the banking industry. They strive for greatness and make shre their employees share the same values and culture focused around the customers. While the hours can sometimes be long, there are plenty of advancement opportunities thst are available if one desires to venture deeper into the banking industry."
good,"•	Reviews home lending and consumer banking customer information and ensures accurate reporting to credit reporting agencies "
good,"En líneas generales mi valoración respecto a mi trayectoria (>"
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a good place to work but you have to make your own way.  Like any job there is biases by the managers.  You need to take charge of your career.  Also, you might get a good starting salary but JP Morgan is stingy with raises and bonuses.  They provide excellent career development training.  You should take advantage of this service."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a very large institution, which can sometimes affect the pace of progress on individual projects.  While the red tape can be a burden at times, it is common in financial institutions of this size, and JPMorgan Chase strives to never let these impede the growth of individual team members."
good,The relationship banker position was a great position until they started to cut the incentive plan. They are making it hard for bankers to make payout. Location is everything don't let them tell you that every location has potential because that's BS make sure you are in a affluent area if you are a banker or you will not make any money.
good,"JPMC is the best at what it does when you consider how massive of a corporation it is. There are countless complexities and loose ends that need to constantly be fixed, amended, or changed. This is why they employ so many people. The job is secure and JPMC is a leader in its areas -- which means there is job security. Most JPMC work locations are in undesirable areas."
good,"Very intense amount of work, but compensation reflects it. People really want you to do well and will help wherever they can.Great place to work and would recommend to anyone."
good,"A global company that values diversity, ethics and diversity. Promotes employee growth and integrity with many opportunities for longevity with good benefits."
good,Chase is great for corporate america...it is difficult however to grow and move to something larger within the company. It is busy and always needs tellers more than any other role
good,Great company to work for!! Everyone was very nice and shared their experiences.Positive work environment where people feel valued.A great culture - coming to work
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"its like everywhere , work hard get paid . But working every saturday sucks .A lot of cold calling . The most enjoyable part of the  job is that you get your commission check every month ."
good,This was a temporary job. Very fortunate because this job was only supposed to be six months. I was there for a year and a half. The work I did in the mortgage banking department was very easy and straightforward.
good,"Great benefits and numerous for career advancement. The workplace environment is extremely calm and receptive. There are always new projects in the works. Job security has not been something many people are concerned about,"
good,"Great place to work. loved working at JP Morgan Chase, but the management takes the law into their hands and acts as a CEO of the company and have their favorites."
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company, at times it can be a little stressful but for the most part the work environment is relaxed and easy going.."
good,"Proper work and life balance in the company. Good work gets an appreciation and vice versa, which makes it more transparent. Only one thing that bother is working hours."
good,"It is a great company to work for if you are just starting out in life. They have great benefits, but you have to keep place with the company. The management will take care of you if you work hard."
good,JPMC has been the only company I have worked for (now at 13 years) and have managed to move around significantly for new and different opportunities.  I have had a wonderful experience but it might not be right for everyone.
good,"the management team is doing good when it come to fun day activities, they provide free food, they give us extra time for lunch and the culture, environment is really great at JP Morgan. the hardest part is just regarding their schedule because i had to take break from school so that i can go to work. that is really bothered me a lot. but other  than that, i would recommend .omeone to go work there."
good,Great company with many benefits. Fast passed environment. Health management is greatly provided and encouraged. Access to other internal departments.
good,"Opportunity to grow and learn new lines of business, friendly environment good people. There is a lot of support to promote within and many local business groups to expand your networking opportunities."
good,"Chase was a great place to work, no room for advancement at a store you enjoy or close to home."
good,Just ready to move on and advance in my career . Chase is a good starter company but when ready to Advance you are at a stand stil. Great vacation time
good,"It is an incoming call center. So be prepared to answer phone calls back-to-back, non-stop. As part of the position, you are required to up-sale other products that the company offers during each call."
good,"The employees of the firm are great people to work with and the product is best in the industry. The group is growing and the firm is well positioned to take advantage of the changes in the industry, particularly in the asset class."
good,The managers are great they offer flexible hours and work/home life balance. My favorite thing about working for Chase is the benefits they offer.  Overall I love my job.
good,Great corporate culture but with its own set of challenges owing to the large organization which is quite difficult to navigate especially if you are a new employee
good,"Overall its not a HORRIBLE company to work for, but often times your just a number. There have been threats of RIF within my dept for well over 2 years and it finally happened, April 20th 2018 is my last day. Glad I get a little time to job search, but a month and a half is hardly ample time to seek a good position in technology. I guess time will tell."
good,Be prepared to have the compensation structure change every year to rewards certain products and services. Good management can make or break your career. Get buy in early on from your fellow branch members because they can make or break your career.
good,I am responsible for vulnerability assessment and maintaining the security and risk posture for the team. I have learned good documentation skills. The management gives your freedom to make your own decisions and entrusts you with responsibilities. The hardest part of the job is collaboration with different teams. I enjoy learning something new every day.
good,"I have learned a lot at JPMorgan Chase it is a successful and wonderful company to work for unfortunately, I would have to relocate due to my family. We are relocating to an area where there aren't any chase locations, so I have to apply elsewhere. I would recommend anyone to work at Chase"
good,"Lots of opportunities but the day to day work can be mundane. Management is willing to work with you but many seem to grow too content. People who want to move up will, those that don't will not."
good,I spent close to 21 years at JP Morgan overall it was a positive experience the overall culture was strong and supportive. I have been through many management changes and restructures the last being my department being moved to Boston
good,"JPMorgan is your classic 9-5 job. If you're looking to check in and check out without really thinking, this is the place you want to be. A lot of the processes and functions are very outdated so you'll reach a point in your time there where it's hard to learn without taking on more project related responsibilities. Work environment is great, and everyone is usually there just to be there to earn that pay check. I am looking to transition out of corporate America because I want to find an industry I feel is making an impact on the community/society."
good,Enjoyable place to work. Very team work orientated. The management was very supportive and friendly.There were employee incentives. I had a good experience working for CHASE.
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great company to work for by far. You will be well trained and it will do wonders for your work experience and resume. Be prepared to work but with enough determination, you can make strides with this company."
good,"Chase is a great company to work for. They provide amazing benefits and paid time off. However, they are always changing their policies, procedures, and compensation plans for their sales employees. I enjoy working for Chase, but the pay and structure is unreliable. I would recommend Chase as an employer to anyone searching for a salary role, but anyone searching for commission, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
good,"Chase is amazing if you want to learn the ins and outs of Retail Banking and overall banking corporations. Once you get situated, learn what you can and move onto other things"
good,Chase is a great job for college age or new college graduates. It teaches a lot of work and life skills including how to dress and act professionally. There is opportunity to make a career out of it otherwise it looks great on a resume and provides benefits like health insurance and 401k matching.
good,JPMorgan Chase was a great place to work.  Would still be working for Chase if our department had not relocated.  The job was very fats paced and competitive and you got paid bonuses and commission for your hard work.
good,"A typical work everyday is business day or busy day.   I was one of the Process Managers who oversees the day-to-day operations of Bank Loans.  I review trades and settlements processing, position and cash reconciliation and attends to Management meetings and conferences."
good,Good place to work. Fast paced and competitive. Good benefits and average compensation. You are given a great deal of training throughout the year and treated fairly.
good,"Very Stressful, long hours, great benefits. Management leaves a lot to be desired. They are always making cuts to the technology department which means there is no job security."
good,"This was my introduction into the finance world as I only had a mathematics background. You hit the ground running, however there is support from your coworkers. You work with various teams in multiple countries and build relationships with managers across the board."
good,"JPMorgan has a large global presence with plenty of opportunity in many different job functions.  The firm is investing in innovation, employees and driving to improve the customer experience at all levels."
good,"I worked in a very fast paced environment that was sink or swim. It taught me how to develop global relationships, manage priorities and learn derivatives."
good,"While only a temporary position, my experience at JP Morgan Chase was positive. The position was straight forward, the training was sufficient to make sure the job was done correctly."
good,"great company to work for; but does require a lot of sacrifices re time and commitment to being available to your clients 24/7. Was promoted after 2 years, but then did not see a lot of potential for further growth within Asset Management without going into direct sales (commission based roles)."
good,This was a temporary staffing agency. Worked for a seasonal company Monday thru Friday every year from 6am to 2pm. The job was easy. Worked with different people everyday.
good,It was a great workplace with good people but the some of the manager are arrogant and not trustworthy. I learned things about government documents and loans.
good,Good Projects to manage .Opportunity to learn about latest technology. great compliance policies helps work in a well defined environment. Overall great company to put in the resume.
good,"lack of care for employees, policy would change a lot, customers would know news about Chase before employee at times. They take care of the employee well to a degree."
good,"good place to work , sometimes you get challenging work sometimes maintenance work but can learn so many things."
good,JPMorgan Chase & Co. has a lot of opportunity for someone to grow and develop in the mortgage industry. The benefits and pay offered are competitive to other mortgage companies.
good,".Rota Shift with overnight support"
good,"For my nine years, I have seen much in the way of change. One consistency is the heavy office politics mixed with limited advancement options. Those who knew how to play the game and say the right things to the right people could advance but only so far. If someone or something harmed a persons reputation, advancement would not happen. As a large corporation there is much in the way of support roles as well as project positions. The missing element is career path and mentorship. Lastly, it is easy to find someone who can be a manager, but hard to find a leader who knows the difference."
good,"JPMC is a large national bank with many opportunities but mostly lower pay for consulting and full time employees.  Depending ont he job title and your skill, you get waht you negotiate for.  Found recent (last 3 years) consulting pay to be in range of $50-60/hr. via consulting agencies due to caps by JPMC.  "
good,"This job is definitely for one that thrives in an environment that is completely phone based. There is room for advancement, but normally you'd need to be in your current line of work for a year in order to consider doing that. The benefits are remarkable, that alone would b=make anyone stay."
good,"depends on which department you work for, the daily hours range from 6 to 12 or more hours.  there are definitely some incompetent people but most employees work hard. The pay is average."
good,"Emphasis on internal mobility, and several opportunities to explore vast array of functions across multiple line of businesses. Structured corporate setting and several levels of management"
good,"If you are a joiner, Chase loves to include the employees in many games, activities, gathering, volunteering, etc.  Great place to work if you enjoy that.  They put family first, but that is in the end up to your direct manager as there is no HR on site."
good,"Good work life balance and employee benefits."
good,"I was part of the Cash core Operations team,  where i led​ ​the​ ​migration​ ​of​ ​the​ ​Cash​ ​core​ ​process​ ​(fund​ ​transfer​ ​process​ ​using​ ​​SWIFT​)​ ​from​ ​eight​ ​Asian​ ​countries"
good,"You'd be expected to work hard, work long with minimum errors if you require a good growth. Ideas are always appreciated. The pay for a fresher; and the bonus is good, but hikes vary;sometimes could be disappointing. Benefits- free transportation, food coupon. "
good,"Chase is a good place to work if you need a part time position, but for some life changes make that impossible. To get a full-time posotion you would have to change fields all together.  "
good,prefer not to review due to time away from the company.  i have not worked there in many years and cannot give an honest review regarding this company
good,Very good company to work for. They are very flexible and work with you for time off for Doctor's appointments. Benefits are good. Fun place to work for.
good,I was very satisfied with my time at JP Morgan Chase. The benefits were good and the salary was fair to start with. The opportunity to grow in my department though was not were it should have been. I felt very stuck at the bottom with no way to move up. But this was reflective of my department not JPMC as a whole.
good,"Just renovated the Lounge and it is GREAT!  Great food, ping pong tables, billiards, and Starbucks all inside the building.  The hours can be long, but it is left mostly to you to manage your day to day responsibilities."
good,"Chase Call Center is a fast paced environment, with high call volumes which can be stressful at times, but the compensation and benefits make up for it. Your annual pay raise is based on your quarterly and overall yearly performances/scores. Never had an issue with my colleagues. But of course, like most places, every job has several pools of drama that float around the office. As long as you steer clear of any drama or negative people, you will be fine. And overall, the company is great at focusing on team building activities and events, for its employees."
good,tedious work after basic agenda is learnt; management is mediocre. benefits are good as well as vacation time. desk job so be prepared for that sort of office culture and day-to-day.
good,I was an ok job nothing special about it not bad nothing good .Chase was just a paycheck nothing really to get excited about. I would clock in take a lunch and clock out
good,Chase was very good to me. My location was a very good location to work at. Lot's of opportunities to grow in the business world. Typical work week was Monday through Friday.
good,Overall great work environment. Incentives can add up very quickly if you build yourself a pipeline as a Relationship Banker (there is a quota.) As a Personal Banker (No quota) points don't add up as quickly but good incentive at the end of the month. Ideal part time job as a teller if you're going to school.
good,"My branch location was too far away, and I have two small kids so the hours and distance took a toll. Great leave of absence and health benefit, depending on management training and advancement is possible."
good,Its a great place to go and settle after years of experience. But for freshers its not a great platform to learn new things and to have career growth.
good,"I have learned to sell banking products through building relationship with customers. Learned about mortgage, commercial and investment banking. I have learned to resolve customer problems in efficient manner."
good,"Good workplace and supportive "
good,"my job consisted of several mini jobs.  i managed a buying team, i serviced 84 automotive dealers while maintaining the bank's directives.  Focused on customer service"
good,"Extremely stratified large bank.  Although management is now making an effort to create an amicable ""culture"" within the firm, in practice, just like any other large public institution, it is very cut-throat (specially at the higher levels) - pay range is pretty standard for a bank, and benefits are pretty average."
good,"This is a company that made a ton of money off you, but always wanted to pay you less. Went through constant comp program changes as upper management stated we was getting paid too much"
good,A well matured organization which has evolved over a period of time. Good working environment but age old systems. Good pay compared to industry standard.
good,Minimal growth. Slow paced at times. Lacking opportunities. Career development was minimal. Would have like opportunity to grow business outside of current state
good,"Great Place to Regain Mainframe Work Experience.  "
good,Work life balance wasn't really there with a stressful environment but the work and industry were very interesting.  Compensation was competitive as well.
good,"I feel that the company had good benefits, but its hard to move up within in the company. The company is full of change. I have been with Chase going on 5 years, and I enjoyed the company but its hard without having certain people in your corner."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great place to begin your career in the financial services industry.  The work/life balance is manageable and you get to engage with folks from every demographic.
good,"In 35 years with JP Morgan and its predecessor firms, I was offered opportunities to learn about multiple businesses and to engage in key initiatives."
good,My manager and the team that I supported were great people to work with.  Great environment and surrounded by very bright and capable people. The management staff respects their administrative staff and appreciates their work.
good,"Worked closely with IT team to ensure that they fully understand there financials.  Additionally, provide them with support on business cases and efficiency saves.  The hardest part of the role is that when I accepted the role I was promised to become head of the team (replace existing team lead) in 1 year time, but this did not happen as the individual I was replacing left the bank the day before I started.  The bank decided to fill the role with an individual that was with the bank for many years."
good,"Good company to work for. Great starter job if interested in working in the financial world. Technology is advanced. I stopped working at chase in 2012, but technology was fast during that time compared to others. Not sure how things are now."
good,"Typical day at work is first starting by checking my emails to see if there is any specific tasks assigned to me on that day."
good,"Reviewed spreadsheet on last applicants status, added new applicants to spreadsheet for the day and reviewed all financial documents provided to proceed with loan review.  Contacted customers on missing items, requested documents from social security administration, IRS, payoff statements, etc..  Ran FHA/VA case numbers, completed change of circumstances and interacted with all parties for submission to underwriter, produced closing documents, contacted notary and finalized loan approval."
good,"Job relocated from US to Buenos Aires. "
good,"Long career progress. Good people, fair management, good long term plan for new hire, tech investment are top priority and always leading the marketplace."
good,"Compensation for the Retail Banking arm of the company is the best in the market, rewarding for competitive sales people. But it's nearly impossible to move from Retail Banking to Private Banking or Commercial Banking."
good,"Good place to start up your career, work culture is good. A friendly environment, you get all the adventures and learn and excel for the better future."
good,High volume creative shop with unending demands for fresh content and quarterly marketing campaigns across a broad spectrum of consumer and B2B financial products and services.
good,"great benefits, base salary plus potential for monthly incentive based on performance in sales and quarterly incentive based on overall branches service"
good,I guess the most enjoyable part of the  job was seeing your employees grow. I feel there are a representation of you. Also seeing them get promoted in a field they really wanted.
good,"Schedules vary based on job description"
good,Worked as a teller. Learned a lot about banking and personal finances. It was very interesting to learn about the operations of banking on a branch level.
good,"JPMC Legal has great name recognition, interesting & challenging people and a collegial work environment.  But the pay is so very low compared to market, and the company has no interest in coming anywhere close to what other companies offer."
good,"The biggest Investment Bank offers you a variety of jobs. If you happen to land up in Bank office of Middle office operations in Mumbai or Bangalore then be prepared for long working hours."
good,"Work demands vary widely depending on the team that you are on. Some are under high-pressure demands, others can coast. Coworkers can be assumed to be competent or better. Most are pleasant to work with."
good,I worked at JP Morgan Chase for over 10 years. The bank has better working culture and diversified. I left Chase was at the time that US banking were not doing well.
good,"answering inbound calls from chase credit card holders. I loved the environment and the co-workers were amazing. no drama at all. management doesn't really care for you, think they know everything, but they don't, got more help from co-workers then my own team manager. the pay was amazing and the benefits, are more then great, I wish more companies could provide you the same benefits like chase."
good,I was at Chase for 9 years. I met some great people and learned a lot. I worked a lot of hours and made a lot of money. They went through a lot changes and eventually closed their Houston office. I was sad to hear a lot of my colleagues lost their jobs. It was a great opportunity for me and I had a great time while I was there.
good,I was working in a newly set up branch only for one year. It has great working environment. The merge with JPMorgan brought the bank to the next level.
good,Great Place to work. Not alot of room for advancement in the tech side of things. The managers were very understanding and friendly. Great Work Enviroment
good,"Working at Chase can be a roller coaster. One minute you are top of the world, and the next you are being tapped on the shoulder.  I would never trade my experience for anything, but your experience here will depend on your attitude and the relationships you build. Be prepared for anything to happen.  The company is so large that they can't cater to every person, so you have to be self-sufficient."
good,The company creates a great experience for professionals who are looking to advance. If you stay consistent there will be opportunities for you to grow.
good,"Smart, efficient company filled with extremely capable, highly educated staff.  Company sets very high standards for all staff from entry level to senior management.  High stress with very high compensation and excellent benefits."
good,Hard working people dedicated to clients needs.  Downsides being management decision to 'contract' out employees to defer benefits. While this did make 'business sense' it felt very disloyal to employees.  Overall a great company that moves in the right direction.
good,"Great company , vey hard to move to different positions. Overall great company, great pay, the only thing I wish the opportunity to get a promotion would be better especially when you are laid off from the company."
good,Had a great management team that really showcased the true definition of a leader. Cherished my opportunities to work under both my assistant manager and branch manager.
good,Very fast paced environment with not much time to sit back and breathe. Day goes by very quickly but you'll often find yourself in the office until 630-800 PM. Management can make or break your internship experience.
good,"Pretty decent company good benefits, multiple cultures.  My enjoyable experience is the team interactions tied to management exposure on high senior levels."
good,"I am not really able to comment on the company. Due to my respect for confidentiality and privacy regulations, a review would not be possible. You have my sincere apologies but I am not at liberty to discuss the activities at JPM."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a challenging environment with many thousands of intelligent and ambitious employees.  Spanning the globe and involved in almost any type of financial activity, the regulatory and analytical complexity of this institution is stimulating but also very taxing.  An employee must also be prepared for consistent change since JPMC is not content to rest on what it has accomplished and will respond to investors who want even larger returns on equity.  A great place to learn and build a network, but a company that presents workers with many challenges that require a significant commitment."
good,"i worked with citi financials groups, and citi has sold their business hfs to globeop, due to i have moved to globeop. So i am not sure on what,how the globeop is going to work."
good,"The development  team was aggressive but the supporting was harsh and boring.  I have to support the Pacific Region including Japan, Taiwan and India. Overnight calls would arrive as the day end system ran overnight. I was under the Oracle team and did the interface with the database of Ingres using C. It's quite challenging."
good,"The company benefits of paid time off where really competitive, most I've seen getting in a job. The bank is fast paced and the training is very helpful. Over all good place to work, compensation is ok not great. You can grow under the appropriate management, note that as most industries this is becoming highly computerized so much more of machine management than actual people management, the reason why I left as I was looking to grow to a supervisor position."
good,"Culture varies across LOBs, departments and locations. Can be difficult to move around to different areas of the bank given specific backgrounds and work history"
good,There was a lot of support to transfer/advance to different departments. Offered a lot of leadership and cross training within the company. I loved the job but highest position in the call center I could move up to was management. Flexible schedules were great many options.
good,"People working here should be technically strong and able to manage the projects on own with minimum help."
good,"Self starter, there is no micro management."
good,"Typical day - very busy"
good,"While working at JPMorgan Chase Bank, I was going to school 3 days a week. My supervisor helped me with having a work schedule that was suitable while I was going to school. I went to work for 3 days part time working as a teller, and then went to school full time."
good,"very collaborative culture, many resources to help you succeed.  robust program of manager training and development.  you have the freedom to express your thoughts and ideas and suggestions and can volunteer to lead very diverse initiatives"
good,"JMPChase est une énorme entreprise avec des services très différents (technologie, back-office, front office etc..)."
good,"Your day is a fine mix of assisting customer in the branch while actively trying to discover new opportunities, making sales and follow up calls while adhering to a strict banking culture."
good,I love working at chase but sometimes juggling work and school can be more difficult because of their hours and scheduling. But overall I love the environment this job place provides. But I can only speak for my branch.
good,JPMC cares about their employees but they have done a poor job of anticipating future needs and teams are frequently understaffed.  The firm provides very good benefits but sometimes asks too much of their employees.
good,"Stressful, productive, good learning experience. Annoying workflow process. Line management has no real power. Upper management far removed from workers and only cares about positive reporting."
good,"My position of ""Customer Support Specialist"" at Chase was a very good paying position with good opportunity to receive extra monthly bonus pay as well. Was named, ""Top Customer Support Specialist Of The Year"" while only being employed there for just under 2 years."
good,"This was a great opportunity that provided sound fundamental training, directives and culture for a green worker in the finance industry. The daily work is challenging, but often rewarding. Sometimes the goals for retail production may seem to go beyond the best interests of the consumer."
good,"Great place to work with great salary, however working weekend almost is on a regular bases due to shortage of staff.  Great place to learn new technology"
good,"A great place to work, management is pretty hands on, communication is clear, investing heavily on the campus, Starbucks on site, great benefits, busy environment"
good,I loved my job with Chase and hoped to continue for many more years.  Sad to say that after 16 years they eliminated our department and relocated to the NE from TX.
good,A typical day at work would be a very busy day. I've learned to be very flexible. the hardest part of my job would be the stresses of dealing with different types of modification and requirements but it is also an enjoyable part of the job because it keeps you busy and on your toes.
good,Private Wealth Management technology internship. Gathered business requirement documents. Built business cases. Followed the SDLC lifecycle. Project management.
good,"was a very good experience working with the everyday person. handling transactions, and providing a great customer experience for each person. Customer care was the number one priority to the tellers."
good,"If you can handle the work load and the expectations this is an excellent place to work. Much is expected, but for those who can meet the challenge, the return is worth it."
good,Its a great place to get started and build your career in banking if that is your goal. They offer pretty decent benefits for full and part time employees.
good,"Very Good Place to Work.  Nothing is perfect, however, the CEO has set a good example of how to run a company."
good,"Overall, if you don't agree with the way upper management is handling day to day functions and you bring efficient and cost saving ideas up to management, they will not take them into account nor do they offer a reason why our idea/opinions are not acceptable nor will they be implemented."
good,Big company with well run management team. Culture is a bit all over the place. Growth opportunity is somewhat limited depending on field. Great place to learn and grow your career overall.
good,"Chase really us a great place to work, but with the set schedule I was given and not the option to change it makes life outside of work difficult. Would like at least he days off in a row."
good,As with any other banking job you have to look for a new job every 2 to 3 years.  It's great if you can find one.  There are people who have managed to make it twenty years.  This company has great retirement.
good,Management is what  make the job.  Without strong management it will make it impossible to have a strong team. I am a firm believer that your team is a strong as its manager.
good,Overall  JPMorgan Chase Bank is a good place to work with diverse BRGs and cultures.  The new Cafe is alot better since new management has taken over. The people are friendly  and in most departments  they are like family. I really love all of tje Community projects and volunteer events they have.
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with JPMorgan Chase.  It was an excellent place for advancement and the pay was great too.  The culture changes depending on the senior leaders in charge.  Towards the end the culture was not good, but those senior leaders have been since replaced to my knowledge."
good,"If you don't mind being one of 200,000+ employees, JPMC is a decent place to work. At least the Data Management area was. Job security in certain customer-facing areas is iffy."
good,"JPMorgan has been a terrific career starter, offers career development, training, visibility to upper level management, mobility opportunities, a wide variety of challenges"
good,"Good Job security, Excellent working culture, Good bonus, Salary minimal, Onshore opportunity are good. Career oriented company, work pressure, extended working hours."
good,"Good company to work"
good,"Good workplace and supportive "
good,"Work times are flexible (morning,night and midnight). "
good,"Different teams operate in a silos"
good,I am a member of an awesome team and we always assist one another with any situations that arise. I have learned a lot from my peers and management alike.
good,"=See Resume="
good,"I have had three jobs at JP Morgan Chase. Some have been great, some not so great. As with any big company everything depends on what group you are in and who your manager is."
good,There are no opportunities to build a career at least you get to know people... but  .... there is not time for networking. discrimination for being overqualified.
good,JP Morgan Chase was cool company to work and bank with. I enjoyed working here! The workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with customers who were affected by the recession who fell behind and was unable to maintain their accounts. I wanted to bail them out. My job was to prevent accounts from becoming delinquent and some customers just did not have it.
good,"Its employee friendly firm."
good,"Great Benefits, but mediocre pay. The hours are not conducive to having a family because you are always scheduled irregularly and there later. I would only consider working there as a last resort unless you are a banker."
good,"A typical day at JP Morgan involves the following:"
good,Great place to work for with good benefits packages with many options for internal mobility. Salaries are lower compared to market  rates for non front office positions.
good,growth was not a big opportunity here and this company tends not to promote within bonus plans are good and the medical insurance was good ok place to work
good,Hierarchy is very difficult to navigate. VP and Director positions dependent on tenure. Culture is progressive and welcoming. Job loss a nonissue and large network for lateral movement.
good,"A typical day was very busy. Very good information learned that is transferrable. Management was ok & the hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the work due to heavy volumes, other people out on vacation or out of the office. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a customer was approved being able to deliver the good news. My work family was the best and we ha great food days!"
good,"Generally, there are plenty of talented people to work with."
good,Great place to learn about financial instruments and the inner workings of a big bank. The staff and management are helpful and willing to teach young employees.
good,JP Morgan is a challenging and fun workplace. the shifts could be long at times and overtime is pretty common. the company has a relaxed yet professional culture.
good,"Over all good organization to work. However a lot of red-tape, which is understandable given the importance of systems up and running 24X7."
good,A typical day at work can be 8 to 12-hour shifts. You learn how to service customer credit card accounts and trouble shooting their accounts. You learn how to build a rapport with a customer within a matter of minutes. The work culture is fast paced and hard working. Management is overall great. The hardest part of the job is the potential to get the escalated call that sets you back and the demanding call volumes. The most enjoyable aspect is the great customer interactions that you get on a day-to-day basis.
good,"Love working with a team to reach sales goals and solve customer needs. Pay and benefits are good, they offer benefits to part time. Management is supportive and there is room to grow in the company."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is really good company to work from employee friendly and work culture prospective, That the reason I am with this firm for more than 12 years now."
good,Good place to work for and you can get your work Life balance. Good annual bonus and WiFi network at office. Few of the managers are not professional enough which is bit tough.
good,"	Clearance & Trade analysis is the primary responsibility for timely processing of all incoming instructions from Globe clear and Trust Clients which have failed Straight through Processing. "
good,"Management more so looks out for themselves first, so advancement is contingent on a constant push on your end. In some cases you may have to circumvent your manager for them to realize your worth."
good,It is good company to work. Only work timing are odd as it has night shifts due to it provide services to US clients. It is great place to learn many things.
good,I had never done Business Analyst work before but learned very quickly.  I worked with an excellent project manager and a VP at the bank.  I learned Excel inside and out and had to run weekly meetings with allot of people on the call going over all new servers that just came into the environment that week and all old servers that were slated for decommission. The job pushed me to do new things that I hadn't done before which intern gave me allot of confidence. In the end my job was off shored to India.
good,"Great opportunity, can be very stressful at times. Going through lots of  changes and can be chaotic at times. Management is great and supportive, not many instances to move up"
good,"A great company to build a career that offers opportunities to people that are ambitious and are prepared to work hard"
good,"Come in to work half an hour before shift. "
good,JP Morgan has many career options and campus locations. The locations are being updated to provide a better work environment.

good,"Gathering and analyzing data received from all CIB LOBs "
good,"The work culture is very good at Mphasis"
good,"It is a stable place to work if you are a hard working, intelligent and flexible individual.  If you are a slacker or are hard to work with you will get managed out.  They have a great benefits package with ample time off. Upper management seems to ""get it"" but the majority of lower management is clueless and can't see the bigger picture."
good,"Learned and grown in Project/Program sense, developed additional presentation skills to executives, had access to senior management and encouraged to try new positions every few years to learn about the firm.

My day begins at 6:30 as I work on flex time.  My manager gives me projects and lets me take care of it.  My co-workers are so much fun to share my work day with."
good,"JP Morgan has everything.  Great opportunities for all employees, wonderful market exposure the works. Could do with a better canteen I think."
good,While working here a number of years I've met a lot of great people.  The work as with any place has it's ups and downs.  Overall it's been a positive experience for me and I think it's a good place to work.
good,"Only facilities are not enough, financial growth also matters. Company is very good. But hike given is not upto the mark. If you are hired on higher position then is a good place but for basic level its not that good."
good,"JP Morgan Chase is a great place to work for. The atmosphere is friendly and warming to walk into. There are so many opportunities to take advantage of and good quality benefits. As a hire there, it was a great way to see how money really worked as well as how the world of banking worked. The hardest part of my job isn't any specific function at all, it's more due to poor staffing and scheduling."
good,"My job is a great, I get to work at 7:45am everyday and leave at 3pm-6pm some days. It is a convenient location, and is a helpful job to have. However, moving up in the company is a lot more difficult than it should be. I am also a over qualified part time worker."
good,"Great Company. Been a teller for 5yrs just looking for a change & a better future. Willing to make more money & aim higher than ever."

good,Typical day at work used to be very structured with employee centricity as the main approach towards driving performance and achieving goals. learn a lot of new things and evolved as a better professional.
good,Worked at a remote location.  Typical week was about 45 hrs.  Compensation was okay.  Difficult to receive market value as you move up if you entered the bank in a lower paying position.  Sr. mgmt opportunities non-existent if you are not located at one of the banks core hubs.
good,You learn a lot from management and coworkers if you try and give questions. Self-motivation is a must. work 8-5 or later. Always a lot of work to be done.
good,"In this job I learned a variety of function.  We processed car titles, the enjoyment was to research the payouts and release titles.  The hardest was when people didn't show up."
good,"Worked here for 8 years, good benefits, great job culture but layoffs happen pretty frequently. I've meet plenty of great people working at Chase and I'm sad to be leaving. The management need better training but they do the best they can with what they know"
good,"You make the best or the worst out of your employer. If you like it, give it your best. If you don't, leave. You are doing your manager, co-workers, the company and ultimately yourself a service."
good,Working in marketing was amazing and I enjoyed most of it.  My position was stressful because I was trained for 2 weeks and then my support went out on maternity leave.  In her absence I was doing the job of 4 people and doing it really well.  I had great support from the other departments.  There was one hiccup that the copy editor was not good and only got worse after being promoted.  Ultimately she went on a power trip and Chase merged with Bank One.  Right after that our department was downsized and she was laid off.  Eventually we were all let go.
good,"J.P. Morgan used to be a terrific place to build a career, with a respectful, smart and results-oriented culture. In my experience, that has become less true in the past few years."
good,"It is a good company to start with- learned a lot of financial knowledge here and enjoyed the people who I work with. If looking for a broader view, no recommend. Because the firm is huge, you always focus yourself on one particular small piece of the whole thing. however, since it is big enough, there is career mobility internal."
good,"Company deserves a good reviews. It has to be noted it is not the one chasing trends aggressively. Culture is more classic, old school but still friendly and enjoyable."

good,"I enjoyed working with the staff, kept a great,lively work environment. Management was very diligent in helping improve work ethic and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Flexible"
good,"Productive workplace."
good,"It was very intensive the first half of the year. If I did not need to move back to California, I would probably not have left my job back in Boston. The team was young and my supervisors were very pleasant to work with."
good,"A great company to work for, just no room for advancement Management stays in positions. Co-workers are good and day to day tasks are simple."
good,"I worked for Chase 10 years to me great benefit for part time and full times, not a stressful place, management depends on the person who's the manager of each branch could do a great job or some thinks they own chase don't go by the polices and procedure. Employees learn to get alone with each other like family and guild them to advancement in company."
good,Not much of advancement in the Human Resources division.  Some departments have the option to work from home for a limited amount of days
good,"Account reviews of various clients accounts to determine any risk"

good,"Chase is a great place to apply your skills and to move up within the company. If one is looking for a company that constantly changes to meet the market/new trends, then Chase is the place! :)"
good,Great family owned company. Not much room for advancement. Great culture and people to work with. Had a fun time with this company. I would recommend for people going through school as a part time or full time job.
good,Chase offers a wide range of position that will surely meet any persons career path. With locations all over the world I'm sure it would be easy to find the career you're searching for.
good,Strong and stable company with good overall culture and employees. Benefits have been deteriorating but mostly consistent with industry. Real strength of company lies in middle management - much to be learned from these experienced leaders. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,"J P Morgan Chase is a good to work with. Good Job culture, great things to learn. Employee management team takes good care of the employees."

good,The feeling of knowing my job helps save homes is gratifying. My quality of work has a direct impact on the economy. Management within my department are knowledgeable and very helpful. The hardest part of my job is reaching the conclusion of not being able to help certain customers retain there home.
good,Overall 4 stars. Great culture to work in and excellent GREEN facilities. Friendly environment and excellent opportunities within the firm.
good,team work is a great aspect of the company and most employees are approachable and great with working with one another. A day at work is consistant. There is always an opportunity to learn something new at the field. Hardest part of the job would be having to sometimes deliver unpleasant news to a client in certain situations. The most enjoyable can be the opportunity of meeting new people each day
good,Highest paying bank around. Excellent vacation and 401k package.  They don't have a good work life balance there are not any exceptions if you need time off and its already used up by other employees you will not be approved for the day off.
good,JP is a great company to work with. gives you a good understanding of matrix organization. Benefits like medical and leave are good. Growth is limited. Good for people who want it as a launch pad or want to retire.

good,"Pros- Benefits, mobility, co-workers, technology"
good,Like how they tell you what your job is and don't micromanage you to do your job. Makes is less stressful then previous jobs in the past.
good,"Fun, loving and talented people that are here to help advance your career. JPMorgan is definitely one of the top bank in the world and working here is a joy"
good,"JPMorgan provided solid knowledge with experts and good managers to support my career. I worked at JPMorgan for 8 years and that's where I gained most of the professional knowledge.   "
good,Great company to work for and love the CEO's philosophy for the company. Large company that some times operates as a lot of small companies without great consistencies in policies and procedures. Work and life balance is a priority for the company but hard to gain sometimes due to critical deadlines.  The company has taken an effort to employ more women into the company and into more leadership roles and plans to do the same for African Americans and I believe that is definitely the right approach going forward.
good,The employee experience is average. There are great benefits. The workplace is typically friendly. The work life balance is a struggle.
good,Nice Place to work. Good people that would like you to succeed. There are good benefits for new employees and have met life long friends while there
good,"It was a wonderful experience working with JPMorgan Chase & Co, I had a great time with the people I've worked with, friendly environment and encourages and help you achieve your goals."
good,"It was a nice place to work"

good,"Good place to work, great benefits, and excellent training."
good,"want you to do it all, but only about making numbers. Lot of people are not very educated and may not have college degree. Fair amount of employee and manager turnover."
good,"I was hired, attended training and was told I would be in a particular location when my training was done.  I was then told that I would be placed in a location that had be without a manager for almost a year. The ABM was so stressed he had stopped performing many of the security checks and often was unable to help clients because he simply did not know his job. This was a period when JP Morgan Chase took over Bank of NY. The two cultures couldn't be further apart. This branch was a Bank of NY with disgruntled staff that felt like they were not being treated fairly. The building had a terrible mold problem in the basement where the lunch room and bathrooms were located. No matter how often I requested someone come to see if it was even safe for us to use this space, I was told it was just going to have to be tolerated.  In order to pass the annual review of our records, I needed the ABM to perform his job and make sure all of our recording keeping was up to date. He was unable to do this. After writing him up, I presented this report to my superior. I was told don't worry about it. I said my bonus could be at stake here, as well as liability for the bank. My boss felt that I was out of line for speaking up so that created a riff between us. He eventually found an opportunity to take me out. I had placed 25 cents into an account for a client who was unable to get into the bank to bring his balance into a positive position. This was against the rules and so I was told that I was being let go because of this breach of the rules. This was common with the Bank of NY Management. They"
good,"Great company to work for that offers top of line benefits,but when it comes to advancing your career it is very difficult to get out from where you were originally employed to do. Stressful environment due to very strict guidelines and procedures, so make sure you don't mess up."
good,"Opening the branch, setting up for opening for business, have morning huddle with staff to go over the plan for day. Performing customer transactions, and other duties as required. Set lunch schedule and relieve employees for lunch. During any down time work on employee schedules,audits,  Check month to date results."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a good company to work for. A lot will be expected of you to provide excellent customer service. The training provided along with the coaching assistance from management will make it easier.
good,"TYPICAL DAY AT WORK has me checking on my mails and responding to them promptly, underwriting the loans from the processor, approve loans, decline some and put conditions on as per standard procedure."
good,"Fun workplace, but the job culture does not necessarily provide for a place that gives maximum productivity... There is a lot of dead weight within the company"
good,"Comparable benefits and work life balance."
good,"I am working as Disputes by Phone Specialist assisting customers with disputes issues when it comes to items/ products they have bought with vendors/ merchants. I have learned a lot about American Culture when it comes to money management and how important it is for Americans the equality of treatment from business to regular consumers. The surrounding is very and accomodating to everyone as well as the people within the company. Hardest part of being a disputes specialist if explaining the whole long, and tidious process of disputes but I do enjoy satisfying customers by resolving their disputes concerns."
good,"only problem is its hard to get your ideas heard. If you have ideas for improvement, they are rarely taken seriously. Overall though, good company, fair compensation, and chances for movement within company."
good,"Worked in a group that was kept engaged in plenty of work, lots of opportunities to learn new technologies and other skills"
good,"An ever changing workplace that requires attention to detail and the ability to multi-task.  Management is approachable and open to suggestion.   Great benefits, 401k, pension."
good,"Smart people, top notch upper management. Complex issues to work on, problem solving is a daily task. Tough regulatory environment creates a lot of non-value add work/"
good,"Great people to work when starting career. Open and transparent working culture, but still a corporation. Overall age of firm was early to late 40s with families, and cubicle nature created a ""corporate"" feel. Respected at all levels with emphasis on ability to speak up and work together. However, visibility opportunities and vertical growth was difficult due to lack of opportunities. Overall good starting point to get a solid corporate experience from a world renowned financial firm."
good,"JPM Chase is a great overall Company to work for. They are very numbers driven and budget conscious. To Management all employees are hot swappable. The best thing you can do is not have any personal issues or have to take any leaves of absences or they will look to replace you. At least this is from my experience. The Pay is good, and the employees are very friendly."
good,"Chase is not the greatest company to work for. They do not care about the employees as much as other companies I've worked for. Compensation is on the low side for the industry, and it is hard to get ahead."
good,Average work day. Great Management. Co-workers are average. Benefits are excellent. Pay is so-so in  comparison to other companies
good,"My job was all about reviewing the checks of the chase customers in US, we used to identify the frauds and sort out the issue. It was really fun working with such kind of a company, the management was so very friendly . Challenging part was the SLA given to identify the fraud."
good,"With few exceptions, the folks that I worked with/for were amazing.  Very diverse cultures.  I learned a lot from them and hopefully they learned something from me."
good,"Great work environment "
good,company is great to work for . and everyone to deal with is awesome.  supportive management. on occasions you would have to deal with some disruptive people.
good,"fun place to work, easy job, incompetent upper management, great pay, good hours, home equity sales manager is not a great leader but team managers are good for the most part"
good,Was at JPMC for 10 years. Enjoyed alot of mobility across the company areas. Innovative ideas and solutions. Had great managers
good,This company is a very professional environment to work at.  Compensation is determine by how hard you work.  Management is unprofessional and does not know how to talk to people professionally.
good,"Worked on both development and maintenance projects. "
good,Lots of internal and external communication; learned a bit about treasury services and how firms use them to protect their capital. Best part of the job is the autonomy.
good,Management and staff were on the same page as far as delivering projects.  As well the daily conferences in regard to work assigments was beneficial in achieving deliverables on time.
good,"If you like working for the public, then this is the place to begin.  Managers are fair, not only with scheduling but with opportunities for advancements."
good,I enjoy my job at Chase.  It has been the first job that I have worked with mortgages as well as the first bank I have worked for.  Currently I work in the loan modification department assisting customers with document collection and it is a Jr. Underwriting type position.  The department is shrinking and there are not many positions in the East Valley that I am interested in and this is why I am looking outside Chase.  If our Underwriters or Loan Officers were in the east Valley I would probably stay with Chase.  Barring a large pay increase of course.
good,Overall Chase is a wonderful place to work for with great benefits and great leadership. Great place to grow within the company and move forward in your career.
good,"Assist walk in customers with either account opening, service issues, or any maintenance on their accounts. During the afternoon I make my follow up calls as well as call my book of business. Management is a little unorganized and our branch is usually short-staffed. My co-workers are amazing people and make work a better environment for me. The hardest part of my job would be multitasking and the most enjoyable would be meeting new customers everyday."
good,"Work was a pleasant place to be , so many friendly faces  and the job is always celebrating something, I  Have learned we are all differently, but the job can get done"
good,Wonderful team environment. Focus on improvement and growth. Understanding leaders. Diverse Culture and environment. Strong Community involvement
good,"Thorough training, great feedback. Working in a branch is a fantastic learning experience. Great benefits including insurance, retirement plans and banking options. Loved working there."
good,It is a good work environment where there are a lot of good people you work with. Training could be better. Job security isn't the best because they move departments to other locations or offshore on a regular basis. They do try to relocate you to another job within JPMorgan.
good,when florence sc lost this location it affected the ecomony. pay was way above average for the location and no company can match our pay.i am will looking to relocate for this position.
good,Great place to learn and grown. This company has gone thru many changes over the years and is now in a new stage of change.the best part of this company was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The benefits was good as well.
good,overall great company. Like many other companies has pros and cons. Many people could and will stay for long term based on their personal needs.
good,Was a great company to work for. Really enjoyed management and my time at Morgan. I learned and matured a lot while I was there.
good,"Reviewed a random sample of loans for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Weekly team meetings were held. Included in each meeting was status, updates and feedback."
good,"Took inbound calls from customers of credit cards. Fixed problems, gave financial advice, sold relevant products. Culture was ok."
good,I worked here for eight and a half years as a Senior Executive Assistant. The work was challenging but very rewarding. Compensation and benefits were very competitive.
good,Positive atmosphere and work culture that was very supportive of community and business development. Enjoyed working on various business and community related projects that enhanced my professional development.
good,The management team is very knowledgeable and professional.  Diversity is celebrated and encouraged.  This a financially secured company. Job security is questionable.
good,"worked a daily que of past due accounts that were 90 days and near charge off. Had great flexibility with days off, very hard to get advancement."
good,A Fantastic place to work and gain experience right out of college. Company tend to be very budget conscious which can sometimes hinder movement within the company.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is when the work is delivered as specified and is successful in that is it usable, intuitive, extensible, and the client and users are happy. This is when I feel I have really done my part of the overall effort of the team to the best of my ability."
good,Productive workplace with supportive management who are willing to go above and beyond to help you grow not only with the company but as a person as well.
good,I liked working at the bank.  The only issue is everything is about the bottom line so staff at the top simply look at how your division is doing and if they don't like it they'll chop you and your colleagues in a heartbeat.
good,"productive fast pace environment, needs more career advancement,"
good,"Decent place to work, obtained many skills in default mortgage servicing, income is good, I have to commute, the work that I have done, has not been challenging."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a decent company to work for."
good,"High charged work environment and can be very stressful.  However, it will test you and force you to learn and improve over time. It was a great environment until cutbacks forced duties to be combined without much reward."
good,"I would dispute charges but the day would become stressful when my manager told me numerous times to ""wrap up the calls"" due to service levels. She would have meeting informing me i was not meeting requirements and metrics in a timely manner."
good,The thing I have learned about Chase is that if you are an internal hire you lose all opportunity to negotiate any salary increase when taking on more responsibilities or advancing your career. I have been told by numerous senior managers and an HR person that if you want to be paid for your experience you are better off leaving the firm for a year or two and then reapplying as an outside candidate.
good,Chase is where my banking career commenced and I learned a massive amount of pertinent information that lead my banking career. I enjoyed he relationships that were build and the recognition the company provided. During my time the management team was phenomenal.
good,My time with JP Morgan Chase has been exciting and a constant learning environment. Would recommend the company to any new student or professional.
good,"Although they're cutting down on hiring people, it is a suitable company to work for. Usually flexible and great benefits and bonuses for part times and full time employees. Very heavy concentration on customer service. Also, many policy and government implemented laws that need to be remembered all the time. Otherwise not too difficult to deal with since there are a lot of resources available to employees."
good,"Day to day is fast paced - people are nice - more opportunities in NYC - different areas and departments in Columbus, Ohio"
good,"good  environment "
good,This is a well known financial institution which offered job security but unfortunately in the region I was in not much room for advancement.
good,the company has great benefits. could improve on management and the opportunity of advancement could increase. I enjoyed the last position I was in before it was outsourced to manila. don't have very much to say about the company. there's for cons then pros
good,Co-workers we all great and like a family. There was no room for advancement in our site but the money was very good for the market here in Rochester.
good,"I enjoy dealing with customer, my manager, coworkers and I, we make an excellent. but I'll like to keep growing with my career."
good,"On a day to day basis, I maintain work queues and assign work as needed. Also handle escalated calls within the call center when a supervisor is requested.

good,Amazing peers and management facilities for all employees. Great flexibility regarding leaves for employees. Continuous trainings provided for self development and IJP opportunities.
good,A good feeling to be a part of a leading bank with financially sound objective.The hardest part of the job was to be the backbone of an organisation with presence over the world

Involved mainly in software analysis, design, implementation and development of Oracle."
good,"Highly qualified supervisor, well paid employment, plenty of overtime but over kill on meetings/seminars/web training which took away from our productivity and majority wasn't even a requirement/or applied to our duties."
good,"My days were spent monitoring operating programs for completion and compliance.  I also performed audit tasks and testing tasks as assigned by management."
good,"Excellent work environment"
good,"At JP Morgan I accurately entered large amounts of financial data into a computer data base at 60 WPM as well as 10-key. Not much interaction with neighboring data specialist occurs and so many hours staring at a computer forced my eyes shut plenty of times. The hardest part is obviously staying awake. However, I enjoyed practicing my typing speed and tracking my productivity."
good,"Responsibilities/Duties:"
good,"As a RM3, I am primarily responsible for managing a portfolio of higher end commercial clients. Responsibilities include commercial loan management, credit risk review, credit application, prospecting and client calls."
good,JP Morgan is a great company to  work for.  It is a very large company and so it has a corporate environment.  I was ranked number one in Idaho for 2014 and did not receive  pay increase that was frustrating.
good,"JPMorgan is a great company to work for if you are starting in the financial industry or need to change from a commission heavy financial job to a job more secure that will allow you room to learn and grow."

good,"Chase is a great place for Job Growth with it's internal opportunites and levels of courses to build career growth."
good,"hard work, long hours. this is a good company to work for with great benefits.  The company is very demanding and can be difficult managing a work/life balance"
good,A typical day at work revolved around taking care of the customer. We had fun when the time called for it like when we celebrated associate birthdays. Co-workers were always fun to be around. Management was okay.
good,"Working for Chase bank is a great opportunity for anyone looking to gain experience in the finance market. The companies solid corporate structure provides a steady path for career advancement. In addition to career growth, JPMC provides accomidating medical and dental benefits for its employess and their families. While working for Chase, I gained priceless knowledge and hands-on experience in various aspects of day-to-day banking business. More specifically, I learned how to assist customers with financial planning, debt consolidation, as well as, retirement & investment assessments. The hardest part of working for Chase, for myself personally, was the fluxuation in bonus payout. The most enjoyable part of working for Chase, for myself personally, was the constant and valuable knowledge gained and the challenging fast-paced work environment."
good,"I really enjoyed working with my co-workers.  We all got along and tried to help each other when possible.  I miss working with them."
good,Good salary but not the best for work/life balance.  Management can be very inflexible and sterile at times.  Overall it is a god place to work.
good,"A typical day at work is meeting deadlines throughout the shift. Over the years I've learned to have patience with people. I have the ultimate respect for management. My co-workers was great, some days not so great depends on what has occurred before coming to work. The hardest part of the job is when the machines broke down or the courier was late delivering the checks to the department to process. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others and the challenge of making the required duties of the shirt and the require quota of each month."
good,Began working at JPM from university. Learned a ton and was a great place to start a professional career. Gave as many opportunities as a massive 250k person organization can.
good,I enjoy the ability travel and learning different aspects of the bank.  I have a great group of coworkers who are willing to share information.
good,"It is a fast paced environment, high pressure, great experience for learning to meet deadlines and working as a unit. Each day I process insurance payments to doctors and hospitals made by insurance companies and patients."
good,"There have been through multiple changes since working for Chase. The pay, people and info-structure are there but depending on the management team supporting you, you  will learn to embrace the changes or jump ship due to some stressful situations. Be sure you are ready change roles, responsibilities and titles."

good,"I could have enjoyed more by learning more, and dealing less with the politics.  But seems like there can not be any place without politics.  Some with more, others with less.  Those who prefer the total prosperity of the company would do good overall, and would have a brighter future."

There are a handful of professional managers out of the 20 on the floor. Co-workers are rather nice on most days, very easy to talk to and laid back.

It appears as though very few managers from the assistant manager position up through the district manager position have a solid understanding of how the business operates outside of the factors that contribute to their bonuses and even then some of them appear to be clueless. Working there for an extended period of time begins to wear on you heavily as the majority of bank policies are designed to prey on the ignorance of the customers who can least afford to be taken advantage of.

good,This was the last position held and it was for 6 months. It was always a busy schedule. I learned about how customer accounts were transferred from one financial institution to another.

My co-workers were all young and dedicated to producing efficient work.

good,Opportunities to learn new banking information was a daily event.
good,"My job would start when I would walk from the parking lot to the bank. I would start helping customers with whatever their needs may be. With the numerous (100's) customers I met daily, I acquired, retained and deepened customer relationships, by creating an outstanding customer experience. I partnered with our loan officers, business bankers, and financial advisors, ensuring our customers received proper access to experts who could satisfy all their specialized financial needs.

good,"Muy buen ambiente, solo mejoraria el trabajo en equipo y los horarios extensos"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of processing personal and business transaction. I learn more about customer experience and banking in general. Management was not good at all to much preferences in my branch personally too many employee's felt they had authority over same ranking such as in teller to teller. As a branch we lacked team work and confidence to speak to a manger about how we felt. I would say there really wasn't anything ""hard"" about my job as a teller. The most enjoyable part was having your customer satisfy at the end of the day and every transaction."
good,"Operations work is not particularly difficult, but multi-tasking is a huge requirement. Expectations of not only managers, but also Front Office teams which have stakes in our trade processing."
good,Assisted customers in finding resolution to stay in their homes.
good,Fast paced environment. Loved the challenge. Worked on multiple projects on a daily basis. NO two days were ever the same.
good,I feel that if you are looking for job with great benefits/ this is the place to be.. But you would definitely have to have patience with the culture/Management of the Bank.
good,Networking throughout the firm is fairly easy and people are willing to mentor. Work life balance is nearly nonexistent but varies within LOB's.
good,"I like working at Chase, but there are a few things that could be better as with any workplace."

good,Data entry at this company was very fast paced but the work pretty straight forward and goal had to be met.

good,J.P.

There are many opportunities to expand ones knowledge. The atmosphere is typically friendly and inviting of all cultural aspects.
good,The organization structure is pretty simple with regards to working. The micromanagement is minimal and the pay is on par with the work you are doing. In order to move up in the organization there is a career path you must follow.

good,Worked 9 to 6 and sometimes on saturdays . Always a flow of guests and multitasking with cash accounts and questions. Balance atm's through the mid day of work. Count many deposits from other companies that deposited and etc.
good,I was responsible for the upper level calls as well as in bound calls to retain the customers. I had decent pay and the management was great. I did find the change of advancement small as well as the fact that there was so many scares that the job never felt secure.

good,Make calls to customers with delinquent Required to meet a specific number calls a shift with agreement to make payments set forth by customers.
good,"Constantly force you to solicit people's money. All you do is pretend to care about people's life, what their doing today, etc. Ultimately, the bank just wants you to put all of their money in the bank."

good,A typical day at work consists of helping clients with standard or irregular banking questions. I learned that profiling the customer is something that takes sales and personality skills. My coworkers are sometimes dedicated but not always gears to making money. The hardest part of my job is earning commission as a new banker and living on the salary alone.
good,Great customer base. Cross-selling with private bankers and financial planners. Talented team members
good,"•Funded loans while working simultaneously with Loan Officers, Underwriters, and Customers"
good,This company tries to maintain excellent customer service and experience for our clients. Job advancements are possible but can be strict and limited depending on your title and location.
good,My typical day at JP Morgan was to research and resolve complaint borrowers had on their foreclosure process. Working their I learned how to complete multiple project and get it done on the same day. My co-worker was are like family to me.

good,My typical day starts with a good strong cup of coffee and reviewing leads that I have with my personal bankers. I then will address any client issues that may be out standing. At around 9am I will start to call clients and potential clients to try to schedule appointment for account reviews. Through out the day I may have several appointments with potential clients where the Financial Advisor and my self will talk with the customer and go over the benifits of our progam. I really enjoy problem solving clients problems and providing a solution. The harder and more complex the issue the better. A situation like that motivates me more to find a solution for the client.
good,I am grateful to have had this position for close to four years. I think it was a opportunity but I was working as a contractor and in the end I was never given a fair opportunity to succeed. Most of my coworkers was rude and hard to get along and the environment was highly nepotistic.
good,Chase is a pretty good place to work. I have learned a lot about the mortgage industry. I feel comfortable in my position and have been satisfied with the compensation and daily work experience.
good,"On a typical day at work, I would talk to Chase customers and counsel them on our equity loan products. The hardest part of the job is turning down a customer for a loan. The most enjoyable part of the job is approving a customer and helping them achieve their goals."
good,"I worked for the J.P. Morgan Chase Building at 277 Park Avenue, New York, NY on two separate occasions during breaks from my college semesters. It was an amazing experience, being able to take the subway to work every morning into Manhattan and feeling important at such a young age. I worked with great people, many of who I still keep in touch with. My duties included routine maintenance of the building, setting up rooms for board meetings, conferences and special events, and general inventory for the entire building. The job could be very demanding at times but when I was done working it felt like a complete day."
good,"With Chase bank a typical day revolved around coaching, coaching, coaching. My daily routine was to ensure that all sales and service behaviors were being properly executed. My time was spent developing quality professionals who could make the results happen."
good,"I was involved with a Chasework project of limited duration. I learned to apply my analysis skills on as an individual and in a group. It was not a competitive environment overall, just on a personal basis to achieve the highest level of accomplishment. My coworkers were the most amazing group of people I've ever had the privilege to work with. We were cooperative and supportive of one another and each was willing to help on another. In all of my years in the workplace, I have never encountered a cohesive group such as this. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the procedural changes and the easiest part was getting up every morning coming in to work."
good,The company is a good foot in the door for banking. Make sure to let your manager know every good thing you do if you want to advance.
good,"This job utilized alot of the skills in which i possess. However, the type of job advancement and pay raise i was seeking did not meet my desires. My co workers and i worked well together daily in order to make sure every customer was receiving the proper service. The hardest part of my job was dealing with elderly individuals who continually returned to ask the same questions. However, each and every time i treated them with respect and answered their questions accordingly. My favorite part of this job was meeting new people every day, and building a book of business of individuals who trusted, and valued my opinion."
good,You meet a wide range of individuals which is pretty amazing.
good,"Overall it's a great place to work, my current position helps me satisfy our customer. It's a lot of room for growth depending on what department your in. I don't agree with some of the quality changes."
good,"Acquire, retain and deepen customer relationships by discovering their financial needs and providing product and service recommendations."
good,Studies:
good,Handled the shipping and receiving of computer equipment for the midtown NY campus. Also cleared out several data centers slated for closure.
good,"JPMC does a lot of thing right. Their sheer sice allows them to be the best and most recognized in the market place. They are also a huge brand name. Unfortunately, their size also creates a 'left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing' kind of situation sometimes. everything depends on what line of business (LOB) you work for. The branches are an over-the-top sales culture. Corporate supprot functions out of Columbus, OH (for retail) are, for the most part, very midwestern-y with a heavy New York feel at the top (leadership). Asset Wealth Management and Treasury Security Services are better than RFS in my opinion. I dont know much about the Investment Bank or Card Services."
good,Excellent team of experienced sales professionals within the F&O Business as well as various other LOBs.
good,"It was great adventure to be part of the chase business family,I love every bit of my stay because the culture and value of the organisation"
good,Can't say that I had the best work environment. Unrealistic deadlines and micromanagement were big turn offs for me at this company.
good,Great Entry Level position. However the position i was enrolled in had long hours and mediocre mangement.
good,A well diversified firm. Limited mobility for advancement as they attract talent from top competitors.
good,I worked for this company for 8+ years and found it to be the most personally rewarding employer that I have ever experienced. I was so incredibly fortunate to work with an incredible group of diverse staff that we became so close that we became family like.
good,I worked for Bank One for 16 years and some employees are like family after that period of time.
good,IT was pleasure to work for the firm having great diverse culture with productive environment
good,"The help desk for Chase Paymentech is a fun, happy environment where you feel like you're making a difference, and advancement is common and encouraged."
good,Good company to work for. Like any other large company you have to  learn how to fit in. Overall I had a great time working at JPMC. You will learn a lot and do a lot at JPMC
good,"It was a good company between 2000 & 2010.  It allowed me to have great clients and good accounts until my job moved to Texas.  I took my work seriously, but when we had to train our replacements, they didn't seem to have our concern for time deadlines and procedures."
good,"The company provides very good benefits as far as Vacation/sick/personal time.  Managers are provide 4 weeks of vacation time, 6 sick days and 3 personal days.  Even if you are not a manager, you still start out at 3 weeks of Vacation time.  Medical/Dental/Vision benefits are very affordable, with Chase contributing towards each of these benefits to make it more affordable for employees."
good,It’s difficult and it’s not to advance at JP Morgan. It depends on the person. My overall experience was positive. If you get in the right line of business it will be a rewarding career.
good,Its a good culture to work in. There is a nice work like balance. They were very flexible with work schedule. There was a lot of room to grow. Only down fall is that it is a large company so a lot of red tape
good,"I absolutely love my job, unfortunately my job role is only full time. Therefore I find myself looking for something else or stepping down part time to spend more time with my family. If I was to go part time with chase I won't have a set schedule."
good,pay is not fair for most employees who are ED and below.  diversity and inclusion is great but sometimes feels like check the box.  C level employees are out of touch with reality.
good,No i dont want to add anything to this and you cant make me.  I answered the questions and you can get a rating from that.  So leave me alone and stop infringing on my civil liberties!
good,Good interview and good company. If you have a desire to do more than work in a branch you have to look at Columbus.  Market directors and above can be a bit of micro managers.
good,JPMorgan Chase is a good place for career driven individuals. The people make the experience worthwhile. Great managers that care about their people in the Tampa facilities
good,Its has good facilities like free food transportation shift allowance but ctc is less. Bounus is paid good here. Work culture is also fine in JPMC. Overall i had good experience there.
good,"With the right sponsorship, you can go far at JPMC. D&I is also very big here... overall good experience, and many opportunities for young employees..."
good,"Overall, JPMC is a reasonable company to work for. Usually you do get companies benefits including Vacations, Paternity/Maternity leave, Medical Plan and Good salary. The only thing I don't like about JPMC is it's working environment.. sometimes you do feel like that you are being micromanaged, and it's very difficult to climb up the ladder until and unless you have good relations with the leadership team."
good,"Pros: JPM had the best people of any company I ever worked for, and the best benefits. They have a 401K and a pension! Who even offers a pension anymore? People were good-hearted and nice. I am still friends with many of my former colleagues."
good,"Excellent for working with new technology, very nice and reputable company. Benefits are very good. You will get recognition if you work hard and nicely."
good,JPMorgan Chase is a solid bank and an overall good place to work. Work life balance is reasonable as is compensation. Culture encourages hard work with a focus on customers.
good,People were really great to work with.  The variety and challenge of the day-to-day work kept the job fresh and never dull.  Generous paid time off and holidays.
good,"Great place to work if you are only there to receive a check and not get too involved with the politics. They are open to new opinions, but there are so many things that the management system needs to include, ie. innovation."
good,"The company is embracing LMOS culture -  this can severely limit upward mobility (consider yourself warned). I will say that because lateral movement is encouraged, I learned skill sets that people would normally go to school for. Just don't expect to move up quickly, if at all. The company is also aggressively trying to bot as many processes as it can. Even if you do get hired, your position could be eliminated by a bot just as quickly."
good,"a bit more demanding and faced paced, get to learn lot of practices and technologies, chance to grow up in career since wide array of opportunities are available"
good,Customers can be very angry about there finances. Customer satisfaction is about 50/50 with knowlegedable CSRs. The job experience can be very stressful.
good,Good company and benefits.  Management was okay.  Pay was better than most competitors.  Opportunities to learn more if manager was supportive but not consistent supportive environment.
good,It is a very good company to work for. I've been here for almost 13 years. That speaks for itself. Benefits are great. Most of the people are awesome to work with. Managers on the other hand are not as friendly. I personally think they are very stressed.
good,"Very Professional"
good,"I was able to learn a great deal in my time at JPMorgan Chase, and took on many different skills. I certainly appreciate being able to learn so much."
good,"JPMorgan overall is a great company to work for. The hours can be taxing, most people work at least 50 hour weeks, or more depending on the line of business, department and time of year. There is definitely a clear path for career advancement, with promotions possible within your role. Your salary does tend to stagnate if you stay with the company for several years, which is a shame; you work harder and harder year over year but your salary barely moves beyond a cost of living increase, even when you do get promoted. The company culture is great - every year there is an entire week devoted to employee appreciation with giveaways, fun activities, free lunches, breakfast, etc. If you have the right skill set they are a very stable employer - certain manual jobs in operational jobs like processing focused roles are being automated away, but high skill knowledge workers (data analysts, project managers, business managers etc) are relatively safe and always have work."
good,"I loved working for Chase.  I miss it terribly.  But, the head boss says one thing but does another. Favouritism is huge there unfortunately.  Given all of that I would still go back if asked because of the people and i really did love my job."
good,"Very busy from start to finish, several meetings per day, some were not  actually needed.   Your work life balance will largely depend on your management team, some are more flexible than others."
good,"Many opportunity for advancement; however, you have no life balance. Very cold environment, very fast pace and not much friendly. Good benefits and salary."
good,"Fast paced work environment, dealing and solving many financial based issues. Working together with the customer to ensure that their finances were secure and protected."
good,"Well maintained company  , fun environment to work at  managers were easy going schedule was perfect for balancing life and school as well parking was horrible"
good,"Good place to work, demanding but rewarding. You will need to be passionate and driven with strong networking skills. Vast array of product and business lines - internal movement is encouraged"
good,"I was able to improve my skills. As well as obtain new skills. I also learned a different function in the compan, which enhanced my abilities. Throughout my time with JP Morgan I was able to train and work in 3 different departments."
good,"I really loved my job until the company started adding a bunch of changes and cutting certain jobs off. I never had a set schedule, some weeks I would work 45+ hours and others I would only work 20 hours."
good,Great exposure to many aspects of the financial system.  Chase is a great company providing excellent benefits and dedicated teams to provide great value to the work environment.
good,"Have met great people and have wonderful customers that I work with.  Branch is open extended hours for the industry, poor work/life balance as a result.  Overall, a solid employer and offers great benefits and resources for their employees to aid success."
good,"- Monitor all LOBS, schedule all teams meetings , trainings and other needs that may impact the adherence. Also approve PTO and all other time-off requests."
good,Management looks out for its employees and always steps in without any questions. Workplace culture is great and there are many programs to join outside of your team to better network throughout the company.
good,"Worked with this company for over thirty years. A lot of opportunity for classes and learning for advanced career opportunities. However, had to relocate due to outsourcing."
good,I love working at Chase but there is no work life balance especially if you have kids or a social life. Besides that the job is cool and alot of room for advancement but scheduling again is not optional.
good,Management should listen to employees more and work on improving process flow.  Things are constantly changing and not for the better. The team should be more involved in decisions.
good,"This job is not difficult, but if you do not stay organized, you will not be successful. Make sure you are following up with customers and trying to bring the branch more business. Management will be all over you if you do not reach out to your current customers."
good,"In order to achieve goals we were partnered with Relationship Bankers and Chase Private Client Bankers. By doing so, they were able to coach us in ways to enhance customer experience while learning about our products."
good,"I love working here. It's a small team, but we work together so well. We are able to have fun while also providing a professional environment for our customers."
good,Chase is a great place to work for. Very demanding job but make the attempt to be flexible with your family schedule. Make changes often. Enjoyed learning from others.
good,"Very competitive...Challenging...Self driven...Excellent company"
good,When I first started working at J.P. Morgan it was very customer service oriented. The branch that I was play stat was more of a family environment. The longer I worked there the further from a customer service oriented and family oriented environment it got.  Bonus structure is gotten much worse and it became more difficult to meet goals to earn the same amount of money.
good,"On a typical day there are metrics that need to be met. With multiple people in charge each having different opinions on how to achieve the goal. You may get 7 different directions on what you are required to do to complete your daily tasks. You are judged marked positively or negatively based on how you handle the task and who may have been monitored that task."
good,"assigned pipeline with applications entered by the bank branches for home equity loans, process applications, contact customer, gather necessary information and address any issues to make the process easy for the customer. I increased my knowledge in lending, stronger customer service skills. I was extremely lucky have started with J L and then  AS,  finally  my manager for 7 yrs AF. all my managers were extremely knowledgeable and helpful with the process of HE Lending. We enjoyed our work as a team, worked hard as a team and played as a team. The hours can be long only if the job files are not finished, time management is essential."
good,"Expectations are high with moderate stress and pressure. Being such a large company there are variations in experiences depending on area. Benefits are good with some variety in options, such as pre-paid legal and discount auto and computer purchases. Management varies as much as people do. My group has very good team managers but disconnected upper managers, partly because they eliminated all middle-management positions. This had a negative affect on career opportunities in the department. Being a large company, there are many open positions in other areas, so expect to move laterally to be able to move vertically during a career. Willing to relocate opens up more opportunities as some types of positions only exist in certain cities. "
good,"Good location in London"
good,"Great place to work.  They try to be open and enjoyable, but at the end of the day still very cold and corporate.  There is a lot of job opportunity within the company in all the financial areas they provide products and services."
good,"Working at the bank for over 30 years I have enjoyed multiple changes, conversions, managers and friends. I will miss working with all my friends and coworkers but will always remember the good times."
good,"Usually my day started way before i reached office , as i used to monitor my emails via blackberry device , to get updated on whats going on as far as my application business functions are concerned . "
good,"Worked for JP Morgan chase from 1997 as a Consultant and ended the career at JP Morgan Chase as an employee for 13 years. Got a lot of insight and experience in the IT industry and always provided 200% at the job, working honestly and hard and smart."
good,"The company is focused on customer needs and they go above and beyond to help.  I've worked for Chase roughly a year and half and I love it.  I do think we could earn more money, but I think that is a thought from many people at many companies.  For the most part management really cares what its employees are doing, but again the customers always come first."
good,"Because there was a very diverse group of customers, I developed a strong listening skill and I would not trade the experience of service for anything"
good,Decent place to work. There are many areas within the bank to transition between. Generally helpful management when you are ready to move on to a different position.
good,"Chase offers decent pay and good benefits. They try to promote a fun work environment, but it’s still an extremely stressful work environment. They also encourage job mobility, but only offer small pay increases. They need to promote job mobility because they are constantly laying people off. It’s not"
good,"It's a big, fast paced company with deep pockets and lots of resources, but it's not a gentle place to work, so it's not for everyone.  You can have a big career if you set your sights high and you don't mind being challenged.  Stamina is required!"
good,Chase has great benefits and an overall good place to work for but my department micromanages you and doesn’t have a good management team. Work is always stressful but we do have fun events and lots of good people to work with.
good,Nice job to have if you can deal with being on the phone. Sometimes the phones become very busy and dealing with customers can get hectic. Pay is ok but overtime is available.
good,"Got more and more chances to explore my self "
good,Working for Chase has its good and bads as most companies do. The coworkers are awsome anywhere you go. The pay is okay except for recently they gave us more work to do with a very tiny raise. And of course it is not so easy to advance here unless maybe you have some sort of experience or id say degree or college eduxation going? All in all its a good place to start off.
good,"Chase offered me a position in their Records Management Department. Started as a file clerk researching payment histories. Advance to Senior file clerk training others to do payment histories. Conducting meetings, caring and storing micro file and writing manuals on researching thirty plus years mortgage payment histories were my duties."
good,Overall my experience was great during my tenure there. Wished more flexibility for parents trying to manage difficult schedules. Left using sick time and will be penalized if you run out as they only give this on a quarterly basis.
good,I started with the company with a very high expectation. My previous LOB used to have a fun working environment. The bosses are all donwn to earth and they keep open door communication with their employee. The environment just suddenly change when the management chaged it turned the world upside down. Maybe the upper management would try to reach out to their people as well to check what is going on with the  business.
good,Found the organizational structure to be more productive than several other major financial institutions I worked at.  A lot probably due to a strong operations and project management teams.   Collaboration among different business units also seemed to be much better than average.  I would say that work life balance is better than average for the industry.
good,Chase had a positive work environment.  They focused on production but tried to allow employees flexibility for work/life balance. Management did a good job assessing skills and placing employees in positions that would allow you to be more productive.
good,"I like to work here but no growth ."
good,"Chase is a great place to work. you stay busy at all times and to see the smile on peoples face when they leave,has always been a great pleasure for me.the most enjoyable part of the job, was all the great customers!"
good,"Good place to work, however things move very slowly. There is alot of politics that stand in someones way. With that said it is a great company to work for with a lot of opportunity"
good,"It can be a bit stressful because of high volumes but the job is rewarding. the organisation is open to innovative ideas and automation, excellent job security."
good,"Chase offers a wide variety of banking products.  You have to be a quick learner because of its constant innovating trend, which is good for the banking industry, because clients only want to deal with the best!"
good,"I take calls from customers and bankers. Taking payments, updating addresses, as well as phone number updates, and processing payoffs for the accounts."
good,"Good place for someone looking for job security and work life balance versus a place to grow by smart work. Don't ask much from job, thus neither reward well."
good,There were many chances for the employees to show their hard work and try their best to move up within the company. Every job well done was always recognized by the management.
good,"I've been with JPMorgan for 18 years, great company overall with intelligent colleagues.  Overall, great experience to work for this company as you can really learn a diverse skillset depending on which team you choose to work on.  You can gain technical skills, trading experience or marketing experience."
good,I was able to see the importance of the business side of society. I participated in developing plans and scheduling meetings. Was able to learn and understand the importance of documentation and proper way to do it.
good,"Very fast pace with high turnover due to the stressful work and demands."
good,At JPMorgan Chase I learned patience and attention to detail. I had a call  center position so any negative feedback about employment about Chase has to do with the position itself. Overall great company and benefits. Very motivated and positive management.
good,It was a good company to work for as it is so known however it was not cooperative with schedules. It would make a better company if it did work with our schedules as well
good,"JPMC is fast-paced and competitive however, the culture promotes collaboration. Overall, employees enjoy working for the company and receive amazing benefits."
good,"a great culture, with very knowledgeable people, willing to share knowledge. a good working environment with the opportunity to be involved in global projects"
good,"You meet awesome people through working here, many connections. Customers depending on what area the bank is in can get a bit tough. You learn to get thick skin. I worked in a verity of towns and had different types of customers. Make sure you work in a busy branch, your days will go by faster, more work. Hardest part is if you get a bad manager out of the 3 branches i worked in only one was miserable. Get to know your manager before you agree for a position, ask them about their managing style."
good,There are tremendous opportunities for advancement by moving from position to position around the company.  All the while gaining new skills and savvy.
good,"Within the technology organization, we're encouraged to be intuitive and think outside the box to develop solutions to be implemented in the environment."
good,"The department I worked for was moved out , did not have much options. As all other departments were not hiring at that time. If I could get a chance to work for them again I would."
good,JP Morgan is an excellent place to work to advance your career. The salary is great and the work is competitive and aggressive. The only downside is that the work life balance can suffer.
good,"I need to review 200 alerts per day, you learn a lot using different programs, the staff, was great , the bosses were excellent, they help you a lot in succeeding in this company."
good,JP Morgan Chase is a great place to work.  The management team is incredible from the top right on down.  They offer top of the line benefits.  It can be difficult to advance career sometimes.  The shear size of the organization somewhat prevents individual relationships for employees.
good,I worked at Chase 4 times as a contractor and wastold that i could be hired at the end of my 1 year contract.  The contract periods were for 1 year but only lasted 3-6 months.  You worked hard and long to complete contract work that was estimated to last 1 year.  You wer put back on the job search too soon.  you worked more than full time
good,A great place to work. But the HR department prevents management from doing their job successfully. Now the inmates run the asylum. The culture has become very unprofessional.
good,Found work experience to be working in a specific Silo.  Generally flexible with Job work/Life balance.  I would like to see the availability of more career movement.
good,"Productive, fun, and bright place to work with a collaborative team environment.  Learned may new Clarity, Jira, and app development methods and was able to benefit from many training sessions about banking industry security and lessons learned reviews after each completed project."
good,"chase is a company that strives to provide the best customer service, at all times you're actively trying to live up to their extremely high standards."
good,"J.P. Morgan has a good corporate culture for a company of its size. It cares about its employees and clients alike. My experience was largely positive, and I feel lucky to have worked there."
good,Chase does not follow the guidelines passed down from the company. All situations are dependent upon site leadership.  I enjoyed working with multiple lines of business.
good,"Nice work environment during my 5 years at JP Morgan Chase. My time there was very rewarding being my first job while i was attending college, I have been very lucky to work with a great team who has taught me “The Hows.” This helped me excel within my career at the company as well as assisted in my personal growth"
good,Great training and human resources. It's a good place for someone new to banking to begin their career. Learn great habits and work ethics. Too big of a company for local banking.
good,"Working here is great and the people I've worked with in Chase Auto Finance has been a great experience. The only issue is that this part of the company use to be largely staffed and because the company has been consolidating a lot, jobs has been eliminated or relocated. in the past 8 years working here I've been uneasy about if my job with be eliminated or relocated which unfortunately is now in my foreseen future. :-("
good,The  management at JP Morgan Chase Bank  was not properly trained to work with people. The work place gives you space for advancement when you have a proper management in a branch .
good,"Great place to kick start your career, I can thank Chase for many opportunities to grow my career. I witnessed so much growth from myself and peers and leaving was bitter sweet. I can say that its very difficult to get back into once you have left. In Ohio anyway"
good,Chase is a fairly good place to work.  The culture is very diverse.  Health benefits plans are very good.  Management will assist in your progress to whatever position or role you would like to obtain.
good,"With all Operational jobs at JPMorgan, the employees are quickly over looked. With a job in operations there are assumptions that ""anyone can do this"" creating an atmosphere where they are not afraid to work you to the ground and once you are willing to quit you can quickly be replaced. This creates a horrible environment as once one person reached this breaking point and quits, the team is now put under much more stress resulting in more hours, more people quitting, and an unsafe work environment."
good,"Chase has everything to become one of the best places to work in America, however their staffing models are not contributing to a healthy work-life balance for employees."
good,"Culture is great, teams work together. Home Lending is exciting area to work where the management cares about the employee, strives to remove bureaucracy, and enhance customer experience."
good,"I work independently, setting my goals and priorities, while also supporting other Administrative Assistants as needed.  My main function is to maintain Managing Directors' Outlook calendar, arranging international and domestic travel, completing T&E expenses in a timely manner (Concur), handling meeting logistics (audio conferencing, telepresence, food/beverage), and any other administrative functions as needed (ie., onboarding/offboarding, supplies, equipment maintenance, etc.)"
good,Great for entry level with a lot of room to grow - multiple businesses and management that is dedicated to mobility.  Hard work is expected but generally rewarded in the long run.
good,The leadership team at J.P. Morgan is amazing.  The only real issue I have is my job is being eliminated because I work remotely at home and I am not it the two locations required to be within my current line of business.
good,"JPMC is a great place to work. Change is constant and opportunities to grow and advance are available for a person who actively manages their career.  As with any large company, opportunities improve the closer you are to the front office and primary locations.  Large banks are heavily regulated and this leads to a culture that emphasizes control and risk avoidance at times to the detriment of innovation and creativity."
good,Great leadership. The company is very big so its hard to get noticed or promoted for your good work. Some cool benefits but you have to be there for a long time.
good,"I have learned that how management differs from middle management to Senior management. How it impact the total work culture at root level."
good,I am technologist and the company is a fun place to work. Employees a provided career oppurtunities to advance their skills with trainings and hackathons
good,"Because I spent over 17 years with the company, I've experienced a mostly satisfactory career. The changes that were made, prior to my resignation, were centered around increasing productivity and not necessarily quality."
good,"Chase bank is a great place to work if you are outgoing and detailed oriented.  I took anywhere from 60-80 calls a day from Chase customers who had Chase credit cards.  I absolutely loved talking to the customers, but as an employee, you do have to meet a metric on the length of the call. This is completely okay because the company did not want customers to wait too long. It was a fun place to work.  They provided six weeks of training and once you were on the floor taking calls, there was always someone available to answer questions.  The company also was always leaving little quirky gifts for employees or notes when you did well with a call.  There wasn't really anything wrong with this job, maybe a little anxiety when you first signed on to take calls. Some of the employees had some problems meeting the metrics, which was stressful for them.  Chase was very good working with their Customer Service people by basically retraining workers and having long term CSR's sit with them to provide advice and show them how a task could be performed quicker."
good,A goal driving organization. Training was given monthly. your day normally began with a morning huddle and then you were off to achieve your goals and hold your daily meetings
good,"Like any other corporate, office politics coupled with incompetent managers ruin the perfect atmosphere of a workplace. Work load is huge, compared to any other MNC banks."
good,"Its a great place to work if one has a good and supportive Branch Manager."
good,"Work/Life Balance - Rated mid to low because more often workload requires between 50 to 60 hours per week."
good,JPMorgan provides many opportunities for employees to build their skills and is a great firm to build a career. The firm prides itself on diversity and has taken measures to improve.
good,Your typical day at work will be in an open seating seating environment that is fast paced.  You will have the opportunity to learn lots about the finance industry.
good,Great place to work from co-workers to managers. Benefits and pay were great. Learned a lot there and they treat their employees fairly. Good company.
good,Great compensation package diverse background of employees great benefits very stressful environment as monthend goals must be met and you have to be able to multi task
good,"Flexible hours, good training and resources, find an affluent area to work in.  Partner with bankers and branch manager to drive investment revenue and to be successful."
good,"For employees in non-sales roles who are located in company's hub locations (e.g. in US: NY/NJ metro, Columbus, OH. etc.) great internal career growth opportunities exist."
good,"From Teller to Customer Service Rep., I was kept very busy. I learned how to count, bundle and ship out large sums of money. My manager and I had good communication between one another. Each place I worked at was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was when my cash drawer was out of balance and I couldn't leave until it was correct. Sometimes, I would find it right away. I enjoyed working with money at the time and meeting new customers as well as seeing the usual daily customers."
good,"Typical day would be to answer emails or speak to team members about the requests that needed to be completed and the time frame to open new accounts or to on-board a new client."
good,There are endless opportunities to learn something different at this employer.  I enjoyed building a network of partners and learning from them as well.
good,JP Morgan is a great place to work if you are keen to lean and want to avail a lot of mobility opportunities. It offers good benefits package. The culture varies depending on which group within JP Morgan you are working in.
good,Working at JPMC you can learn al to from the industry leader. My experience at Chase is unmatched and the knowledge of banking that I have received while an employee at chase is something that will carry me through out my life journey.
good,"Heavy workloads and fast-paced environment (Internship). The hardest part of this company is understanding each technical software, different teams and different skill sets to learn."
good,The culture has changed over these  20 years but I still love and respect this company that allowed me to have a great education and career since the 1990's.
good,"Love the benefits, however the salary could be more competitive for they type of work.   Options to work from home when sick is great in our line of business.  Down fall, is no paid parking for employees working in down town location.   Communication in my line of business is slow across lines of management to employees and are often misinterpreted.  Overall satisfied with the company however."
good,"Hard work is a must at chase, benefits are great and the environment is pushing people towards their goals and objectives, the hardest part of the job is to keep up with the competition."
good,"Great place to work, extremely talented colleagues to work with. Lot of knowledge sharing, learning and team development. I would definitely go back here for another opportunity if presented to work again. Good/descent work-life balance. Flexible team work schedules. Great benefits and health care coverage/retirement benefits etc."
good,"Loan requests put in your queue each day to be approved or declined.  Usually have 10 to 20 credits in your queue and try to complete two to three each day.  Most of the time you have to get the Relationship Managers to answer questions or provide more information to decision the requests."
good,"I was able to manage my team and have fun while we achieved our goals.  Not only for sales, and operations, especially in customer experience which is my favorite part of working with the clients."
good,"JPMorgan has a ton of LOBs they just dont connect at all and you can find yourself trapped in a spot.  In terms of advancement, they aren't in a rush.  ""Stay in your job min of 2 years at least"" or ""Come back in 6-8 months we might have something"" kind of place.  I like my coworkers, good people and good workers.  It's a place where they want to retain people, lots of 10-15 year plus tenures.  "
good,"Chase is a great place to start and spend your career.  The culture supports training, coaching and preparing employees for the next step in their career.  The stability at Chase is very strong"
good,"Good Company, great people.  Nice facilities, cafeteria served good food, very caring company in the community/ Uses latest technology."
good,"solid company to work for, definite name drop for elsewhere. this is mostly a stepping stone job, as to truly move up, you need to leave and come back"
good,"Very solid structure and client oriented organization. Product offering is superb. Great innovation and resources.  Retail banking is currently focusing in operating as one business unit, leveraging core strengths in existing relationships in Business banking, consumer, lending, investments."
good,"A typical day at work was working with clients to deepen relationships and service accounts such as checking, savings, loans and investments. I learned a lot about the financial industry and was able to obtain my Series 6, Series 63 and Life & Disability. Banking changed a lot overtime, it became more about technology services and the branch traffic became very slow. The most enjoyable part were my colleagues and the expertise that I gained."
good,My work at JPMorgan Chase has given me various exposure to the financial services industry as well as an understanding and interest in the general economic environment.
good,I loved working at Chase. I came across great managers that always helped me balance life and work. I enjoyed my functions at this company. I was always given the room to grow and develop professionally.

good,"I being in the company por almost 10 years and is a great place to be with a lot of opportunities ,there la a lot of diversity and equal of opñortunitues to every one,is a very secure place to work."
good,"All performance is based on scores and customers surveys. A matrix system is used for monitoring performance which did not allow for corrections. For example if the customer made an error on the phone survey by pressing 1 meaning poor service, but intended to press 5 for excellent service this could not be changed or omitted from your performance evaluation. Customers opinions covers 50 percent of your performance evaluation.  Chase has exceptional employees, benefits and work ethnics."
good,"Like most relationship banker positions, bonuses and commissions are key. The more work you put in to acquiring customer the more you will earn. Chase in no different."
good,"Low Base Salary compared to it peers, but the incentives are there if you hustle 24 hours, 7 days a week...…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….."
good,"My time with this company was great. It gave me the opportunity to grow as a person professionally and personally. I’m looking to pursue advancement in my career and a change of pace. Coming into the office on a daily basis was something I looked forward to especially when the environment was sensational and Management made sure their employers were looked after and cared for. I personally learned what it was like to work at a high stress and professional level. The hardest part of the job, today, is that my department is no longer needed due to it being more cost efficient to relocate out of state."
good,"Lots of great people and great teams but at the end of the day all decisions are made by upper management, who can be out of the loop. Varies manager to manager"
good,"JP Morgan Chase is cutting edge in banking products and services,  There is a strong orientation to customer service. Emphasis on employee development."

good,"I have been at Chase for 5 years. I enjoy working here, but do not see it as the job I want to retire from.  "
good,Chase is a great company to begin and end your career. You should try other companies then come back to grow. Most of the upper management were promoted at other companies then came to Chase.
good,I worked in the back office of investment banking. The environment was very friendly and full of young talented individuals. The place provides a great platform for someone to start their career in finance
good,"Excellent training provided, cutting edge technology and great advertising to the public. Low base salary, uneven management:,at the mercy of the current manager"
good,"I like working for Chase, but being a 20 hr work week teller isn't making it. It was working well while I was finishing up school but now I need full time. It is very difficult to obtain that while working for Chase."
good,Por cuestiones de confidencialidad no puedo hacer comentarios al respecto
good,Worked at Chase for several years.  I would still work there if they had not shut down my office location.  Good benefits when I was employed.  Policies and procedures and strictly enforced.
good,"company in all is ok to work with, only that I did not like was that, I was hired for one department and moved over to another after 3 or 4 months into my employment, without being given a choice if I wanted to move or not. I got sick with graves disease and the days missed by dr's doing went against my attendance."
good,Great place to start your AV career and learn about the industry. One of the largest AV companies which means there is usually plenty of work in major cities.
good,"Working at chase was a bit stressful, however, they did provide the tools in order for us to be successful at our positions. Our compensation and benefits made up for many of the companies faults. Plenty of opportunity for advancement."

good,"I worked in middle office in the investment bank, and while I was under a protected analyst program, the pay was very fair and our hours were not remotely excessive. Observing my managers, their balance was somewhat more volatile, but in general they still kept very fair hours and a good level of pay. "
good,"Generally like the company, but needs better pay for tellers and bankers. Some branches are closed Saturdays, some are not. Would like if all were closed to allow employees to enjoy weekends for personal time/life. Also, trying to move up in the company is a pain, especially when trying to relocate to a new city. Eventually ended up looking for work with a different company because of it."
good,"I like working for chase and love it, people are nice and friendly. Working environment is cool and comfy. I like all of my boss and managers. no complain."

good,"Benefits are great, co-workers are great, management I had was great, didn't get much advancement opportunities though. Branch went through 3 managers within 1.5 years..."
good,"Having worked for the company for 19 years, I can confidently say there is ample opportunity to move around the various Lines of business to find your niche.  Most managers were willing to hire not only based on your skills but your professional reputation.  I have been given the chance to grow in ways I never knew were possible."
good,"Trade Finance  at JP Morgan involved  a lot of Hard work and long working hours."
good,"JPMorgan Chase is a good company to work for and grow with. The managers are focused on the employees success and advancement for the most part. The company does exceptionally well because of its sheer size and market share. They pass that on, for the most part in benefits and work/life balance."
good,"Very high customer volume, thus fast paced. It was a very structured work environment. Each staff member had to adhere strictly to their job descriptions."
good,"Great people to work with and lots of clients to help out. Your day is a mixture of client phone calls, training, scheduling and client-facing interaction. It can get busy very quickly so do not expect a consistent time for lunch or breaks, you make time when you can. Clients are usually very friendly and most issues can be resolved if you utilize your resources."
