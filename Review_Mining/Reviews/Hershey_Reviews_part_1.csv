bad,"When I was interviewed for the job, they never mentioned that the contract job is hired through an agency, not directly from Hershey itself. Next, they don't tell you that they renew your contract every 3 months for a year, after a year, you have to quit before come back 2 months later (so you basically have to find a job for those 2 months or be unemployed)."
bad,Poor management and favoritism and unorganized scheduling. We had birds inside the facility. And consistent harassment among the workplace and constant distractions.
bad,Excessive hours union reps get preferential treatment by company to not take care of workers.points given for not working OT even if you already have 60plus hours .
bad,"Expect lots of bullying, very poor management, favoritism and cliques. This is not the place you want to be! Managers do not care about your well being as long as the job gets done. Expect lots of mandatory overtime."
bad,"not a good company. needs to be ran  by someone else ."
bad,I have witness management get rid of employees simply because they did not like them. They make up rules as they see fit always benefiting themselves . They ask you to work on your off days but they already made it Mandatory and if you do not you receive a point on your attendance. you only get 5 before they start throwing around termination and the points stay active for a year. The work culture is awful nobody smiles or are happy to be at work. Not an employee friendly company .
bad,"Working for Hershey has been the worse work experience I've ever received. I've had many jobs, and I've worked in different parts of the world and I can honestly say this job was not worth my time and I would not recommend it to anyone. When I started working there, I quickly felt neglected by management. Management lacks communication. I was never notified by any changes that were relevant to me, I was never notified when I was being relocated, I was never notified by any training classes that were taking place that would have been beneficial to me. I felt they simply didn't care about my progression. I was simply there to be over worked.This brings me to my next point. Retail managers try over work their retail staff. We were expected to work additional hours, double shifts. On many occasions I wouldn't even have a break, it was common that we didn't eat. Yet my work was not appreciated by management."
bad,"To begin with, the culture is terrible! They promote an unhealthy work-life balance, expecting you to work 60 hours every week, including weekends, in an entry level position. The pay is absolutely horrendous! They barely compensate you enough money in the gas you use to drive around your territory for work, and even with working overtime, they have a fixed rate for this position across the country, so living in Seattle, one of the most expensive places to live, I had to pick up a second side job. The people are cut-throat, nothing matters but Hershey type of people. They encourage terrible, low-life behavior, and congratulate you when you do sneaky stuff to competitor products. Overall terrible people, terrible culture, and terrible company."
bad,Management is absolutely horrific. There's no Job/work balance. Your forced to take five days of consecutive vacation days when you only start with 10 days for the entire year. Production always comes first even when there's a clear safety or quality issue. Management shows blunt favoritism and retaliation toward certain people. Permanent and Contingent employees are openly disrespected. I've witness employees loose their jobs because management simply doesn't  like them. It's the most unprofessional establishment I've ever worked for. Corruption runs deep and without a union there's no chance of being treated fairly. This is only a glimpse of how terrible the Memphis plant is. Management is violating rights and breaking laws and there's nothing being done.
bad,"Hershey hired people they referred to as ""Temps,"" but there were not temporary positions. They were just permanent jobs with less pay than the people who had been hired in the 1980's. "
bad,love love love this job very good company to work for only down fall is the manitory 7 days straight during busy season but overall a very good company to work for
bad,Working for creamery Hershey ice cream was a pleasure to work for management not so good he had a temper . The job was easy and my office manager was a doll.
bad,"I've worked at Hershey for close to 40 years. Today is my 43rd day straight without a day off.  I have worked as many as 56 all mandatory.  12 hrs on a good day 16 on a bad one.  I have been looking for a job for a while but am afraid I am going to be forced to quit.  I am close to being able to retire but can't make ends meet yet.  A company who prides itself on corporate responsibility, and ethics, what a crock.  I can't continue to work like this my body just can't take it.  Its the company's way of getting rid of all the older people and people with disabilities that drive up their insurance costs.  It never used to be like this I used to love my job. Your treated like a slave with no control over your life.  Hourly people are treated like dirt by hourly people who work Monday through Friday no weekends no overtime.  Horrible company horrible management stay away."
bad,"Hershey was a client, I was a contractor for System One. Good environment, Corporate life was as expected. There is a huge problem with diversity, although it is the first thing it is spoken about when you go there. As an Italian citizen, I had some issues merging with the employees there."
bad,Worked through temp agency. No real room for advancement since Hershey never seemed to hire the temps. Rotating & swing shift so never knew what hours you would work a week & no guarantee of full-time.
bad,"Management doesn't know what or how to do any of the jobs yet they want to ""implement changes"" and blame problems that occur on the workers."
bad,Horrible management. Bosses take no responsibility and don't help out co workers. Total chaos. No opportunity to advance. Terrible experience. Bad pay.
bad,"management is not all all good. Did not enjoy the work or what they were asking of us. "
bad,"This company is dishonest and unethical. It was very common for them to hire an employee for 1 position only to put them in another position once they were hired. Most employees are salaried and are expected to be available to work from 3:00 AM to 11:00 PM with no overtime. If you complain you are out."
bad,"I currently work here as an area sales representative on the snack side, no confection involved. The pay sucks. I can barely afford to survive, let alone feed my family. This is a perfect entry level job for college kids, but no one else. Management has no life and will email you every weeknight and weekend..and expect an answer back. They make us compete against each other every couple months and if we win...we receive ""smiles"". You are busting your tail to get more displays and more cases sold in to place in the top 3...but only rewarded with a smile. If you receive a smile, you will get points to buy things on some website(poor quality items, by the way). They told us we were our own boss and could make our own schedule. We need to start at 7, the last 8:00 AM and  our every move is questioned. You have to be in the store 30 minutes minimally, anything less you will be questioned and treated as a child. If it takes you long to get from store to store, they will ask why. They do not believe traffic exists and will not believe you. You will become miserable and unmotivated really quickly. Many of my colleagues are looking for jobs currently, as we are all miserable. The pay is entry-level and definitely not good enough for the area I live in. They cut our overtime as well, so when i first started I was basically lied to. There is no room for advancement and no more room to make more money in your check. The CEO said we had summer Fridays(mainly for people in the office), but we all thought we'd be able to participate. Come to find out that we need to ask 2 weeks in advance"
bad,"Its a place that has gone through a huge amount of change in the last 5-7 years. The majority of it isn't good."
bad,"Inept management.  They hire inexperienced managers that are more interested in employee discipline than helping get the job done.  Work life balance is non-existent, they constantly force overtime with no regards to already worked hours.  Pay is at the low end on the industry.  The company and union collude to diminish workers rights.  It's all about the Got Ya mentality."
bad,"12 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 21 days straight. Then you get one day off, and you're right back to it. If you're ok with this, then it's the job for you. If you have children, or doctors appointments, it doesn't matter. You're getting points. No work-life balance whatsoever. Salaried employees almost never work overtime or weekends. Weekends are run by the leads, which are hourly. "
bad,"Nice to work independently, but pay was not commensurate with duties. Tasked with more responsibility, but not much in return for raises in a high cost of living area. Work culture was fine."
bad,"Too many hours and management not qualified or understanding. No family time although claiming to be a family orientated job. Not optional but manadatory overtime, 7 days a week"
bad,"The Hershey Company has been one of the poorest experiences in my working career. The Management low rates their employees and are very unprofessional. Daily chaos and no room for growth. They hire approximately 5-10 employees weekly due to an extremely large turnover in production.  They have gone through three HR managers in two and a half years, three nurses in the last three years, and two plant managers in the last three years. Sanitation leaves alot to be desired on the production floor, causing product waste to be tremendous in sone production areas. Equipment breaks down and there is an extreme shortage in maintenance technicians. "
bad,"buenas prestaciones, mala administracion de los supervisores, muy despotas, te faltan al respeto."
bad,the only care in this company in Hazleton is to get as much candy out as possible. there is no work life/balance. you will work 7 days/week 8-12 hours a day. even the temps .
bad,"When I started here it was one of the best places to work. As management changed, they took and took away from us. Took sick time, changed attendance, took people away, took pay away (we finally got that back). They are now working what is supposed to be 12 days on, 4 days off, but that's not working. Machinery is constantly broken down or other issues, so some areas are literally getting scheduled every weekend with maybe a weekday off. You can also be scheduled 8,10 or 12 hours with no predictability to make Dr appts, etc. The management and HR are not for the employees. It's all about the mighty dollar and I'm guessing Milton is rolling in his grave the way we are treated and can't make plans with your family. They don't care. We got production out just fine on a 4 and 5 day work week for years and now they say that's not possible?? We get our schedule on Thursday or Friday for a work week starting on Sunday. You absolutely can't make plans even on what you think might be your weekend off. No one wants to work here now. All the new ones getting hired quit soon after. Everything is kept secret from us. We don't know if we're having a plant shutdown till literally when the schedule comes out. They don't want you making plans ahead of time to be off a week. We used to know, not now. I have never seen an employer treat their employees the way this place does. The benefits and pay are the only reason I'm still here. Everyone I know is looking for other jobs. You don't want to work here if you have little kids or want any kind of family life."
bad,"You'll be going to Walmarts every day building displays and getting chewed out by store managers. Unrealistic expectations, strong nepotism/favoritism within the company. Work days start at 7am after an hour of unpaid driving to your first store. Days usually end around 5pm with an hour or more of unpaid drive time home. Mandatory overtime required (47.5 hours per week) and usually expected to work 50+ hours a week. Annual bonus structure is based off company performance, not individual performance. Overall a lot of uncertainty in the company's future (less people shopping at grocery stores plus sugar/candy industry overall is in decline)."
bad,"Y&S is a toxic environment. It comes from the top down. Nothing but a ""tribal"" mentality. People will throw (especially managers, supervisors, and team leaders) others ""under the bus"" to get where they want. Not an ounce of integrity among any of the management. Went to one of the supervisors about harassment  (plus others), only to be dismissed and left to fend for yourself. As I said, toxic."
bad,Se trabaja bajo mucha presion al ser una empresa de producto facilmente perecedero hay que estar en coordinando las entregas puntuales para evitar rechazos por llegadas tardes
bad,"Great pay; that’s why people stay and that’s really the only positive.  Morale is extremely low. Upper management doesn’t care at all about the production workers or middle management; they don’t even walk out on the production floor. I was never told anything positive, like “good job”. I never knew what my manager would do next to me; it was like walking on eggshells everyday. Had to leave for my health. The money wasn’t worth the constant knot I had in my stomach. Very disappointing."
bad,"- dirty "
bad,"Working for Hershey was very stressful, they will buy vouchers from the state, and make you work for months without a day off....12 hrs a day. I worked 17 days without a day off got two days off then another 28 days before we got another day off. The machinery is ancient, and doesn’t perform well at all, so you are spending every moment keeping it running. Poor management, and bad employee moral"
bad,"They don't care about the employees, so people struggle. Working 12 days in a row with only 2 days to try to recover doesn't work out well. I haven't seen my family much for a few years now."
bad,"Job is actually easy it is just management. The production management which is a woman who has no knowledge of any production worker skills. She show favoritism, talk very rude to you, and will go to HR and try and get you hired. It's a no union company so you have no back when it comes to your job. Alot of people said at the job she has got several people fired. Just watch your back since I been there I stay out the way from her. She has got several people fired for no reason which it really horrible. If you work for this company try to no get on there bad side because it will cost you your job. HR agree with everything told to them."
bad,"Bad hours and ridiculous hiring tests for technicians. Improper management of time, manpower, and equipment. Can't hold on to employees. No way to advance."
bad,They don't want to pay operators their high pay so they continue to treat them poorly and harass them into wanting to leave.  It is a Union shop which does nothing for the people.  They bought into Management and do not support the people.  You will probably see another employee buy out in 2017 when the contract expires.  Then they will bring in Temps at $12.00/hour.
bad,Only hire direct out of college. Discriminate against all others even with experience and a network within the grocery trade. Plus all they do stock shelves in which don't need r year degree to do.
bad,I worked here over ten years ago and it wasn't a great place for my career so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone let alone someone that I was related to
bad,"Pay is incredibly uncompetitive, even for supervisors and benefits are largely nonexistent. Mid-level managers are very unorganized constantly making everything more difficult for the supervisors below them."
bad,"As a mechanic here I found out what was really broken down here and it was everything within the northwest corner of the building that couldn't be repaired but needs to be overhauled. I was never trained on how to staff a maintenance department or make adjustments to how people are treated. If you like to troubleshoot and see how people are treated here you won't figure this one out it's an ongoing problem. Working here is simple math, work - life = 0 balance. If you have hobbies or enjoy spending time with your family look for another employer that can provide a work life balance. Like any place else if someone calls off it's simple your one short and leave after 8 hours, not here if you are low in seniority you will get pounded with 12 hour shifts and end up divorced. Your vehicle will always be in the parking lot inside the fence on weekends but the little parking lot outside of the fence is always empty. They claim they are big on safety, see how safe you feel after working 12 hours all the time and driving home or going in. The rumble strips along 81 were put down for employees that work here. The maintenance job here is good it's like any other if you enjoy this career but what you have to put up with coming from the northwest section of the building is beyond repair and your skills are useless. So get your bearings and look another direction, there are better places out there that offer a work life balance and are more family oriented. But if you think this is a good fit for you try it and you will see what the other 400+ employees are saying. Don't get me wrong this"
bad,con los colegas se trabaja muy agusto el ambiente de trabajo es bueno
bad,"Getting in to get the job done to do the job right the first time pleasant people there is no hard part of the job, job well done at the end of the shift"
bad,I worked as a scheduling intern within the scheduling department and it was by far the worst experience I’ve had. I received one promotion which put me at a supervisor which was great and pay raises were nice when we would get them. Our two managers we had were so great but everyone above them were awful. Everything that went wrong they tried to blame on the interns when in all reality it’s because they didn’t know how to communicate with the interns to get something done correctly. They also started more drama within the office than the interns did who were college students which was very annoying and just made my work experience awful. I dreaded going to work there because I knew something was going to happen or I was going to get yelled at for something. The hours we had to work were absolutely insane as well. I would get scheduled 10-16 hour days and usually was expected to stay longer and you never got paid any over time. That sucked. It’s definitely not a fun job and you feel like your just doing the dirty work. Do not recommend at all.
bad,"Guerre constante entre les patrons et les employés. On vous met devant le fait accompli à quelques jours d'avance. Mauvaise gérance en général. Les cadres mentent délibérément aux employés. Employeur à éviter (vous ne resterez pas plus que quelques mois). Les RH ne veulent pas vous voir (remplissez une feuille, mettez la dans une boîte, et on vous répondra peut-être un jour)."
bad,It's cool haven't been there to long just not a kind of job for me no benefits no respect no structure at all not organized at all so I'm just looking for something different and better and beneficial
bad,"There was terrible management. This means employees are responsible for dealing with customers who get upset when there are not enough spoons, ice cream cups, or certain kinds of cones for example. The hygienic practices were just good enough, I learned how to operate a basic cash register, I gained experience working and communicating with people who did not speak English very well. I was underpaid, as were some employees who may not have even been legally allowed to work in the U.S."
bad,They have fire all the good people from the great managers now we have managers that they don't know what they doing at the job so I'm ready to leave the job please help me find a better job
bad,This job is not something I like or would ever recommend to anyone I don't approve of the management nor the employees. The environment of the work setting is not suitable to what people should be working in
bad,Worked a ridiculous amount of hours for a teenager. Paid very low for the work I performed. Best part of the job was that I was able to make enough money in the summer to not work during the school year.
bad,"The managers are lazy and incompetent, if you follow the rules with the guests that the company laid out, the managers won't back you up and you get in trouble, and if you don't follow the rules, you get in trouble. Although, good luck getting a manager to come over at all. They have better things to do, like sit in their office or go on vacation. Unless you're someone with limited availability, you'll get worked to the bone because of all the other employees who don't feel like coming in."
bad,"The company car and good benefits is the only good thing about the company. The job is exhausting, most workers work over 50 hour weeks and have no work life balance. The treatment in your workplace (aka walmart) is not good and disrespectful. Terrible environment and Mars pays way more money with no overtime hours expected"
bad,"Started out great until a guy with seniority asked me to sign his name to something fraudulently. Basically I became a target once he was found out, and got in trouble. Many members of varying shifts made it a hostile work environment and did mean, petty things to try and get me in trouble because this guy got in trouble. Think twice before working there. Pay is good - that's it."
bad,When I first started I was informed of some overtime that would be required. Which was fine. But then it turned into non stop overtime with extremely little time off. Became very difficult to balance family life and duties because of working non stop.
bad,"From the feedback I receive from the employees at the new plant, the most enjoyable part of the day is leaving the plant.  The hardest part of the job was working for a plant manager whose purpose was to shutdown the old plant and make no attempt to save it and the employees."
bad,"It's been many years since I worked for this company but during my time there, the leadership could have used improvement. While the district level management was focused and driven to performance, the regional was more motivated by political reasons."
bad,"I would clock into work and make my way to the parking attendants booth. Depending on the shift I may have to get the booth keys for the doors and cash box from security. If I am closing I would have to take care of the trash and recycling and lock the cash box and booths. If I worked the shuttle driver shift I would just need the keys to the van. I learned crisis management in my experience with the Hershey Company. When the main lot got full we would open the auxiliary lot for customers and would have a different procedure to transition to. There were times when you have a full lot and are waiting for a management decision to transition lots. There were also individual issues that needed addressed for ticket payment and at times parking attendants could be allowed to negotiate with customers for a lower parking fee. Management was demanding and wanted customers to see a smiling face, with a pleasant tone, and a professional demeanor upon entry to Chocolate World. Attendants were further pushed to use any idle time to pickup trash and to perform any task that could improve the aesthetic of our work space. The workplace culture was demanding. Thousands of people everyday visit Chocolate World and they need to be received and depart in a timely and efficient manner. There was little time for attendants to take a break and we constantly worked to improve information delivery and our efficiency. The people I worked with were carefree and easy to get along with however our work did not always allow us to relax. The hardest part of the job was communication. I would constantly work"
bad,"The company will tell you the great things about it, as well as some of their ""trained employees"". "
bad,"There is too much nepotism, favoritism, and racism.  The management team is close-minded and built on friendships. The workplace culture is very cut-throat."
bad,"I fix industrial food producing, wrapping, and conveying machinery including Rovema, Bosch, Sig, but mostly off brands, inexpensive types, and one-offs or prototypes."
bad,"90% merchandising, 10% sales. A combination of salary and hourly, with immense pressure to work the max of 55 hours per week. Very little opportunity for high dollar bonuses. Competition for promotions is intense, as nobody wants to be in this position for more than 2 years. Very labor intensive, you're body will break down during Easter and Halloween seasons. Very little meaningful support from your manager, they're more concerned about useless metrics. A good company to have on your resume, nothing more."
bad,"The Hazleton PA Hershey factory is not so great, especially the 3rd shift. Employees will actually laugh at you if you are new and have a problem and are stressed trying to fix things - and you are brand new and have no idea how to fix a boxmaker or tape machine! The gossip was a big drawback, bullying ppl. Union. They don't help you if you have issue. Seniority. There's about 400 hundred workers with seniority over you - you won't see day shift for 20 yesrs. Good luck"
bad,"Empresa en desarrollo, formando la cultura, necesario eliminar malas practicas."
bad,"Individuals advance according to who they know and not by how well they can do the job. Management can’t determine how to make a profit without employees working weekends. If they can’t produce one type of bar, they just make up the pounds with other products. This makes  the whole plant, except management, work the weekends.  HR department is a joke. They are most definitely not for the hourly employees. We’re only allowed to miss 4 days per year. At 5 occurrences, you get a verbal warning and it goes more severe from there. And now, we’re scheduled 12/13 days straight and never knowing what your schedule will be. We must schedule a vacation for doctor’s appointments, etc when management (salary) come and go as they please. We have supervisors that can’t make it to work all week."
bad,"Pay is great, however they own you and will be forced to work overtime constantly or you don’t have job.  They have no care for their employees or respect"
bad,"The company got greed over the years.They use to give Hersheypark passes. They are lucky they give a appreciation meal once a year. It use to be that you could eat as much as you want, but now you only get one time and very small portion. Plus, they don't treat there employees good. Example if an employee gets hurt they don't want to be held responsible. A person doesn't have a social life working here either. Over time must of the departments work 12 hours shifts. It use to be not like this, but company wants to save money in not paying overtime. There is so much to say about this company that I could go on but I am not."
bad,"Esta posición me permitió tener una mayor interacción con el área de ventas e incluso la oportunidad de visitar las instalaciones de algunos de nuestros clientes, me brindo una mayor visión del negocio."
bad,"Hershey's wasn't a bad nor good place to work, it's just to stressful and it was drama. I got to work in a environment where there's no drama at all. If there's drama and fighting going on, it distracts me from getting my job done. I won't be able to risk losing a job that I get."
bad,"The work is easy and the pay is good for the work done. However, be expected to work random hours. You could work regular 8 hour days on your normal shift on one week, then find out next week you are working 12 hours on 3 different shifts in the same week. And you never know what to do with your home life, because you only get your schedule 4 days in advance of the coming week."
bad,"Started off great but I quickly learned that it was all about the numbers. They mainly wanted you to sell in contracts basically no matter what cost. There were other RSM's selling not only candy but contracts as well without the store owner's knowledge. They would try to clean it up by saying "" Oh they don't read their contracts just have it already pulled up on your IPAD and just get them to sign it."" Upper management not really helpful either. Felt like a fulltime job with part time pay."
bad,Everything has to be a big secret. Most of the management team only cares about themselves. Company morale is at an all time low with no relief in sight.
bad,"All they have to offer is money. Their attitude is arrogant. It was total chaos when I was hired and it didn't get any better. A few good people, but they are overshadowed by the red tape and bs."
bad,If you want your spouse to work at a a place where men and women hookup then let them go here to work. The women and men here frolic and fratenize with one another at work and out in the parking lot among other things. They even allow spousal assault on their premises and the people who commit the crime on video are allowed to keep their jobs. Management does nothing and could care less of the trashy nasty stuff that goes on around their product. Not a place with morals or values. All this place has to offer is money and men and women hookups.
bad,"Learned planning and organizing priorities to execute plans in my stores"
bad,"the moral of this company is brutal.  May be alright higher up, but as a plant employee, you're just a number and nothing more.  The pay is pretty decent, and benefits aren't bad.  But other than that, they have nothing to offer.  Higher up discriminates against certain people if not in the right ""group"".  if you want a job where you just show up and do the same meaningless thing day after day and no one will remember you if you don't show up one day, then hershey is the place for you."
bad,"The company cycles through people like they are commodities. The culture is growing increasing cut throat. Brands are great, strategy is good. But they can't seem to turn acquisitions into successes or turnaround poor performing brands."
bad,"Sometimes you would get bad customers and then you would get the customers who completely made your day. There was no employee manager confidentiality, if you told your manager something by the time you were clocking out of your shift everyone on the sales floor knew your business.Hopefully since the new relocation they ahve also renovated the employees and their attitudes."
bad,"Simply, if you value your life, family, spending time with family and hobbies-do not work here... or at least don’t work the West Hwrshey plant! Compensation is not worth the poor lifestyle that follows or the limited work-life balancing act."
bad,"I worked in various stores at Hershey Park, primarily as a gift store cashier. You are required to stay busy when there is not much to do, always cleaning the store when you have a chance, or fixing the shelves. When working with other employees, it's fun, but when working alone in a store it is boring. The supervisors may or may not be a bit too nosy about what you are doing."
bad,"no se interesan por sus empleados."
bad,"Like the other reviewers said the major problem with this facility is the ""management"" staff group."
bad,Management expects you to stay busy without providing any work to do. The office is nowhere near busy enough to keep a full time admin asst busy 40 hours a week.
bad,Safety is number 1 priority. Everything is done slowly and meticulously but the job is done every day. Manages are friendly and lenient.
bad,"I was a contractor for a few months in HR. I was praised on a phone in meetup call with 30 people on Tues and told not to return on Thurs. I was let go without much of a reason and certainly never had any discussion about things to work on, but I was told from the agency by them I seemed ""frustrated"" wow. Part of my job was selling Hershey to candidates, ironic isn't it? 90% of the time was never spoken to by my on site manager, Only saw the one who approved my timesheet 5 times ever. Finished my work then at the end of the day was given the work of the others who were perm that they sat on all day. nice! good luck if you choose to work here."
bad,"sometimes stressful ,short staff,work hard,off days not good poor leadership human resources not fair,not communicating no feedback will not provide check studs"
bad,"Buena compañía con MUY BUENAS prestaciones."
bad,"Ive worked at Hershey for four years now. Since starting management has become very poor, most of them don’t know what they are doing, hold the building open longer than it needs to be, and when we do close, people are not allowed to be forced out. This leaves employees there till an hour or an hour in half after the building has closed. Most departments are short staffed so a lot of employees are scheduled almost every day. The amount of work you do doesn’t  show up on your paycheck half the time. You get nice discounts and even tickets to Hershey Park but that is if you can afford to buy them when you get your check."
bad,"I loved the poeple i worked with.  Management lead to this place being shut down and outsourced to Indonesia.  Laid us off right before christmas and then had mandatory ""meetings"" so we couldnt collect EI"
bad,"A typical day would include picking orders and riding a forklift, it consisted of picking ordersexample case picking and working on the assembley line . The co workers and staff are usually eorking so you do not get lot of down very high pace and the pay was not that good . Overall I did learn alot about case picking . And they allow you free Hershey candy ."
bad,"A.M. meeting, pm's & floor calls. Do many operator adjustments, find out info as you go. Communication is not good between management & hourly employees. Management promotes deception & getting everyone else in trouble. I work with many good technicians whom are just as fed up as I am. We have lost several very good techs because of plant management. Most techs stay for the pay and that's it. The hardest part of my job is seeing others get set up, and can do nothing about it. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to do R&D. I have definitely learned how NOT to treat people. I have also learned how to work with many different types of personalities, and have a very good rapport with most everyone in the plant."
bad,"If your in need of money, then this is the place for you.  If you want to see your family, or have any life outside of the job, then you had better not even think of applying here.  They will lie to you about how much weekend and Holiday work there is.  You will be lucky to have off 2 weekends a month, count on 1 weekend off per month, as long as no one goes on vacation.  If you want a Holiday off, you better schedule a vacation day.  The people you will be working with are a great group of guys, and will soon become your family!"
bad,"A typical day at work is very busy and stressful. I have learned about the product and it's history. As for management, that is is a different story. I work with people from all over the world and enjoy working with them. The hardest part is staying open very, very late, i.e. we close at 12 a.m. and they want to keep us open until 1 to 1:30 in the morning and after we close, it's another hour, hour and a half to clean up. Therefore, we go home at round 2-3 in the morning after being there since 4 p.m. We are always short staffed. I DO enjoy working swing shift since my spouse works swing too. We have the same days off and that is working best for us. It just seems like we work hard for NO benefits, unless you are a ""staff member"" i.e. manager, assistant manager, or supervisor that works full time. I am already putting in 40 hrs+ and have been there for 3 years. I have been passed up for promotions, not even being asked if I was interested in becoming a supervisor. I have just been a cashier and I have not been very happy there for about 2 years. I am looking for a swing shift, 3:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. with benefits and Thursdays and Fridays off. The enjoyable part of the job is making guests happy with their purchase."
bad,"come in, get your work done. no career advancement available. Hardest part of the job is the fast pass you must work at.  Hershey expects a lot of you, but they pay well."

bad,Throughout the hiring process they are not truthful upon what they tell you to get you to accept the job. The only thing that is truthful from HR about your employment at Hershey is the pay and and overtime availability.
bad,"THIS JOB IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. In and out of grocery stores all day. You have to deal with everyone from store managers to shelf stockers to back room employees. The job itself sucks, you are basically a Walmart employee. Lots of having lifting (big boxes of chocolate to moving 500 hundred pound pallets). You don't get much support from management, nor to you get much training. You have a sales team but only see them once every 2 months. You are basically left alone to sell in displays to store managers, that basically don't even care about the real side of business."
bad,"Would  supervise two production lines.  Management had no clue how to treat people with respect and work together with supervision to get issues resolved.  Would like to point fingers and belittle supervisors when things went wrong.  Plant management, QA manager and BU leaders were a joke.  The only enjoyable part was working with the people on the floor and the other supervisors and leads.  Also no work and life balance.  Worked 12 days on and two off plus 12 hour shifts when needed.  It was worse for the hourly people.  Milton Hershey must be rolling in his grave."
bad,"Pros: Can work as many hours as you want i.e. lots of overtime pay, great benefits, good pay once off trainee status"
bad,"This plant is awful. You get your schedule on a Wednesday and by Thursday morning it is different, or they tell you Wednesday that you are working Friday or the whole weekend and then it is 2 days or more before the next one comes out. The management here is AWFUL. It is a bunch of people ( including the plant manager) that have no idea on how to better this place, all they care about is how much money they cn make and how much product we can put out, they don't care if that means you are gunna be here for 14 days in a row or not ( by the way 14 days or more in a row HAPPENS ALOT HERE IN THE ROBINSON PLANT). The money for the work you do is great and the benefits you get here are also great, but there is NO WORK OR HOME LIFE BALANCE. They tell you SOME overtime is required, that's a lie it is mostly 12 hour shifts depending on where you end up. The point system is a JOKE here. This plant is like a GIANT HIGH SCHOOL. People are RUDE and BULLY everyone, and when you try to do something about it you pretty much get told you have to deal with it because they are TOO SHORT HANDED TO FIRE ANYONE!!!!  If you enjoy money and no time to spend it then this is the job for you, but if you have children ( especially little ones) or plan on having children I would look somewhere else for a job."
bad,"Have their workers working way to much never really have time off to see their kids won't change over time from mandatory to optional, not very many chances to advance and not high enough pay for how many hours they are making their workers work"
bad,"There is a post from 2017 here saying the same thing I experienced. I never thought to research Hershey before my wife went to work there.The end to our marriage."
bad,"The job itself is not hard or bad. It is good pay. However, things there have gotten horrible. Management no longer cares about us employees. They are working us almost every day. We are so short handed due to firing and people quitting, and they are not hiring anyone to replace the ones who we lost. So that means most people are on 12 hour shifts. We practically live there. If you want a day off and want to use your vacation, well good luck getting it approved, HR is not on our side. My advice, run the other way."
bad,"The average day of wok at Hershey's includes getting up at 5:15 in the morning to be at your first store by 7 at the latest. We have iPads that track everything from your store check in time to the sales of the stores. We would deal with the management of retailers to get the product's presence as maximized as possible and help getting product out of the backroom. You learn a lot about retail and the industry, as well as how each different store works with their particular market. The other members of the sales team are what I enjoyed about the job. The team was very motivated and very willing to go out of their way and help in every way. Some of the aspects of the job that weren't very enjoyable were the long hours especially in the busy seasons (Valentines, Easter, Halloween, Christmas) and the physicality factor of heavy lifting. Most of the job was very autonomous and solo, with the exception of dealing with management in the beginning of the store visit. Although we met with the team about once a month, it would have been nice if there was more opportunities to collaborate with the team."
bad,It was a place to work. They are not the same company that they use to be. Employees were required to work long hours and many worked 7 days a weeks for weeks on end.
bad,"Come in, do stretches, get your order forms and drive the pallet jacks to fill the orders. Learned how to drive the pallet jack. The management was very disorganized and unfair and the coworkers were often quite disrespectful. The hardest part of the job was the unfairness and the best part was that I liked driving the pallet jack."
bad,Great people all willing to teach and help you learn what it takes to be successful. Ability to practice in all skills of business and be entrepreneurial.
bad,"packed candy into the boxes for shipping, watch the lines, and put the caps on the candy"
bad,"Great place to work,helpful management,no work load ,good work life balance , limited scope to impliment your ideas , good pay, paid holidays, like working here"
bad,"Ambiente de Trabajo  era diferente en cada area de trabajo ya que ahy buenos lideres y otros no tan buenos que les entregaban la gente y no les decian que hacer."
bad,"empresa boa, mas sem muita organização."
bad,"I loved my years at Hershey. It was a great company, Great bosses."
good,"Aprendí a realizar inventarios a gran escala."
good,The management at this place is downright pitiful. From the plant manager all the way down to the team leaders not one is qualified to do their job. This makes for a very stressful workplace most hourly employees are there only to get a check and can't wait to leave. Most hourly employees are actively looking for other jobs
good,"Pude aprender muito nesse tempo em que trabalhei nessa empresa,como Lançar requisições, desenvolver planilhas para conferência de inventários,e inclusive ter interação com Microsiga."
good,"it was a great working environment but management was a bit out of it."
good,"No two days are ever the same. Independence. A lot of driving. Convenient chain stores so sketchy neighborhoods. A lot of driving, and merchandising. You have a new supervisor every two years."
good,I enjoyed the first few months at this company. The hours were long and the company was demanding. Overtime was always an option. Mandatory and voluntary.
good,"The environment is amazing, everyone is friendly and I've made some great friends. But, as a college student who has to pay their own way, getting paid $8.25 to start with .25 increases every year, it's not a sustaining job. It's really the environment that keeps people around because it's so amazing. Definitely a great start for high schoolers."
good,"El area de cadena de suministro está conformada por gerentes que no trabajan en equipo, ven por sus intereses personales antes de los de la compañía y llevan una agenda propia lo que ocasiona un ambiente laboral muy desagradable aunque por encimita parezca que hay armonía. La administración se lleva con un mínimo de recursos, lo que hace imposible operar en un ambiente de normalidad y estresa a todos los procesos y colaboradores.  Los jóvenes toman la empresa como un trampolín y no duran más de un año antes de moverse a otra compañía. Es una empresa recomendable para aprender y buscar otra compañía más sólida donde hacer carrera."
good,"Working at Hershey isn't bad most days, but the problem lies in directionless management.  Often times we get put in stressful situations due to our superiors being afraid to make a decision."
good,"A typical day began with setting up the ice cream shop with all the coffee, toppings, and ice cream. "
good,A Hersheys é uma empresa muito boa para trabalhar.
good,"The Territory was called Richmond/Rosenberg."
good,it was a fun place to work at always busy but the people i worked with was verry posative and made me want to go back . i loved that i always had somthing to do and tey let u eat all the candy you want .
good,"This would be a great place to work if it weren't for the people who treat others poorly. The lack of management intervention in such cases is intolerable."
good,Innteraction with internal and external customers.  Contract negotations.  Inventory management. Supervision of subordanates.  Just in Time purchasing
good,"If you like to work a lot of hours, including weekend a don't have a big family or other commitments than this I the job for you. Pays well and has fairly nice benefits."
good,The time I spent at Hershey Chocolate World was not wasted. I learned many things about myself. Right after we would clock in we had a meeting before our shift. It was a summary of how we were doing with sales and customer service. Although our manager were hard to get along with since we had three different ones in a short span of time we all still worked as a team and had fun at the same time. I loved the look on a customers face when they found what they needed or I would help them get a deal. It was a very rewarding job.
good,"Overall, I would recommend this job to someone who doesn't mind traveling a lot. It's a very large territory and honestly, too much for one person to cover. Management wise, there was a transition shortly after I started and I didn't have a manager for 3 months. This was at the very beginning of my job and I felt like I didn't receive enough training before the management transition. Once a new manager was hired I felt like he wasn't very invested or cared about me or my territory. Job is designed for someone who doesn't mind traveling and who also doesn't mind working early mornings and late nights during holidays. Pay is competitive along with benefits, but in my opinion not worth it when it comes to job stress."
good,"Belle entreprise avec salaire et avantages sociaux très avantageux.  Malheureusement, la façon dont la compagnie est géré laisse à désirer"
good,"I loved my job. My coworkers were great and the guests were awesome as well. The only thing bad about this company is management and communication. No one talks to anyone so it's a mess half he time. Other than that, it was a great job."
good,"My specific work was very boring"
good,It was great when I started in 1990. Family oriented and fun but now as an employee for 28.5 years I was just a number and they could care less about the employees.
good,"El área de cadena de suministro está ""gobernada"" ir un grupo de gente que no da buenos resultados pero que son los favoritos de la cabeza. No hay presupuesto para nada, trabajas con lo mínimo y siempre piden más ahorros. No hay reconocimiento a un buen trabajo a menos que seas del grupo selecto. Hay muchísima rotación por estos vicios."
good,"Compensation used to be really good until they changed pay scale back in 2008. Use to get holidays off as well, now there's no guarantee of that. This company has gotten greedy and doesn't care about it's employees, the only thing that they care about is producing non stop. They keep taking away and not giving back. Here's a idea treat your employees better and give them time off to spend with there families."
good,"It was nice, the people were great.  Things changed with each reorganization.  I enjoyed the work and the people.  Was able to do some charitable things."
good,Good company but doesn't pay employees very well. Great part time job for someone who just wants to supplement their income. Products are highly recognized and easy to sell.
good,"Una empresa que tiene buena cultura de calidad y valores pero no todos se cumplen, los líderes de producción involucran asuntos personales con el trabajo y aprovechan su puesto para tomar represalias. Difícil promoción y crecimiento, pues todo se maneja de manera temporal desde plantas hasta categorías, para subir de sueldo tienes que ser amigo de los jefes. A pesar de ser una empresa internacional y reconocida, no reparten utilidades."
good,"en el tiempo que yo estuve , fue un tiempo de cambios de lo antiguo a lo nuevo , yo venia revolucionado de la carrera cosa que no entendieron los antiguos , la empresa es muy buena y se vio el cambio ya que salieron los antiguos"
good,Hard work good beneftit. It slow there right now. Cutting hours and people. There normally a good place to work but alot of new head people are in charge and changing things
good,You can expect steady and stable employment in a lower cost of living area.  Recent voluntary separation programs have the work/life balance out of kilter (because a lot of people left).
good,lo  q no me gusto q te prometian aumento de sueldo a cambio de q explotaras mas a la gente q trabajara para sacar mas produciion si no lo sacaban hasta no dejaban ir a la gente al comedor..muchas apollaban pero con el tiempo en base de esfuerzo de mas se lecionaban los brazos y antes de q dijeran algo las despedian yo en lo personal aprendi a convivir con la gente saber trabajar en equipo porq todos somos equipo aprendi en general a q con consistencia y mucha atencion aprendy a manejar maquinas porq ami no me enseñaron me enseñe viendo y lograr mi objetivo de operar las maquinas a mi me encantaba mi trabajo lo q no me gusto fue como tratan a la gente y q cuando yo me leccione no me dejaban ir al seguro me atendian ellos y asi lastimada me exigian q trabajara cual tenia q tener reposo solo se inchaba mi mano...
good,"Overall Hershey is a good company to work for.  I have had best in class sales education and have worked with some of the best managers and salesmen in the industry.  I enjoy my team and have learned a lot about being a team lead and assisting in on the job training.  The hardest part of the job is also my most enjoyable and that is overcoming ""The No"".  I like to overcome challenges and show successful results."
good,Not a family friendly place to work if you have a mere 15 years of service.  
good,"mi trabajo me gustaba mucho la mayoria del tiempo tenia mi lugar al cual llegar me gustaba mucho envolver el chocolate y cuando no trabajaba mi maquina nos mandaban a otras areas lo cual es bueno porque aprendes mas y agarras experiencia para todo, los supervisores son buenos en general pero como en todo hay algunos q tienen mas experiencia q los demas, me hubiera gustado q a la gente q es temporal le den mas oportunidad de crecer pero hay mas preferencia con la gente permenente"
good,"most days work is routinely done, unless there is a course to be taken,"
good,The leadership team needs improvement. They don't value there employees. The employees that grew with the company gets looked over for promotions and they bring in people for the outside
good,this Hershey was not affiliated with the Hershey brand at the time of my employment they wouldn't give raises and they wanted me to work position I was not hired for
good,You will gain lots of experience but job is very stressful.  Comparable to other companies with a Global Shared Services Department they are far behind the competition.
good,"company is great for someone just out of college as a starting job with a fortune 500 company to help build resume.   No true opportunities for promotions. It's based on who you know- nepotism is common. If your DM likes you and you can kiss butt, you will get promoted"
good,"La comida es muy mala, no hay oportunidad de crecimiento, tienes que ser amiguito de algun lider o jefe para que te puedan dar algum tipo de ascenso, te ponen infinidad de trabajas para darte una categoria, ambiente laboral tenso, siempre trabajam bajo presion, entras como eventual y solo el 20% de las contrataciones del año se quedan, y de ese 20% solo al 5% les dan planta antes de que uno se salga, los supervisores no les toman importancia a sus trabajadores a pesar de lo que dicen, ponen a cualquier persona de lider de grupo, para cambiarte de area tienes que pasar por quien sabe cuantas fregaderas, aparte de que el supervisor del area del cul te quieres salir tiene que estar de acuerdo, cuando no hay suficientes empleados te cargan el trabajo de 2 o hasta 3 personas sin siquiera darte las gracias"
good,"There is no room for advancement at this company unless you know someone real well. The only enjoyment I had working here were the people that I worked with. I loved every one of my teammates, if it were not for them I would not have liked what I did. I am still heartbroken that I was made to leave because my job ended. Management does not see anything but numbers."
good,"Los gerentes muy malos, no muy buen liderazgo último año ambiente de trabajo no es bueno, rotación de personal medio y no valoran a buenos elementos si no eres amigo del jefe los salarios son muy bajos y prestaciones que dan cualquier empresa te lo da así que si no mejoran se va a pique esta empresa en mexico"
good,Overall the company was a fun company to work for the only thing that I didn't like about the company was management and the way that they treat their employees but I will say it I had the opportunity to go back I would if they have new management in place.
good,"all customer service with very little likelihood of advancement"
good,"I would like to discuss this position in an interview. Great company with poor management and no room to grow. I am looking for a career, not a job. I feel here, with the overwhelming turnover its not a place for growth. I have learned so much in my short time here and will help me be a leader moving forward."
good,Très mauvaise place où travailler...  Aucune place à l'avancement pour les employés.
good,"Their not much work but the management is a tough, he will judge you no matter what. I kid you not, not a lot of people last there"
good,Typical day at work included entering piles of information into the computer program according to the account information. The hardest part of my job was sitting entering the same information everyday without a potential to grow.
good,Lo mas dificil trabajar 12hras continuas. Respecto a lo demas todo es muy facil de aprender.
good,I have enjoyed working here even though it is very fast paced in the department I work in. I have learned how to adapt better to constant change on the spur of the moment. The people I work with are good people and we work together and try to get things done. Hardest part of the job sometimes for me is working the graveyard sift sometimes but I've done it for years so I just deal with it. Most enjoyable is getting along with the people I work with.
good,"Plan on living there. Work week consists of 7 days a week and 16 hour days. Good pay, no life. Health benefits suck! My job was cut due to corporate greed! Good luck!"
good,"Working environment good, but sometimes no job and who's part time worker cannot come to work, only selected will come to work as usual, rest time to short,"
good,Can be a better place if complaints were taken more seriously. If shift changes weren’t so constant and if supervisors were professional and qualified on each line as as packer or moulder so they also knew how to manage and supervise if there was an issue instead of just barking orders.
good,The location of the store makes it so that there are constant customers and tourists walking in and out of the store at every minute. This creates some stress as the store is constantly busy. Overall workplace culture was good and I learned a few things.
good,"You have no life, so if you have one now forget about them. It is great money though. So it might feel worth it at times. So it’s up to you how you want to spend your life."
good,"The management and co-workers were always friendly, but the customer service environment was not pleasant and was extremely stressful. You'll frequently work past 11 PM in the summer, and have to work holidays too."
good,"my days at hershey were busy and productive especially holidays"
good,The food service department is fast paced for little pay as one of several food areas brings in thousands of dollars on a slow day you begin to wonder if you really want to work here.
good,Great company. Initial Manager was outstanding. Cost saving opportunities led to dramatic reduction in Account Representatives. I still think that Hershey's is a good place to work.
good,"I really love working with some of the people I work with, but the company itself just does not care about it's employees. They refuse to raise wages for more laborious jobs and then complain about under-staffing, when gas station attendants get at least $10/hr and you have to work 3-4 years before you touch that."
good,The production facilities have a terrible work life balance.  Many production lines are seven days a week and overtime is required.
good,"Typical day was logging waste and write-offs and generating reports. It's pretty rare for anyone to get full time hours and benefits are practically nonexistent, aside from the discount."
good,ok management and the product was fun to sell but there is a ton of pressure to perform. Prices of products keep rising making it a challenge to sell.
good,"Un día típico: colocar el producto dentro de cajas que hay que armar y estibar las cajas llenas del producto en tarimas, "
good,"While I worked for the company it gave the opportunity to learn new things."
good,strong disconnect between departments. Currently undergoing internal restructure. Great people although high turnover in some departments such as marketing.
good,"Typical security job. working multiple venues and many hours. Bag checks, checkpoints and helping patrons in the park and stadiums"
good,"Typical day includes early mornings and long commutes. You spend most of the day alone, unless accompanied by boss or higher up co-worker. Use analyzed store statistics to promote more buying of product, or use in securing a secondary location in store for more product. Stock shelves of product to ensure movement. Record all contacts made within the store and spend several hours a night updating folders and preparing for next day sales calls."
good,"A typical day at Hershey is fast pace non-stop.It is a unfriendly environment and very stressful. The majority of the co-workers are old and about to retire. There is a lot of fighting and bickering all of the time with co-workers. The management is no better. There is a lot of favoritism ,and crooked things that go on with management. I would not recommend that anybody work there. The best part about the job is staying focused on your task and overcoming all the mess that goes on around you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the mess around you."
good,empresa boa para se trabalhar mas tinha muito preconceito muito escolha de funcionario para puxar saco
good,maintain production line to attain the production goals for the day
good,The people that work there are awesome. The boss is very laid back and out on the road most of the time so your usually running the office most of the time which is cool. Your able to go online and do whatever while you wait for customer call backs. There is no room for advancement though. The office consists of 1 office manager and two girls on the phones. Thats it.
good,Buenas personas para trabajar. Mucha diversión y compañerismo.
good,The 401k is profitable.  Opportunity to learn new things.  Company marketing is strong and adds business to facilities and market share.  Very busy factory.
good,"disponibilidad para atender dudas, así como apoyo para las mismas"
good,"The company is a good place to start ones career. Long term employment depends on the department and manager, The supply chain department seemed to be progressive, however, the finance department was resistant to change. Very stingy vacation policy."
good,I work in retail and our season of busy time is generally about 9 months of the year at chocolate world busy time is from may til December as we are also the welcome center for Hershey park so it can be very busy either we are generally straightening up the floor ringing on register putting returns away answering questions for our guests display changes helping guests who need to ship their items purchased or bag checking the items purchased for pick up later in the day so they don't have  to carry them with them
good,"It was a great place to work too bad I was so young at the time and didnt appreciate my fortune. Hard work for a honest pay, my time there was pleasant most of the time lots of laughs with coworkers.Management seemed willing to work with you and were always available to listen to any concerns."
good,Enjoyed the diversity of work options and projects. Best benefit was the free bite size chocolate samples in every conference room.  You get used to it and change to a more healthy lifestyle which is highly encouraged.
good,"Not bad, good company name. Don't stay for too long. It'll hurt your soul. Trying to create the best atmosphere for guests and being punished for doing so. Managers need to be re-evaluated."
good,"NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. Very rude, there is no upward mobility, the pay was terrible, and they offer no benefits for part time employees. I do not recommend working here,"
good,i enjoyed going to work and doing my job.   I love working with some people. The company paid their employee right and they also give  good benefits to their employee.
good,"i learned to be a team player, the management was great, i was a hard worker never had hard day at work and i loved the people i worked around.Everyday was joy to me just by working with my assembly crew"
good,"Good long term vision, but is overshadowed by short term fiscally driven decisions.  This is causing good talent to leave.  Touting diversity of thought and smart risk taking, but most leaders are afraid to stick their neck out and make a decision."
good,"their giving job scope just not like they promised before i start working, and still promised until now but nothing. and to many side job and not relate with my expertise"
good,It was not really a job for me. We either had a lot to do or there was a lot of down time. I like to be moving. When another job came along I took that position and left the Hershey Company
good,"Had a nice time working for Hershey but economic downturn changed retail environment and robust work in stores seemed to become pointless, couldn't buy as much product as the did in previous years."
good,"- Good company overall with estabolished brands and market. "
good,"This franchise generally has a warm and cozy atmosphere. One of the main priorities is customer service, this company will teach you how to be a personable seller."
good,"Llegar al área asignada y ver la producción que se tiene que hacer."
good,too much responsibility for the pay. on call 24/7 would have to go into work at 0300 on a day off just to fill a shift for 2 hours. The hardest part of the job is probably working with the upper management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship with the employees.
good,"Good place to work. Good people and good work ethics. "
good,"ótimo ambiente,ótima gerencia. único ponto negativo é o abuso moral."
good,"I've been working at Hershey's Chocolate World in the 4D show for over three years now and while the job itself is decent, I don't want to make a career out of it and would like to move on to better opportunities.  While I grew as an employee in my first couple of years, I no longer feel challenged as the job is almost mindless at this point with minimal guest interaction.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the few times I did get to connect to the guests. It was also the hardest part of the job, but being kept on my toes and being challenged was what made it enjoyable.  The rotating schedule was nice too, so that we were doing different things throughout the day. Management is poor.  New employees have been added at the beginning of every season for every year that I've worked here, but no employees have left.  As a result employee hours are split and it is hard to get shifts most weeks.  Furthermore there are several employees I feel should have been let go a long time ago, but are still being given hours despite not pulling their weight or making other employees uncomfortable.  Overall the job itself is a nice temporary summer job, with emphasis on the temporary."
good,"El ambiente en The Hershey Company es de gente joven comprometida con su carrera y el crecimiento de la empresa."
good,"Not much room for advancement, management did not back you up.  Co-workers were great, management was all over  the place.  Hardest part off the job was trying to shorten timelines for launching new products.  Best part was work life balance."
good,"respetar rool de visitas llegar con los Jefes de departamento saludar reportar mi llegada pasar al anaquel revisar que me hacia falta ir ala bodega a checar que mercancia tenia empesar con la limpieza el acomodo y resurtido iva checando caducidades para realisar la rotacion del producto asi en cada departemento. ya que llebabamos4 departamentos,abarrotes,lacteos,dulceria,y chek out .Lo mas dificil en algunas tiendas era tratar o negociar con los diferentes Gerentes.lo que mas me gusto de este empleo fue la confianza,el que nos premiaran y reconocieran  por realizar bien nuestro trabajo."
good,"field side of the job"
good,"Did PM's, responded to calls from production to fix broken candy processing equipment."
good,"Shut down store, but was okay to work fun. Nothing too exciting ever happened and work tended to be slow"
good,"come in get settle clock in at required time. head to work area talk with co workers till machine was turned on rotate every half hour break every hour and a half. "
good,era de llegar y empezar a trabajar bueno por mi parte era preparando producto para consumo(dulces) era mucho desgaste fisico pero agradable por que era un responsabilidad muy grande y ponias a prueba todos tus sentidos para q las cosas te salieran bien y no tubieras ningun error para que ubiese problemas con los consumidores la relacion con mis compañeros era bien agradable la parte mas dificil es que se dieran cuenta de lo que tu como persona aportabas para la empresa el compromiso y el nivel de trabajo y la forma de trajo
good,"aprendí muchas cosas como trabajar en equipo,"
good,great place to work for a teenager just starting out hours are short during the winter months 
good,"Direct Selling calling on 3 customers."
good,"At Hershey it is easy work but you have to have the speed to be able to pack ice cream into a box, put the required item in the box, tape it, and send it down a conveyor belt, and open a new box all before the other person across from you gets done. It is a decent job. The management is not to bad but they could be nicer. It is a strictish environment. The co-workers love ruors and drama but overall they are pretty good people to work with."
good,"Typical day driving truck out on route to fill Hershey customers with their orders, perform maintenance on equipment, delivery product, collecting money and processing paperwork."
good,"was a good place to work, low paying job, but the people were great"
good,a typical night at work revolved around performing routine maintenance and breakdown maintenance on the machinery. I learned about maintenance scheduling and work flow from production needs.
good,"I was lucky working with 3 very nice managers, director.  They inspired me to challenge and push myself for great achievement.  We made great teams.  The hardest part of the job was when we did year-end closing I had worked hard and long hours through Christmas, New Year quite a few year.   I missed spending Holidays with my family !   "
good,"working on an assembly line packing and shipping items. Counting making sure every item is accounted for , ensuring packaging and labeling is correct as well as neatness"
good,"En si el empleo y el sueldo muy bien, el gerente muy amable y atento, el ambiente laboral estupendo y las compañeras siempre al pendiente de darte consejos para que tengas un excelente día de trabajo. "
good,Hershey is going through a lot of changes right now and is a bit difficult to describe.  It really depends on what area you want to work in.  Still proud to be a part of the company.  Supply Chain has great leaders and is a good area to be part of.
good,"The office atmosphere is fun and inviting. Decent cafeteria, fitness center, outdoor seating for lunch. The rest of my review would be very dependent upon the manager you get. Work/life balance is not there unless your manager is on board. Previously worked at other Fortune 500 CPG companies with better balance and benefits especially related to families."
good,"Despues de que te contratan no saben si vas para Spicy o para Chocolate y si te lo dicen, te lo dicen al mes con 2 semanas."
good,"The pay is wonderful but Hershey does not have a union. The motto is ""One Hershey"" but that's a lie! The best thing about this location is the pay & 401k."
good,"- more manual labor than expected"
good,"Exactly what the title says just read the title, I only dislike that there is no room to advance my career. When you do have a chance too it has hardly any worthwhile benefits"
good,"Working at the Hershey Center was very convenient for me because of its job availability, where I can say which days I am free to work which helped me throughout school. It's a nice workplace with friendly co-workers"
good,"This job is as fun as you make it. It was great meeting people from all different places. I wish there had been advancement in the position. That was not explained to me, I learned of it at the first meeting. Regardless, great hours, and nice co-workers. Management changes often."
good,"I enjoyed the work entrusted me while employed with Hershey.  It was challenging and necessary.  Employee personalities did not always vibe, but for the most part the work environment was a comfortable one."
good,I learned a lot about the ice cream business from a supplier point of view. The management was very helpful when it came to evaluating the customers needs. The hardest part was convincing customers why they should put our ice cream in there establishments. Customers interaction was the focal point of the whole job
good,Overall great benefits compared to a lot.  Management seems to have less and less concern for their employees.  Bottom line is very important and it is evident.  Probably not going to get away from this wherever you go.
good,"Must be prepared to understand politics can sometime be more important than production. The culture is fantastic, however 80% of KPIs are subjective, so hard metrics are hard to find which ultimately affects your yearly raiting."
good,"No te liquidan cada vez que te renuevan el contrato, duran hasta un año renovandote el.contrato cada mes"
good,Fun place to work. Get certian amount of free ice cream each month. Laid back but fast paced environment to work. Good management. Lots of interaction with different peoole throughout the day.
good,It started out pretty good but the corporate culture has changed over the years.  It used to be nice when the role was based on establishing good relationships with store management but now the focus is all about selling in contracts to stores that can't handle a lot of volume.
good,"un buen trabajo actividades basicas de trabajo, empaque de chocolates, operador de moldeo, el ambiente muy agradedable buen trato de lider y supervisor."
good,"There is no typical work day. Your Territory make up, management and your team members can make are break your experience. You will learn a lot working for this company and you can earn great job security."
good,I learned to be patient with the people around me. On a daily basis I would help passengers on and off the ride. I directed guest to get on and off the ride and assigned them a cart to get on.
good,Money to be made if you are willing to work the overtime. 8 or 12 hour days. Management at the time is lacking experience.  Many people feel they ae just a number.  The part is being mandated to work 12 hours seven days a week with a day of on your 21st day.  Making candy is pretty cool.
good,order selecting always moving reach productivity learned alot about the company a place to grow co-workers was outgoing enjoyed it overtime bonses free candy very holiday management was ok
good,"The Hershey Company as a whole is a great company and the people that work there are as well, yet some management has the mindset, that we don't have to follow the values, but want those who they lead to do so. In order to management, you have to lead by example. They have excellent benefits and salaries as well as perks."
good,A typical day would consist of work in a team on the production line. I learned how to work diffrent machines which were new to me. Management was very helpful in everyway possible.
good,Empresa mundial con grandes areas de aprendizaje y muchas presion laboral.
good,Great place to work if you don’t mind working a lot. I’d go back but I’m not aloud to for a few more months until I complete physical therapy. Great pay
good,"Gusto el laboritario "
good,Empresa estricta en el tema de seguridad y manejo de alimentos y valoracion de la seguridad y buenas practicas de manufactura
good,"Fechamento final de mês"
good,The internship program was still working out the kinks so I didn't get as much exposure to the entire business as I wanted. Otherwise good experience.
good,"fue un día de trabajo  en el cual  se tenia un problema en los equipos y se tenia que trabajar bajo presion  y para esto tienes que contar  con el apoyo de mi gente a cargo    se trabajo en equipo para solucionar el problema mas fácilmente"
good,The pay was excellent along with the benefits and advancement. The warehouse was temperature controlled and management was on top of any situation you came to them about.
good,"Aprendi bastante excel e a desenvolver minha competência cultural."
good,"Great company, recommend the role if you are interested in Sales as a career. Be willing to relocate as well. Job covers a territory of 30 stores that you are responsible for driving sales in"
good,"le salaire $19.75 de l'heure me permettais de vivre a l'aise et ne pas dépendre de personne.Coté travaille en tel c'était bien le travaille était dur physiquement la chaleur était insupportable ,disont tu travaillait pour ton argent parcontre ons avait de assez bon avantage sociaux de beau party de Noel surtout de beaux cadeaux durant l'année ."
good,"its a seasonal job and sometimes the workplace is not busy and kind be so busy during holiday and summer, the management are good and they make sure you are okay."
good,The company was awesome when I started. It has changed drastically over the years. Management became non caring and you were forced to work seven days a week all the time. They don't care about your home life or your health.
good,"Flexible scheduling.  Yearly pay increases.  Employee appreciation events to keep moral high during peak seasons.  Management keep staff updated on events happening in Hershey.  "
good,The hardest part of the job is the lack of career progression opportunities. The company has become flexible with work and personal life balance and have started allowing employees to work from home once per week.
good,Working for The Hershey Company offers the chance for entry level sales people to grow and develop their skill set to new heights.  Hershey offers continued training and holds monthly regional business meetings to demonstrate your sales call procedure.
good,"A typical day would be walking into a grocery store or Wal-Mart and look for opportunities where you could help the store produce more.  Meet with Key Decision Makers and ask them what their critical success factors are.  Inform them what I could offer them to help their bottom line."
good,Aprendí los grados de seguridad que se debe de tener ante toda situación.
good,"I planned my day, what stores to call on, making sure I had my supplies and anything I would need to do my call.  I called on at least 8 stores, depending on what was going on.  I worked independently for the most part.  Sometime I worked with another representative or my manager.  I loved working with my first two managers.  I was treated very well.  I attended meetings out of town, and this was about the only time I really had a chance to interact with the other representatives.  We all got along great.  It was a fun place to work.  The hardest part of the job is the lack of respect in a work place.  The most enjoyable part were the friends of made, my clients, co-workers, first two managers.  I worked part-time."
good,no hay muchos cambios de un dia a otro. lo mas dificil es cuando se vuelve monotono
good,Buen ambiente y diversidad de ideas que son escuchadas y valoradas para implementacion de soluciones
good,"Employed as a Merchandising Sales Associate in the rough parts of the Houston Metro Area. Which always required good situational awareness and at times poise in difficult environments. "
good,I entered the The Hershey Company as happiest as I could be...since I was a chocolate lover after all.   I had a great career for 8 years.   I had great mentors and I was planning my career around someday going into Corporate Offices.   But that dream was not achieved since I was dismissed w/o the opportunity for me of seeking relocation to another job.   It was a shame that after 8 years the company spent preparing me to be the perfect Hershey material; they let me go.   Still appreciate all the learnings and great mentors I found in the way.   But new international management is very closed circle and if you aren't one of them; you are out.   Not so Hershey behaviors after all.
good,Beautiful workspace and great marketing/advertising seminars are held in the office. But limited options when you work here as a contractor. Contractors do not have access to everything regular employees do which sometimes makes getting the job done difficult.
good,"HE&R is working to improve the ""human element"" but compensation and advancement opportunities are a little lacking. Classes and continued education with an emphasis on the company culture and history are mandatory.  There are a lot of people who work there for 25 plus years. This speaks to the positive environment.  However, it also means there are few openings."
good,Deal with managers in food accounts and walmart. Discuss promotions and seasonal items. Fill the shelves and pack out product
good,Deliver ice cream to 20-30 different locations per day. Very fast paced and very time consuming.
good,"A very entrepreneurial and autonomous working environment, a lean structure with limited resources requires everyone to get involved across all areas of the business. Decision making is very fast and doesn't require evaluation of many layers of management."
good,"The company has great morals but operates on a old mind set of diversity and how people get promoted. As in most companies, they sell you on a false hope that you will get promoted and jobs are limited. They’re not diverse enough and need to work on making the job fun with all types of people."
good,"I retired after 45 yrs, with a early separation buyout. The company was becoming more politically correct. The hard working were carrying the slouching.All that mattered was bottom line numbers."
good,"The department I worked in had a lot of potential to be great - but everyone was still a little bitter about a recent management change, so there was a lot of animosity towards the new head honcho, which caused employees in the department to be neglected. The company as a whole really cared about their employees, though, and they made sure to recognize people from all departments. I would definitely recommend this as a great place to work overall."
good,Fun and friendly environment. Very very fast paced. Management very uplifting and motivational. Very understanding . Great for someone who is currently in school
good,It was a pretty easy job with not alot of ways to screw up. The people there are great to work with and talk too. I made many friends while i was there. The reason i actually ended up quitting was because most of my friends from work ended up heading back to school. The only negative part of the job is that sometimes it can get very boring just walking the entire shift.
good,I like working for Hershey company through System one  as  the a temp. but they don't like hiring outside  the company they do take pride in getting new product out in other country
good,"Gran aprendizaje del negocio administrativo, la compañía mantiene un legado que el personal continua"
good,"Covering large areas makes things difficult, and there is a great deal of freedom to do things our way. So it is important to be self motivated, and always working, or this job will bury you fast"
good,Great place to work if you have money on your mind but if you have a family....forget them...Hershey is your life and your coworkers are your new family. Constant almost every day inversion.  Job stability isn't the best either. Management (some)  treat you like you are nothing (so much for being on the same team.)
good,good place to work. hard to get on fulltime. friendly management. overall if you dont mind working for minimum wage this is the place to work
good,"Diagnose and resolve issues concerning the following over the phone, in person, and over remote access."
good,Good Company when it was still making chocolate.  Now not so good.
good,Good place to work I had No problems with the company. Honestly it was me everyone there was friendly I worked and went home happy . Best Job I ever had.
good,Sorry I have nothing good to say about them at this moment because it's been quite awhile ago sence I've worked there but I can say that I was there for about 11 years on and off.
good,"Alright place to work, but poor work life balance. Little room for advancement in maintenance and dishonest hiring practices certainly didn't help. best part, well air conditioned."
good,"*Typical day includes overseeing 30 - 40 people"
good,"Bom relacionamento diário de trabalho, a cada dia um novo desafio, metas diária a serem cumpridas, normas do "" 5 S"" implantadas, BPF (Boas Praticas de Fabricação) ."
good,Its the best place I ever worked. The work is steady a lot of overtime. You see the plant managers and bosses actually helping out. They pay amazing and is a union.
good,"Hershey is a great company. The job of merchandising involves a lot more sales and tons of displays. I owned a Mustang when I started, had to trade it for an SUV to accommodate all the supplies and inventory they sent me."
good,"A typical work day at Hershey is usually busy and upbeat.  Being upbeat friendly and kind, it is always a pleasure to meet the different contractors vendors and regular employees each day. Each day is enjoyable at Hershey's."
good,Tiered management structure allows for employees to progress and move up within the company. Provides opportunities to work directly with consumers for immediate feedback and input.
good,Big company but has good pay and excellent benefits. Good working environment. Lots of overtime if desired. Friendly coworkers. Good training for all jobs.
good,"At Hershey, I enjoy such perks as a casual dress policy, a flex work policy, and a generous military leave policy."
good,It depends on the season and day. I learned how to operate different areas of food service. Management was good overall but slow on recognizing patterns. My co-workers were brilliant. The hardest part of the job would be picking up trays from the dining rea and the piles of dishes that would accumulate. The people there was most enjoyable.
good,"It has been an overall positive experience working for System One,  at the Hershey Company.  The job itself is enjoyable and we get paid fairly , but it is hard not having any paid time off. While most of the actual Hershey employees are wonderful hard working people, some of them go out of their way to belittle/make the job more difficult the contractors that are working there beside them."
good,"good employer to work for , good people. good work atmosphere."
good,"great place to work, but as cost cutting happens the organization has shrunk significantly in the last 10 years."
good,Great pay but mandatory overtime. During the week and weekends. Hot and cold working environments at the Reese plant. Some language barriers between employees.
good,"The Hershey Company is a solid company, with an eye on growth and the future.  It's chocolate.  Who doesn't love chocolate?"
good,"Challenging environment and business to handle."
good,good company with strong community involvement and culture - Project Fellowship very good program which allows employee involvement - HR has deficiency issues and needs to be looked at
good,"I went into work and did what ever was needed         "
good,Me gustaria que todos trabajemos al parejo. No es justo que unos trabajen menos y ganen mas que uno. Uno que tiene mas estudios merece mas oportunidades.
good,The culture is not open or inclusive unfortuntaly.  They do provide opportunities for trainning which is a great plus
good,An excellet job with great benefits and pay. Was working up to a relief supervisor position until the plant closed.
good,The company 401k match was very competitive. Health benefits were very good as well. There can be long weeks as it is not uncommon for operators or supervisors to work 7 days/week. Work life balance can be tough depending on your role.
good,Good company learning is there but not got exposed but due to Managment mistake I came out of the company it's bad part of the that but overall good to be working like this company.
good,Great place to work. Good culture and work/life balance. A place where I would consider staying for the long term. The company also has a great mission.
good,"Long hours, easy work, good pay.  People are friendly, standards are high.  Once your in don't leave you will not find a better paying job.  multiple work environments, warm 90 degrees or cool 50 degrees"
good,"its not a bad place to work, the ice-cream is good and she rakes in a fair amount of customers. There is a lot of people usually around even times, but otherwise the work flow is not as busy."
good,"Well respected ethical, mission driven organization with strong consumer connection and brand equity.  A great organization to work, grow and develop with many opportunities to advance professionally."
good,The people only want to move up and will do whatever it takes to do it. They are two-faced and cut throat. Working 12 hrs 6:30pm till 6:30 am leaves no Time to either sleep or do anything. You will have no social life and getting a day shift is pretty much impossible. The company is a union so once your in you are pushed to the bottom to be bossed around and pushed to your limit. The pay is great though.
good,a typical night at HERSHEY would be a learning exspereings sometimes be cause you would be moved to a nother line to run a  machine or taute how to run a different machine as a fulltime employeeso as a fulltime employee you are always learning about new thing in the plant.a great job opportunity .
good,"Enjoyed the dynamic environment and challenging, competitive atmosphere. Very supportive of work life balance and excellent marketing emphasis on the brand."
good,"Non-union plant. No enforced overtime. Uniforms and cleaning service provided free of charge. Crompany discounts on products. Personal lockers and shower facilities provided on site. In plant cafeteria providing meals on all shifts.  "
good,It is alright. I have been there a long time. I like being busy so this is a good place. VERY FLEXIBLE AVAILABILITY!!! I do not work while in classes (only have to work at least once every four months). Overall great place.
good,I enjoy my job at the Hershey company which is why I have been here as long as I have. I would say like any other job it has its issues but my colleagues are great and I enjoy being there while I work. I like that it is fast paced and always changing.
good,"El trabajo no es nada pesado, es muy facil pero la verdad eso de rolar turno cada semana cuando te meten a grupo no es nada agradable ya que te tocara trabajar sabado y domingo por la tarde. se aprende mucho a tener cuidado y que seas reponsable ya que te asignan un area."
good,"The people truly create the culture here at Hershey fostering a collaborative, learning, and evolutionary environment. I would definitely recommend people interested in developing a career and owning their business to work here."
good,"I loved getting paid to have fun, and making guests happy. I also liked being part of a brand that I enjoyed, and that was well known and liked by the public."
good,A typical day was asking previous shift about any problems/issues with machines then getting set up with supplies to last throughout the shift....Start up machines and monitor accordingly... Diagnos issues with machines and make any adjustments possible or call in Mechanic. Re-work blow-off product.
good,Overtime and job security are a con.  Like the benefits and holidays and the fact it's salary. Overall good position and like the company itself. People are good to work with.
good,Good place to make money if you plan on staying in the surrounding area not many more jobs where you can make more.  Not a good job if you have extra curricular activities outside of work.
good,"My job here was I was an actor in the Chocolate Tasting Experience. It's another paid attraction at Hershey Chocolate World. I learned all about chocolate, customer service skills, memorization and public speaking."
good,"Bueno ambiente de trabajo, con una jornada laboral de 8 horas, la parte difícil era que no te podías dedicar al 100% en tu marca ya que en el establecimiento que prestabas el servicio no lo permite, me gustaba el estar acomodando todo el producto de la marca aprendi a cuadrar muebles y al acomodo correcto de la mercancía"
good,"I pretty much worked with supervisors and my co worker.  I had schedules to produce for the week.  I worked at my own pace.  I had my own routine.  I attended meetings.  I worked with numerous schedule changes   I had to put in employees time management.  I do believe that Hershey's management team needs a lot of work.  As far as my co workers I loved them and their support was great.  I enjoyed working days and working at my own pace without someone standing over me.  I feel like my job was important, even though the support wasn't there when needed."
good,Fun place to work with supportive management.You get the training to learn all the aspects of the job.this is expected of a big company.You get the help from your co-workers.
good,"Hershey has a very complex business, and each department is responsible for their own part. They are also responsible for understand all the other parts. This leads to a lot of mis-communications between departments. People easily become frustrated when their messages don't link up"
good,if you work for this company and want to advance you can't.  they don't promote with in if you are a part time person.  they treat the part timers like they are second class and they are the one that make the most money for the company.  the management turns over every three years so the part timers if they decide to stay on a average in five years will have 2-3 different bosses.  you have to adapt to constant change.
good,"Uma empresa bem organizada , limpa com tudo certo dentro dos padroes de uma empresa de alimentos"
good,"Even though I was easily the youngest person on staff none of my co-workers treated me that way, always nice and management tolerated no less."
good,"good place to work, great pay, good benefits and good values"
good,"Ive been employed by HE&R twice now and, who knows might be a third down the road. You can start as early as 14 always looking for people year round. Lots of different departments so if you dont enjoy what you're currently doing talk to your soup and they should help."
good,"Lots of freedom to create schedule and workflow process, yet receiving adequate support. 401K benefit good, but houly pay on the low side for what the job required."
good,"I worked 85 days in a row not with one day off, most of them was 10 or more hours a day. At one time Hershey hired there own Hershey temps. I really loved my job, and would have stayed and  if they didnt switch to system one, and was going to shaft us and make us start all over."
good,performed scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on machinery. we worked a extreme amount of overtime average work week was 80 hours and very rarely any holidays off. The only bonus was i paid well and the health benefits were good
good,Hershey es una empresa muy amigable con su personal ya que brinda descuentos en sus productos.
good,"The Hershey Company is a great place to work but can be unnecessarily stressful, depending on the position.  It is a great place to start a career and learn how big companies work."
good,"Hershey is a good company to work for, they spare no expense to give their employees extensive training to improve their job skills.in the long run it makes the company stronger"
good,"Empresa do ramo de Chocolates,com preços competitivos"
good,enjoyed my work times in market...selling products in market. arranged marketing activities. handling distributors for upgrading product sale.my senior managers allways help me for secondary and primary
good,"Great company to work for, but many direction changes and managerial mind changes can get frustrating. Especially when they directly impact your day to day job. Great compensation, flexible work hours and travel, if you like too."
good,Good Company to work for. Has great iconinc brands that consumers love and are very loyal to. Company has made investments in broadening its portfolio and grow.
good,"I was a Senior Management Rep where I would answer phones, emails and faxes for customers wanting to place their orders for candy. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with my co-workers and customers from all over the United States on a daily basis."
good,"Since I like hockey, working at the giant center was a lot of fun. However, I was not getting many hours and the hourly pay rate was not very much considering the amount of hard work that we were doing. Benefits were not too bad, though. Overall the Giant Center is a great building but did not fit my needs."
good,overall great experience. very political and hard to move up in positions. best candy company to work for. Can be demanding at times. nice atmosphere to work in.
good,"Iconic American Corporation success story. Can be fun at times but as big as Hersheys is, your contributions go largely unnoticed. "
good,"I learned many baking techniques as well as providing for large parties and events.  I love to work in fast-paced environments and around all ages.  Working with kids was exceptional.  It really made the job enjoyable.  Over the three years I have worked there, the management changed and with that many things changed as well; which is not always bad.  I always except change.  I will say with the new manager, favoritism within the workplace was rampant.  Not necessarily according to their work or work-ethics."
good,"I enjoyed job,got to know many nice people in stores(mostly rural)"
good,"Most of the day is spent in the field with Customers. Average of 500+ milese driven per week. Talking with Key Decision Makers in stores, discussing up-coming orders to stores and often times doing heavy lifting to get candy out of store back rooms and on to the floors."
good,"I worked at one of the parlors which were privately owned. It was a lot of fun and the small business feel allowed me to learn several new work-related tasks. As long as you want a job working with people, I would recommend working at one of the parlors."
good,Very good company to work for surrounded by wonderful coworkers.
good,"There was plenty of opportunity for advancement, at The Hershey Company, Reading Plant."
good,When I first started work there in 1989 the company cared about the employees. But like most they now just care about getting product out the door.
good,Working at The Hershey Company has been a pleasure. They challange your mind and give you a variety of positions to work in.
good,Hershey Memphis is a fast paced fun place to work. Everyday brings new challenges that allows for creativity to solve and overcome unique problems. These issues will increase your leadership ability and team building skills.
good,"I worked at Hershey Entertainment as an intern in the scheduling department. It was a good job, I got promoted twice, and loved my coworkers.  The major, major drawback was hours. In the scheduling office (that scheduled for games, rides, food and beverage, and security) I would get scheduled 14-18 hour shifts on the regular. I never had any time to myself or to see my family or friends the entire summer. It is looked down upon to request shorter shifts, there was no warning. You're just thrown into insane hours. Many interns relocated from other states and they were not told what the hours would be. Yes, pay was great, but only because you're forced to work these insane hours. Also, miscommunication is absolutely the fall of the department. I can't say for other departments, but the scheduling office had absolutely no communication. It sucked."
good,"Pretty good work/life balance, benefits for part-time employees and management and work culture is friendly and engaging. They strive to be good corporate citizen."
good,I work Part-time for HE&R.  Schedule is flexible every month and management doesn't question any days that I cannot work.  Overall a great part time job.
good,"I worked part-time at Hershey's Chocolate World for a few years while I was in college. I enjoyed working there because it was a fun and friendly work environment, and people were happy most of the time because they were on vacation. It was fast-paced and kept me busy, but I was still able to take breaks throughout the day."
good,"This is a place in which you learn a lot and have great experiences. All starts very sweet but it can end very sour. Usually you don't get the whole picture because you are being lied to. They create false expectations only to fire you because you are not longer needed."
good,Excellent company to work at but expect you to work long hours and finish projects no matter the workload. A lot of chances to move up and encourage to learn new skills
good,Tiene un buen ambiente laboral con un excelente trato
good,"Hay la jente te ayuda mucho .aprendes mucho a estibar ,empacar te mandan a diferentes áreas"
good,Loved the games we played the employees and there hard work. Putting forth your best effort and keeping work appropriate conversations it’s always room for advancement
good,"Excelente empresa mucho interés en sus trabajadores, con grandes motivaciones y calidad e higiene en su planta con grandes prospectos en su producción, además de una amplia Variedad de puestos y la oportunidad de destacar en ellos, con personas llenas de valores y ética profesional en sus instalaciones"
good,"A great culture built on Milton Hershey's legacy of the Milton Hershey School to help disadvantaged children.  This is the core of the culture and inspiring on a daily basis."
good,Being a machine operator is fun and busy day goes by quick. It's a fun place to work but it is a factory so you won't get along with everyone but that's just the way factories are
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, com politicas comerciais bem definidas e excelente clima organizacional."
good,"Salario no competitivo, prestaciones acetables y mucha oportunidad de desarrollo"
good,"Union properties make it difficult for young eager employees to develop.  Many managers have worked their way up from entry level positions.  Have no other real world experience other than Hershey.  Little too no creativity, if it isn't broke don't fix it mentality."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Hershey Chocolate store, a day at the store was always a happy one, even if the day was stressful, something could always bring a smile to my face."
good,"Simple job to learn in the summer, while also offering advancement if you stuck around enough. In order to get the opportunity to advance however, you would need to work outside of summer hours and prove you're available to work most of the week. Nice flexible scheduling. Coworkers are amazing."
good,"Have benefit"
good,Good place to work in manufacturing environment.  Difficult to advance into corporate from remote plant.  Overall work life balance was good and most managers were fair.
good,"Enjoyed working with managers of stores, cutting in new products and pushing for more space for candy and mints. I have 3 managers while working for Hershey's Company and all 3 had different goals to push for in my territory.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know store managers, getting their respect so I could cut in new products with ease.  The hardest part of the job was traveling to all my 155 stores under a specific amount of route time every cycle."
good,"Food manufacturing environment; required to function in many different roles:  HR, QA, Maintenance, Finance, Planning, Scheduling, Training."
good,"Over all good place to work.    There is a wealth of knowledge available if you want to better yourself.  "
good,"running four wrapping machines by myself, nice coworkers, good benefits,  nice environment  place to work I feel so mad and sad went the company tell us they move to Mexico because they go make american chocolate in mexico and sell in USA"
good,"A typical day at work involved calling on various grocery customers to build displays, merchandise product, and sell in additional features to store management. Since this job was a retail sales job, much of the time was spent on my own but my manager was always available for calls and questions. The hardest part of the job was that I had to work 50+ hours a week and driving up to 4-5 hours a day."
good,"troca de turno."
good,"autonomous role, upward mobility only if willing to move every couple of years. good benefits"
good,"Es una compañía grandiosa, tienes diferentes actividades diarias, donde laboras en una planta de producción tienes facilidad para comunicarte y relacionarte con áreas distintas aprender y absorber mucha información.

good,"On a typical day I was either inspecting, packing or cleaning. I learned how a factory works. Management was strict and I loved my coworkers. The hardest part was how fast some machines were. I enjoyed it there. I loved that job but I was only a temp."
good,"Es una buena empresa pero en el puesto que me desempeño es un puesto que se maneja mediante una agencia me liquidan cada 3 meses, no haces antiguedad careses de muchas prestaciones."
good,"overall Hershey is a great place to work! Depending on the skills and qualifications that one possess, the opportunity for advancement is great. I have seen people get promoted as quickly as 14months. The job security here is outstanding. I have not one complaint from being employed with this company."
good,A productive workplace with great entertainment and joyful customers most of the time. Not everyday was there the most pleasant people but majority of the time there was.
good,Hershey employee's receive excellent benefits and compensation. there are multiple different shifts available to work and various types of work. there is no shortage of overtime hours to be picked up and it is an awesome opportunity to see how a fortune 500 company operates.
good,"The park was typically full & packed of guests but not always fast inside the stores. My fellow employees became my best friends during my time there & we all made it a fun place to be at. Unlike other workplaces, we were able to throw our very own department parties & get to know our co-workers better. The hardest part of the job was carrying the merchandise throughout the park to various stores. There were so many people who have traveled across the country just to come visit the park so I made sure to give them an experience that they will not forget."
good,I enjoyed my time with Hershey.  I started as a machine operator and advanced to a team lead after one year.  I was able to familiarize myself with the operations of a number of packaging machines; transportation processes; personnel and production scheduling processes; material procurement processes.
good,ccordinacion de el area de manuales metas cumplidas
good,"Pros:  Great place if you're raising a family.  Centrally located & within driving distance to Philly, DC, and NYC."
good,Usually one of the first companys to implement leading edge technology. More than 80 affordable chocolate brands started by a passionate founder in Milton Hershey.
good,"Mi trabajo es, siempre bajo presion ya que hay demasiadas unidades que monitorear, correos, llenado de bitácoras y llamadas constantes cada media hora a los operadores."
good,"Good place to work as long as you like drama!! You work all the time, 7 days a week depending on what line you work on. Saturday is time and 3/4 and Sunday is double time when those days are worked! Pay is great benifits are great but place is nothing but drama!!"
good,"Es una empresa con un excelente ambiente laboral."
good,Buenas prestaciones y se preocupan por el bienestar de los empleados
good,"While the Hershey company can be an excellent workplace, the culture has evolved away from the employee-friendly workplace it once was.  It is a difficult environment to grow in, status quo remains the order of the day."
good,es una gran empresa tiene un buen ambiete laborar y tiene buenos horarios de trabajo
good,"I like the Hershey culture because they respect your way of thinking. The office is located in a nice place of Guadalajara, there people are kind, but the daily work is sometimes monotonous."
good,"A typical day at work consist of packing boxes, interacting with and meeting new people wile working together to complete a given task"
good,Management is a pretty bad especially in food and beverage I learned alot but still upper management doesn't give you the tools to be successful.

good,Hershey is a great company to work for.  They have done a nice job retaining employees and promoting from within.  The sales organization is full of individuals who care about the company and our customers.  It is great to work with so many passionate individuals.
good,"A typical day at Hershey consisted of fast paced production lines. SIG, Bosch, and Rovema candy wrapping machines. Quality control of candy and candy wrapper seals. Oversaw the candy coming from molding, through the wrapping machine, and then the tape machine. Ensured boxes were running smoothly up conveyors. If necessary reset robotic hand packing machines. The worst part of the job was during peak season when the company could implement the 26 day rule wherein an individual could work up to 26 days in a row 12 hr shifts. One of the best things at the same time was there was so much over time and I really enjoyed paychecks that had the 16hr shift on Sunday making double time."
good,"Hershey has provided me with the tools I need to be a successful HR representative.  Having the ability to go back to school has been an experience that I am grateful for.  I would recommend The Hershey Company to anyone who is looking for a career with a sound, stable company.  Hershey will be here for many, many more years."
good,I worked in sales and merchandising. The position is part-time. The pay is fair but the flexibility is why I took the job. Hershey is very accommodating. Great for a part-time job.
good,A typical day consisted of driving 40-60 miles calling on customer accounts.
good,"A typical day is 7-4 in the field making sales calls and gaining new business. Then the day ends in my home office preparing for the next day, answering emails, printing, and reviewing analytics."
good,Would like an opportunity where there is more of a balance between home life and work.
good,Hershey provided a great environment to learn as a co-op. Gained tremendous experience with industrial equipment and process engineering. Would recommend working as a co-op for this company.
good,"Great company. If you like sales, you would love to be part of this organization."
good,"The Hershey Company is a great company. Management and coworkers are great. I live in Monroe County which I want to live, work, and pray in my county."
good,"Es una buena empresa en general, aunque en el área de mantenimiento queda un poco resagada"
good,"Working for Hershey was definitely a life changing experience, they are so nice and respectful they’ll teach you everything you need to know plus more! And the benefits of the company are unbelievable."
good,"You work from 8:30 , clocking into your first store at 9:00 am and work until 2:00 pm . You must get a least 10 -12 stores done in those 5 hours . Plan out your territory for the day within a zip code to make it most efficient . You have a quota each month for your call activity . "

good,"Empresa responsável que se preocupa com seus colaboradores, um bom ambiente de trabalho. Uma boa empresa de se trabalhar."
good,"Es una empresa que se preocupa por cumplir con estándares de calidad para todos sus productos, se preocupa porque sus empleados cumplan con el código de ética de la compañía."
good,"The hardest part of my experience at the Hershey Company was trying not to eat all of the candy.  Otherwise, I enjoyed my tenure with the Hershey Company."
good,Wish I could go back. It was a really good time. They try to make u feel like family. The pay is ok it was fare for the time. I just didn't like that o couldn't move to another shift
good,"Em um dia típico, o trabalho em equipe sempre se destacava. Aprendi que a união faz toda a diferença e que desde o chão de fábrica a gerencia, somos todos um só."
good,"In sales, there is never a typical day outside of always checking sales reports each morning to understand business trends and meeting deliverables. Management was always highly supportive of my career and aspirations to grow. The culture was a One Hershey, with an openness to collaborate. Cultural and Leadership changes have adjusted some of the above, while marketplace dynamics have been hard on the confection category.  I truly enjoyed working with so many wonderful and talented individuals."
good,Trabalhei por um pouco tempo mas foi muito agradável permanecer na mesma
good,its s great job good for a family with great salary and trying to get on your feet and have something in life. good beneifits and growth within the company.
good,"Empresa ótima para trabalhar, valorizam seu trabalho, bem como, lhe ajudam para um crescimento profissional."
good,"Una empresa de mi gusto por su ambiente laboral, el problema es rolar turnos"
good,The company has a strong CSR commitment and has been a consistent industry leader in North America. I have learned a lot about the industry and the people I've worked with. The company empowers its employees in all levels to be independent and to take accountability for our actions through having a company-shareholder mindset. Working with the company has been enjoyable but at times the stress-levels can be quite daunting as there are many instances that would require for you to work a ridiculous number of hours.
good,"-Interactuar con el personal en las modalidades de crecimiento mediante el entrenamiento y el desarrollo del personal operativo. "
good,I love my job i learn a lot there as leader as a machine operator l was on the safety team and cpr great team that I work with great supervisor to work with
good,Chocolate World was always a busy and fast paced atmosphere. It was good because it made workers work 10 times faster and cleaner to provide good feedback. Everyone listened fairly well to management and would do what they were told the first time being asked. The toughest part of the job would be that management wasn't the cleanest or the best. They were lazy and could easily manipulate the younger workers into doing their work.
good,Buena empresa con buenas prestaciones y buen ambiente laboral
good,Good company to work for. Pay was satisfactory and the work required was manageable. Supervision was fair and easy to work with. Would welcome opportunity to work for them again.
good,"Aunque mi trabajo con horarios variables, era un trabajo con las prestaciones de ley y un sueldo fijo. Sin embargo eran contrataciones por tiempo y no creabas antiguedad y cuando bajaba la producción por pedidos, lamentablemente tenían que hacer recorte de personal."
good,"aprendi a ajustar maquinas,cambiar sensores,encintar cableados,poner tornilleria faltante"
good,"Hershey´s es una buena empresa para trabajar, ya que tiene excelentes prestaciones, es flexible y el equilibrio entre trabajo/ vida personal son excelentes."
good,"Empresa multinacional con amplio conocimiento en la categoria de dulces y snacks."
good,"This is a union job.  good conditions, good salary, and good benefits.   Management is pretty descent to work with.  Certain times of the year overtime is manditory."
good,A very well organized company that gives you the tools you need to do your job and provide an excellent customer experience. Supportive of employees and very responsive. My only complaint is the local managers are sometimes reassigned from other markets and don't want to hear what your specific area is doing or needs; they have their own ideas that aren't applicable to your market and go against what the regional and VP team have laid out for the quarterly goals.
good,Working at the Hershey Company was a great experience. Everyone is welcoming and is willing to help. There is a good amount of work that needs to be done but when working with a team everything runs smoothly. The management is fantastic. I would definitely work here again and I recommend this company to everyone.
good,"Able to set your own schedule, very little pressure from management, Personnel available to assist, if needed, thorough training provided, Accounts are easy to work with."
good,Uma empresa dinâmica mas não muito agradável de trabalhar
good,The company is a good one in regards to production work that gives a strong income base. Management maintains day to day production well. Definitely a place to build a long term position with production.
good,recibir turno del compañero lider para empesar la jornada con el conocimiento de que fallas o nuevas mejoras en el en el equipo se presenten turno anterior y saber que el producto que yo obtenga en turno sea con calidad e inocuidad y mi equipo de trabajo este con su epp adecuado segun sus labores para evitar incidentes o accidentes y asi con la comunicacion direccta de mi supervisor en turno puedamos realizar un buen trabajo y buen desempeño en la produccion
good,Good Company to work and better work life balance with more productive and quality work. Can learn different areas of the IT environment there.
good,"Excellent company, excellent culture, opportunity for advancement. Representing great brands, working with great people, very competitive, but team environment."
good,"didn't learn anything new, management was good till you started to tire yourself out. it was enjoyable talking to the co-workers but difficult to finish dishes due the machine almost alway breaking down."
good,"I can utilize my experience, knowledge and skills to the best of my potential with a sole aim towards achieving organizational goal and to take up greater responsibility, and in the course learn with contributions to people and organization.I am self motivated, organized and hard working person who believes in constant gaining and learning from the experiences."
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, el trabajo esta muy facil, hay capacitacion constante, valoran mucho el valor humano,"
good,I liked the job and my fellow co workers. The reason I left was because I was on a flexible schedule. Meaning the union contract stated 8 hours between shifts. It got to the point that I didn't know. If I was coming or going. I did not have time off I worked 7 days a week for 9 months. I was exhausted. After I left the put robots in over 50 lost their jobs.
good,"Las personas que laboran en mi area son muy amabales y se cuenta  con un gran equipo de trabajo."
good,"Great place to work, the management is great and very helpful, training is always on point, memos get handed in on time, schedule is always handed out on time. Great atmosphere, the people are super layed back, but definitely on you when time comes to work."

good,I enjoyed my time there in the beginning but over time the culture changed.  typical day included walmart audits and packing out shelves.
good,I enjoyed my time with Hershey. I feel that I reinforced the skills I had learned in school and it was a supportive work environment.
good,Great people and history.  Strong desire to outperform the industry.  Limited work-life balance and career opportunities.
good,"Packaging, assembly, keeping records, and organizing is what most of a day at work consists. It is a great job just needs more work."
good,"Working and living in Hershey is great for families who want a reasonable cost of living, short commute and overall good quality of life. The company is a pillar in the community, and there are many employees who either grew up in the area, or are committed to living in Hershey for the long haul, because of the Pros mentioned above, the company's strong performance, and generous compensation. Those factors contribute to a more conservative culture."
good,"1. I worked in a goal-oriented team that always delivers great results."
good,My territory was to call on independent grocery and convenience store markets in Northern Lake County.
good,"Even though there could be, I'm sure many, improvements, Hershey is actually a very comfortable, stable, and (when necessary) a relaxing place to work. There is always something or somewhere that that can keep you busy. And, if need be, there are times when things just work out better for you to go home and catch up on missed time."
good,Very fast paced you must know your surroundings its a good place to work its my first job and i love it
good,"This was a great place to work, but can burn you out with forced overtime. The fact that Saturdays are paid at 1.75 and Sundays at double time helps sooth things over though!"
good,"Hershey is great and the work is fun! The only problem is that you need to relocate in order to move up in your career. They assume you should feel like moving across the country a few times for Hershey is ""normal""."
good,I work there us a summer student for one summer and supervisor are friendly and co-worker friendly and i enjoy working at hershey factory us a summer student
good,"Great place to work with highly educated and innovative team members who are committed to delivering quality work and competitive new products. "
good,very stressful and starining environment. No days off and always dealing with attitudes and crazy people. The pay was excelent but was no longer worth the headeache for me. This is the ideal jib for a single person not looking to start a family or enjoy life
good,"Great place to work. Very flexible part time hours, some advancement, and great coworkers. The only down fall is there are seasonal hours ( a lot of hours June-September, little hours January-May)."
good,"A Hershey do Brasil oferece um excelente ambiente de trabalho e benefícios, notadamente ganhando cada vez mais participação quando o assunto é chocolate entre os brasileiros, é, com certeza, uma das melhores empresas para se trabalhar. Os pontos negativos é que não se comprometem com um plano de carreira para seus colaboradores e os chefes não possuem perfis de lideres, um foco exacerbado em processos e quase nenhum em pessoas, o que limita significativamente seu potencial."
good,"Lo que aprendí en la empresa fue como operar una maquina, apagar y prender la maquinaria, dejar limpio el área,empacar los chocolates, entarimar, supervisar que los chocolates pasen por mi maquina con excelente calidad. Cuando mi maquina no funcionaba le avisaba a mi supervisor o los materialistas o yo misma lo revisaba porque era de puros sensores."
good,"Es una buena empresa reconocida mundialmente, prestaciones en áreas de administración superiores a las de ley."
good,Management is very caring. Scientist  work along side with you. Assisting with coming up with new product ideals and seeing them through all the testing to launching the product is the most enjoyable thing. The way it makes you and your team feels is great. It is a very family oriented work place. We give back to the community. The only problem over the last 4 years they have been downsizing and you never know when your job could be gone.
good,Great day to day work but leadership is lacking.  Management not sure where the company is going or how to get there.  Almost as if part of the company got lost along the way.  Perhaps to much turnover.
good,A new challenge every day in a fast paced environment while working with a positive team-forward group of supervisors. It has been a pleasure to work with such a dynamic group of colleagues.
good,"A typical day at worked consisted of restocking shelves, ringing up customers orders, help guests find items they are looking for and deliver it all with a smiling face. I learned how to communicate with guests, problem-solving, work a register, and be a part of a team. Our management cared about our well-being. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. They accepted me when I started working and worked well with others. I believe the hardest part of the job would be standing at a register for hours in a row. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with people."
good,"The Hershey Company planta Monterrey es un lugar para aprender perfecto para hacer tus primeras prácticas profesionales. Tienes acceso a la experiencia de una empresa transnacional sin la presión o volatilidad de giros como el automotriz o la tecnológica."
good,"As a whole, Hershey is an outstanding company to work for and does its very best at taking care of employees. The people you are surrounded with are second to none which makes for a very friendly environment to work in."
good,"Great people."
good,Well organized large leading company in confections industry.  Great opportunities to learn and grow your career.  Company is large enough that you can expand your knowledge easily.
good,"Working for this company was a great experience. People are really invested in you and willing to help you at every turn if you ask. I will say that because of the family-oriented culture, it can be difficult to receive feedback if not totally positive."
good,Well designed management team to oversee the sales for the Hershey's brand sold through Wal Mart.  Training provided through on the job training with Territory manager and assistant manager along with the best reps in the assigned territory to give direction on what is expected and how to perform as expected.  Company provided transportation and electronic devices to allow every opportunity to successfully complete daily functions and to optimize effective communication to all levels of management to provide answers to any questions your clients may have.  There really wasn't any excuse to perform your job well and have the best opportunity to reach sales goals.  The atmosphere was great and competitive and the quarterly sales meetings and new product roll out was always held in very nice hotels and were always kept short in order to not waste time.  If I hadn't had medical problems I would still be there and loving it.
good,muy buena cultura aprendes mucho trabajas 8 horas muy buenos supervisores
good,Great company to work for. Good pay and benefits. Work life balance is also great. Only negative would be difficulty in advancement from entry level sales.
good,i learned how a cash register works. my customer service is top at Hersheys Ice Cream. my co workers are slow.
good,Excellent company in terms of teamwork and relationship between merchandisers. Monthly staff meetings help facilitate this. A typical day was going to various locations to execute merchandising functions as assigned.
good,"It was a warm and caring environment as long as you maintained the corporate attitude. One of the challenges was being 3,000 miles away from the corporate office, although that was also a blessing. Management worked hard to include everyone no matter what one's position was. Hershey offers outstanding benefits."
good,"Por se tratar de uma Start up o trabalho inicial na Hershey foi muito agradavel, aprendemos juntos desenvolvemos juntos todas as areas da Cia. No inicio nos sofremos um pouco no mercado pois a Bauducco tinha um nome forte e uma equipe consolidada porem juntos fizemos a diferença no dia a dia e trouxemos um excelente resultado com 8% de crescimento com o mercado em retração."
good,A good place for a co-op or internship. Projects where difficult but not impossible. Supervisors and other employees were kind and helpful. Generally a good atmosphere everywhere.
good,"- Flexible work environment"
good,"5 hours, M-Th with some flexibility. I would visit 7-9 stores each day. Almost 200 stores total (though they try to keep you around 170). So I saw each store every 6 weeks."
good,Wonderful company to work for. They have a great company culture. The Retail Sales Representative position is very flexible and independent.
good,Great overall company to work for. Great stability with this company. For someone who is trying to grow with the company it is a great place to work.
good,The Hershey Company was  a great place to work.  Co-workers were very engaged with each other working together to get product out for manufacturing.  There wasn't actually hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with employees.
good,"al llegar a lavorar buscabamos al lider de grupo para que nos asignara el trabajo del dia y que lavor desempeñariamos,asi aprendimos varias lavores."
good,It was a great company to work for. Great pay and benefits. A lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work is mostly counting currency and coin that comes in throughout a park day, and also refilling bags for the next day. I have learned many skills at this job working with money, supervisory skills, database skills, and working with excel. All of our employees including supervisors and foreman have to work together in a big team to get all the work that needs done in the day. The hardest part of the job is overcoming the stress when our department gets busy, but all I have to do is keep myself calm, and keep the work going until it is all finished. I enjoy all parts of my job, it has great experience, and I can say I do not mind going into work everyday, but there is no room for advancement."
good,"I was able to show my skills and the well experience Maintenance team to show me a lot so I can do hands on maintenance for myself. The company with great team work,management..ECT"
good,Great management and making the company so better in so many ways.they teach you to exceed in so many ways and great benefits and retirement . Very committed to the best quality of the product
good,This was a good job but the only thing is they could pay better. There pay is $9.00 but I think it should be at least $10.50/hour because we do so much work. But it’s a good skill too.
good,Great company but they ask you to do a million and one things as an RSR and if you forget something they flag you. If you want to promote you HAVE to move. Great Benefits
good,"The ONLY down side to the whole job was that if you were new on Maintenance you worked a lot of hours until you did your time. Pay and benefits were great, Management was awesome. If i wouldn't have moved out of state for family reasons i would have preferred to retire from there."
good,"Aprendi a fazer as misturas necessárias para alguns produtos na linha, controlar o tempo de mistura, mexer nas máquinas. A parte mais difícil foi trabalhar no PCH, pois tem várias produtos diferentes lado a lado o que demanda muita atenção."
good,"Like any company they have their pros and cons. I loved everything about The Hershey Company except the fact that they claim it's mandatory OT, but it's really not. You'll be working 47.5-55 hours a week. The management would like you to work weekends as well which can become a bit much."
good,A good part time job with young employees such as myself. The leadership is good there as well. Most enjoyable part the friendship developed with my co workers.
good,"This is an awesome company that wants you to excel in your area. They provide training for new skills, great work life balance, and truly care about their employers. Managers are understanding, but they do require a lot of work but it is manageable."
good,The Hershey Company is a great place to work and build a career. The company truly values their employees and works to ensure a proper work/life balance. They are active participants in the community and encourage their employees to do the same.
good,I was verry Lucky to work for a great company that cared about there employes

good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  I would travel to stores, check the dates on the candy and try to get new candy in the stores.  I got laid off because they wanted to hire people just out of college."
good,"I have no complaints, I worked as an RSR for 2.5 years. Its an amazing place, the DSMs do a great job hiring I worked with some of the best people i've met and you will be taken care of."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs to have to date. I enjoyed attending events around Arizona and showing off our product. Being a Brand Ambassador for Hershey's was fun, collaborative, and easy-going. I worked with an amazing team full of outgoing anf genuine people."

They give you free candy, pay you to work, free cook outs twice a month, and etc. Every day we are constantly reminded how great we are so that we continue to keep up the good work.

good,Hershey foods had everything from 1950's technology to the most cutting edge technology of today.  It was a great place to learn and grow from a Maintenance worker to a Supervisor.
good,"A typical day at work while working is easy going when you are taught the directions of the ride. I've learned that working with large machinery that, it's actually fun to work with huge rides and roller coasters. The management is well done and doesn't Favorited others beside the ride leads with other ride operators. The hardest part of the day is being capable of dealing with very angry guests that came happy to the park then another co-worker made their day worse. The most enjoyable part of the job, is being outside in fresh air and capable to talk to others."
good,"Fast pace"
good,Great company to work for! Would definitely recommend to others.

good,I met many wonderful people while working at The Hershey Company.  I learned a lot of new things and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and all the free candy and promotional items too.
good,"I was the technical leader for the corporate office providing a high level of customer service for 400 users.  Typical desktop, laptop, printer, i-devices and blackberry support.  I provided technical support for the Executive Leadership.  Setup and connected all meetings via Cisco Meeting Place.  The best part of my job was working with all the employees and making sure they were taken care of with all technical issues and questions.  The hardest part of my job was making sure all technical issues were taken care of by priority, meaning that all executive tickets that came in were a drop everything and see them issue, so whoever I was working on would have to wait until I was done with the executives.  Sometimes that would put me behind so I would need to make sure I was able to come back and take care of the rest of the tickets before end of business.  Providing the best customer service for everyone and then gaining their respect and confidence is the most enjoyable part.  "
good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar e ótimas pesssoas.Aprendi a operar a máquina,adorava meu trabalho.A direçao e a gerencia não tenho nada a falar.Os meus colegas de trabalho eram ótimos,não tive parte difícil no trabalho a parte mais agrádavel do trabalho era estar com meus colegas de trabalho."

I learned a lot about being a committed working individual and that hard work does pay off in the long run. I wasn't too familiar with the management team, but I did love the experience of working as a member of the Hershey Chocolate Factory. The hardest part of my job was balancing my life outside of work and trying to make the best of my life when I was not working.

Desta maneira, aprendi todas as áreas dentro de Administração de Vendas (Order to Cash, Multas, Inteligência de Vendas). O aprendizado e experiência foi ótimo e único. Aprendi tudo que envolve o setor de Pós Venda. A Hershey visa a integração de colaborador - direção/gerência. Para eles, quanto mais próximo, melhor. O ambiente de trabalho era bom e tranquilo, exceto nos finais de meses que eram bem agitados. A parte mais difícil era utilizar o sistema Protheus/Microsiga que surgiam bastante problemas diários. A parte mais agradável era lidar com um empresa com pensamento jovem e inovador."
