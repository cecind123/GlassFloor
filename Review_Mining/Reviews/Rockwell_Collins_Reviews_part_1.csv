good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"Rockwell Collins flourished. One of the best Companies ever with an unparalleled legacy as Rockwell and then Rockwell Collins. Outstanding Avionics and other ""world class"" products that provide our military with the best equipment. Under UTC Collins has become paralyzed."
bad,"The company is not inclusive. Even though it sustains that diversity is a core value it does not provide a path for women to advance, specifically non white women.  The pay gap between men and women is about 25%"
bad,Awful place to work completely reactive to everything in there setup no new kits till shelves empty and 3 days to get more and then there are the back stabbers so keep an eye out for them then having to be certified in something you dont do waste 3 more days this place just sucks
bad,"overall, this company is poorly ran with management well into a declining state. they are unwilling to evaluate themselves in a honest way and continue to provoke and diminish the value of the newer and current floor employees, especially contractors.do not look to advance, most of the current employees have 10-15+ and are in it for the long haul, any employees that had the skills/opportunity to advance took it with another company. "
bad,"This is the worst company ever. Really judge people for the wrong reasons. I would not recommend this for anyone. Read their always hiring for the same positions , hmm I wonder why"
bad,Don’t recommend unless you want to sit and do nothing for 1 month or more. If you want to work in a good safe environment apply for security there good.
bad,"not A good place to work, lots of turnover with new employees "
bad,"They favor people, only hire and promote family or friends u less In dire need. Jamestown facility  is complete garbage. HR  and senior management are complete waste of salary. Pay them and other higher roles more to do minimal than. The hourly enployees!!"
bad,"Management is a joke. Supervisors are unqualified idiots. Constantly demand overtime weekly. They don’t care about quality, just numbers out the door. Upper management is clueless and have no backbone. Numerous inspectors are unqualified and incompetent."
bad,Terrible company to work for every pay period your check will be messed up you could be missing anywhere from 3-40 hours off your check company is stealing money payroll lady Wanda is unprofessional will avoid you from tryin to correct your check bad management from top to bottom low pay
bad,"Lied to from day one about what I would be doing.  Do Not work there!"
bad,"Plant badly managed.  Always too much overtime, orders were always behind.  Not enough workers to get job done.  Parts always getting lost and no accountability."
bad,The pay is a joke. Working with raw explosives and propellants starts you at less than $20  Most of the employees are from a temp agency that comes to work whenever they want. You'll see permanent employees quit because of frustration. Management is clueless on how this place needs to function. Promotion is only if you're part of the good ol' boys club. They lack diversity in management. You will get threats of being unemployed if you don't work OT. You are hired for a certain job and pay but they will make you fulfill a professional role that is well above your pay grade. This company is good for interns ( 3mos.) but then they choose to apply and work with a different aerospace company. Take note that they don't promote within unless you are buddies with your boss. If you ever get promoted they will not increase your pay as what the market salary/pay is. In and Out Burger workers and managers makes way more and gets better benefits.
bad,They will wait till your 89th day to tell you that you pointed out because you got sick and had hospital excuses and the manager and leads are no good I knew way more then them because I came from there competition haeco America so they basically don't Know nothing it be hilarious
bad,"horribly managed company, constantly hiring and firing employees. Employees that are unfortunate enough to stay are those that have been there for years and are still underpaid"
bad,"Management sucks, Raises sucks, micro managemen, favoritism with certain employers, HR does not help the people that work there, they just help management, ask people who worked there and got fired for no reason or harass by management and HR"
bad,There is a LOT of management.  Managers reporting to managers that report to managers.  The senior leaders at this place need to be revamped. Never worked at such an unorganized company.  You can not trust the communication they put out to their employees.  They try to sugar coat everything and never give you the truth. They have a team of crafty writers that snowball all of the communications so you have no clue what is going on.  Senior management here is a complete joke.
bad,"It may be better now that the company was purchased and is now being chopped up with the waste being sold off, and whatever good is left. "

bad,"Constant management turmoil. A new buyout by Collins, who has no idea what doing business with the Government on a job shop basis even is nor what is required by the military."
bad,"I knew I should of listened to reviews before I took this contractor position with this company, but I didn't and gave it a try and it was a huge mistake.There is a poor overall level of competence at all levels within the organization, from management, and employees. The work place culture there is horrible and they need to get rid of all the people that have been with this company for 10 years or more and start over because what they have working there now are past their prime and don't have a clue."
bad,"This company is the worst run business I have ever been involved in. Here is why...."
bad,"Very poor management, Old antiquated systems,  do as I say not as I do mentality,  if any mistakes are made by management they will blame them on you and never take the onus of their mistakes. The work place is in shambles, High turnover rate and not enough managers to cover the different departments. Save your time and energy and read the reviews for this business, you won’t be sorry!"
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked in my life. It felt like I was waking up to return to the dark dungeon everyday."
bad,"Management has been working together for years and they are just there to collect a check. No training and if you are a minority don't waste your time applying, experience and education go out the door when applying for internal positions."
bad,The system is broken. Management is poor and production people get worked like slaves. People come and go and leave without leaving their knowledge behind.
bad,Half the time between the union and management everything is a surprise. You come in on a daily basis and have know clue of what is going on and everything remains as a secretive environment.
bad,Got through the interview and nearly a month later all passed through security checks - 2 days left of my notice at current place and i get a phone call to say there has been a recruitment freeze and my position is lost. Terrible planning and organisation
bad,This company is all about profit and taking away benefits to get those profits. They do not care about you just their bottom line. Worked for 6 years and never gained one benefit just kept on losing pay/insurance/overtime. No room for advancement either.
bad,"Unless you're an extreme brown noser, related to a manager or part of they're ""Clique"" you will not advance or get a decent raise. I only stuck around because I live 5mins from work"
bad,"Management does not communicate well."
bad,"the products ,I was to work on were intermittent , which forced me to compete for work with overtime hogs from previous shift , which meant I either had to wait for an hour or so to work on something or go home with no work that night . The politics were horrible ."
bad,"Very good company, but there are too many chiefs not enough indians if you know what I mean. The pay is very competitive and upper manangemnet is ok but dont have as much experience."
bad,"It's all push push push. Hurry up and ship. Management doesn't support the quality team. No work life balance. Poor management, overall affects the employee morale. I highly wouldn't recommend this place for anyone."
bad,"Overall the position was not hard.  I was given a challenging client, one who wrote an email to the company's Executive staff that I was great to work with.  My contract was not renewed after I put in several hours to make the customer completely satisfied.  The company apparently only hires contractors to avoid health care and benefits costs and get rid of them after the project is delivered."
bad,"Good work, safe environment. Extremely poor management. Cared nothing for work/life balance. Poor training and heavy favoritism. I would not recommend."
bad,"lack of leadership, lack of care for employees, no clear direction in daily goals. the tops get richer while the bottom doesnt advance. you come into work and there is no clear plan of the day. issues come up and nobody wants to take owner ship to solve the problem. they do not hire from within the company and constantly bring people in from the outside making former employee train the new ones. disgraceful."
bad,"Most people work as little as possible, while others take on the bulk of the work load. Management is terrible, they praise the lazy workers and abuse the hard workers.They hire people with no experience and friends of the family, its not what you know its who you know.."
bad,"Most people work as little as possible, while others take on the bulk of the work load. Management is terrible, they praise the slackers and abuse the hard workers.  Mexicali is taking over the Wilsonville campus, trying to take as much work to Mexico as possible, wouldn't be surprised if the campus closes in the near future. Company tries to run every location like corporate (Cedar Rapids, IA), even though they all do different things. Knee jerk decisions without thinking about how it will effect both internal and external customers. Too many procedures, contradicting procedures. They hire people with no experience and pay them more than the employee who has been doing it for years. Not an equal opportunity employer. No raises, but acquired a company that had billions of dollars of debt!"
bad,"/ Not acknowledged for job performace/ to many clicks/needed to be a ""friend"" of management to get good reviews."
bad,"Great workers; Poor management; training great if you came"
bad,"I have nothing good to say about the company or the location. If you are a person of color you will not get a promotion into management, so only enter into this company as management because you will never be considered for a higher level job."
bad,"Bad Contract Position with a Customer Service Supervisor that uses foul language consistently with customers, vendors and employees, An Office Bully that is truly out of control and HR will not support employees who tries to explain the problems they're with her because her best friend is the Director. Very uncomfortable"
bad,"Do not work there, no loyalty, don't care for the employees, they give you a hard time,Favoritism, H.R don't listen to your concerns.No Fun,Sucks....."
bad,"I was a former contract worker always promised to be full time. I was never informed on hour changes , force to put up QA manager that knew nothing about aircraft. All in all McDonald's restaurant treatment is far better with the same pay."
bad,Not good. Constant challenges created by continuous string of poor management decisions by managers not even qualified to run a High School shop class.
bad,"What a nightmare!  Worst place I have ever worked.  No planning, no project management.  And their lab: wow.  OSHA would have a field day.  230V 3Phase wires all over the floor.  Glad to be out of there!  There is a reason they pay people so much and have a 25% turnover rate.  Save yourself the headache and look somewhere else."
bad,A good company to work for. The work here is cutting edge and helps understand the Aerospace Industry from inside. Team Dynamics is good.
bad,not a very good company ...company is lead but morons...do not apply there they lay off. it is a very bad culture and environment.
bad,good place to work for manufacturing evacuation emergency slides &rafts
bad,Its the military. It is not supposed to be fun. I should have gotten out sooner than i did
bad,"Despite this company being a ""bad"" company to work for, I had a great mentor protege ""boss"", he was a very talented speaker, writer, and manager. I worked directly for him and with him and he was like one of the wonders of this world.  Just totally very smart and a very charismatic white man too."
bad,"Long hours, mandatory over time. Very dusty and dirt place to work. When they are done with you, out the door... Contract labor. I would never go back to that hell hole."
bad,"Worst company I have and will ever work for. Management or ""leaders"" as they like to be called are clowns. Don't know their head from their rears. Will not hesitate throwing their employees under the bus to give them more time to fly below the radar a bit longer. If you like hooking up with coworkers this is the place to work. Like a brothel."
bad,"Rockwell Collins is a very competitive place to work. The management is powerless at the end of year reviews, Upper Managment (who does not work with you) are the ones that determine the raises. which are very little if any at all.  Rockwell Collins does not advance people with in the ranks, they hire from outside, expect you to train them."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,Employer was bearable up until July 2012 since UTC took over.
bad,Pros – Cedar Rapids good for family life.
bad,The shop workers are in a union and are treated like 2nd class citizens by management it’s a small union and has no negotiating power and they know it so the final decision on things doesn’t come from the union
bad,"Vergennes location is a wasteland of fake management, and clueless individuals.  Operations staff is a joke, GM doesn’t even know your name.  Don’t make a false move or else you’ll end up in HR.  Fake fake fake."
bad,"Bad management, bad hr, manager taking care of favourite ones, long standing hours. Mandatory overtime specially on Saturday. One reason that they have jobs all the time because more people leaving jobs everyday"
bad,"I was full speed ahead when I started working for this company. I learned how to test my product, and was up to speed with the person I worked with in two weeks. There is no opportunity for advancement unless your willing to kiss up to the supervisor or management. It doesn't matter how much work you get done. I have worked hard and have been productive and produced a quality product without any errors in the process or paperwork. The company is run by dropping the work on us on Thurs. & Fri. and making it mandatory to be here Sat. and Sun. to get the work out. Then, when you return to work the following week, you are left with no work or not enough work to keep you busy until more units are dropped on you. This encourages people to slow down during the week even if they have enough work to do. If your going to work here, plan on kissing up to the boss and management and giving your life over to the company."
bad,"I'm not sure where to start, but this place is ran just like the Washington Redskins very poorly from the management, to employees. Majority of the people at this location are past their prime and should of been let go many years ago. The culture at this place is the worst I have seen and people are stuck in their ways and refuse to change."
bad,"Ok job some people are friendly and great "
bad,Dangerous work environment not concerned with major safety issues at all... Would not refer anyone to work there. Very racial cultural based work surroundings.
bad,if you like to kiss a** this job is for you poor management they expect for things to get done like a slave they do not appreciate the employees unless you kiss their a**
bad,"Tattletale culture overwhelms real work, most culturally toxic in all my life. Stay away! Passive aggressive leaders and staff, they'll own your good work and leave you wanting. Bullies run the show and deligate all their work so they can golf. Worst experience ever. You've been warned ..."
bad,"Company stresses on Ethics but sadly management/managers themselves don’t comply and are extremely bias. They do not observe nor appreciate employee’s contribution. An employee can raise his/her concern, yet nothing is done to resolve it. In fact they label you as inefficient and blacklist you. I was working and holding dual job profiles and was under so much of stress but yet there was no help from my own manager.  Unhealthy and unhelpful environment. Employees don’t even dare to speak up openly. Bad culture."
bad,Buyer are not buyers and planners do not plan.  Bad mangers  Changing different company with different rules and dont' tell the employee or any training
bad,"No opion poor life balance "
bad,They like to use the buddy/family system here if you know someone then you're job is secured if you don't good luck. Management is terrible no actually manager just insecure wanna be leaders. If you plan on being stuck or worried at a job then this is for you.
bad,"Great people to work with. Bosses don`t give workers any freedom to think for themselves. The culture in production, is production over quality! The most enjoyable part of my job was listening to all the BS going on in the area."
bad,After working for this company for a number of years I was no longer a valued employee and found micro management to be the way management chose to run business . The  Senior management team were very poorly chosen and very inexperienced.  Adhering to company policies was not a practice management did very often. Poor company to work for!
bad,"Overall the position was not hard.Constant challenges created by continuous string of poor management decisions by managers not even qualified to run a Burger King. Management is incompetent, only concerned with monthly numbers and profits, and doesn't support issues that address growth and technical issues. Workplace culture is back stabbing and there is no such thing as teamwork. While Rockwell tries to emphasize ""building trust every day"" as their motto, it seems that's only because that's an area where they are so weak. Career advancement is centered around who you know, not what you can do. Advancement is extremely limited and nepotism runs rampant with this company."
bad,There is no training plans in place for new employees or temps. There is no team work among the employees or supervisors. The HR team is not fair with decisions that are made.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"I went to work for a friend that we had worked with before, and he was a major micro-manager. I couldn't do or say anything without him knowing and he used that to push me out. I was very disappointed that I worked here and wish I could take it back."
bad,"The way management treats employees is unfair and sometimes discriminating.  HR only protects management and is not there for the employees.  You're on your own.  If you like being a phony individual to get ahead, this is the place for you.  If you're a hard worker looking for recognition, look elsewhere."
bad,"I worked there for almost the full two years of my contract and resigned due to feeling I was treated awful. I trained my replacements and then they did the job. I wasn't given any new tasks so I sat there all day with nothing to do. I had so much potential and started working towards my masters degree to move up within the company but nobody cares about that. They care about money and that's it. Management is terrible. Supervisors call in sick when the are hungover, come in hungover and sleep at their desks. It's a terrible place to work. I feel used and disrespected."
bad,"Was a great place to work when the company was owned by           Goodrich, once UTC purchased the company the business went down, the employees were treated like just a another number."
bad,"People that work hard for this company and actually do their jobs are looked over, while those who don’t do their jobs are rewarded. It’s not what you know, but who you know. Politics and buddy system are what’s important to this company and not the customers or work itself."
bad,"They moved me to a different position after 6 months that is well above my current pay grade. Doing the work of a technical writer and being paid as an EPA. "
bad,"The company itself sucks, healthcare is horrible, almost no benefits besides what they are required to give you. Management has a huge favoritism issue."
bad,"No Fair Career Advancement and Endemic Nepotism.  Management does not reward those deserving promotions and instead unfairly rewards cronies, friends, and close associates."
bad,"Run from this place.  Employees are considered disposable resources.   The company culture has changed from the two past mergers.  Another one with Raytheon is anticipated.  No resources, unsustainable goals and toxic culture."
bad,"Very unorganized company. Supervisors are useless and lazy. Managers are always clueless. The leads barely train you. The employees are the main ones training new employees. Materials are always delaying work. The best reward in that place is leaving early which is not good for your paycheck. Putting up high numbers is there main concern. Pay rate is a joke. There point system is very terrible. They’ll give you a point for being a second late for work. You have to show up to work super early just to get a good parking spot, otherwise you’ll be walking up and down a hill just to get into the building. There is a lot of favoritism. They will fire people in there last hour of the shift instead of being straight up with employees. You’ll have to wait the last minute of the day on Friday to figure out if you’ll have work on Saturday. Best thing I can say is they have great benefits but everything else is a big headache"
bad,"Not even a number or a piece of meat. Employees are an inconvenience and not a valued asset. The Boeing 737 max incident springs to mind with the similar attitude and culture of the way the facility has gone. Good people are made to feel unwelome and replaced with cheap zombies. Glad to go, thanks for the pay off."
bad,If you aren’t part of any group in there....you are cast out and looked upon. If you aren’t in good terms with the HR lady might as well hang yourselves.....she controls everything and everyone.
bad,"Based on my experience Stay away from Utc . Sucks place to work at. No advancement , slow base, your not allowed to use your cell phone. New hires won’t be able to do any of their job until 3rd month."
bad,"There are very few people who will genuinely care about you in this company. The ""rank and yank"" culture encourages even the most human entering this work environment to side-swipe and crush coworkers. There is no collaboration or team work. You're better off surviving among Velociraptors."
bad,Redundancy handled badly.  Local management ok but no respect from States.  Was a good company as BE aerospace not great as Rockwell.  They do not treat people as humans but more as numbers.  Would not trust the management in the States at all.  No prospects for UK staff.
bad,"Constant lack of communication, manipulation, lying and harassment from management. Constant disrespect, and threats of job security."
bad,Rockwell Collins tended to have IT Personnel who did not care about job and where not professional. User life very slow paced and relaxed.  Bad working hours 4pm to Midnight or Midnight to 8.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"It does have several advantages for persons that would like to learn ideas in the field of aviation. The location in Cedar Rapids, Iowa does have more disadvantages than advantages."
bad,Not a very pleasant work environment.  Very little training was provided to all new engineers.  Leadership was virtually non-existent.
bad,"No job work / life balance (got paid for 40 and expected to work 60-70 hours per week)."
bad,Management not supportive most if the time.  Management not supportive of my desire to continue my education. I wanted to learn skills to help do my job.
bad,"I will leave it at this; when I started, UTC stock was at ~$140 per share. Today it is at $84. Two large scale layoffs/early retirement offerings within the past year, taking most of the native knowledge base out. Sound stable to you?"
bad,"The folks in the shop were an amazing group and would ""crawl through broken glass"" to meet customer requirements. Management however was another story."
bad,work on customer owned units usually under pressure to return them to the customer. Also under pressure to have high quality work. Co-workers are very cohesive.
bad,The people make this place terrible.   You better keep your mouth shut.   Dont trust anyone.   No one values your work and unless you have been there 15 years no one cares or thinks you are worth a anything.  Avoid like a disease.  Unless you want to have your soul taken away.
bad,Management is very arrogant and usually don't welcome new ideas.One of the the engineering manager is the worst I've ever seen.
bad,Normal day
bad,A terrible place to work. People are dishonest with their time and use of company ethics. Managers yell and scream at their people and pound their fists on the table.
bad,"Used to be a nice place to work, but continued mergers have made it almost unbearable.  Too many mid managers and directors leave the rest doing all the work."
bad,Tirocinio in HR. Tirocinio a guardare il vuoto. Nulla da fare. Eppure le colleghe HR erano sempre piene di lavoro. Non si fidano dei tirocinanti (parlo per HR) e non condividono responsabilità con loro.
bad,"Very disappointed in the management. After I started, I was given a position that I did not interview for. I was told by my supervisor that I would eventually move into a new roll which never happened. Then I got laid off, I was told because of a recent merger."
bad,"The major problem with Rockwell Collins and by extension Collins Aerospace is its inability to deal with smart and intelligent underrepresented cultures. You are OK if you play the game, but if you are not a game player, you are a problem for the ""Good Old Boy"" Mentality that permeates the company. "
bad,Management is absolutely horrid. They do not care about their employees. They only care about themselves. They say they are family oriented but then turn and get mad at you for having to call in because your child is sick.
bad,"Site Manager has no idea how to run a plant."
bad,"There are better places to work, no room to grow and advance.You are better off in a larger company. Go to a place that will value your worth and acknowledge what you bring to the table."
bad,Management will make low level employees carry all the weight for incompetenet planing and won't even try to fix the long lasting known problems that are brought up constantly by subordinates. No room for growth what so ever. Your skills and job ethic don't count only who ever sucks up to the managers will get some sort of benefit. Cant even talk to the HR department because they will turn their back on you and tell you that they are right you are wrong and if you don't like it leave. Very hostile working environment and the hourly employees have done attempts to unionize because of how bad conditions are. Do yourself a favor and keep away because making 10 cents raises yearly is just not worth it.
bad,"Very poor communication among workers."
bad,Great pay and great benefits. But they lay off too often. The insurance is good. Better than you can buy out side work on your on. Hope you like working working weekends they seem to work every weekend and most major holidays.
bad,"Management is a poor example of leadership throughout some departments at Rockwell Collins. Employee morale is low in some departments because certain managers have no knowledge what it is like to treat their employees with respect, rather, they make some crude remarks that involve bullying, they play favorites, they use intimidation tactics, some managers have gone as far as making racial slurs and have managed to remain in their current (managerial) positions. "
bad,"As a been there done that reviewer, I have to fully agree with the previous review. If they hire permanent employees they are looking for 'yes men' and robots. They are making a very visible transition to contractors and letting go of employees, even long time employees, under the guise of 'workforce reductions' if they find it cheaper to use contractors. Salary and benefits are good (at present) but that fact is tempered with self serving bullies for managers who only look to pass on their work to their subordinates. Contrary to some of the positive reviews, there is no laughter or camaraderie but a lot of backstabbing, gossip and a very self serving culture. A huge change from the days as Goodrich where they promoted their 'people philosophy' where now you are truly only a number. Job security is non existent and the only way I would recommend taking a position with the company is to gain experience and move on."
bad,"Management is concerned only about climbing the corporate ladder.  Hiding the truth, misleading the customer and flat out lying is common place at UTC.  Don't expect to get ahead in the company unless you are willing to sacrifice your soul."
bad,Hardest part of job is trying to deliver product despite constantly changing project requirements.  Most enjoyable part of job is seeing your office building in the rear view mirror as you leave.
bad,"Not the best work environment for anyone below management level, unless your in with the Boss or have high level degree"
bad,"The worst company I have ever experienced in the whole of my working life. "
bad,"I relocated for this job through Aerotek and was brought in as a temp to hire. They trained me 2 weeks on equipment that never worked right and then after 4 weeks had me train a new guy. The 5th week Aerotek sent me an email to not return to work. I was doing everything they asked and was trained to do. Everyone seemed happy with my work and with no warning or reason, they let me go. I could not recommend UTC to anyone."
bad,I can only hope this position is open because RC finally decided to address the substandard leadership in the subcontracts organization.
bad,Co-works are sexist and make the job hard to come to. Management yells at you everyday. No chance for advancement to a higher position. Traveling over 70% of the time with no overtime compensation. Calibration Lab Manager doesn't know what he is doing and comes in late and leaves early.
bad,I was forced out of my job by high up individuals that had no knowledge in training.
bad,"Rockwell Collins is an ok place to work, the benefits are good, but little to no chance of advancement unless your a family member of a higher up. Nepotism runs rampent. Management is incompetent, only concerned with monthly numbers and profits, and doesn't support issues that address growth and technical issues. Coworkers are good, but most long-timers have lost motivation due to no advancement and little appreciation from management. Many of the technical personnel that are qualified are overwhelmed and some don't have the expertise or experience to contend with ever changing technical issues, and some don't even have any technical schooling at all."
bad,"The highlight of Goodrich Chula Vista is the location, rate of pay is only average. Expect to be monitored as to your arrival time each and every day, how long you take for lunch and amount of time you spend in the bathroom. There is a cafeteria on site, so there is no reason to leave the facility. Food isn’t too bad considering how small the cafeteria is. Biggest down fall of this place is internal office politics. You can be the best engineer in the world and be walked out the door for someone over hearing you say the wrong thing. The good thing is if you are not a top notch engineer you can last here forever, just so long as manager likes you. No work required!"
bad,"Bad management, No life/work balance, very unorganized, pay sucks, hours short on checks, at times don't get paid on time. Could be a week late, up to 90 days late. Got to get there an hour and half early just to get good parking spot! Times you will stand doing nothing for 9 hrs, due to no parts."
bad,"Everything is competitive, supervisors never really acknowledge employees for anything positive only negative. Quick to fire people for lack of explanation."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,Very unprofessional place of employment. The pay is about half of the plant in Windsor Locks. Unfriendly co-workers. Poor management . The hiring process and orientation is absolutely terrible .
bad,"Prepare to give up your personal life, as you are literally on-call 24/7. Sure you have “vacation”, but are expected by our director to bring your laptop and work. Lack of basic respect for your time and efforts. Poor management and communication from all levels, with a company-worst rate of people leaving every...single...year. No willingness to listen to employees or make any improvements. Work and events are only “check-in-the-box” to fool leadership, but in reality are often unfinished and accomplish nothing of value. Begged for basic training for years, to no avail. Different set of rules depending on who you are, and if you're in the ‘click’. Director and managers would gossip with HR like high school girls. Worst leadership I have ever experienced in my career, by far."
bad,its not a bad gig but the lack of support you get is ridiculous the management is a joke not to mention if your 2nd shift you get treated like a second class citizen
bad,Needless to say this company relies on the buddy system and senioroty for advancement.  Experience and education go out the door when applying for internal positions.  The base pay is very low. Work and life balance do not exist as people are forced to work over time every day and on the weekends.  This company has a lack of educated management.
bad,They run things by way of buddy system and they have too many non-diverse employees.  Most of them have been raised in the rural areas so they know nothing about true diversity
bad,"If you work hard and take pride in what you do, you’re only given more work and no recognition while the ones who need to be fired are promoted!!!  Company has no morals or values.  Terrible place to work.  Run far away!!!!"
bad,"Management is committed to keep perpetuating the inefficiencies for the sake of tradition. There is a strong brown sniffing culture at the moment of getting a promotion. The people look sad in general and it has created a toxic work environment. Since the system is so broken, it relies heavily on manual input and long hours of work are expected. The management love appearances but it is just for show. I am surprised this place is operating without the FAA closing it down. This site operates without input/supervision from UTC, which has spoiled management into doing whatever they want... for decades."
bad,"Very various work skills, excellence benefits, easy going work atmosphere, close to home,  short commute to work, designing and building production equipment."
bad,"First off the Programs Managers will lie and cheat on their reports in order for them to look good. They will lie about employees working for them as to get rid of older employees. I've seen this happen dozens of times in 23 years."
bad,"The management is horrible, the moral has dropped to an all time low! On time delivery is non existent because of poor management!!! Poor training and favortism!!"
bad,"Beware the weak leader who is he, who has no true leadership; he provides micromanagement, interruptions and interference, as alternatives to strategic vision, leadership by example, and the integrity to allow people to perform in accord with their job descriptions;"
bad,"The temps are treated like dirt.  And every Engineering Program Assistant is a temp. Full time hire is not possible because of budgets and what not. The manager is the Engineering Division Manager.  Guess who he always sided with in a dispute?  Overall, it was not a great place to work."
bad,"Work force are great the job was good but the whole site is let down by very poor management."
bad,"My typical day is to allocate breakdown jobs by criticallity and importance, to liase with management at daily meetings, to manage TPM and PPM projects and to maintain production levels by minimising breakdown times. To work with both service engineers and contractor control. I have learned that by mutual trust and good management of fellow workers that any obsticle can be challenged."
bad,"The facility in Peshtigo, WI needs new management from the Site Leader all the way down to the floor supervisors. I don’t think anyone of them have ever worked a day in their lives on a factory floor or assembled anything. They are nothing but robots controlled by the corporation. There is a huge burocracy to go thru to get anything changed, and lots of goofy Mickey Mouse rules. Favorites of the supervisors are evident also."
bad,"One of the worst places i have ever worked in my life. Management have no clue of the aerospace business or production. No orientation, no skills training. Just blood aweful. No safety or certifications AT ALL ! No access to SPECS. Only M.E. can view them. Don't waste your time."
bad,"This review if focused on the Electronic Systems Center located in Phoenix AZ.  This site was part of Goodrich before being acquired by UTC Aerospace Systems.  It is now part of the newly renamed Collins Aerospace.  "
bad,Most of the my days were dealing with issues that would come up in a production environment. A lot of the issues could be avoided if management would give engineering a direction. Most of the input engineering gave management was ignored or put off until management could claim the idea as its own. A lot of favoritism and retaliation is played in this company. An engineer on the manufacturing floor doesn't really do much engineering work it is more a clerical job. This company claims to be ethical but is just the opposite not a good place for an engineer looking to advance their career.
bad,"Management is very uninvolved in solving issues with daily"
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,I've worked at UTAS twice in the past 5 years and been laid of with zero notice twice. Easy job but no security there. They lay you off and bring you back like a yo yo. Hard workers stay but are whipped like a wagon mule for more work.
bad,"Prior Parts Engineer at UTC Albuquerque, NM.  Too many lay-offs, horrible parts issues, don't know the 5 types of control drawings, poor management, using SAP (worst ERP system ever), no job growth and way too much training interferes with getting your job done. Don't recommend anyone even apply there.  Corporate UTC is way too greedy and can't get contracts as they bid too high to get the most profit and loose it to some other competitor.  Some Program Managers were difficult to work with.  They are having problems even defining their market.  On the other hand, pay was good, people were nice overall and benefits used to be good but they trashed them with high Deductibles. Company was better when it was Goodrich."
bad,"I exceeded all expectations for the position and even went above and beyond my immediate responsibilities and found correctable problems with documentation, equipment, and processes but there was a ""Don't make waves"" attitude and no desire to correct problems or deficiencies, repair faulty equipment, or even adjust processes.  "
bad,"most but not all management staff are bunch of liars.coworkers are selfish people ,think they will steal your work."
bad,"Chaotic approach to business management...managers always know best even about things they know nothing about."
bad,"When a company raises the pay average of all employees to only 80% of the area average for the same work, that in itself should be suspect. My experience there was unique to say the least. With the new company taking over there are a lot of questions of course. A lot of favoritism and questionable practices happening there."
bad,"Unless you want to get layoff in the most humiliate way possible, steer clear from this company.  The upper management doesn't care about you.  They only care about their own well being and you are nothing but a disposable tool to them.  "
bad,Very relaxed work environment . Feels like working for a govt job . Good job for people who start career and to move on after 3-4 years.Nothing much to learn for software engineers.
bad,"This is the only employer I've ever had that received a negative review. SELL your stock, don't apply, forget you ever heard of this company. This company is a bunch of old guys past their prime that like to talk about the good ole days while they sit on their butt collecting salaries for government contracts that have gone over budget while the contracts are infinitely extended. At best unethical and borderline criminal. I had a six month contract and when I saw what was going on there I ran. They tried to convert me to full time after four months but the culture of chronic laziness scared me so I left ASAP. They pay was good while I was there though and because nobody does any work it's very easy to balance your life. My boss showed up for about 2 hours a day. Middle Management is incompetent although I can't speak for upper management although typically that kind of cancer goes all the way to the top. I suppose it is possible that what I experienced only exists at that one location albeit a huge location for RC. I've met guys who are getting to the end of their careers and are just looking to coast, if so then this is the place for you."
bad,The culture is not good in terms of leadership from every department. Lack of transparency towards junior personnel is missing from leadership. Lack of empowerment from superior is non existent base on my experience.
bad,"No fun at work. Strict managers who doesn't care for the employees, but themselves, Managers have no leadership skills. No good directions for the hard working programmers"
bad,"Can be a good place to work, however 70% of employees in Supply Chain want to leave the job function, company wide.  There are nice people and good managers, yet my experience was 16 hour days, and no end to the unrealistic workload.  The only communication or flow down of information was via email, no manager support or guidance to help you do you job, grow or develop to be better  (3 staff meetings in almost 2 & 1/2 years.)   Only endless emails  and each was left to interpret, apply  and try to make sense of the information individually, if you even had time to read all your emails and get your work done, in a 12 - 16 hour day.  The pay was great and some nice benefits."
bad,"The company says they represent an open minded, fair corporate culture, but once in the office, it is a selfish work environment where everyone is on their own and does not care about the future well-being of others."
bad,"This company has been acquired by a new company and gone through mergers every few years for the past several. With every new merger, the culture shifts to something younger, which is great. "
bad,Doesn't value talent and efficiency nearly as much as warm bodies.  Don't give more to them than they deserve.  I dedicaed my life to that company and they sent me packing.  Nobody fought for me when push came to shove and I had given them everything.
bad,Entreprise qui fut vraiment une belle expérience pour moi mais qui au fil des années c’est complètement dégradé du a un management de bas niveau . La DRH n’etait vraiment pas a la haureur et tres manipulatrice (Patricia LUDOVINO). Elle fut remplacée pour le sabotage définitif de l’entreprIse qui a fini pas etres délocalié en Pologne fin 2018. Une soixantaine d’employés on donc ete mis au chômage. Mauvais souvenir au final .
bad,"The management likes to micro manage,  hold it against you if you have an emergency."
bad,"Identify risks and obstacles, quantify impacts, ensure mitigations and contingency plans are executed"
bad,You can work hard each and everyday.  You can be friendly with everyone but at the end of the day if your not related to someone or friends with whoever counts you won’t get in or be accepted to the Oakville Location since Burlington is closing down. Not based on job performance!!
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"Do not waste your time!!! Their rules and policies only apply to certain people. You go through a ton of training and if they decide they do not like you for ANY reason they will bully and harass you until you make mistakes and then terminate you for those mistakes. Management talks  to people horribly. They have no idea what they are doing, change their minds in a daily basis of whats expected of you and their communication skills leave a lot to be desired. You will watch their favorite people do what ever they like and make as many mistakes and they want. They will get moved around to try other jobs until they find one they like while the disliked (many for no reason) people just get let go. HR does nothing to help."
bad,"Typical large corporate environment with cross-functional management team. The day starts with level accountability meetings to ensure all employees are getting their say for overall team productivity. Project team meetings populate the remainder of the day. Business strategy and proposals demonstrated a lack of customer focus and didn't position us for long-term success. Procurement followed disciplined process regardless of project type or intent; perfect for production, not so much for capital equipment deployment or rapid product prototyping or troubleshooting."
bad,Leads let on going harassment slide. Lack of training for new people and inspectors(meaning poor quality control). Leads often give false promises for your growth in the company. Would not want to step in an airplane again after seeing how much the quality downgraded.
bad,The company is very large and there is a lot of red-tape to  go through to get work done. The company is very volatile to the market and is a roller coaster ride when it comes to job assignments.
bad,Perform many aspects of wafer processing. Management could be improved. Friendly co-workers. Learned many different processes. Most enjoyable part of the job is variety. Hardest part of the job is dealing with priorities.
bad,Rockwell Collins is a good company to work for but unfortunately they are closing their facility in San Diego.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and would be happy to work with any of them again.
bad,"Very two faced MANAGERS.All deparments fight against each other."
bad,"Good Environment and Workplace."
bad,"Good management principles"
bad,"Wages are very low but the benefits are great. Work life balance is non existent and the place is extremely unorganized. There is a buddy system as far as how you advance and there are people working on the lines with so much more experience than the supervisors and the line leads but because of the unfair way the leads are chosen, the company will continue to suffer. The union also does nothing. The union is a joke. The wages are so unfair and nobody in the union fights for fairer wages."
bad,"Rockwell Collins took over late last year. When this happened the environment became cut throat. I felt that the salary people began to turn on each other because they weren't sure if they would have a job or not. One day Collins came in and laid 25 of us off. I still keep in touch with former employees and they say that the conditions have gotten worse. Its unfortunate because it used to be a good place to work, but what I can remember was not at worth my time. I am now glad I was laid off because I finally realized I was not going anywhere in my position and it would be very difficult to move somewhere else."
bad,"The workplace culture is very stressful and frustrating. It's either very busy or very slow, there's typically no in between. The hardest part of the job is the slow advancement and low salary. You do a lot more work than what they pay you. You also do tasks that are not part of your job description. The enjoyable part is you get to work with wonderful people who are going through the same struggle in the company."
bad,Limited advancement and salary opportunities. Very resistant to progress and change with new ideas. Must comply with limited resources and antiquated equipment / documentation.
bad,"No opportunities for advancement.High rate of turnover, everyone is concerned that the Brea location may not be there in a couple of years."
bad,"Run...The company has an above average package but gives manager full autonomy to deny benefits such as telework or even college tuition/education training.   No accountability for bad managers and there are many.  Also a few good ones.  The company might demote you at will, meaning first you are forced to change title and a few months later salary or other reduction  of your benefits.   Company/dept reorganized about every 10 months and with little direction,  the employee is left with no clear assignments.   Employee morale is low.  Work environment is toxic and in absence of good leadership, new employee turnover is high.  They cant keep new employee.  Promotion is not what you know but who you know.  Not a good place and will only get worse with the upcoming Raytheon merger."
bad,"Bias and unfair - used to be a great company but not anymore. Harassment, retaliation, targeting, hostile work environment. I've never been so disgusted with a company until having worked here"
bad,"No communication, at this company at all. Nobody talks to anybody, emails only to a few and only a few know whats going on. Mangers are stupid, and peddy, and have no experience but here. Engineering runs everything here, but they dont do a good job, everything is last minute."
bad,"Long Hours I worked 70 hr a week for more than 6 of the 8 months my time there."
bad,"Ithaco/Goodrich Aerospace was a close knit family who got along and knew what to do. The Ithaca management was great. Coworkers were always willing to help each other. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep other Goodrich facilities out of our business (mainly Danbury). I more than enjoyed going to work everyday, even during snowstorms."
bad,"I would not recommend pursing employee at Collins Aerospace unless you want to live, eat and breathe your job.  Employee morale is extremely poor and employee behavior is less than professional."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"You are treated like a second class citizen as a contractor and many people look down on you, which can be difficult to deal with. Most of the engineers are much older and extremely overworked making this a difficult place to fit in if you are younger. The managers have absolutely no idea how to deal with project management and use an agile methodology to mask the fact that they do not understand the scope of projects. You will learn a lot here and it can be a great stepping stone towards a future career, but the stress, lack of pay and difficult work culture make this a place to avoid."
bad,"Very disappointed in how things are handled with standard rules, you can get punished for someone else's bad decisions, instead of management holding the individual that made the bad decision accountable. Management has their hands tied behind their back when it comes confronting individuals and punishing them in the correct mannor"
bad,"Plenty work, safety, cool in summer, heat in winter. 1st or 2nd shift, drink machine, ice machine, snack machine.clean bathroom,cool lunch room.good parking spaces."
bad,"the management are very hardworking therefore sometimes they overlooked on the interns welfare. however, they are very helpful when asked for help and are generous in sharing knowledge. for example, they asked interns to sit on one of their important meetings to show progress and share issues."
bad,"My experience with Rockwell Collins started well but change for the worse with a management change.  I saw too many good managers who had been promoted from the engineering ranks quit (or be ""let go"") as a result of their advocating for their workers.  If you're a cut-throat manager type, maybe this is the place for you."
bad,Use to be a good company before being bought out by UTC. Company now treats employees as numbers and nothing more. Ridiculous increase in employee benefits which increase yearly. Wages are not competitive with any aerospace company and is one of the lowest in the industry. Management has no clue on how to run the company and place blame on the employees when we try and help things run more smoothly and efficiently.
bad,"A typical day includes jumping around from various products/issues depending on what is hottest and who is loudest."
bad,Previous company was a small family oriented organization that grew and learned together.  Rockwell Collins bought the company and divided the organization.
bad,A company stuck in the 1950's - word and deed do not match and they are driven and controlled from the top and the top is completely disconnected from the reality of what is going on in the organization.
bad,"Very stressful work place with contradictory management.  As a quality inspector, my job was to approve manufactured components to be shipped to the customer. Emphasis should have been on quality, safety, customer satisfaction. Instead, it was on meeting tact times and ship dates.  This company is all about numbers and profit, not employees or quality products. "
bad,"Rockwell Collins is backsliding as a ""great place to work"" and does not offer the diverse culture it purports. "
bad,"This review primarily discusses the Phoenix, AZ location. There is a constant air of fear and poor management in this location. The revolving door of hiring and firing has everyone on edge. There seems to be no rhyme or reason for the way they fire people or for the methods of hiring replacements. They seem to want to fail as they keep firing the best workers and replacing them with people who are so inept that they cannot succeed. In return the company expects people to work more than 40 hours a week to compensate for the ineptitude of management and the pathetic work of the new hires. I wouldn't recommend this train wreck to anyone. Avoid the ESC at UTAS at all costs."
bad,"Management and work atmosphere very disfuntional."
bad,"Does not value your effort and under compensated. Performing Senior Engineering Work, for title and salary of entry-level electrical engineering. Performance Reviews are not fair and does not reflect what your hard work. Prevent you from advancement. In meetings, Project engineers humiliate and do not appreciate your ideas."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid.  No management support and lots of favoritism from up top. The little guys do all the work and the bigger guys take credit,  until something goes wrong,  then they throw everyone under the bus."
bad,Focus on Wall Street rather than people doing the work.  Senior Leadership does not understand customer focused engagements and the mission.  Production focused.
bad,"I would not recommend working for Collins.  The overtime is through  the roof.  They EXPECT salaried employees to just work more OT, 7 days per week.  There is NO work life balance.  Only place I have worked where everyone is looking for a new job.  Upper management is clueless as to what is going on."
bad,"No SOP for production or materials processes and too many broken processes and no adequate root cause analysis...only bandaid fixes. Hourly employees are grossly underpaid so they are used up and discarded as necessary. Don’t walk, but run to another opportunity. Pass this one by unless you are desperately seeking employment."
bad,"Upper level management is a den of thieves. You cannot trust a single thing that is said or done with those people. I wouldn’t work here if I was starving on the street. "
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"I quit because I had a toxic manager. People are moved into management based on personality and not skill.Creates dysfunction on team. The company has been declining every time it gets bought out. There is no sense of synergy. If you like the ""survival of the fittest"" environment, this would be your place."
bad,Awful culture and team dynamic.   Very little value on people or their well being; there is a reason that I left and moved on to something else.  1am phone calls asking about part due dates seems excessive
bad,"Most of my coworkers were great people, but there are far too many layers of management, and zero communication. Upper management is completely out of touch with reality; and fear of constant layoffs it's the only thing convincing most people that it's okay to work 10-20 of unpaid overtime per week. The pay is below average for the aerospace industry in general, and HR does not have you best interests at heart."
bad,"Small raises, no lean or continuous improvement even though they claim to drive ACE.  Only promote favorites and not much room to grow.  Could pick up some very bad habits if you don't know better.  Management has little to no experience in lean aerospace manufacturing and are not interested in improving processes.  Supervisors are just the favorites picked off the floor regardless of lack of experience.  Unethical management."
bad,"Horrible management, sometimes bordering on hostile. Re-applied for a different contract position but was not hired and received zero feedback."
bad,"When the team fails, it's the developers fault.  When the team succeeds, it's because of great management.  There is no win for the little guy in this company.  They value flash more than content."
bad,Too much nepotism. Along with lots of favoritism. Bad management is a big downfall here. There is no positive feedback from management. Management and HR make it seem impossible to obtain a raise and it brings the moral of employs down .
bad,Many changes in the time I was there seemed to breed uncertainty and instability.  Management changes kept expectations of job roles uncertain.  Keep eyes wide-open when interviewing.
bad,"This company will suck the life out of you and do everything they to make your life a living nightmare."
bad,Top management is a joke.  No respect for hourly workers.  More interested in metrics than making good product. Quality has been driven down due to the push to make shipments.
bad,"UTC Aerospace has a lot of opportunities. They seem to be going through a management change, so things could be better. Good group of people and a lot of overtime...sometimes."
bad,"Keine Leistungsgerechte Zahlung, ständige Kürzungen von jeder Seite."
bad,"The job has a variety of functions so it is not so routine that it becomes monotonous.  It is refreshing meeting/greeting aircraft owners daily and building relationships with them for repeat business  should they own a fleet of aircraft.  The hardest part of the job is that it is a very small office with four airline mechanics , a sales manager and myself and that I am solely responsible for all office functions and there is no interest in cross training with the current manager so my work/life balance can be somewhat challenging during busy seasons and I believe work/life balance is key when being the best you can be both personally and professionally."
bad,Company does not invest anything in their temps that start on the docks.  Training is minimal at best.  Myself and 3 other people were terminated one month before temporary contract was to expire.
bad,"Now that Goodrich has been bought by UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP (UTC), there is very little to be accomplished by working there as a contractor. UTC has decreed that no contractor will be able to work there longer than 2 years -combined with any or all of its subsidiaries! They expect you to work several disciplines that they should be hiring several contractors for. After you do a GREAT job, they kick you to the curb and say ""only 2 years""! And the worst part of it NOW is they want you to teach foreign nationals your engineering expertise so they can outsource the work to India & Mexico."
bad,"This company is great to start your career in aerospace, however, they vastly underpay their employees and the benefits are god awful. In sum, I enjoyed my time but am happily moving on."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"Management had their favorites, anyone who disagreed eventually was fired. Too much overtime. No advancement oppurtunities, even after relocating because of promises for advancement."
bad,"60 hours a week and always asking for overtime volunteers, company does NOT care about its employees all it cares about is the numbers. Benefits are the ONLY good thing about this company. PTO is a joke, Sick days are just pathetic."
bad,I am responsible for aftermarket project engineering including coordination of activities among groups and being the voice of the customer to help ensure customer requirements are incorporated into the product.
bad,They try to pay you in culture not cash. Been pretty disappointed from the start. Maybe i expected more from an aerospace company. And there new age policies makes it hard for a blue collar working man.
bad,"Fairly laid back place to work, until you start dealing with the management. The business managers dont do anything to assist with an issue. They have their favorites and if they don't like you, you'll know about it. You can work 180% efficiencies, but if you're not part of the good old boys you'll get the same base 3% annual raise. Glossed over for promotions, stuck on an off shift."
bad,"While Rockwell tries to emphasize ""building trust every day"" as their motto, it seems that's only because that's an area where they are so weak.  I've found the integrity of the business development and ethics offices to be quite low."
bad,"One can experience the worst and the best from management and leadership.  Some solid and very progressive new leaders.  Leaders from acquired companies tend to be inflexible, combative, resistant to change and progress"
bad,"Micro Management all day long by a large group of managers"
bad,Corporation is being bought out by a larger corporation. The coming loss of positions is going to catch many people off guard. Job outlook is not stable.
bad,"Work/life balance is not there, the UTC Flex is not for everyone, just certain individuals.  I really did not enjoy the company and the information I was given prior to employment was not true."
bad,"Management and job culture was immensely horrible. No room for growth even if you're qualified and educated. Salary and Union make everyone compete against each other versus work together. Managers seems to lack knowledge in their departments and they do things in an unethical way. It goes against its gears of integrity, people, performance, and ideas."
bad,"good place to work until bought by UTC,  now it is cutthroat and UTC has kicked everyone out that I worked with.  Many have contacted me for a job opportunity,  Would not go back and have no intentions on doing so.  Product was interesting and fun to work on."
bad,"Working at Rockwell Collins was a good place to work for the consistent, steady paycheck, But I would not work there again.  The amount of stress is not worth the pay."
bad,"Benefits took a dive in 2014.  PPO plan disappeared never to return.  Out of pocket healthcare costs results in substantially reduced salary.  Work-life balance is not.  Company culture places emphasis on appearances of valuing diversity and internal compliance and policy initiatives.  Heavily bureaucratic procedures result in repeatedly delaying projects.  This continues despite the recent appearance of the company stating that red tape needs to go away and processes need to be streamlined.  (Little confidence that a large corporation can /will actually accomplish this.)  Job security is high as long as one wears many hats and consistently works 50+ hours/week.  ""Flex Time""?  (What's that?)"
bad,Don't waste your time to apply here in Louisville. Management is horrible. Since UTC took over it's gotten worse and no one will do anything to help the culture. Lazy employees who only care about themselves and if they don't get their way they fuss and moan. Wanting to leave so bad
bad,"It's alright, people are ok, diversification is killing the work force. This  is causing promotions to people that are not as qualified as they should be to move up the corporate ladder."
bad,"Very  good company but a lot of internal fight is taking the charm away"
bad,"Upper management is shoty at best, low pay low raises benefits slowly being removed...  a lots of favoritisum with people.  Supervisor afraid to do anything about slackers and lumps those responsibilities on hard good workers"
bad,"Great products and a vast customer base made for a lot of pride in the job. Coworkers were wonderful people, very driven and intelligent."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"This job is very steady, 40 hours a week guaranteed, airplane seat assembly, coworkers and management are ok to work with, not the friendliest people."
bad,"First off, I enjoy what I do and am a very adaptable person, having had worked in the aerospace and military sectors for a very long time. What I did not appreciate about working at UTC was the total lack of support by upper management.  I have worked for many managers during my career and can honestly say that certain management had very little clue as to how to interact with employees and be a supportive force. I had many coworkers that felt the same way and the result was this concern was eventually brought to the attention of superiors and human resources. To say nothing was done by HR is an understatement.  Certainly, HR is not an advocate for the employee.  A bit of advice. Document. Document. Document. "
bad,"Worked at the Phoenix plant, became like the wizard of oz. Engineering, if I only had a brain. Site, needs courage. Human Resources in need of a heart to do proper due diligence."
bad,"Have learned many different skills in the field of machining. After 6 years of loyal service, a plateau effect and lack of opportunity has morale and drive at all time low."
bad,1) receiving and GRN
bad,"Not that many interesting and new projects available to work on, no R&D"
bad,Everyone will talk behind everyone's back. Mostly everyone there is negative. Just a big corporate company full of pointless meetings and paperwork that stifles growth.
bad,"Nice, intelligent coworkers.  Do not value employees voice or change ideas.  Continual change and no appreciation."
bad,At one time the product I worked on was number one in the industry. Since Rockwell relocated to Iowa the product has slipped considerably.   Customers are upset and leadtimes have affected production and delivery to the customer.  New management has not made very smart decisions.
bad,"Company has lofty goals but is too disorganized to complete them."
bad,unable to specify with any clarity;  unable to skip this - I would prefer not to leave a review at all. Still trying to reach the minimum characters...
bad,"Interesting work but no real training at all on troubleshooting their boards except from fellow technicians.  Forget management, they don't care.  The biggest thing is (and even Human resources knows this) their supply chain is completely broken and has been for more years than anyone can remember?  It just never really gets fixed??  So if you troubleshoot to component level (expected) you have to wait to the END of every month (last week) to get parts to fix and retest your boards so meanwhile they all stack up on you and then look out....overtime mandatory regardless of your personal life or plans including paid holidays.....they make you mandatorily work them regardless.  If money is all you care about with tons of overtime only at the end of every single month...you'll enjoy it.  If you want a life of no stress...forget it."
bad,"Poor management on a daily Audit processes to assure compliance to Quality practices, accuracy and completeness of Quality records, and work instructions. Support and participate in the Internal Audit process."
bad,"Not the best company and not the worst company.  "
bad,"Quick Pace, Need to be prepared to work many tasks and must have a good or above levels of many types of software engineering process, Great environment to work."
bad,I worked here for two years before contract expired. Worked 6 days a week and the occasional on call.this company likes t use temp workers. With little to no chance of becoming permanent.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"All they want is workers to show up, work endless hours with many working 7 days a week. Not concerned with employee well being or time off to rest. Management is so behind in their thinking compared to other manufacturing companies. If they don't come around they will get eaten up by competitors. Extremity high turn around in employees. Insurance is terrible with extreme deductibles."
bad,leaders was almost never around when you needed them. It made situation some time difficult to make an decision on issues that would arise. The leaders minds were often on pleasure more than business where it should have been. people had to rely on each other because of this.
bad,The company is going down hill uesd tobe good they care for the Employee. Now its just another quick cash cow and they can care less about you they will find uneducated employee make them work long hours low pay.
bad,while working for this company i ended my contract with the knowledge and skill set to move abroad in the division of Quality Assurance. Making sure that the customer had quality product delivering on time delivery.

bad,There is no family life while working second shift. No to minimal advancement throughout the company. I have learned a lot but feel as though I am running head first into a wall with this company. If you can load castings and repeat then you will do great.
bad,"To much stress putting on people. Was happy when my contract ended. However a good team and people are friendly. Overall wouldn't build a long lasting career, good place to gain experience and move on."
bad,Upper management has many people in the wrong positions. Your job title does not mean anything. Degree people is not recognized. They place the needs of personnel where areas our weak by helping in the progression for the next project scope.
bad,"I was based in Banbury at the UTC CTG Business Unit. My advice would be that if you haven't worked in a weak QMS, then this company is not for you. "
bad,"Good place to work, not so good people to work for. Promotions based on how you answer the questions and not on your actual experience."
bad,I enjoyed my co workers and working with airplanes. The hardest part of the job was leaving after 15 years. I would work there again.
bad,"Interesting place to contract, but don't count on a full-time offer."

bad,"Would consider working there full time if given the chance.  Management is on shakey grounds, could be more efficient and helpful.  Co-workers could be manageable with some assistance.  Hardest part of job is trusting your co-workers. Most enjoyable is having the opportunity to go do the job without someone standing over you all the time."
bad,Huge pay and benefits cuts after first year of employment. Pay and benefits were transferred to new hires...
bad,"- Managing a team for the NCM activities"
bad,"Company looking for young experienced workers who are willing to work more than 45 hours per week. Good environment for young programmers wishing to move up in rank, with nothing to lose. Management turnover is high and tends to work like new presidential appointment; re-evaluating positions based on management discretion and not based on previous positions or experience. Hardest part of the job is pleasing managers; i.e. No job security without good relationships with manager. Find a good manager and benefit from the training and experience in avionics product development, standards, and processes required for SW product certification. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are allowed to contribute to the accomplishments and success of SW product certification and delivery to customer. Need to embrace self-esteem on what you can accomplish. Work culture reflects the TV series 'Survivors' - need good alliances to survive culture of management discretion."
bad,able to learn things I never knew I would
bad,Too much emphasis on process engineering and recycling of legacy stuff.
bad,"Huge layers of management issues, culture of work - zero, continues improvement - what is this..."
bad,"The numerous changes in ownership and the lack of management embracing the culture change has severely hindered the growth of the department.  Additionally, the lack of focus on customer service will eventually drive away clients.  Lastly, the toxic work environment management has created by refusing to address employee inefficiencies and the inability to provide any accountability will be their undoing."
bad,"Upper mgmt divided/focused blame-shifting,"
bad,Since when i have my internship in collins aerospace they are all approachable especially in Galleys OPEX! Thay are all kind and generous. That's all.
bad,"SInce the UTC buyout, Rockwell Collins, now Collins Aerospace is in decline. The merger was poorly implemented with poor communications from leadership.  Loss of bonus, loss of benefits and more layers of management."
bad,"If you are one of the favorites, you can get extra training in order to have better chance of advancement and better chance of a raise at the end of the year.  OT is expected on weekends and no matter how much you do it is never enough."
bad,work culture is tribal. hardest part of the job is working with management and some coworkers. Upper Management may not be aware of the culture at this facility.
bad,"Cannot review atm as I am still here"
bad,Middle management is too far removed from the workforce. Policies and procedures greatly contribute to on time delivery of quality customer products resulting in costly reworks.
bad,"I enjoyed learning about the functions of the stockroom.  I had a position were I assisted production in receiving replacement parts they needed due to NCR or scraped in production.  I also assisted in pulling kits and parts for Sales Orders for replacements in the field. "
bad,"As a Planner III I have gained so many knowledge and skills with my supervisor. The Operations itself are supportive with our group. I have no issue on my work load, it is just there is no work life balance on my current company. "
bad,Your average day can be fair. Work gets done but it's always rushed. I have learned that the majority of employees works together as a team. Management doesn't! The hardest part of the job is watching management crush and destroy the moral of the employees who care. The most enjoyable part of the job is Learning. The company has many interesting areas.

bad,"The job and work is interesting.  Your able to work with various levels of management, however the career advancement is minimal and there is still and ""old boys club"" environment."
bad,"Management is arrogant and bureaucratic. That the walls have slogans about creativity is a joke. Any creativity is systematically crushed. The work is frequently very uninspiring. Even if you have the skills to do desirable work, only a few select are allowed to do it. One employee in particular, who is a terrible engineer, frequently screws up, ends up blaming others, and management does nothing about it."
bad,"Company lacked the understanding of a Quality Management System, or it's purpose.  Inadequate systems in place to support work loads and volume.  People were great, Management lacking."
bad,The work is simple and easily learned. Small batches. Management are up against it with the majority of the permanent shop floor staff but don't help themselves with their attitude. Large amount of animosity from full-time shop floor staff towards any contractors and some even refuse to show contractors what to do if you get stuck. Hardest part of the job was putting up with the blokes.
bad,The job itself is interesting and full of variety however culture and management leave a lot to be desired hence my reason for looking for other opportunities
bad,Management consistently implementing poor decision making in regard to LEAN systems and 5 S culture. End result is inefficiency and time loss in production. Management also  promotes a negative counter productive employee too employee work environment sub culture.
bad,"Difficult environment since UTC acquisition in 2012. Goodrich fostered a wonderful culture and when merged with Hamilton Sunstrand, comprised an employee-empowered culture. The employees are great."
bad,"Having worked in the industry for a good number of decades, I have come to find that Rockwell Collins culture has changed, one from being open to new ideas, willing to train and utilize a persons global talents to that of:"
bad,"Rockwell Collins bought a great small company doing good work. The company slowly changed the focus from building a good product to making a huge profit. RC added process, indirect charging accountants and  managers. They spend millions on losing proposal efforts. I don't think they will last in the Flight Simulator business much longer."
bad,"Plant management was weak.  Lied about progression and pay increases.  Plenty of overtime.  We were told ""safety is always first"".  In reality, production is.  Dangerous place to be a maintenance tech.  Benefits suck, with the exception being the retirement.  If you choose to work here, good luck. Watch your back."
bad,"Very challenging schedules, a lot of uncompensated overtime."
bad,"Incompetent Management"
bad,I ran reports and queries.  The culture in the building I worked in was very cold and unwelcoming. My manager had too much time on his hands and micro managed the people in his group.  The hardest part was getting through the day everyday.
bad,A challenging organization to work with due to a highly confrontational labor relations environment.
bad,"Pay and benefits great, but management and organization within the company was terrible."
bad,Population dominated by those at retirement age who are holding on and hindering innovation from succeeding.
bad,They do not hire for lead positions the way they should. Depends on who you are or who you are. Only one manager their seemed to care about the employees. The other ones were on a power trip.
bad,Workers are cheating the company. Managers feeds workers of their ego but workers who ate mostly vietnamese and Laotians are toxic and dishonest.  In one year there were more returns of products than expected in three years.
bad,"I was part of a massive layoff, even though my credentials were on target and even after I got rewarded for a design issue, with my input to a military representative it was approved."
bad,No room for advancement unless you're a relative or know a manager. Good ole boy club! Muat be an a** kisser to move up. Raises equal 20 cents per year. Insurance goes up crazy amounts with extremely high deductibles. Never get a head. 12 years and have gone up in pay about 3 dollars.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,Poor management and pay. Management gets bonuses for keeping pay under budget. Both offsite and onsite managers are responsible for hiring idiots because qualified people aren't offered enough pay. I worked with a guy who couldn't subtract 85 from 100. I will never fly again.
bad,"I hated my supervisor he is definitely a racist so I quite the job. I worked for IBM,HP, Lockheed, Boeing Delta Airlines, Honeywell and UTC was my worse job I ever had. They should do better evaluatingbthere staff"
bad,I love the environment of not so strict. My superior lets you improve yourself though lack of support. No bonuses and low salary increase. I've learned to be resourceful for most of the times.
bad,New company new infrastructure.  Was informed by leadership to get my masters degree in business to secure my position.  Then nothing happened with it.
bad,Reasonably good company but very less high-end work for engineering. Not a place for high growth individual but good for the candidate having good work-life balance. Learning opportunity is limited as exposure is limited due to many compliance-related issue and activities.
bad,"A350 Galley program has a lot of good people working on the project, but the lack of engineering control makes working there very difficult. Lack of management within the teams and therefore poor development of the teams. HR do not do enough to retain staff and hiring policy is not structured enough to hire the right people. Short-term thinking from the company no long-term plan to fix the route causes of the organisation."
bad,"I worked at UTC for 5+years. UTC had 14 schedule changes during my time, to the current work load of 4on/4off 12 hour days, with a high frequency of calls early am on your days off to come in for OT. They have no problems paying OT you work. Work loads are visually tracked and expectations are often unrealistic. Support and management are often unavailable when you need them. The Spokane plant has a very high turn over due to management, schedule changes and ever increasing production expectations. There are never enough people to meet production demands and every day you have to explain why your department failed to meet them. This leads to conflict within the teams. There always has to be someone to blame. Managers in general are inexperienced and overloaded, and don't always handle things the best ways. Communication severely lacks at this facility. Promotions are given to the most popular employees over those who are most qualified. This facility expects a lot from all of it's employees and doesn't care if you have a life outside of work. Before it was bought out by UTC, the atmosphere was ""family"" oriented. Now it is strictly ""corporate"" oriented. HR is no assistance to it's employees for any matters. Plant manager allows managers, engineers and admin to run the facility. Often times people spend more time micro-managing other people than actually contributing to successful production."
bad,"Strange and ineffective middle management made up of mostly clique-ish Gen-Y and Millennials. More meetings than you can count, managers who don't LEAD but whose only job seems to be to take metrics on artificial milestones resulting in micro-management. And did I mention ageism? Process and knowledge of fancy toolsets are more important than experience and knowledge of the company's main end products - the actual AVIONICS suite!  A once traditionally-great avionics leader now a Silicon Valley-like software developer posing as an aerospace company."
bad,"Hires anyone off the street, very low expectations. You have to be someone’s favorite to get any type of raise or be noticed. I can’t believe this place is still afloat with the slackers with horrible work ethic yet they are the ones getting merit raises because they make buddies with the bosses.  Almost impossible to get fired from. If you are a hard worker do not apply here. You will be disappointed to know It doesent matter how hard you work, the guy that works half as hard as you will get the same respect."
bad,"Fun workplace, not micro managed.  Company is closing so morale is a little low but overall they are ok to work for.  Daily job consists of pulling kits to support production.  Hardest part of the job is standing all day.  I enjoy pulling parts to meet production need."
bad,"Not enough people to do the work. Management has different philosophies than previous company Goodrich. Goodrich was more people oriented, UTC is more share holder oriented."
bad,"To start, the benefits are perfectly fine. They eat into your checks if you are an hourly worker, but otherwise they are fine. The vacation time is great. They pay below the national average for the positions offered at hourly pay. Management tends to care more about their own problems than the problems going on with their team. When it comes to advancement, if you are any good at what you do, it is your manager's goal to keep you moving horizontally. They don't want to lose you. Then we get to job security...at least at the location I was, someone can say anything they want about you and it is held against you until it is either proven or disproved. The issue with this is that they consider you guilty until proven innocent. Once they find that you are innocent, if they have caused you to lose more than half of a paycheck they will hunt for any reason whatsoever to fire you to avoid compensation. I myself have dealt with this and I know of other employees that have dealt with similar situations. It starts as someone made a complaint about you, then it turns into you did something against the rules that you didn't even know was in the rules to begin with. It doesn't matter how good of an employee you are. You are never secure."
bad,"Our quality management team has changed leaders within the last couple of years. All they care about is supporting production and moving hardware. They don't care about following procedures, and the quality personnel on the floor have no one on their side. Quality supervisors of technical areas have absolutely no idea what their subordinates do, and have no desire to learn how to support their employees."
bad,"Work life was decent. But the office setting wasn't the best, dark and gloomy. Projects were completed slowly and often late."
bad,"Overall good people to work with, but they seem to hire people who are incapable of their positions to lead a team. Hard to follow a leader who doesn't know what he is talking about nor has he ever been in the field before. Very much a favoritism environment to advance."
bad,"Great corporate image however the UK segment lacks finances and low sales forecasts"
bad,The union is behind the times and expects everything.  Upper management does not want to fix problems. they just want to keep the union happy.  Which puts front line supervisors in a bad position.
bad,"travail interressant mais que des cdd et interim ,j 'ai travaillé 5 ans en mission diverses.c'est regretables ,heureusement j ai pu m investir dans une autre société plus interressante et plus digne."
bad,"You are forced to work in unsafe environment, so the company can retain their status as a relative new branch of United Technologies."

This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,"Leave all your previous experience at home cause it won't be welcome at Goodrich. Protected aging workforce, no training for new folks, strange culture, management needs to step up and drive organization to the next level./.."
bad,Management has changed but the culture has not. They will do anything to ship product. There are better places to work in the Portland area.  The government side of the business is run worse than the commercial side.
bad,"I'm a current contractor with this company, but after 1 year of employment with them, it is highly seen that they don't treat contractors as their own.  They treat contractors as outsiders and they don't get invited to their company functions."
bad,"I don't much to say about this company is not too bad if you can make it in their favorite list, not to much room for improvement, but it pays the bill and is somewhat stable."
bad,"If only the Mission statement could have been actualized, UTAS would have been an amazing company to work for. Unfortunately senior employees toxic behavior and counterproductive work ethic ultimately ended my time with the company. Eventually those hostile and ungrateful employees will retire, but will it come soon enough?"
bad,You will not have to worry about getting laid off here.  With work ramping up they are hiring a lot right now.  Very good stepping stone to get into the Aviation Industry.
bad,"Not much to say about this company. Not good!"
bad,A typical day was eight hours. The hardest part was modeling foam and leather in Pro-E.
bad,"Quotes to customers by email, getting quote approvals back from customers any where between 10 to 25 a day. Talking to customers on the phone , tracking there equipment down and letting them know where it is in the process and how soon it will ship giving AWB's. Working with Technician's out on the repair floor working with Shipping Receiving. Dealing with AOG's and Urgent requests for major Airlines and business jet. Foreign and Domestic."
bad,Rockwell Collins was a flexible company which would work with employees to meet their needs. The UTC merger has resulted in scenarios where I am frequently forced to choose between my family and my job.
bad,"Cette entreprise a ete ideale jusqu'a la venue d'une nouvelle direction. Celle ci a detruit litterallement l'esprit d'equipe et la qualite au sein de la societe."
bad,"This company used to be a great place to work until they became top heavy in upper management. The company makes cuts in staffing due to gross over-spending on image rather than updating the most important aspect of the business, production."
bad,Company overloads hard workers to a point that health and balanced life do not exist. Working over 70 hours a week for many years has it price. Life is too short.
bad,Too many hours just standing around.Poor management.Lack of materials. Overtime and Saturdays nearly every week.No inclusion in the business. Rules not enforced.
bad,"I’ve had good and bad experiences at Collins Aerospace, and it depends really who you’re reporting to within the organization. Human Resources is minimally involved and their focus is to protect the company. Overall, it was a good job in terms of compensation and benefits. Work/life balance is a joke (again, depending on who you report to), and it’s extremely competitive. That’s the culture."
bad,"While the work life balance was great and the autonomy was nice, the workforce and culture ruined everything. You could hear a needle drop 24/7. My coworkers would not talk much to me, which originally I thought was because I was new. However, as time went on nothing improved. I realized they don't talk much to each other either. Very sad place to work."
bad,"To each his own, seems like people only teach you their basic troubleshooting and keep their own troubleshooting know how to themselves for job security. I have more knowledge than my co worker and I produce more product but butt kissing gives him more edge."
bad,This company has made too many cuts to save on expenses.  They are working on getting more contracts but the cuts have put undue stress on the employees
bad,treat employees unfairly. poor communication between management. no raises for cost of living. nearly impossible to work your way into a better paying position. terrible benefits
bad,"A cool niche app, however the managers had no vision to take it where it needed to go"
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
bad,Fast paced work environment but stressful at times. Rewarding because we helped fellow employees with their benefit questions. Enjoyed working there and I learned a lot about the different benefit plans  Liked my immediate supervisor a lot.
bad,most jobs were exciting and fun to work on. loved the experience working on aerospace equipment. was able to fit in and provide the extensive experience required to be successful as a senior tech. learned a lot of new things. glad to have worked there.
bad,Rockwell is more interested in quantity than quality. Nice co-workers. Hard to advance. Management skills are very poor.
bad,"receiving in material "
bad,The people are great and the company could be too if only it could agree on a singular path forward where all the departments worked towards the same focus. Currently the departments all fight against each other to meet their own metrics which may or may not work with each other and the customer's needs.
bad,"Rockwell Collins is a good employer but there is a lot of pressure to perform under almost impossible conditions. I could see how it would be easy to have a mental breakdown, and people have them weekly. We work a great deal of overtime but it isn't forced which is nice. There is a lot of freedom as far as listening to your mp3 players, but they expect to much for the little that they pay from their employees."
good,Lack of Team Management and Growth Potential. Only been here 3 years but wow is there no place to grow no matter how hard you work.
good,Many logistics issues after the merger between UTC and Rockwell Collins. The work life balance is skewed due to lack of adequate resources and proper attention to programs and customers.
good,"I started working for this company, prior to the company being purchased by Rockwell.  Entire operation moved to headquarters in Iowa and several positions in Texas.  Only a skeleton crew remains in Charlottesville.  Small office, I really enjoyed my employment there when it was Computing Technologies of Aviation (CTA).  My position"
good,They only care about the office people. We are just modern day slaves to them. They say they care about workers safety but you constantly handle things that can kill you. They have no respect for their employees.
good,little work no overtime and no room for improvement if you need to know something full time employer would tell you wrong info
good,Great place to work but working this long thru temp service is crazy to me they say hiring comes from home office they dont see the extra effort you put in your job
good,"Management is poor and  not supportive. Human resources is only for the upper level managers and do not have time to talk to supervisors or hourly employees. Very very political in the way they promote and will not listen to any ideas coming from people who are not in their circle, even supervisors."
good,"Old school heavy handed, beat the stuff out of you management style and very difficult to enjoy. On the positive side, good benefits, many people friendly, and onsite cafeteria."
good,"A typical day at work consists of opening customer boxes and inspecting units for damage, contamination and discrepancies. I learned a lot about the company and the process of repairing electronic aviation units. Management is terrible and a handful of the co-workers are two-faces, liars and hypocrites. All in all if you keep to yourself, work hard and focus time flies by."
good,Upper management is out of touch with reality but everyone else is pretty cool. Job security is a constant concern.
good,The training for this position wasn’t done correctly. There’s lots of this knowledge regarding that you should know how to do this already. With never even seeing or working on this before. Management seems extremely lazy and is more involved within themselves than helping others with information needed.
good,"This would be a great place to work if the upper management was all fired and replaced with people who actually know what they are doing and not just money hungry. There is way too much drama, bullying, and harassment and when you bring it to upper management they tell you to just try to ignore it and dont let it bother you instead of fixing the problem.The overtime is mandatory. Schedule is monday to friday from 7 to 3:30, but most likely you will be working monday to saturday. 7 to 5:30 M-Th, F 7 to 3:30 and Sat 6 to 12 or possibly 6 to 2."
good,"It's an okay place to work. Management could use an update seeing that for my group, I was given no direction from my supervisor. The rest of the team was amazing though."
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits. Company lacks on good management skills and diversity when it comes to women in leadership roles. Not focus on individual employee career growth."
good,"Our plant got shut down over poor leadership. The Tucson plant had a weak team of directors. Two of them had no business being in those positions as they would disrespect others on a daily basis and had no clue what processes took place in the departments they managed. I would not work for either of them again. Other than the lack of leadership and horrid overtime (mandatory for months straight, 1-2 days off in a month) the people and decent benefits made it worth while."
good,"Both Estimating Groups lack viable Predictive Analytical skills, ARCO and Learning Curves are the analytic ceiling for this group's skill set. Parametric Estimates are not Trendline based, if done at all, in fact they are completely lacking in any in house Risk Modeling and/or Data Fitting tools. Leadership demonstrates no willingness to comprehend that Estimating is only as good as the information at hand(Estimating doesn't operate in a vacuum, viable values don't come out of thin air, viable Estimating is rooted in Data Analytics). "
good,"Job Security isn't safe. not a nice place to work. there is no place for progression. No Communication from management, this place has lost its atmosphere"
good,"very cut "
good,"Company is antiquated as far as its Operating procedures and working environment. They are definitely doing a lot with a little and seem to be very efficient at getting this accomplished. It is not a bad place to work, it definitely could be a lot better."
good,too focused on $ and not taking care of the employee. long day and little or no positive feedback. little or no opportunity for upward mobility or lateral for that matter.
good,"A typical day at work is being placed in a situation where you are overwhelmed and underpaid. I believe the pay is so low because it forces you to work overtime in order to survive. "
good,"This company is very demanding of your time and views production employees as mere tools. Management is extremely disorganized and rarely   has a decent plan to meet customers needs, other than throw labor at it until the orders are complete, often over the weekend due to the inability to receive material until Friday. They do offer a good amount of PTO, to bad you'll have to use it to get the weekend off."
good,"Experienced discrimination, high turn over rate in the HR department, a lot of drama, lack of respect..... There is a lot of favorites being played throughout this facility, no matter how hard of a worker you are if your supervisor or manager doesn't care for you don't expect them to have your back if something like verbally assaulted happens to you, and if you go to HR don't expect to get any results the personal changes so much in that department its hard to keep up with whos in charge"
good,"I have learned a lot in my tenure at Rockwell Collins.  It is a fast paced environment with plenty of opportunities for growth.  "
good,"Elementary Management team. Creates a poor work environment that takes advantage of good employees. Too often the focus is on quantity and not quality. Team Managers have little to no interpersonal communication skills. Salary does not meet the industry pay rate. Very toxic environment that is created in the boardroom and passed down through the directors. No feeling of job security even after going above and beyond to support the customer. Even after working every Holiday and literally preventing a line down situation at Airbus and Boeing numerous times. Management accepts all the credit. A place where you are a number and not a human being. I literally had to put close to $19,000 in overtime because noone would help me achieve customer demand."
good,"Due to the UTC policy of limiting contractors to a 24 month assignment, our whole department will be wiped out by July 31st, Tooling Engineers, Tool Designers and NC Programmers.  I can't for the life me, understand why there are limits in terms on length of employment.  "
good,"The service and repair of a wide range of CNC and PLC operated machines and plant. Promoted to team leader in 1996."
good,I would like a fun workplace with fun co workers. I would love a job that everyone get along with each other.
good,It is hard place to work and survive. Need to dedicate all of your time to the company
good,"The pay is decent if you’re salary, but the environment is toxic. The people on the floor are great and work hard. The company, however, is poorly managed, and turnover is high."
good,"Regardless of you accomplishments, leadership will promote those that are politically savvy and are perceived as friends. Small groups of performers drive company results and are rarely recognized."
good,"Collins Aerospace has found that systems engineering is more difficult and involved than expected.  Management has the usual foibles: short-sightedness along with lousy contracts.  The engineers that allow themselves to be caught up in the poor planning tend to suffer with unreasonable demands and schedules.  A typical American corporate engineering environment, however. "
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Those with kids should be ready to be under scrutiny anytime you take time off if your kid is sick. Managers do not seem to care about the employees, just their own backs to climb the ladder."
good,"I actually worked at Goodrich Corp(purchased by UTC). Lots of design work there. They were always very busy, which I prefer. All Management decisions were made at the home office in SC, so very little got changed or improved at Goodrich. Low level management often times had little idea what was produced or what was needed. The most difficult part of the job was the fact that Goodrich was ""for sale"" most of the 11 years I was there(2 as contractor) and they acted like it. No new ideas or improvements, just keep production moving. Many people lost their jobs in order to make the bottom line look appealing to any prospective buyers!"
good,"Long hours and fast paced. Attention to detail and organizational skills definitely needed, flexibility and ability to work under pressure with high expectations is the type of environment this is."
good,"The work is interesting, full of new and innovative ideas.  Leadership severely lacks training and competency in being a leader, which leaves a large lack of communication and understanding between employees."
good,"Work environment and culture is good since most of the people are friendly and nice. However, management is so toxic that they neglect the career growth of the employees. The recent mass promotion was based on the length of stay and not just based performance which is unfair for most. No proper training and discussions are provided. Health benefit is very good, but any other else is unjust."
good,"Too much focus on this day, this month, this quarter leads to massive overtime at month and quarter end.  The company drains all inventory to make sales, leaving people with nothing to work on come the first of the next month.  Layoffs and contractor furloughs are common.  I think there were 6 in my 3 years with UTC.  Executive management lacks a vision and direction for the company and can’t see past this month or quarter’s results.  Quality always seems to take a backseat to production numbers."
good,Decent place to work. Just not that exciting or challenging most of the time. Systems testing on the Avionics Rigs was the most rewarding part of the job.
good,"There are a lot of responsibilities, too many for one person. You are working with another person sometimes unless they call in, then your by yourself. When your by yourself you can only do so much so of course you fall behind on your daily responsibilities. Don't even bother suggesting ANYTHING to management because they will act like you came up with something great and lead you on to thinking something will get done when in reality they have no intentions of following through. Long story short it is a fun place to work but they will work you into the dirt. The most positive thing I got from working there was my supervisor at night was an incredible individual and I will miss working along side him enormously."
good,Management likes to try and play mind games to force you to work overtime. Management also has unrealistic expectations of mechanics. Steady job but also underpaid with very very slow advancement. Management will also play favorites.
good,"Although you get a better pay for this area, you must be willing to give up your home and family life, because the company doesn't care about it's employees, and works way too much over time. The company is poorly managed, the supervisors are unable to do their jobs because of the poor management, which in turn, makes it harder on the union employees to do theirs."
good,"The practices they utilize are very old and they do not work, management knows this but they are stuck in the thought process that as long as it gets them by everything is ok.  Overall management attitude and actions have a detrimental effect on employee attitudes and work ethic."
good,"Since Aerostructures was purchased by UTC, the culture has dramatically changed. Financial metric have been driving all decisions."
good,"Over the years, Company has gone to a very high deductible plan. So unless you are very healthy, you will be spending a lot on medical, on top of the monthly fees."
good,"I work with a great bunch of people, however; the management does not recognize the talent of the individuals who work there. A typical day at work includes meetings with the customers, completing metrics on past due shipments, answering questions from management. The hardest part of my job currently is explaining to the customers why their products are constantly behind schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers."
good,"The Duluth Office is real big on the ""good ole boy"" hiring system. You will find alot of the upper management are more buddies than qualified educated managers."
good,"RC is a company based in the midwest, trying to grow on the west coast."
good,Customer Support/Help Desk
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"I would've liked to retire here, but they trained me for a month, just to let me go three months later. Makes no sense to spend so much time training someone if you don't have every intention of keeping them!? And if you're temporarily out of work, call the people you've already trained for a month and who have three months of experience back in, when you get more work, instead of hiring new people!?"
good,"Poste peu stable, il m'a été proposé plusieurs remplacement pour au final n'en avoir qu'un à temps partiel"
good,Stressful work environment with little to no opportunity for advancement within the department.  No support from the self promoting manager with constant threats and criticism.  Otherwise the pay and benefits are good.
good,"Management here is all over the place. Some areas have some legitimately great people here, and others not so much. I know that pre-merger UTC was attempting a culture change at this site, and it currently sounds like Collins is up to the task. This is how I rank the corporate area as of right now."
good,"The company only promotes the people they consider favorites and the management turns a blind eye to people not doing their jobs, allowing goofing off over doing their jobs."
good,A typical day in Rockwell Collins is coordination with counterparts in another country. Most decisions that will be done in this company will be based on the counterparts decision.
good,"Lack of training, poor management, favoritism, definitely a ""Trump"" atmosphere.  Great opportunity for the younger generation and if you know someone who works there."
good,The culture and Management is left to be desired. Not a fun place to work. Management isn't supportive and only looks out for themselves. Not a fun place at all.
good,"Interesting work but not well thought out project execution. Company is being bought out again but now by UTC and this may take some time. Most people are contractors and work hard trying to do the right things. Absolutely no training, just start and figure it out mentality. There is turnover but not constant. Most office coworkers are nice but one manager has some personality issues that need to be addressed. Contracting brings decent pay overall but usually without vacation days. I was lucky enough to work with a few caring and supportive people who did know how to treat people and helped keep you safe by being on task even though it is crazy unorganized. There are many things to learn so it is up to you to put in the effort to get the most out of your time. Stressful but not a toxic environment; just changing priorities so often it feels like you are never going to get things accomplished. Rockwell Collins is probably at fault for not supporting this location: layoffs happened a few years ago and contractors hired to save money. REALLY not any way to run a business. Still, I will stay till they let me go when my project ends unless I can slip into another task here. The most enjoyable part of the position is dealing with coworkers, plus the computer IT support staff on location is very helpful and pleasant."
good,This company is in the middle of a take over after being bought twice. No security at this time and the leadership is awful. Right now the company is still BE Aerospace but will soon be Rockwell Collins
good,"Overall good people to work with , had no Insurance , vacation or benefits . Really enjoy the work I do.. Working with all the different departments , Engineering , quality , delivery assurance , sales people"
good,"One of the good company with poor management."
good,". Good palce for an entry level i mean entry level with a good knowledge of CNC machine"
good,"Albuquerque location is proud to have been part of over one-hundred successful mission critical rocket launches with zero failures, serving NASA, and the United States Military, as well as providing quality Aerospace systems that support our troops in the military and in the field. A typical day for a production scheduler involves operational support to all departments, including but not limited to Engineering design and development, CAD, Configuration Management (CM), Supply chain, Project management, Quality Management, Stockroom and Manufacturing management. It is a rapidly changing fast pace environment that involves critical thinking and problem solving skills. I have learned a lot from my co-workers including the ability to implement original and creative solutions to challenges in electrical manufacturing and production. The hardest part of the job has been dealing with change, from implementation of a new MRP tool and resistance to it, to organizational changes. The interaction with co-workers and the teamwork environment, specifically at Albuquerque location has been the most enjoyable part of my job. Unfortunately, the Albuquerque site is scheduled to be closed at the end of September 2016."
good,Learned many aspects of wafer processing. Friendly co-workers. Management could be improved. Hard to deal with the culture. The variety of tasks makes the job more enjoyable.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Company is great global culture, but post acquisition, there has been a drastic change in leadership view point. Company is going backwards in terms of employee engagement, performance reviews and benefits."
good,"Many positions here require someone else to do their job before you can do yours. Sometimes, that process gets skipped. Pay is ok, Insurance in not. HR is constantly changing. The work is easy, but the job is hard. Stress is usually high."
good,Nothing much to talk about. Standard work like any other captive. Some units have manufacturing attached which make it good place to learn technologies.
good,Clicks everyone was in  CLICK just like high school Management has its favs If you are not from the area its is had to work there everyone is related or drunk buddys
good,"Was working at UTC for 8+years. I make 2 cents more then ppl walking in from the street! NOT OK! I am a good worker, plenty of over time (only if you meet your production rate of at least 85%) done many higher paying positions for a short period of time but still...not compensated for it. Little to no rewards. PPl will throw you under the bus BEWARE! FAVORITISM GALORE BEWARE! HR is a joke bullying goes on there."
good,The hardest part of the job is the communication with management. The most enjoyable part of job is having a day off to be with family. Not every day is promised to have work to do being we only get one shipment in a week we have to plan out our week by our work we have. Overtime is always available they assume u have no life outside of the job and want everyone to work every weekend.
good,"Work environment and culture is good since most of the people are friendly and nice. However, management is so toxic that they neglect the career growth of the employees. The recent mass promotion was based on the length of stay and not just based performance which is unfair for most. No proper training and discussions are provided. Health benefit is very good, but any other else is unjust."
good,Management spent too much time micro managing.  There was not much opportunity for advancement.  Job was stressful because of micro management.  Job security was weak.
good,Fair (not great) place to work. The layoffs they choose do not seem to make sense.  They lay off good workers.  Company is in the process of merging with another company as of end of 2018.
good,when you need to talk to your supervisor it's as if he's hiding. I worked in the etch room where there were always hydrochloric acid leaks. often times ending with a sore throat and a headache. no telling what it's doing to your lungs. maintenance is good when they have the parts on hand. but the pay is good if you don't mind selling off your health .
good,The company facility was bought out and employees replaced then whole place was shut down. They moved all the machinery to new location. Lost all jobs
good,The people of company(the workers) are great and most everyone gets along. Management is however toxic and disregard people with families. Often expecting people to work 15 or more hours a day. There are many other workplace culture issues that have led to a lot of long time employees to recently leave for better treatment/pay for what is expected.
good,"Good place for EE or software engineers, the rest, not so much.  Unless you're in HR, they move up steadily.  There's no career path provided, you're supposed to write your own but not told what constitutes goals that qualify for a move up."
good,"could be a great placed to work except they have gone overboard on the lean Mfg concepts and try and control and track everything...lots of wasted time in wall walks that take away from productive time, basically, they want you to do more and more with less and little time"
good,Some good pockets to work in but overall greater focus on bottom line than people development.  Government work can be unstable depending on contracts in place.
good,"Rockwell Collins management is very inexperienced.  It is a good thing they were acquired by UTC.  Hopefully, UTC will provide the necessary leadership and vision to bring the company forward and transform it from a Cedar Rapids centric company to a true global player."
good,"I started with the company in March of 1989. Working in the sheet metal shop. I have learned a great deal about fabrication work in my many years with the company. Since my previous position has been outsourced, I am now currently in assembly."
good,This would be a great place to work if the management knew how to run a company. There is no life/work balance. If you have the misfortune of being on second or third shift you're treated like a second or third class citizen. No communication and it feels like the lunatics are running the asylum.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UTC.  Unfortunately, they closed the facility where I worked and I was unable to relocate.  The Job was stressful and there was a lot of emphasis on making schedule."
good,the work is not bad but most of the management team doesn't really know how to manage their employees. and the pay is not very good and you won't get anywhere.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,Not much different than other corporate jobs. Business side of the organization make far less than those in IT. Politics like any company. who you know is very important.
good,"Large organization with high budgets, lots of departments and chiefs."
good,"Really big, procedurally hamstrung technically amazing company.  All the best tools are at your disposal.  The bad news is that they have a tool for every microtask you might need to do and they're all different, they don't talk to each other and some are truly, deeply flawed.  You need to be a very patient techno dweeb who really enjoys the esoteric, with a really thick political skin, to thrive here."
good,"I currently work second shift, and I have gained further knowledge of reading and understanding blueprints.  Management is great, along with my coworkers.  The hardest part of the job is the hours, being second shift, and the most enjoyable is team work between my co workers."
good,"Old Ways die hard. Very Poor Management. Parts Pushers. No respect  for Quality. Lots of good people make up the workforce, but he the ineptitude of leadership, with the type material they handle, is something to behold."
good,"There is no ""typical"" day at work.  Each day is a new experience."
good,"PLEASE DELETE THIS OR DO NOT ASSOCIATE IT WITH ME."
good,"Company needed lots of improvements but hired people when needed and didn't burn out their employees."
good,"- Everyday, we attend meeting for safety reminders, urgent parts, customer feedbacks and instructions."
good,"I was involved with two implementations due to acquired companies in the ISR division. Because of Goodrich's unique product line, we tested the golden thread rule through out the implementations to streamline processes, to the limit."
good,Neurotic preoccupation with minutia at the expense of creative solutions to real production problems.
good,"place has decent pay, benefits could be better. 12 hour shifts suck, working nights and weekends isn't fun, and working most holidays. They have a high divorce rate because people are usually unhappy because of the long shifts and working nights and weekends and holidays."
good,Excellent poste pour apprendre les bases de la mécanique
good,No room for advancement within the Company.  Communication barriers between job roles that are continuously talked about but nothing ever seems to get done.
good,Management look around for talented and skilled employees to move them to the next level. Work so hard and others who do not work as hard get bonuses/awards.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"It was an interesting place to work. Had management been better, things in our department would have been improved greatly. Once you get past the groups of individuals are established there, you'll do fine. If they don't like you and dont fit it in, this is not a place for you."
good,"Bureaucratic processes are considerable, which inhibit effective execution of job tasks. Leadership is caring and amenable to recommendations. Some of the employees' culture is very unpleasant. Vacation is generous but medical and financial benefits are not as competitive as other businesses."
good,"Work-life balance varies heavily on the manager. If you find a manager that is willing and honestly believes in work-life balance rather than balancing life around work then its an enjoyable experience. 50 hours was the normal expectations for the group I worked for. Anything less than that don't expected to be promoted and you will always be just average. Again heavily depends on the manager, but even when you're experiencing real issues in your personal life like getting cancer or having a spouse die the expectations are still the same."
good,this company is moving to Manila Philippines i shipped all goods to them along the way i have acquired a Dangerous Goods shipping certificate i have knowledge in all types of shipments
good,"Since the arrival of Collins, the chaotic culture of continuous churn, firefighting and long unpaid hours is normalizing toward more stability.  The pay is not great, but if you want to live in Colorado Springs it is not the worst option either."
good,"People are interested in making sure you understand your job, if you have any questions, somebody who previously worked your job, will help you. You have breaks throughout your shift and paid lunch break. People who work there are really friendly and helpful. Glad I got the experience to work there."
good,"Change of senior management 18 months ago led to multiple managers and others leaving . Direction was completely different. Style and approach to situations by senior management was humiliating in front of others when trying to solve problems, you could taste the fear in meetings. Bottom line was the business was making good profit at Marston so corporate bosses over in States were turning a blind eye as to how we got there. It's a shame a lot of good people with vast experience were let go, majority were hard working and honest too. Many have not been replaced so pressure is so intense on those that are left. This is why I left myself."
good,"Overall:"
good,"Team environment is exceptional with everyone down to earth and wanting to help each other. Management needs major rework on picking projects, standing up for their site and acknowledging the work of the employees."
good,"I worked at Windsor Locks, Connecticut."
good,"I found the work/life balance to be a little more tilted to the work side than I liked.  Stressful work environment with too much to do in too little time.   It's not all bad - if you can get past the sheer amount of work thrown at you, the company has solid pay for the area, good job security, and some good people working for it."
good,"I work in Shipping Department, It's hard work, a lot of lifting and packing, with little or no help. I do my job very well. I am responsible for all the days orders to go out. When you are a team of 2 it is a very hard job."
good,"Too many Layers of Management. Management seemed willing to listen, but never took any action. I only met one Manager in 8 months that I would recommend for hire anywhere."
good,Pretty good place to work. Great benefits but the pay is low. Love the people who I work with. I'm looking to continue to improve my skills and add knowledge and continue to learn as much as I can about the business.
good,"The company I started for in 1984 was not the same as when my employment ended with layoff in 2004. It was sold to Lockheed, then Hughes, then Rockwell . Avicom international was original employer. It had been sold to Rockwell around 2001. All down hill from there. Hope they are still in business."
good,"Good company,poor management and no room to avancement or to move up. The company was bought out by textron on Jan 31st and when textron took over it became a better company but still poor management."
good,"Work is often based around theory and not real results. I am more interested in contribution to the bottom line, rather than just creating power point presentations that never become reality."
good,Production is poorly managed. They reduce staff every year. You never know when your time is up. They promote career advancement but never actually follow through.
good,"They work you to death. But the pay is good. Managers are fair. Some days are OK. Legacy employees clog the system, which causes problems. Depends on department and location/"
good,"work environment was good, management likes to really take advantage of those who go above and beyond. you never get a merit raise, upper management discourages employees from even asking for one ."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"As with other large corporations that are the result of a series of mergers and acquisitions, some locations have a culture that may be different from the corporate culture. The best way to navigate this is to do what is right, no matter what."
good,Rockwell Collins used to be a family oriented company that was great to its employees.  Over the last 5 to 7 years it is all about the money and employees come last.  Its a shame.
good,They need to be more professional in management. It is very much on relationship based. The opportunity and the talent are are equally distributed and it's hard to be recognized if you are not in the manager favorite list.
good,"Good work environment ,horrible management. Treat contractors unfairly and lie to them a lot . Constant change and rules do not apply or everyone. Shipping & receiving department management is the worst and unprofessional"
good,UTC is not a bad place to work but it does have some draw backs.  The moral is low in general but the pay is above average.  Some individuals are unwilling to make the hard decisions to correct little items that effect the long term items.
good,"utc aerospace its big aviation company,all the product will tested following international stardart.u will learn and your skill will follow international standart."
good,"Loved the work and had good benefits, but the leadership philosophy is more stick and not much lead by teamwork. when I reached age of 62, things changed."
good,"I was a Packaging Engineer Contractor and was never able to obtain full time employment.  For that reason I began to look elsewhere for employment.  Unfortunately, they do not seem to ever grant full time opportunities to their contractors."
good,Great place to work. Projects are well planed and executed. good training programs always learning something new. Good pay and benefits. Company likes to promote from with in.
good,"Work place culture is not good and there is no option to promotions there is no value for operators"
good,"utc , and their business model is to replace american engineers with indians, and the company who is aiding them to do so is quest .from india.they are also abusing the visa systems."
good,If you like working ALL the time this is a job for you. Only 1 day off a week. 12 hour days. If your sick or if your spouse has surgery to bad. Be at work or they will replace you.
good,Expectations are very high. Most opportunities are at headquarters or flow through headquarters.  Work hours can be heavy depending on your aspirations. More minorities and women in leadership would be beneficial to the company.
good,"UTC offers pretty good benefits, as well as pay."
good,It was a good place to work until this new manager came and disturbed our nice work environment. Came in like everyone was beneath them. I use to hate to hear that person voice.  Overall no one in the plant liked that person.
good,never knew what to expect when going in each day. Some days covered up some days waiting on parts. Last days of the month   were very hectic getting parts shipped on time.Most enjoyable  part of my job was the people I worked with on a daily basis
good,RC is a typical A&D company - great technology but it moves slow.  The CEO is trying to change the culture of the company.  Continued focus on empowerment is needed.
good,"Ok, not much on the designside. manufacturing centric, lots of differnt bosses to report to. heavy chart generating. FAA paperwork"
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"La paga es buena, pero el ambiente pesimo...mucho desorden, falta de organizacion, falta de liderazgo, favoritismo, incumplimiento de las reglas de la empresa, desigualdad..."
good,"In 2012, UTC bought Goodrich including our 200+ person division which has been designing and fabricating spacecraft electronic boxes for 50 years.  The local management is generally good.  But we have been burdened with UTC policies on top of our own procedures.  This has degraded productivity (for me & some others) over the last 3 years.  SAP was implemented with some major hiccups.  It is better now, but it still inhibits rapid purchase requisitions, purchase orders and travel expenditure reports.  SAP is considered to be painful by anyone who doesn't use it every day. We now have our 3rd site manager in the last year and a half. Fortunately, he had previous experience in the same position and same location, so we have some hope of stability.  "
good,great place to work great people but the pay scale and promotion movement is slim to none. Opinions are encouraged but rarely listened to. Equipment was state of the art but could not get common fixes for regular equipment.
good,"Good Organization to be in, if you had just started your career. Team is collaborative, professional and work 'smart'."
good,"Company is good to work at. Some opportunities for young engineers. Pay is not progressing unless you go to management."
good,"Company has family atmosphere but lacks work life balance and career growth, too much of nepotism by the Management which is demoralising employees"
good,"Small close knit culture transitioning into a larger corporation environment  as Goodrich was acquired by UTC and merged with Hamilton Sundsrand.  I was exposed to  the Post Delivery Service side of the business as I was supporting  a sustainment program working closely with the Logistic team and the use of the SAP ERP system."
good,"Lots of really good, intelligent people."
good,"•	Perfected major document tracking Excel spreadsheets compiling data and reports for four vendors to be used by "
good,"Lots of meetings, and more meetings. I was an intern, so income was low, and any time the plant was closed, I didn't get paid except for exact holidays. Lost 2/3 of a paycheck at Christmas."
good,Work started at 4 in the morning. Did maintenance on aircraft wheels. My co workers did a good job in making my job easier by informing me of what to look out for.
good,"People are very hard working, team oriented, disciplined, goal oriented."
good,State of flux.  Not sure new owner will make this a profitable company.
good,"This is completly for India Design Center"
good,Large company with many roles. The time out of the country(6 months a year) was ok as a single person. Now with a family my circumstances have changed. T
good,"Good place to work for but, if it wasn't for the management and people that do the scheduling for the parts "
good,"my typical day is ok ,but if i have a problem with something the management cannot make a decision on it so its very desorganization"
good,Overall a good company but needs improved Management training for using experience engineers more productively.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,Work/Life balance is great based on flex schedules and flex time. Pay is lower than the market for any position that is NOT an engineer
good,High leadership is great! Company’s mission and vision is great too .You want to work for them but they don't utilize people skills and potentials always correctly..Company tends to be a great global thinker but with local behavior and mind set . The result is huge turnover …….A great company to start....
good,Major contract cancelled. Layoffs. Company was OK but could have improved working conditions.
good,"Hard to get new tools when you needed them, had a lot of people working with nothing to do and even tried every week to get people to work on their days off (with still no work to be done)."
good,"Goodrich has a lot of work in house and coming its way soon. The management team has no problem spending $250,000 on new ergonomic chairs and desks but it won't give some of its most competent workers a raise to retain them. This is a company run by the older baby boomer generation but let me tell you, they know how to make quality parts fast!"
good,MDSC has a lot of capable engineers but unfortunately does not believe in effective project management and performance monitoring. No wonder why the projects are rarely on budget and in schedule.
good,"A good company to work for. It is very slow at times. With so many new people without the skils, it is hard to complete the job on time. Training is needed for the employee to boost there Skill level."
good,"Things were going well, until I received a project I had no idea how they wanted it completed. I did my best and got instructions after mistakes were made. I had been getting ""your doing a good job"" from my boss  and even had a quick meeting telling me they were bringing me onto the team, 2 days later i was let go. I think if the training was better, mistakes would not have been there. Plus, when your new, who is not going to make mistakes?? I feel they handled it badly."
good,"There is a couple  different  departments, there all good environments.  everyday you learn something new. every body is really help full. you learn how to build panels."
good,Some days were more difficult than others. Working for different bosses with different agendas and personalities was challenging but could be accomplished if told truthfully upfront what is expected.
good,"I worked at Collins Aerospace full-time (More than a year). Ethical company. Wide range of opportunities and ability to move between program management, business development, engineering, and operations."
good,"Management, although not terrible, falls behind other companies I've worked for in the past with regard to supporting their employees.  Being told multiple times over the course of months that something would be addressed by management only for it not to be. "
good,the best way to do the job comes from the people who do it every day. They were rarely consulted about anything. Super superiority complexes in middle and upper management. not all though.
good,L'agencement des cellules au niveau montage évoluent de manière régulière afin d'améliorer les conditions de travail et sécurité
good,"1. 48hours work/week"
good,"Management was top heavy and not too flexible."
good,Overall experience at UTC has been a great venture. Fantastic opportunity to sponsor your career development and many opportunities to promote within the organization.
good,"Even if my pay was doubled and I was offered amazing benefits,  I still would have left. The manager over me was incredibly rude and disrespectful. Some days the manager didn’t even acknowledge my presence. On numerous occasions I would email her regarding employee requests and I would get no response. Sad, really."
good,The company encourage networks including family ties. A department head helped a young graduate with the same last name being promoted 5 levels to a Principal Program Manager in 7 years.
good,"UTC is a good place to work, except for the fact that certain departments require you to work 70 hours per week, not a good Life/Work balance.  Management seems a little off, could do better."
good,"My day at work was good, learned everything that was provided for me to learn but, needed to advance  in other areas but did not give me more opportunity to advance"
good,This site has a lot of very dedicated employees - but in the short time I was there the management team had 100% turn over!  The company did a major reorganization and corporate did not understand the demographics at the site
good,"Fortune 50 company that demands a lot from their employees; there are ample opportunities to learn and be challenged. The work is difficult and demanding but very beneficial to career growth: I have learned an extraordinary amount while with the company. However, they do not pay nearly well enough for the work that is required; compensation is not competitive when compared to the local market. Furthermore, the company promotes far too slowly often leaving talented employees frustrated and eventually looking for opportunities elsewhere."
good,"UTAS is a typical large aerospace company market and profit driven. They outsourced a lot of work to doughtier companies in India, Singapore, Turkey, and Mexico. The UTAS major engineering site in Chula Vista, CA is shrinking rapidly.  UTAS lost  major deal of work on A320Neo Nacelle which they owned 100% at the beginning."
good,"never had materials in. poor management, always had to leave work early because there was never work to do. i needed more hrs. 20 hrs a week sometimes.."
good,"It's a typical office environment, cube farm. Very large facility.  Although, there are many events I'm not included in because I'm a contractor I do like learning to work in very large and complex QMS, with multiple locations."
good,"management is overly optimistic with their timelines and does not listen to subordinates. Benefits are average, however certainly not very competitive."
good,Management is not effective. The management types and levels are too many. Some business groups are out of consideration from upper level managers. The organization has become complicated.
good,The company is having growing pains but is great work life balance.  Management has changed numerous times in 7 months.  My contract is through Jan 2018.
good,"Working two and half years as Temporary employee and there is no hope to be permanent, loosing health insurance, no holiday/ paid leave."
good,Time studies are done on senior welders who have been slacking their whole careers. I welded on average 3 times the average while I was there. The other welders hated me for doing it. They said I was messing up the time studies and was gonna make the company expect more out of everyone else and wanted me to use up all the allotted time on the jobs. It was a constant hassle with the other slackers in there. The culture is to not do your best. A new metallurgist came in and weld tested before I hired in and only one welder who worked in the titanium room passed the class A aerospace tests. The other welders who were welding 4130 and nitronic 40 all failed their tests and were given their certs back even after failing the tests. They found out that the guy who had been testing the welders had not been testing them properly. Most of the welders in there cannot pass a class A aerospace test and at best are class B. The main reason for poor welding skills in my opinion is the cheap pay. They expect a welder to start around 20 bucks an hour.
good,"If you like big corporate workplaces than this is for you. Lots of room for advancement and the compensation is terrific. However, you are a small fish in a  very very big pond."
good,ok culture is very interesting  and brings opportunities and challenges at the same time for the most part. All in all good working environment. good experience.
good,"It's an OK place to work I can't really but in down, it been good to me for last few years. A lot of BD behind close doors. Just not my place to be. To many friends"
good,It can be a good environment but it's very depressing and people tend to let you down. Nobody really cares about the employees and harassment runs rampant. HR takes forever to address simple issues and turns a blind eye to misbehavior.
good,"I have learned numerous areas of aviation expertise .Overtime available .Frequent team  support meetings,Safety regulations are highly enforced"
good,"Over worked and understaffed. Wages slightly over minimum wage for technicians. This is for field workers. Job security is good though. However, turnover is high with UTC due to low wages compared to industry standards."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,Unfortunately micro management and negative culture from Rockwell Collins' headquarters in Iowa creates a work environment that is counterproductive and difficult to work in.
good,"Duties included, but not limited to: being responsible for the receipt and shipment of incoming materials, supplies, and products. Receives goods, verifies items against the record of shipment, and inspects condition. Gathers, verifies, and packs items for shipment according to specifications and the transportation method used. Records received and shipped items according to established procedures"
good,"During my 17 years of service at Rockwell Collins, I am always an advocate for change is good, but for as often as they revolved my direct leadership was hindering our progress and guidance of company goals."
good,"Une entreprise aéronautique juste à coté de l'aéroport Charles de Gaulle."
good,"If you are looking for a job this is the place. If you want a career look elsewhere. For an assembler with this company I had little to no oportunities for advancement, and the yearly raises were never enough to compensate for the raise in the economy. The management, and other employees are good people, but the lack of ambition in most makes the mood feel depressing."
good,"Rather not comment due to their poor management skills. Good money , lots of overtime. too much turn over in higher ranks."
good,Good place to work with good job security. Metrics driven company.
good,"Depending on the shift, a typical day will start with a tour of the section to ensure people know what job they should be working on and to see if there are any issues. A daily start up meeting with WED to see raise any maintenance issues, followed by a management meeting to discuss the days priorities. Raising any necessary work orders and meeting with the quality department to close out quality issues. Still involved in production, so will slot in where required. This can involve conventional or CNC turning, assembly or de-burring. Co-workers are the the best part of the job, an extremely skilled and talented group. Going through a site closure, so dealing with the stresses that accompany this are easily the hardest part. Motivating and consolling are the order of the day."
good,"There are many great individuals to work with, but there is a pre-1980's management environment.  Benefits are reduced quarterly to help meet the stock market commitments.  Unfortunately, there is not much left to take away."
good,"Rockwell has 3 different components - Government, Commercial, and E-Business.  E-business is a cut throat environment and is no place for the fragile soul.  Play the game and play it well."
good,"The management or i should say lack of was not ideal. I was an employee that worked overtime, was always on time and was never sick. I got let go due to some minor issue. I believe my dismissal was due to the fact that i applied for a senior position."
good,"Co-workers were great to work around, a lot of good team work and a great Leader"
good,Just follow the leaders and you'll be liked. Enjoyed working with team members.
good,Challenging work environment that provides a good first hand experience in navigation and defense based programs.
good,"Management top heavy."
good,Good people. Management style is very militant. Worked long hours problem solving. Sometimes there were dog and pony shows instead of real process improvement. Very capable people there waiting for an opportunity to use their talent fully. The hardest part of the job was motivating others to do the best thing for the business. The most enjoyable part was interacting with good people who wanted to make a positive impact.
good,"Production of plane undercarriages for Boeing, Gulfstream, DHC-8, Airbus, military and other aircraft. Work on software within ISO standard."
good,"I was a temp employee working for Remedy Staffing at Rockwell Collins. I ran the 2nd shift computer operations. I ran reports, input data, monitored system to include the network, input payroll and had the shift all to myself. Nice job and nice place to work and people there were very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this place as one of the top places to work in Brevard County. Unfortunately, they did not make me a full time employee for whatever reason, too bad , too sad :("
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

good,"Temporary contract worker. No opportunity to become permanent."
good,"One of the best place to start your career. Company invests a lot in training and development."
good,"great environment and always willing to learn more to move up in the comppany , family oriented business with a great benefit package for its employees"
good,"Unfortunately for the moment, i choose not to review my current employer as my duration with the company hasn't finished to enable me summarise the whole experience."
good,Did not quite enjoy my time at Collin's Aerospace as I felt that the work there were more slow-paced and mundane. There was little innovative going on within the Aerospace Industry and that probably attributed to it.
good,"I like the job but not the long hours. 106 hours every 2 weeks."
good,"Some upper management needs schooling. A lot of friends and family type issues.•	Provided day to day working leadership within a production facility by ensuring that safe-working procedures, good housekeeping practices and all company policies are adhered to at all times."
good,Great place to learn engineering - all disciplines are used at work. Not a good culture however. Company has been a mess since acquired by United Technologies.
good,Must be able to work with tight deadlines. Constant change of priorities on a daily basis. Will be on call if needed at moments notice. Management is required to be on site a minimum of 45 hours  a week per current site management.
good,"Collins Aerospace is the very best at what we do and what we do is change the world. We design, create and deliver the most advanced and diverse range of aerospace and defense solutions on the market. Each second, a flight takes off with one of our systems on board."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  9 Hour workday Monday through Thursday and Fridays are half a day all year around.  Flexible hours as well."
good,Nice to work and the employees are okay also.  Benefits are good for manager only and higher ups.  High attrition rate for supervisors and rank and file.
good,"More improvement in terms of benefits, like giving bonuses, paid VL and SL in full not in partial. Salary range base on the role job not really as good. Yearly increase not quite good also."
good,"Collins is a large company that pays well. If you want be a well paid cog in the wheel this place is for you."
good,Très peu de nouveau projets. Expertise technique. Présence mondiale
good,"Working in Aerospace is quite rewarding. Knowing that you work on items on an airplane is pretty amazing."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities to advance with this company. Depending on your manager, your career can take off or stagnate. Managers and HR work together to discredit employees. Culture is awful with UTC."
good,"Company was great in the beginning and more work prevailed the amount of mandatory overtime got to be some what unbearable at times.The moral went down hill with all the pressure of overtime and eventually people just gave up and went to other resourses for a job"
good,"Job is not aligned with what i expect and the salary is not aligned with the respected salary for Engineering graduate. Also, my leads do not have a particular plan for our improvement,"
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

good,"it new environment work experience, nice to meet different type of attitude of my co-worker kinda interesting to see how they react to changes that i brought"
good,Great opportunity and learned much about my field in finance in such a fast pace environment and large company. Compensation and advancement opportunities are limited.
good,"The culture of the company is changing, it is becoming more business and less people oriented.  Management is not regarding their people as vital resources to help improve the process of quality..  They are also lacking the value of team building and relying more on self preservation."
good,The assignments are challenging. However the scheduling of deliverables for the assignments are very demanding. The enjoyable part of the job is the completion of assignment.
good,"It's been a great place to work. Flexible hours for Engineers. Team work environment. It is a small place <60 people, but everyone are well known, good collaborations working environment."
good,"Can learning new method new parts of filght ,understanding of work site safety come first go for traning team work ,using of tools in right time and proper tools ."
good,learned to manage different product lines and engineering department. Learned lean manufacturing concepts to  improve processes to ensure employees are successful.

good,"Its a good place to work with good pay and benefits that are competitive. "
good,"A typical day at work would include setting up machines for the current part needed to fill out a work order, checking parts to make sure they meet blueprint specifications."
good,Rockwell was a great place to work when it was B/E Aerospace. It grew to fast and it was not prepared for it. It then turned into a stressful place to work
good,"I did a variety of tasks from computer data entry to packing parts according to the shipping order. If your area was slow , we would help in other areas."
good,This place is everyone for them selves. Leadership is weak and there is a lot of back stabbing. Things get done but not always right and most tends to look the other way.
good,"They were ok.  When United Technologies bought Goodrich Aerostructures out, the culture changed.  CSC came in, and the relationship changed, and we were suddenly ""the enemy""."
good,"8 - 10 hour days as supplier quality engineer. "
good,Lot's of learning and challenge to the work environment. Many friendly co-working helping each other to finish the work load fasts and quality. More opportunity a wait in aerospace company and you will learn to be person with discipline and dedication for give a 100% quality in every work you done
good,a typical day is like every other freaking job and this is ridiculous to have to write something like this.  I am not going to offer my opinion on anything about this place
good,got discouraged when I could not learn on the computers on field; even though have no access to the program and to improve my skills  I actually need to need to practice!
good,"It is nice to work because it has good ethics, has good benefit for employees who want to go to school. Plus they have really nice holiday vacation and lot of diversity and safety at work."

good,"A good company to work for with competitive wages and benefits for the area. three most important concepts for the company are safety, quality, delivery. In that order."
good,A great  place to get an education. You can transfer between business units and keep your or increase salary. Some people can work remotely and have flex work schedules.
good,"Very challenging work environment, with opportunity to progress for individuals who are driven and motivated. Good, salary, benefits and job security."
good,The work environment is stressful and often complicated. Management is based in Oakville Ontario and not personally connected to working conditions in Tullahoma.
good,It was a good place to work. Learned a lot of new skills at the time while at Lucas Aerospace . Unfortunately I was laid off after some restructuring of the Company.
good,"Wont advice unless required.RC has acquired BE.I am not sure about RC policies r any other benefits.But now BE is under their cap, and they really dont have much of a freedom or good work profiles, I surely wont advice untill unless you desperately need it."
good,"Fast-paced, at times chaotic with a single minded goal to meet delivery dates on time, no matter the financial or human cost. If you like fast paced work environments and hefty work loads, this one is for you. I you like your work life balance to be, well, in balance, don't even think about it, it will burn you out. "
good,Before changing companies. Very good place to work..Very good working conditions.Liked my job.Was happy to go to work everyday.Enjoyed my job and did my job very well.
good,Work day is fast paced environment. Very competitive work ethic. Workplace culture is relaxed. Work provides lots of training sessions. The transitions are smooth.
good,Under payed for the amount of work .Management only care about numbers not the employees. Co workers is great to work with and benefits is fair. Lots of overtime is demand by leads and if turned down they will call you in the office.
good,"I was involved in a few interesting projects as an intern here and the pay for interns is probably the highest in the area. Good place to learn and gain experience as an undergrad. However, job security appears to be non-existent here. The company hires and fires based on project. If job security is important look elsewhere."
good,"It's a job.  I liked what I did and the people I worked with.  As a technical writer, I depend on other employees for work and review.  Generally I would get my work done, turn it in for review where it would sit neglected forever."
good,Everyone that worked at the site i was located at were not too happy about being there. There was constant complaints about personnel years back when i was there.
good,Productive place to work for with a potential for a stressful environment. The pay and benefits is highly competitive with competing companies. Employers are usually friendly

good,"The people that work at UTC Aerospace Systems are great! Its a fun environment with with a collaborative culture, but the management is very top down and it is difficult to make improvements or changes as all things must be approved by division and off-site leadership."
good,They put safety first. They are involved in ACE training. Included in the 5 S program which is part of LEAN manufacturing. Housekeeping is very important in production.
good,"Very busy every day with lots of goals and objectives."
good,Lots of time off and the people were great. I enjoyed working here. Pay was good and benefits were not bad. Work life balance was good. I enjoyed working here.
good,"Can't really give a lot a feedback on the company because my interaction with the staff and leaders was limited.  However, the company has a unique blend of generations (millennials to baby boomers)."
good,"Apply here only if your interested in furthering your education and have a high tolerance for ignorance. Hopefully this changes as management changes, but no time in the foreseeable future."
good,"Great company in terms of products. Workmanship of operators is stellar."
good,UTC is a poorly organized company. Management and associates are at a total loss of normal business communications. There is a lack of communication within departments generally.
good,they give you lots of training. very fast paced. pretty good benefits. work 9 hour days but get every other Friday off. they have lots of different jobs from test to assembly.
good,management has driven plant into the ground benefits arent great and pay scale is out of date. would be a better place if  management had a backbone and looked after its own employees
good,"Working in this company is a big experience for me. Very challenging and must work hard to get the high pay especially when doing overtime. For me as a foreigner, it is an advantage for me to earn more. Though salary is not that quite high, through overtimes i still manage to get the salary i want. Management is ok, they look down to us and meet what we need in the Production. My work there as a Quality Technician and Quality Calibration Technicians build more personal growth in me. I see myself doing things that i never thought i can do. I love my job here. I love the people around here especially in my Calibration family. Its not only dealing with the tools and equipment, i also encounter and doing stuff in our vendors or third parties."
good,"A typical day at Rockwell is very stressful.  There is always a push and very little reward.  Promotions are hard to come by if you are not in the right network, and so are raises."
good,"The job was challenging, but very rewarding in overcoming the challenges. The hiring practices are not as extraordinary as you would expect from a large company."
good,"I was with B/E Aerospace and when they were acquired by Rockwell Collins we were notified the first day that our facility would be shut down.  I understand it was a business decision, but it is hard to understand and accept."
good,"Rockwell has its headquarters in Cedar Rapids, IA. They do have other sites in Irvine, CA, Wilsonville, OR, Sterling, VA, Richardson, TX, and Melbourne, FL. However there are few opportunities for growth in any of the locations outside of Iowa."
good,benefits where acceptable but was getting more expensive every year. they had a good advancement for people that work hard and are knowledgeable in their work scope.

good,Management is supportive and open minded.  The company is one of the top ethically rated companies in the country.  Teams are often reorganized with little input from team members.
good,"Set-up, and operated CNC machinery for complex subsystems and components for aerospace, aircraft, and missile programs. Measured parts utilizing micrometers, height gages, dial indicators and go/no go gages among others."
good,"Typical days are fast paced with demanding schedules.  Little to no tool training create employee hardship.  Employees are highly skilled, personable, and embrace teamwork. Site managers refusal to communicate honest forecasts and continued blame of upper management created atmosphere of gross mistrust of job security. Enjoyed accountability without micromanagement."
good,"Focused on keeping first pass fill rate in the high ninetieth percentile while at the same time trying to reduce unwanted inventory dollars. Coordinated with buyer and production control to manage material flow in accordance with production and customer needs. Also to determine resources necessary to meet production schedules, determine progress of work, and completion dates.  Worked with customers POC in regards to production schedule and meeting commitment dates."
good,Very interesting and technical place to work.  Built very high avionics products such as overhead guidance displays for commercial and military aircraft.
good,Its my First Company. The work environment was very good. We have ample of time to do the work.The colleagues are good here.We can learn many new things.
good,Its a good place for contractors if they want 6 months rolling contract. Job life and life balance can be bad depending upon project but most of them were bad.
good,"A good place to find stable employment.  A great place to be if avionics and aviation are your passion."
good,"Awsome company to work and get lot of informations from the company"

good,"Give us your opinion about"

good,"Une expérience sur une pièce intéressante et un grand groupe."
good,"My co-workers helped make me feel a part of the final project. Lots of opportunity to learn new skills. Very fast paced, but if you have the desire you will take a lot from your experience here."
good,your typical large corporation. lots of opportunities though and room to grow. can get lost. lots of room to move around and laterally.

good,"Rockwell Collins Operating System"
good,It is a good company. I would be an investor but until the corporate vision is shared by all I would not work there again. I think the lower level managers need more management training.
good,"I come into work and perform the tasks I am given, but they do not challenge me enough.  I get bored because I am not cross-trained in enough areas to multitask throughout the day.  Some of my tasks take a long time and I could be doing other things while I wait.  I would like to pushed with a steady workload and provide a benefit to the company I work for while I am getting paid.  The hardest thing about my job is trying to explain to my supervisor that I would like to learn more, but he doesn't listen.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"- every morning have a meeting to share information regarding any updated."
good,"Good pay, easy work. The hardest part of the job is remembering you have to leave at the end of the day. Management depending on where you are at leaves you alone to do your work."
good,Job included the assembling of aircraft radios with a constant emphasis on having no defects. Benefits were very good.
good,"- Team spirit is important"
good,"Management de certains service ne s'appuie pas l'éthique. Il y a malgré tout un bon esprit d'équipe."
good,Company bought out by UTC. Tough environment to work in. Lots of challenges that need to be worked. All about business. Not much for work life balance.
good,"A typical day at work is from 7 am to 4 pm some days with OT, in my almost 9 years working at Rockwell Collins got a lot of experience on inventories, warehouse transactions, Quality  assurance, the management has the Mexican culture which is not good, they need to know they are working in USA not in Mexico.  Co-workers are the best, with some problems as all have, but overall we get along very well and have a great time working together."
good,The NASA contractor is treated like a red-headed stepchild.  The current environment in the space industry is not real good unless you are a civil servant.  I enjoyed working for UTC initially but am looking to leave.
good,"A busy place to work "
good,"Rockwell Collins was temp job for four months. My Daily job was to build cables, assemble kits,label the parts and cleaning the units. Working with co-workers was very helpful and I enjoyed working with  my co-workers.The company had lots of overtime which I enjoyed doing."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed working at the rock. Work environment smooth. Enjoyed working with hands. Working as a contract employee the transition to full time was not attainable at the time. Management team was supportive and kept employees well apprised of new guidelines or policy changes.
good,"Interaction with all levels of the organization, both locally and nation-wide at all times. Plenty of advancement opportunities available if you are willing to move out of state. Health benefits are adequate."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"It is definitely a good company to start with as I had joined as a fresher."
good,Fair company overall. Need to invest more in development of managers.
good,no real opportunties for moving up.  Work is different each day.  Hardest part of job is working with a variety of people and their attitudes on any given day.  Co-workers are smart but not capable.
good,Not much to say.  I was not at the company long enough to provide a meaning review
good,"Es una Empresa donde aprendes mucho y muy rapido,tiene un alto enfoque en mejoras de proceso y desarrollo de su gente"
good,"Development and Production of Head Up Display system components for Commercial and Military aircraft."
good,"I worked my way around many parts of the lifecycle of a number of products. Production was fun and teams worked well together and acted like a family. Project transition was a great learning experience, but provided little growth opportunity, and Engineering development, though fascinating, was very limited to those without an engineering degree as the company does not have a PMO - Project Management Office. My hope for the company is that they will see the value in combining Technology Managers with Business Managers in order to allow the Engineering Managers to focus on their technical expertise, increasing creativity, quality, and efficiency and allow the Business Managers to maintain everything else within the lifecycle processes (scheduling, resource, scope, budget, and risk management). Partnering for success is key. Good Luck."
good,"if you enjoy sitting all day , looking under a scope and doing the same thing over and over again day in and day out this is the job for you. The leadership was extremely poor here and the people worried more about what your doing then the work they are doing .very frustrating place to work!"
good,Very challenging after being acquired by UTC. No opportunity for advancement.
good,It could have been a better experience. Pay was low. I did not like it that much.
good,"I like this work place, full of life, fun and competitive. i need to relocate to my home town so i need to get part with this organization"
good,"good place to work, friendly people"
good,Had enjoyed the work place. Fun atmosphere. I like the Summer concert and long winter break.
good,People make the difference at Rockwell Collins.  Management are short sighted.  Focus on Lean and Diversity.
good,My present employee use to be very exciting and well motivated to work at but things fall apart when the company gave us the notice that it was going to move to Mexico.
good,Typical day is the same everyday. I have learned to solder circuit boards and inspect circuit board. It is typical factory work
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,Nice company to work.
good,"I work on a variety of containers, or bottles each day. Other areas bring bottles that have something wrong with them and I have to troubleshoot and find out how to fix them."
good,"Learned a lot to write ECO/ECR, to read sheet metal drawing."
good,"Was nice until they closed and move out of Cleveland. I did learn a lot and took advantage of all training available. I really enjoyed working NDT and working in the R&D lab. Every day was something different. My day was never the same. I did have some normal inspection work, supporting production control. But I also was involved in trouble shooting and documenting areas that needed improvement. Work with both Manufacturing and Design Engineers.."
good,You come in and work independently. No one over your shoulder at all times watching your every move. Management is very friendly. Office is setup where even people making six figures are scattered around in the same area as people on hourly wages.
good,they were ok to work for. untill they decided to close the plant.
good,"Excellent adherance to standards, and very thorough documentation. Disciplined environment."
good,"Driven to make and meet commitments to customers, investors and employees. This drive puts pressure on work life balance."
good,Inspect electronic assemblies to Prints and review build books
good,Purchasing and reviewing stock daily would be a typical day including NCR management.
good,Excellent compensation. Able to achieve a good work/life balance. Good MRP system
good,Watch your back. Favoritism is at large within facility. A must have ability should be upon interview.. Do you kiss butt? Job advancement is very difficult to achieve. Communication is definitely not within top 10 expectancy.
good,I was a contractor for Collins that needed health benefits and therefore needed to pursue full time employment. It is a good company that required lots of overtime from its employees.
good,Poorly managed. Lots of money spent unwisely while benefits for employees are not enough. They treat older and senior employees unfairly.  Some employees seem to be very lucky and receiving a lot of promotions in a very short time while many other who are more technically  savvy are stagnant. Interview and hiring process is ridiculous.
good,"Lean and continuous improvement is the driving force behind the company and it is everyones job to improve the efficiencies of their daily work practices.  It is fast paced and high stress and very challenging.  Managers are expected to know and understand their people, their processes, their metrics and to develop solutions to problems, issues and opportunities on the shop floor."
good,I work in the PNW and enjoy the area a lot.  The people at work are generally very courteous and good to work with.  The work itself can be a little boring sometimes but the technology is top notch and exciting.
good,"Workplace culture"
good,The job was what I needed when I needed it. I got to work on high profile tasks. I got daily experience with a variety of design applications.  I enjoyed my time there.
good,"Good company to work for. They have areas they could improve upon just like any other company. I value the work/life balance, but with their was more opportunity for growth and development."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"On the surface the company looks le a great place.  Once established in the ranks, it's apparent that the only focus is dollars.  The constant spiral of continuous improvement is merely for show.  Management doesn't support quality initiatives. Metrics are ignored and the only thing they show is a lack of action from leadership/ management. Management will flat out tell you they don't have time to train up employees.  Individuals have been let go for fraudulent maintenance encouraged by their leadership who is still present. Absolutely no accountability. People constantly overstep their roles and responsibilities in order to support numbers and will disregard established processes and procedures making it more difficult in those areas where lines have been crossed.  This degrades the morale of the employees and creates a constant battle for those who are truly passionate and engaged. Leadership goes so far as to take customer goods and transport them in their personal vehicles, violating too many requirements to count, just for numbers.  The manuals/ procedures are ignored even after leadership approval.  The current QM has started multiple times that he cannot wait for his 12 months to be up so he isn't required to lay back relocation costs.  The previous QM to that created a toxic relationship between Ops and Quality, pulling wool over everyone's eyes until finally let go.  It's a shame they don't embrace the excellent employees they do have and merely look to just stay afloat to get by.  This place is all show and no action. This is very well known amongst the rank and file"
good,"The overall experience has more to do with your individual management team, than anything."
good,"maintenance repair and overhaul of the Aircraft component,"
good,Rockwell Collins use to be a very good place to work until they started focusing on positioning the company for a sale.  It turn into a company that cut costs at the expense of the employees.  It was great if you were a stock holder.  Maybe this will change now that UTC owns them.
good,Relaxed place to work.  Has flexibility for hours in some cases.  Will work with people going to school.  Hard to switch to a different shift.  Paid Christmas Vacation from 24th-31st of December.
good,"The people are good and the job I do enjoy.  what this issue is once someone leaves or is laid off, they do not hire but expect others to pick up the work load and they do not backfill which cause a very stressful working situation."
good,Had their own agenda and had favorites.  Co workers complained their job was not what they wanted to do and that it was more stressful than others and went behind others to fabricate negative stories.
good,"Rockwell Collins is a good place to get started in your career or to use as a stepping stone, but I would recommend against a long career here. The workflow is incredibly slow and largely dominated by reviews and testing, and the median age of my coworkers had to be at least 40+ so don't expect an exciting work environment. Plain, drab, aging."
good,"Has a lot of opportunities for advancement, you either want more or you get relaxed and comfortable. Lunch trucks and cafes are very nice and convenient, food is okay. not a huge fan of wearing safety glasses."
good,"UTC is a good place to work at. Company constantly driving for innovation."
good,Lay off was abrupt. No time to say good bye to coworkers. Company was in good location. Hours of work was excellent. Compensation was good same as other companies in the same field.
good,"Can be better, good place to work with. However, there has been lots of management changes lately due to two acquisitions that took place, Rockwell Collins and United Technologies."
good,Jobs changed continuously.  Comradeship between employees could stand improvement   There was interesting work sometimes cooperation between employees was lacking
good,"Good company with less pressure and lot of space of innovation. Friendly management."
good,"Continued change in direct leadership is what has evolved with them from what I have seen in my tenure with RC.  Their intent is well, but the switching of talent prohibits focus of team to be successful of continued guidance from leadership that corporate does not realize the impact if they demand these type of alignment.  Overall they are good as long as you can change, and change again within a less then 3 year span...continuously."
good,"A typical work day would be full of teamwork, discussions and sharing of ideas. We learned the different parts of the product, the different production processes and techniques, and I was also able to learn the interesting lives of my co-workers and teammates. "
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Not a bad company. Good place to statrt in the aviation business. The working condition is not bad and you get the benefit. The supervisors and the same as any other company, some are good some are bad and seems lost but they don't bother you."
good,"I enjoy working at UTC...most days. I have built many bonds , among many people, at work. The environment is average for the corporate world. Every once in a while, they will throw us a gift card, or a ""morale burger."" However, it is frustrating seeing coworkers told there is not any money in the budget for raises, but you see tens of thousands of dollars spent on meaningless landscaping, and basketball hoops installed in the parking lot. The amenities are poor, with vending machines that malfunction, or ""take"" peoples money. Bathrooms are poorly ventilated. "
good,There was very poor and unclear communication between upper management and management at supervisors' level. Our manager was handling more responsibilities than he could handle.
good,"It was required to work extremely long hours. However, the people culture was interesting to learn. Unfortunately, when I first started working there, time cards were hand written in by the employees ( very hard to verify for a supervisor)."
good,"Process Oriented good work culture."
good,"Not a bad place to work, A lot of very dedicated and smart people. Pays well and offers a good work life balance. Stressful at times."
good,"Great place to work if you enjoy high workloads "
good,Great products and good employees and local management. Insane level of processes with a lot of repetition and poor data management. Upper management is not very aware of what all needs to be fixed and when they do know the process to change the process is ridiculously long. I didn't see anything change the entire time I worked their.
good,Rockwell Collins encourages movement within the organization however there is always a hiring freeze and the opportunities for growth within the company were very limited.
good,The company is good to start your career. The ethics in the company is great value. The management is usually very motivating and supporting for career growth. The compensation is not par to the market place.
good,"Rockwell Collins is an ok company to work for.  Management evaluation issues, good pay, nice people and very organized."
good,I was employed to cover a maternity role as Marketing Admin/Assistant in the Government department of Rockwell Collins. It was an enjoyable and varied role.
good,"Decent place to work.  Work life balance is up to the individual.  People there are generally pretty nice.  Occasionally you run in the ""big fish in a small pond"" person which is common in cities in the Midwest.  Advancement isn't always the greatest because of the Good ol Boys Club mentality there. Management can be overbearing at times.  There seems to be many extra layers of management which can get pretty inefficient when trying to accomplish simple things.  Pays well however you earned it by dealing with a lot of fluff which can be stressful at times.  This type of environment is common amount places that have government involvement.  Regulation, paperwork galore! Overall it's still a good place to work."
good,"The Benefits were great, but the management and bureaucracy left things stagnant and feeling like things would never change for the better. In my position there wasn't much opportunity to advance as the leadership was very entrenched. The Hardest part of the job was answering phone calls with no support documentation and no one to even teach you how to troubleshoot the equipment. no manuals or if they were there they were very limited."
good,Opportunities to grow and enhance skillsets.  Challenging tasks that covered both commercial and government contracts alike.  Great group of engineers and supporting staff.
good,"I am sure overall Rockwell Collins is a nice place to work however I was in a remote location that translated to ""stepchild""."
good,"Reorganization after reorganization after reorganization after layoffs and fired managers and more reorganization has made the management structure and leadership (at least of the part of UTC that I work for) a complete and total mess.  It's the exact reason I am looking to leave the company after being with them for 10 years.  Co-workers and the work life balance are great.  I will miss them, I'm sure.  But I can't deal any longer with having 3 managers all in different states who don't communicate with each other and who give me conflicting objectives and instructions.  Its impossible to succeed.  Maybe someday they'll get their act together and UTC will be a great place to work again, but many of the good employees are getting tired of trying to wait it out."
good,"UTC promotes Continuous Improvement in multiple areas including production, administrative, and delivery in effort to continue to provide customers with a great experience. UTC also encourages it's employees to grow and advance there skill sets and career by providing training in multiple areas."
good,"Over all good place to work , "
good,I love the type of work I do have been doing for 31 years. The bosses were very good and could see how good of work I did.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,A typical day at Goodrich involves some heavy lifting. We work at a very past pace with a utility knife cutting masking tape to cover gas turbine buckets. Once they're covered properly we cut out small required dimensions and then coat them with an aluminum seal with an arc spray gun.
good,"Every day fast pace working environment.Stressful with high load of urgency."
good,Challenging work environment dealing with the changing economy and government cut backs.
good,"Overall, a good company to work for. Typical day varies widely based on what department you're in and what project you're working on. Opportunities to advance while staying on a technical career path, or switch to a management career path. Company shuts down between Christmas and New Year's, plus three weeks vacation and paid holidays."
good,"It has a good people oriented culture and values in workplace, however it seems harder to get promoted even if individual is performing work exceptionally."
good,"One of my best jobs (first); atmosphere can be hostile among co-workers, but there is a lot of humor; management, while not the best, is strongly regulated by HR department."
good,"Great benefits. Challenging moral and work life balance depending on the position. "
good,Making sure all Tech gets their parts as they order them and making daily cycle count are done. Making emails are answered in a timely matter. Great place!
good,"good company to work for . compensations can be better otherwise good in aerospace industry . good work culture, fun is good, learning is better and oppurtunities are there"
good,I am the type of person that can and will work very well with others. I’m very trustworthy I I work hard to make commitment I work hard to support the line. Have meetings with supply chain on commitments and working with them to see what I can do to help them. Always willing to lend a helping hand. I have meetings to status shortages. I have over 30 years of experience in   Production Control
good,Es maquiladora al fin y alcabo. No se puede pedir mucho pero los horarios son buenos. Por lo que me parece que eso es lo que hace a esta empresa atractiva. De ahi en fuera es casi lo mismo.
good,"As the title states, this isn't a glamorous tech company with fun colors everywhere, free food consistently and young, energetic fresh graduates. Collins Aerospace is a place for people who are a little older, a lot more serious and are very, very good at what they do. As a result I found it a little boring as an intern. Other interns were really fun to help/work with/collaborate with, but with the exception of my software mentor assigned to me I didn't interface much with any full-time workers."
good,Management is not good at collins in India.They are doing their own. Not listening to his employee even though they said that we valued their employee.
good,My advice is get what you can out of this company. As long as they’re in partnership with UTC Aerospace it’s only a matter of time they’ll outsource everything and lay people off.
good,"The culture is good and relax. Good maternity benefits. The work is not hard. "
good,"Exelente empresa, vive constantes cambios organizacionales comunes en este tipo de compañias"
good,"My typical days at work were filled with analytical reports"
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Fast pace"
good,"A good place to work, good people who care about the products they produce.  The projects are interesting and challenging.  Would highly recommend to all."
good,The people at Rockwell Collins were great to work with. I took a job in a position that I had no prior experience. It was a struggle for me to learn the position despite the continued assistance provided by management.
good,"Creates a good learning opportunity for interns but, no advancement once internship is over due to hiring freeze"
good,"They pay well and you leave your job at the office.  This makes for a good work-life balance and you have time to spend your hard earned money however you want."
good,"Good place to work"
good,Work environment is good peer to peer. The really only negative aspect is the low level supervisors. Most of them are awful and I cannot figure out how they got there. Just apply with an open mind.
good,it is a great company to work for. I like it very much. Only very much stress. it is hard to balance family life and work. It should be more open to flex time
good,"Flexible schedule"
good,The major reason I'm willing to left this company is a small amount of tasks to do and lact of possibilities to achieve new experience and growth.
good,"They offers really good benefits PTO, sick, and personall combine hours of over 228 hours. the Benefits make up for the low paying empliyees."
good,It was clear that the job culture at Rockwell Collins was very one sided.  I felt like I had to walk on egg shell the entire time there.  You would like to see a bigger effort to hire a more diversity.  Once inside you see the good ole' boy network in full force.
good,Good pepole ok money great workplace take care of  employe.At UTC i was a packging clerk my job was to box and wrap the explosive and have it ready for shipping and reciveing. Also know how to use sap
good,Productive and proactive workplace with helpful co-workers. It was very interesting learning about continuous improvement and making processes more robust. Communication was always an issue although I became better at it and learned from my mistakes as well as others'.
good,"Once, I get to work I would have a meeting to communicate the production status for the night as well as meet with first shift managers. Then assign jobs and go over safety rule and regulations."
good,Pleasure Working with the Employees. The work was challenging and I enjoyed being there. I would go back if given the chance.
good,"Never have I had a contract that last more than 6 months."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Like a lot of Fortune 500 companies, it's a blend of good people and excessive management."
good,A finance administrator wears many hats.  A typical day may include but is not limited to travel coordinating between travelers and travel agents; auditing and approving expense reports for reimbursement; reviewing labor hours worked for errors in entry and correcting.  Adjusting and correcting payroll errors.  Receiving and submitting invoices for payment.  Creating purchase requisitions and tracking PO's.  The possibilities are endless.
good,"Expectations are high"
good,"At my current job, I have various meetings throughout the day to review customer issues. Throughout the day, I call and  e-mail and respond to foreign and domestic customers about repair orders. During the day I take time to review and accept / deny customer warranty claims and to send quotes to customers."
good,I do varies types of work. I work with explosives and varies types of metal. We make product for all branches of military. I work with a good group of people and we have great team dynamics.
good,"Very competent Engineers (software, systems, mechanical, and optical) who were very easy to work with aside from small office politics. Highly communicative and accommodating operations and repair department. High and mid-level engineering management could do a better job improving communication chain, but do a sufficient job in aiding with career development."
good,A typical day at work would be fast-paced. I learned how to use different mechanical tools. The management needed some classes. My co-workers were good people. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy things. The enjoyable part was going to work.
good,The work environment here was good until a series of mergers and acquisitions began.  The changing cultures and software conversions made working there very difficult.  You never knew what changes were coming next.
good,"It has been the best company that I ever worked for, but...there are not many opportunities for advancements or promotions."
good,Not a bad place. They struggled to find things for me to do as an intern. They seem to stay constantly behind on work due to being understaffed. Should hire more people and provide more work to interns.
good,"I was an intern for 2 summers with this company, and did not feel i was prepared well enough to begin working there. The company is unorganized. I had a bad experience with HR on multiple occasions. First, hiring process took unnecessarily long with no communication on their part. Second, another miscommunication when being offered to come back to following summer of 2018, They believed I no-showed on day 1 - Orientation, when in fact, I was never contacted by them about an offer. Once I did start working there, I had no real training on what I will be doing. I was given very few amount of tasks throughout my internship in the summer of 2017."
good,"Finding a good manager here is important so you will have career advancement.  If not, you will be easily lost in the company with what you are suppose to do."
good,"but when I worked their is was fun and the managers were great to work with, noticed I said with and not for.  They seemed to have a different style so you did not always consider them your boss, rather a co-worker"
good,"Working at UTC Aerospace was fast paced in the shipping department but fun at the same time. I learned how to attach bill of ladings to Fed Ex, UPS and different Truck carriers. The hardest part of the job was end of the month because every back order and every shipment needed to go out. My boss was absolutely the nicest person I have ever worked for. Most enjoyable part of the job were the different personalities you would come across every day."
good,"Great people to work with, building some amazing products for different customers.  Strong focus of lean manufacturing and continuous improvement.  There is always something new to learn and help yourself grow."
good,Rockwell Collins is a ok company to work for. A lot of OT. A 9/80 work schedule witch is a plus. Always a big push to meet end of the month to numbers.
good,I loved this job while I was there the only issue I was having was the hours that I worked I worked late evening into the early morning mon through Friday and it made it hard on my home life
good,"If your a good worker, then your position is stable. Company is great with the flexibility of your work hours to fit your home life and responsibilties (kids, old parents, etc...)."
good,Company provides more than adequate training for your individual job.  Support between sites (for your job title) for questions and assistance is excellent.  Management doesn't always pass on pertinent Corporate news in a timely manner.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Everyone was incredibly kind and helpful, but the company moves slowly, as you'd expect from such a big company and an aircraft company at that. Everything had the feeling of a software product from 5-10 years ago, and personally that didn't excite me. If you are someone who wants to be able to go into work everyday, work on things that will be on airplanes, but not to have to work too hard, then this is the place for you"
good,"Overall it was a good paying company, however there was little to no career advancement.  Lack of management recognition and support within certain organizations caused some of the lack of advancement.  I was a co-op therefore there were no benefits offered, but hourly compensation helped offset the lack."
good,"The work is easy, and repetitive. I learned not to trust management and not to take more responsibility than the title request. Management was not fair, too much favoritism, lots of family members are hired. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job for me was presenting information to management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the employees."
good,Manage teams of R&D engineers ding electronic design and signal processing work for advanced aircraft sensor development.
good,"Work for 14 yrs as Sr. QA got a little over twenty bucks."
good,Had a great time supporting military clients on USMC bases in Helmand Prv. Eventually you get burnt out because of needs of business and other team mates not pulling their weight.
good,"When I first started at Collins Aerospace they were a smaller company than they are today.  Three was a great opportunity to work across departments.  The salaried people on the floor or lower level buyers worked well together.  Upper management was very divided and focused too much on blame-shifting than actually addressing the constant challenges.  Upper management relied too much on the buddy system or was very politically motivated to protect their own hide than to work with their staff to come up with the best solutions for the company. The company was turning a profit, but if they would go back to simple business practices like using true analytical work they could come up with solutions to improve on the profit margin."
good,"Don't work under craig baker. He'll lay you off right before holiday season because you won't work for free off the clock. Other than him, that place is an awesome and interesting workplace."
good,The job requires a bit too much that is outside of the scope of my job duties.  Management continues to add on these duties and tends to punish those who question these added responsibilities.  I absolutely love helping out my clients and being asked questions by my coworkers.  The respect that my colleagues show for each other is tremendous and very fulfilling.
good,"While the company overall offers some excellent benefits and options, the location in Lenexa is vastly lacking in its management skills, as well as its willingness and ability to promote within, and grow current employees."
good,"Loved UTC for benefits and relaxed environment. No consistency with managers. They are allowed to do as they want. HR doesn't protect the little people. If you get a manager that treats you poorly, only option is to leave the group or company."
good,"Great place to learn the ropes of composite work. But, poor management, poor leadership, a barely there union and very few advancement opportunities make this a difficult place to want to work at. poor negotiations by the union have lead to a 200% increase in the cost of health care over the last two years."
good,"Nice place to work, Supervisors are not on the same page. It should have standards for everyone not favorites. I don't like the ideal of using your vacation for sick time, You come out short when there's no work.. Your vacation is used for that purpose to fill in time missed or no work. Not just one area affected but several."
good,The company offers excellent opportunities for growth and educational attainment. Employees are given autonomy to make decisions and to promote the work processes.
good,"EMTEQ  has undergone great deal of change since BE Aerospace (New Berlin) buyout; having remained an autonomous organization within BEA until the NY leadership team replaced executive staff in WI with NY staff in mid 2017.  Then RWC purchased BEA in late 2017, and subsequently was itself purchased n early 2018."
good,"Work whit a very nice group of experience, people learn a lot about them for working on stressful environments, also as and aviation company, learn a lot for security."
good,"Overall UTC Aerospace Systems is a good company to work for.  On an operational level, corporate needs to get out to its facilities more to better understand performance issues.  Poor run operations get lost in the weed until it is too late.  The benefit UTC offers in the Employee Scholars Program which pays for employees in good standing to get a degree."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Company was formerly known as GOODRICH aerospace systems."
good,"Rockwell Collins is a great place to work. A good environment, nice staff, management works with you and interesting programs. I built, assembled and disassembled their units. I loaded software on the needed boards and performed various tests on the products. Management showed special interest in each of his workers. This is a Engineering location. All the workers seemed to know their assignments and helped when it was asked for. I loved it because of the location. It was twenty minutes from my home."
good,The area that I worked in opened my eyes to Asbestos and how it affected people and their families. I worked with some of the greatest attorneys.
good,"The company and its culture are overall good. The benefits are great and the employee scholarship program is excellent. However, the management of the company is full of bureaucracy and excessive micromanagement. There are many people that appear to do nothing but look at social media on their phones. Most times, upper management appears to have no idea how day-to-day operations are conducted and there is no follow through on any initiatives to improve efficiency."
good,Hurry up and wait atmosphere. No room for advancement.  The pay is good but you are being paid to work from neck down. Local engineering team is very professional.
good,"-Characterize focal plane arrays "
good,"Good company to work for because they develop interesting products. The work/life balance is good with UTC. They removed the bonus program, which was a good feature under Goodrich."
good,BE Aerospace is a typical Engineering company ran by men. As Rockwell Collins takes control this should get better. The benefits are fine on par with other companies of their size.
good,"Rockwell has so many different areas in the company, it doesn't matter what department you're working in, you can always job shadow another department.  The Mentoring program is amazing and highly encouraged to spend time networking"
good,"This is a great company to work for.  Very challenging yet enjoyable work.  I was rescued in forced due to a bad business jet environment, so job security is lacking."
good,"Although no job is secure, just wanted to last longer there before getting laid off. I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"Days went quickly cos people were so busy, As a designer it was outside the box thinking and designing. I enjoyed everyday till they close the entire building and moved it to Oregon. Management was good till the upper managers had devil plans. Co workers were great made some lifelong friends. It was hard ground breaking work but exciting cos no one has done this before."
good,"My typical day at work: I'm working in the NDT area, scaning parts"
good,1)worked entire software development lifecycle project.
good,The bad thing I can say about these guys is they will fire you not in person but over the phone if you have surgery and they dont want you to come back. They also like to send certified letters saying you have been let go then lie to unemployment that you voluntary had quit them. The management is clueless because they make changes to things and never tell or get the opinion of the people working in that area of the plant.
good,A lot of old timers. Could be site to site specific. Moves fast pace day to day but business turns slow along the lines of military contracts. Feel a sense of pride making products to protect our country.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Great people, friendly and helpful, very hard working! "
good,"Collins Aerospace it's self is a great company, but some of there management personnel are terrible.  They usually only hire though temp agencies. They have no loyalty to their employees. I worked for them for three years as a temp. Each year being promised to be hired permanently. My boss was terrible he was prone to fits of anger, he would throw things, and call names"
good,"el trabajo en si es bueno, dependiendo de que tipo de proceso sera el tiempo que tardaras en aprenderlo, lo mal difícil fue acostumbrarme a los materiales que se utilizan son muy moldebles, lo mas interesante es el tipo de trabajo es con cuidado y sin apurarse mucho cuidan la calidad de cada pieza que sale del área."
good,"Good place to work, I liked working there. Manufacturing plant of interior seating for pilots and attendance seat. Company is growing very fast to keep up with the demand of the customer."
good,"It's a good company to start at, but unfortunately it takes forever to make enough money to live on. Great starting point for young people looking to gain some valuable experience to take elsewhere and make more money!"
good,"Some leaders are really bad, not sure how they keep getting promoted but will never for that group again  not sure what will happen with split of UTC will have to see then it happens."
good,UTC is a great company that invests in their employees and tries to promote work life balance as much as possible.  Flex-work schedules are offered as much as possible if it supports the business.
good,"All was rated above honestly. Derogatory statements are not necessary, liked my job mostly until management changes created issue th a rolled down to production floor output and demands. But all in all it was a good place to work for 9 yrs. Management since I left has improved employee treat ment and improved the which was created by the previous."
good,Support problems with VIRTEK Lasers. Create FiberSIM plies by cutting engineering ply design. Create ply books for Manufacturing Engineering to follow the ply layup on tools.
good,"Based in the UK, driven by the US. Very metric orientated business. UTC is a large corporation and makes its money through buying companies / organisations, then stripping out the non core, improving the core and then selling / integrating what's left."
good,The job was good and some of the people were good to work with. One manager there is fair but the others are not as fair. The hours are awesome and so is the benefits.
good,Small subsidiary of a major corporation. Intensive customer iteraction required and must wear many hats. The people are nice and hard-working. Safety is important.
good,The company over all is great!  Great benefits and work environment at the Livermore CA location.  But local management is horrible. They play favorites with scheduling and bidding procedures
good,"Too many hours to be worked nit enough time to do anything. Alot of things need to be learned very quickly and is a very busy site, if you have family you wont see them often with this position."
good,"Work generally starts at 630 and ends at 300 with a half hour lunch.  Its pretty much an everyday thing unless you want overtime.  Management is sporadic at times, very few managers actually care what happens with quality and parts... while the vast majority of other managers are only concerned with one thing numbers."
good,"Work environment was good in this company & learning and growth was also good in the company.I have learn a lot about MRO in aviation in this company.Hands on experience in class 1 part for repair , maintenance and overhaul was a competitive job."
good,"They say they want quality but if you slow down on quantity they seem to be upset. They need upgraded equipment, the army doesn't try to win wars with muskets anymore, you can only produce as fast as the equipment will let you. Various issues arise because of tool problems or the unwillingness to spend money on consumables which cause rework, and escapes."
good,"Company decision to closed down the plant and move back to headquarter. Effecting 150 employees: HR. Engineers, Managers, Assemblers, Technicians and Quality."
good,"In my position here, what I liked the most, was that I did several different things, which kept me on my feet.  Having more than one task to do all the time and to manage, made the day go by fast, and is a big part of what I liked about the job."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"A productive environment, a lot of work got out of the plant on a daily basis. The people were nice, but the management needed a lot of help with organization."
good,"Other than casual fridays where you can wear jeans, office work is very professional business attire (think khakis or slacks). The company seems to be kind of old school, but everyone is pleasant."
good,Good place to work and gain corporate experience. Was a very corporate environment that is progressing towards creating an employee culture but not at the peak yet. Look forward to see where UTC will go in the next 10 years.
good,Independently handling the HR Generalist Functions. The culture of the company is very good. Independence to do the work without much monitoring
good,"Pretty Much did what you want on the off shifts, high emphasis on training"
good,"Goddrich has merged with UTC.  Company has plenty of oppurtunity for growth, however pay and compensation is on the low end of the spectrum.  Right now things are volatile in the IT area.  They are continously reducing force, yet hiring is ramping up in Engineering"
good,"its a blast to be there, very laid back"
good,great workers at this company. nice place/state to work at. Every other Friday the company have a game going on. We get together to no more about other co-workers
good,"Typically I worked long programs (1-2 years). I had something to do at all times during program life, so I was always busy. It was nice to never be bored. I enjoyed working with the many talented and intelligent Engineers. I did find the management to be intrusive and cause more road blocks than they knocked down."
good,Good people but the pay was way low. If you get an interview no your not lost. Its really there.
good,"One of the best employers in this area, but career advancement is an afterthought. Corporate policies indicate otherwise, however some old-school managers still feel that promotion should be based on seniority and not ability. Job duties are fine. People are wonderful. If all I wanted was a job, I could work here for decades; but if I want a career, the so-called senior managers don't know how to develop talent or know what to ask employees about their career aspirations."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo con prestaciones sobre la ley.
good,"Rockwell Collin's, now Collin's Aerospace, has a culture of inclusion and diversity.  Bringing together a diversity of thought enables Rockwell Collins to develop innovative technology, creating market differentiation."
good,"Your day is what you make of it. If you want to move the business forward, there are methods to do so (with their own barriers). But if you are unwilling to make the effort, you can do the base job without any detriment to yourself."
good,I communicated more and practiced with the people around me. I liked how they always had videos that taught you how to be safe while working. Also how clean the space was all the time.
good,Challenging environment to work within.  Most policies and procedures are driven from Cedar Rapids.  Absolute compliance is necessary for survival within the organization.  Promotions happen in Cedar Rapids.  Very few promotions happen at site level.
good,"They pay well, but do not try very hard to get interns into full time positions. The place is managed very well. Very successful. Don't always get the most meaningful work as an intern."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"Collins provides a great environment to work in, but the job can be highly stressful at times.  Requires great attention to detail and given the industry, how processes are handled change.  Managers always have an open door and are willing to listen."
good,"A typical day consists of meetings and inspection of parts."
good,"Nice work experience being a design engineer, that you'll have more knowledge and learning about the product of the company, that you will be the one who's responsible for the initial design. This company helps a lot of people, but I am not in favor of a 6 days working schedule."
good,"Great place and environment to work at. Good benefits and co-workers are awesome. BUT some of the Management only cares about you and notice you when you reach the daily productivity goals. You can work your hardest but yet certain supervisors won’t care about your unexpected life situations that occurs. HR should be helpful and help you with options but certain HR will tell you that “this is a company, you can choose to come in to work RIGHT NOW or re-assign your position”.  Some of the supervisors favor certain employees and give them the options, and it’s not fair to the hard working employees who needs a few days off for a sudden death of a family member, or children with illness,  but are told “no” by certain supervisors but some supervisors would do the best the can to help you out with anything you need. But other than that, the company is a great place to work at, just some supervisors needs to be fair and understand employees more especially when they’re going through a rough time in life, some employees lost their job due to the unfairness and they need a job to support their family."
good,"It's a Production Company, following and working in an Electronic Working Instruction (EWI) twelve hours working Monday to Saturday its exhausting but it challenge me everyday to be more productive and i learn to be Frugal in my life because of my situation ,everyday i work under pressure to reach my output the hardest part of my Job is working far to my family, standing in my workplace but its all good because i am young and fit to work from it and i enjoy working because i'm executing my work precisely and when i feel that i add value ."
good,"The environment at Collins Aerospace is fairly relaxed. There are burst of fast-pace lots of overtime scenarios quite often. It really depends on the production demand and process changes. The management is fairly okay, but your teams are pretty outstanding, because they are who you really rely on."
good,"Product/sprocesses, and facilities are amazing but managment struggles with providing a culture for growth.  Managers from different areas try to pull you in many different directions at the same time. "
good,The workforce were friendly and good to work with. Management were a bit unorganised but it was an enjoyable job. I learned a lot working there........
good,United Technologies Aerospace is a face pace corporate atmosphere. UTAS has a very complex organizational structure with multiple components. The best part is the flexibility of lunch break and schedule management.
good,This place pays well to start. After a certain point you will get stuck in an area with little hope of leaving. They will pay for you to go to school but after acquiring your degree you will likely need to go elsewhere to use it.
good,"Overall the company was solid, but management was going through multiple changes while I was still there so it was difficult to maintain a good flow and communication flowing down became less than adequate. It has now been taken over by another company."
good,"Team oriented with positive feedback. Helpful coworker training of existing systems. Multiple product platforms, with challenging opportunities for success."
good,"Great company to work for if you're motivated to advance in your career. I must admit I only worked for them for about 2 years, as UTC acquired Goodrich, then subbed out the IT support team."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great place to start out, but not necessarily to stay. They offer competitive benefits and a great flex program for students, parents, or those with other needs. Collins Aerospace has many challenges, which provides opportunities for growth and career enhancing experiences. Lack of effective leadership and accountability significantly impacts the morale. The company values are loosely supported, also impacting morale."
good,"A typical day at work consists of discussing and negotiate data content, requirements and policies between Collins Aerospace and the regulatory agencies."
good,"Start day with issuance of parts, Return to stock, then back-orders. Run and process daily inbound receiving report. process and receive inbound parts."
good,"Typical corporate work that can fluctuate from low stress to extremely high stress. Located in Pueblo, CO and not a desirable area so commuting means you get a lower, Pueblo pay."
good,It is hard to review Rockwell Collins right now as it goes through it's impending purchase by UTC and becoming the new Collins Aerospace.  The company will have to discover what is means to be Collins Aerospace and how to compete in a much broader marketplace.
good,Bonne équipe et bonne ambiance dans les services en général
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

good,"Great place to develop my career. Lots of training provided."
good,Cool place overall it has it good n bad up n downs people are ok I had a 10 years there union workers so that's a good thing but overall I'll say they need to pay people more for the work they do
good,Great place to work. Fast paced. Always something to do. Need more training to do your job. Could use more formal training for new hires. More communication needed from upper managment.
good,"Even as an intern, I was well integrated into standard work flow. I got to see and learn a lot about the manufacturing process, and the employees were always willing to teach me about their work and how it is important"
good,"Was good place to work in North Dakota. It has a huge plant. We made aerospace parts for planes. Was allowed to work with minimum supervision, unless needed something. They would get tools needed"
good,"It varies from project to project but overall, I recommend the company.  There is plenty of opportunity, and many of the managers have been great.  The work environment was alright for the most part."
good,Semi monthly pay with fair PTO and great benefits. Not the greatest work environment or management. They also have cafeterias and exercise rooms at most of their US locations
good,Good entry level place to work as an engineer.  Plan on waiting 10 years before any real advancement if you stay.  Better to move on to a different company after getting some experience.
good,Challenging and fast-paced.  High level of customer interaction.  The position requires a high demand of accuracy and follow up with customers and various departments.
good,"Work life balance great. Gym with personal trainer and offer quick 30 min. group classes. "
good,Rockwell Collins creates super first class interiors.  Fast paced and room for advancement to those who work hard. 3 weeks PTO to start and paid Holidays.  Nice break room.
good,Too many politics prevent advancement. Work is demanding but it is well compensated.  The more you make the more you can keep others from advancing in the company
good,"Working in the furnace is a very dangerous, We work 12 hours a day 4 days a week."
good,UTC/UTAS as a whole has potential for career advancement but only if the employee shows a willingness to put in long hours and do jobs that others will not or cannot do themselves.
good,Quality and compliance were highly emphasized and comprised much of the work.  Attention to detail and collaboration was essential.  Working virtually was important in this global company.
good,Balanced work environment with solid leaders and co-workers.  Good work environment and opportunities to learn and experience multiple roles of interest.
good,"Followed up with vendors on parts returned for evaluation and repair, assisted in developing cost basis for follow on program procurement requests, worked with purchasing agent and buyers and vendor representatives to expedite cost requests and repair information.."

good,"New mgmt is taking over at the site I was located.  Procedures and processes are inherently different and the new mgmt style doesnt seem to be working well.  It will take some time for the new style to take hold, but until then, there will be lots of internal fighting while the new regime takes over."
good,Rockwell Collins in Winston Salem offers a very safe and clean work environment. The hours are good but long during the fall and winter months. The long hours are compensated through much overtime.
good,"I enjoyed my time with UTC Aerospace. I leanred a lot by working there. My co-workers were all productive and willing to help each other for the sake of the business. Committed managers who check up on employees, making sure all is going well and that there is a smooth chain of production."
good,Rockwell Collins is a good company with great opportunities to move to other areas. It has a good group of people that work to meet customer and company needs.
good,"Good company with good work life balance. I left due to relocation, but I would have been leaving in the near future due to lack of growth opportunities in my specific area."
good,"I'm not allowed to describe a typical day.. There is not typical day.  Rockwell is a very large company, it's easy to not be seen or recognized for your achievements."
good,Good overall not to hard good pay benefits could be better . Management is fair conditions are good people  as far as Co workers  and pretty good and fairly flexible hours
good,Great Company and decent pay. Benefits are going down. Over all they are a great employer. They need to diversify there business and not rely so heavily on avionics. If the industry sees a slump it slows the company.
good,The company is open to people working remotely but the company could improve its medical benefits as the only option is a high deductible plan which is a hardship for some employees.
good,Rockwell Collins is good company to work with. It has versatile options for employees who wants to learn cross-functional technologies. It has a great employee benefit programs.
good,every day is different as a program manager.  I am responsible for all Airbus programs nationwide and work closely with our vice president and president at our site in MN which is the largest SIS site in the US.
good,"Les 2 mois et demi se sont bien passés, activités et taches intéressantes, personnel sympa"
good,Big Company with some good and back things.  It can always benefit from reduced management.  It has grown too large to be efficient.
good,very unfair when it comes to advancing within the company. Great employees bad management no communication and favoritisms is played a lot.
good,"I worked here for like three years and the whole time I was there the employees, staff and faculty were great. Awesome place to put roots into and grow with."
good,Straight forward and not hard if you follow directions and rules. I work the 3rd shift and it is easy to get lots of work done. Do not have to deal with planned maintenance as much on 3rd shift. I enjoy working with my co-workers and supervisor.

good,Avionics is an interesting domain and Rockwell Collins is the best place to enhance one's skills. It has got highly skilled professionals in avionics industry and working with them is a plus.
good,Good place to learn composite layup and to get into aerospace industry. Can advance but it is difficult. Would recommend some schooling or experience to get ahead.

The hardest part of the job is when I'm Strange to a new environment,and the most enjoyable part of the job is with my adaptability and resilience,I'm able to apply what I've learnt from my mentor and co-worker which is a sense of achievement and satisfaction for me. If there's a chance for me to venture my skills and knowledge to oversea, i'll gladly love to, because i love to travel"

good,"Outstanding Aerospace company, it's a pleasure working with one of the most technologically advanced aerospace companies in the world. "
good,UTAS is a good company to work for. The employees are friendly and the benefits are good. The work environment isn't too strict. It's a lot of work in the Engine and Controls group with long nights and weekends sometimes but the responsibility you are given within the first year is incredible.
good,A stable place to work before the merger with Goodrich. Too soon to tell if this will still be the case with UTC.
good,"Great company to work for. I've learned alot of the past few years and the opportunity to better yourself is there. Rockwell Collins promotes learning and rewards it. They have a tuition assistance program, good vacation time, and great benefits."
good,Learned the whole process of being a project engineer. Learned to manage a project in a timely manner.
good,"I was a summer employee who was asked to stay longer. I loved my job. A typical day consisted of applying payments and filing papers. I would shred and move files towards the end of the month. I also got fun little projects like making power-points and pasting address labels to letters. I learned a lot about money while working at this job. Management was fantastic. Always helpful and patient. Co-workers were always there to answer my questions and help me understand exactly what I was doing. Hardest part about my job was not having an accounting background but with being a summer employee, I wasn't expected to. Most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships that you gain. I was the youngest person in my section so everyone was always watching me and making sure I was ok and having a good day."
good,"Goodrich Aerospace work day was multi tasked. I learned finishing task at hand correctly and moving on to the next, was less troublesome then to pile on with less attention to detail. Management was even keeled and co-workers were key to the companys bottomline. Due to facing all challenges methodically with expirence helps to ease a hard day. The practical sence of accomplishment is my reward."
good,I learned alot about setting up and running CNC machines. I worked with a great bunch of men and women.
good,good company with good benefits. fellow inspectors had xlnt skills.
good,Not real happy with recent decision to close our faciltiy and fire everyone but our Site Leader. No relocation packages offered and no attempt to latterally transfer to other company businesses in the local area. Everyone upset and looking for a new job.
good,. 5 days/week
good,"Great and challenging place to work, ever changing landscape with constant customer interaction.  Beginning a massive cultural shift away from an engineering company to a customer first business model."
good,"Although Collins is a good company to work for, candidates should prepared to work in an environment dictated by rules and rigid processes within a matrix management structure."
good,"Lots of changes going on, all for the right reasons, it is a good caring place to work.. They value their employees, provide a good career path for them also."
good,"Multi national, multi state  company, excellent application of technology."
good,"There were days when the job was stressful but it helped having the support and team that I had. The job is fast-paced and an individual should be able to handle the changes, in order to do well at this job."
good,"Typical day at work involves Techwriting and Certification tasks."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,Good company and lots of work to do.  Great people to work with!  Management is usually accessible if needed.  Work and personal life balance is usually good.  I worked there for only a few months after they became Collins Aerospace.
good,"Great place to work. Newly acquired by UTC. This company is in transition - Rockwell Collins & B/E Aerospace are now Collins Aerospace. Fast pace environment, growth opportunities, long hours."
good,If you’re new here it’s pretty good. They just went through a merger and are about to go through another. The older employees lost out on a lot of benefits and incentives for hard work.
good,"A day working there consisted of meeting in your group with your supervisor. Going over what has been completed and what tasks we have for the day. I learned many things, to be a Team lead, reading drawings, training other employees about my departments. Management was in a transitional change when I left. Moral was not as high as it was when it was Goodrich Aerospace. Keeping up with their demands which were usually not a practical goal. Although the people were very good workers to work with."
good,"The Irvine, CA facility has been divested from United Technologies Corporation / Collins Aerospace so this review is no longer applicable to Collins Aerospace."
good,The demand is great at UTC and requires a great deal of your time. Working every Saturday is pretty much a given and at times weekends Saturday and Sunday are required. Very strong in their use of Lean Manufacturing.
good,The company is currently in a shift regarding culture of a new overall company since merger and some big changes are happening to head us in a newer direction and location.
good,Not a bad place to work. Management can be better. Always room for advancing if you put the effort. Good benefits. 4 days on and 4 days off.  Rotating shifts every 6 weeks.
good,"Started working at Pomona at Rockwell Collins after the Hughes Avicom purchase, then worked at the Tustin facility, finally here at Irvine, Ca."
good,Much like any production line facility. Work is face paced and can be demanding at times but this also makes the day go by fast. No real issues with this company.
good,"Come in turn on your computer, login your job,go to morning meeting return and set up station and proceed to braze building model assigned to you with attention to detail."
good,"Had a great Schedule from 7-5 Monday to Friday, Learned so much about the Aviation Business, Airports and Agent Networking. We handled Airports and FBO information all of the world.  Along with working with personal proprietary information. "
good,the facility alone made about 4 million a month it was considered the cash cow for the corporate head quarters. The peoplle were knowledgeable and hardworking
good,"Overtime mandatory, very divers culture, and I learned we are all the same as cultures come in to play. the hardest part of the job is working 7 days a week. The easiest part of the job is working different lines."
good,"Rockwell Collins NOC is a 24 by 7 place were the job can go from 0 to 60 in a matter of seconds. People their are sometime under appreciated, under paid and over worked but still maintain a high degree reliability to our internal and external customer network connectivity. Worked there 20 years and met a good group of individuals that want nothing more than to get recognized for the work they perform under a high stress work place."
good,Overall good company. Nice team to work with. Nice place to work. CEO of Rockwell Collins is of the good person in Rockwell Collins. I want to retire from this company.
good,"This company size is used to be larger size, and about 400 employees, but now it is just 120 people."
good,"Utc aerospace since I leaved, But it was Goodrich when I joined, back 2012. Its was a learning stage in my career regarding thrust reverser and entire engine mounting component. company is good but the salary and the benefits is quite low compare to other airline company."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"nice place to work at. very hard to get hired direct. development and production Aerospace Casting parts. Initiating purchase orders and managing incoming materials while ensuring timely delivery. Consistent track record of increasing productivity and efficiency, reducing costs. Demonstrated ability to complete projects within established time and on budget. Knowledge of U.S. Government contracts within the aerospace industry. Experience with FAR, DFAR, and Export Control (ITAR & EAR)"
good,Easy going people. Management and engineering are not the most efficient group out there and could listen to the workers concerns more effectively. Nothing to brag about the place.
good,"As a company associated with U.S. defense contractor, Rockwell Collins required a concentrated work effort. All work time had to be accounted for, and there was little time for enjoyment. On September 11, 2017, the Richardson TX campus had a Reduction in Force (RIF) and I was laid off (so much for job security). Other than that it was a good place to work."
good,"great place to work,after layoffs my name was some how not on the call back papers,thanks,head of union he just didn't like me .weak union,pushed me out .I want to go back to work at utc any job"
good,"Though recently bought by UTC, the culture was really positive. Everyone from the hourly people to the executives really embraced the continuous improvement culture. Employees were given the autonomy to make improvements to processes, and the site was not afraid to take calculated risks."
good,"As a Quality inspector I would review defects ensuring the is and should be conditions are present, measuring discrepancies. I would also interview the people involved in the defect to determine the root cause and determine the best corrective action to prevent this issue from happening in the future."
good,Currently a contractor hoping to get hired on.  Seems to be a great company and people stay and return.  Very fast paced but that is the norm for the industry
good,"Excellent company, culture and leadership in the M&S organization very demanding and constantly changing. However, the role is very rewarding and the employees are world class."
good,"Information management company with strong aviation focus."
good,Some really great people in Irvine location.  Very nice facility that was recently updated.  Good work life balance for most employees.  Management is great in some areas.
good,"Travailler chez UTC m'a permis de développer mes compétences, d'acquérir de l'autonomie. "
good,"Siempre se busca alcanzar la excelencia competitiva "
good,"I really enjoy this job and all that it comes with it, however the only downfall is their layoffs. It's a friendly environment with lots of room to learn and grow."
good,"Rockwell Collins offers decent pay and benefits. "
good,UTC is a great company but it is going through a lot of changes which has created a lot of conflict. It's a great company for interns to develop the skill set that they will need in the corporate world.
good,Ambiente di lavoro piacevole. Ottimo rapporto con i colleghi.
good,"El trabajo es enfocado 100% a ventas mensuales, porcentaje de scrap, KPI, productividad de horas hombre/maquina."
good,Loved my job. Would work there again. Stayed productive and busy.  Only thing was some employees could be mean borderline harassment. Management seem to turn a blind eye. They will gang up on you. Great employer but some employees there made it hard to stay positive.
good,A very nice and friendly place to work and everyone was really nice and helpful.  Unfortunately the contract did not last very long.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

good,Rockwell Collins is a good place to work for. The managers are fair and there is a good atmosphere with the employees. I recommend it.
good,Rockwell Collins (San Jose) was a good place to work. They had a 9/80 work schedule (every other Friday off) which was very convenient.
good,they have you start at 3rd shift then move up as openings come available. cnc machining for very small airplane engine components.
good,Has times when busy others slow. Management ok but willing to work with you. Co workers good to work with. Pulling cable thru ceilings trying to redo infrastructure
good,"Competitive pay and provides job security, but limited advancement opportunity."
good,"UTC Aerospace Systems is one of the largest systems providers for the aerospace industry.  It is a global company with tremendous growth opportunities.  The company has strong operations and manufacturing capabilities, but operates very lean.  Employees work very hard to keep up with job demands."
good,Management was awesome. You went into work and did your job and then left. No one really bothered you as long as you got your job done.
good,Productive and Fun Work. Good working environment. Safe work place. Excellent working culture.
good,"Good company to work for.  Good benefits, and good opportunities for aerospace engineers.  "
good,"Average job average pay"
good,"A typical day at UTC would involve communication with employees on various safety and health related issues.  Some were as complicated as determining the threshold value limit for a chemical, and others were as simple as understanding the safety lenses prescription policy.  The most important thing I learned from working at UTC is that they will advance employees without regard to qualification or experience.  They just need to see the right attitude and have confidence in your ability to do the job.  This makes this an ideal company for interns and less experienced persons to matriculate through the company.  The hardest part of the job is the attrition rate.  Due to the company structure, some business units ""carry"" others. In this respect, employees with extensive investments in the company, developing programs, or even achieving goals with the business unit comment that they are not valued by their management.  They leave, retire without proteges or are asked to leave due to their indirect overhead charge cost.  The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you can retain experience, develop meaningful relationships, network, transfer within the company and  receive training to improve your value as an employee. "
good,contract employee i worked there for a year as a inspector in the receiving department. 
good,"Rockwell Collins Inc. was a good company to work for.  The average work day required me to interact with multiple customers including electrical, mechanical, and software development engineers working on new design concepts for the RTA-4100 Multiscan weather radar.  In addition, I was responsible for being the technical liaison between the Business and Regional Systems weather radar engineering laboratory and Rockwell Collins Field Service Centers, and production facilities world wide that maintained legacy RTA-85X weather radar systems.  Daily responsibilities included performing engineering design, integration, and qualification testing of recently developed and legacy weather radar product lines.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to use my aviation electronics skills to analyze, debug, and repair weather radar system malfunctions thus making it possible for me to return a fully operational weather radar to the customer. "
good,I enjoyed the level of responsibility I had at this job. I learned alot in the short time I was here. I was laid off.
good,"the pay is good, they play to favorites even if they can't do the job"
good,"As an exempt procurement agent my day consists of managing sub-contracts and resolving supply chain issues. At the strategic level I am responsible for sourcing and developing suppliers, negotiating and managing long term agreements, along with reporting the results to leadership. On a tactical level I coordinate with the appropriate team members to resolve, scheduling, ordering, logistics and AP issues."
good,Solved problems and worked closely with customers and suppliers.

good,"Good place to work for"
good,"Good company with structure  "
good,"Collins is one of the best places I've worked. The pay is competitive, the benefits are competitive and the culture is great. As with any place, you get out of it what you put into it. They will give you every opportunity to succeed."
good,"Process bien établis"
good,Overall a good place to work. You will have a lot of autonomy once you are trained. Pay is fair for the job. Not much opportunity to move around once you are assigned a slot. Senior co-workers can display burned out attitudes.
good,Las personas en general (operadores y administrativos) son muy amables.
good,"lots of pressure and highest quility required. Bullying management in production. Older workforce, resistant to change. Getting changes done. Learnt alot about 5S and lean manufacturing principles"
good,"Freedom in work environment"
good,Current lack of work means there are limitations of interesting projects and tasks to work on and job insecurity (many recent redundancies)..............
good,"You go to work excited about what you do, making products that will be used in aerospace applications. The benefits are good, 3 weeks of vacation standard, 1 week of sick pay, and very flexible managers in terms of needing time off. You are allowed a 15 minute paid break and a 30 minute unpaid lunch, and allowed to go off-campus.  Continuous Improvement is very encouraged but it seems higher level management is not interested in following through or listening to shop floor employees suggestions. HR is very unhelpful due to the overall corporate nature, you can’t get onsite help most of the time, and are given a phone number for even the most simple employee issues."
good,"Se trabaja de manera tranquila, el ambiente usualmente es muy bueno, lastima que algunas personas lo intoxiquen."
good,I enjoyed the overall work environment working at Collins.  However the work/life balance was not at all what I would have liked.  I felt as though because I took time for my personal life I was not given the opportunity to advance in my career.
good,Es una empresa excelente con muy buenas prestaciones y ambiente de Trabajo.
good,"The pace is fast and there is a lot to do. However, sometimes you can get put on project or programs where the pace is slower which can be borng. I have had a good career here but looking for something different."
good,A very nice place to work. I've been here 18 years and absolutely love coming to work. Everyone gets along and work well together. The hardest part of the job is leaving it at the end of the day. The most enjoyable is breaks and lunch. Everyone has a good time.
good,"lots of work, work life balance needs to improve. Good company overall. Good work atmosphere people help each other. Positive benefits and bonuses and people"
good,"There were a lot of really nice people working there.  Too bad management and HR weren't in tune with the things needed to make productivity the top priority.  Instead, the focus was on the latest corporate fads, such as remodeling to emulate the Google offices.  Midwestern engineering doesn't work the same way and the result was not positive."
good,"Solid Aerospace Company recognized around the world as a leader. Good salary and benefits. Lack of opportunities to be promoted from within, unless the direct manager helps in personal advancement. Many don’t."
good,"Fast paced workplace with challenging work assignments. Very nice locale and many people walk outside during lunch. Interior was remodeled such that cubicles were too small without the privacy to focus on your workstation. Culture was a mixed bag, reasonably friendly, but demanding."
good,Worked for the summer as an intern and enjoyed my time there. Ws challenged to learn about the business while also being trained at a good pace and was given the chance to show my abilities multiple times. Would be very happy to get a full time position with them in the future.
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

good,always give the good work at the date submitted.always prepared before the work started. i learned more because every each day they have different work that our boss give.
good,"The overall vibe there is good for the most part. There are some Managers that are difficult to work with. The pay and benefits are quite competitive. And the safety of the workforce is a very high priority. They want you to go home intact every day, zero accidents is the standard."
good,"Manejan productos inetersantes, el establecimiento esta limpio y ordenado."
good,"Typical workday write test scripts to verify correct handling of Positive Train Control. I've learned TCL scripting. The hardest part of the job was the specifications are not up to date, so there is constant questions to development engineers about the specs. The people there are good to work with, and my supervisor understands the issues."
good,"challenging projects."
good,I like my job the people there are nice people a comfortable place to work nice pay its a union shop I like some of the management team some benefits are very good

good,"Decent company to work for.  I advanced through the company taking on three different positions.  Like any company, they have some good and some bad upper management."
good,UTC is a good place to learn and develop new/curren skills.  Strong Team work and a fast work environment.  It's a company with a robust quality management system that helps to the daily tasks.
good,"A normal start of shift is doing turn overs with a person that ran the machine and parts before you. you get paid two 10 min breaks and two 30 min breaks taken anytime your crew has agreed upon. depending on the machine you can have cycle times from 1 min to 18 min. depending on the crew you're on breaks consist of ping pong, cards, smoke break, etc. There is always group events outside of work and activities. A hard day at work is when a machine is not working correctly or having to many managers trying to speed up or control a process for that day because it needs to be shipped. you can only go as fast as the machine can go."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Rockwell Collins. Compared to other employers, work-life balance is great, Saturday work is rare, management is open minded and provides an overall great work environment."
good,Typical shift would be all work is pre laid out take the next job set and prove out.All my work knalage was taught on site.Most enjoyable people around you.
good,Good opportunity that may enhance engineering skills on manufacturing and design. Helps to improve interpersonal skills and interrelation with other nationality
good,"Antiquated manual system and too much bureaucracy leads to high levels of daily frustration. The people are great though, a place where everyone knows everyone."
good,I would recommend Rockwell to my friends. Rockwell has treated me well for nearly 30 years and is the reason I am still with Rockwell. Flexible and family oriented work place.
good,Excellent company to work in for aerospace interior furniture.  Many different positions available for focused individuals wanting a fast paced workplace.
good,Depending on your position it is a lot of desk work. Lacks diversity and advancement for minorities. Great benefits and plenty employee resource groups.
good,"A typical day at work is stressed, busy ,long day, fast paced. I like my job but sometimes situations could be handled in a different way.The hardest part of the job is being rushed and never get off on your scheduled work hours. The good part of my job is that it is important to me and I assure to the best of my knowledge that quality comes first when products are inspected."

good,"I enjoyed working at Rockwell, the people were pleasant to work with and the upper management went out of there way to help u in anyway,  they made the benefits affordable"
good,Overall UTC is a good place to work. if you are willing to relocate then you can advance among the various divisions of UTC. The Aerospace Division is performing well.
good,Created writing efforts to be used to update Component Manuals. Reviewed other writers efforts. Typical day utilized Engineering documents to do my job.
good,It’s a good place to work at but management does not let you exel. Working here is a great for experience and they also pay for schooling here which is good.
good,"Rockwell Collins is a great company to work at. The environment is very friendly and open to any individuals ideas. However, I want to move into different companies, something different and get more experience out of it. Definitely this company has impacted me in a good way and expanded my skills and ideas."
good,"Bon environnement "
good,"Rockwell is a great company but most leadership roles require you to be in Cedar Rapids, IA.  It stunts career opportunities and does not provide the diversity of thought and personnel."

good,"Big Company"
good,"Fast-paced environment"
good,"great place to work and start your career, stressful at times but for the most part it is a good job. Management does tend to get in the way of production which makes it difficult but manageable."
good,"Like the challenge of the work.  Engineers take production workers input on the challenges and input of the products.  The management thinks the workers are robots, working production workers 12 hours a day 6 days a week."

good,Running on shift and working in a department that requires plenty of attention and strength especially working in a vital section which the whole company requires your attention but its a good experience working environment
good,"Rockwell is a very big company and offers a variety of experiences..."
good,Hard working employees should be recognized and appreciated. All employees are rated similar rather than talent being identified promoted and groomed for further success of the company.
good,"Will work for Rockwell-Collins again if the opportunity comes around. I was assigned to work on a secret project for the US Navy, therefore, I had to obtained a ""Secret"" clearance. It took longer for me to get this clearance due to my dual citizenship (American and Panamanian). During this assignment with the US Navy, the company flew me to Wichita to gather technical information on a Boeing 707 airplane that belongs to the US Navy, so I could finish writing my technical manuals on this project."
good,Company offers competitive salary and benefits package.  Opportunities for advance are mostly for people with Engineering background.  Most Management members come from Engineering background as opposed to Leadership background.  Other members lack the Leadership and people skills needed to be a successful Leader which reflects in current workforce morale.
good,"I am able to come into work, do my job, assist where needed and then go home.  "
good,The company offers opportunity for advancement and has an excellent school benefits package. Good place to work and gain valuable business experience.

good,"Overall good place to work."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts at 7:30am, I would like to get here earlier however bus times restrict that. I get in to work and go straight to the boot room to prepare for the day ahead, I put on my overalls, glasses and work boots. I go down to the shop floor greet everyone good morning, and take a look at the R&O wall where jobs are ordered by priority. If there is work there I will get on with that. If not i will find my manager and request work. The most enjoyable part of the job is it's organised nature, and my co workers. They make my day most of the time. I would say the hardest part of the job would be the early start and commute, after a long day at work the one thing I dislike the most is getting on to a bus with a lot of loud school children. I have learned how to lap, gap and counter lap flat face valves. I can use a speed hone, surface grinder, hydraulic test rigs, milling machine and lathe and perform most assembly activities including wire locking. I have limited experience on a centred grinder also. I would love to learn everything and anything I possibly can as i am an apprentice just out of their time. I love engineering! Work life is not as fun anymore due to the fact that our site is being made to close within the next year and a half."
good,"Great place to work, Just takes time to move around within the ranks. I would recommend the company to anyone who is currently in the manufacturing field. Some days are challenging, but as a whole the company is solid."
good,Since this is a large company each business unit operates differently and have different job cultures.  The BUs in the Midwest are more focused on the development of talented individuals where as BUs on the west coast are struggling to keep employees.
good,"The company has been growing and recognizes the need to adopt a more liberal environment that fosters team building and transparency throughout the management based hierarchy. "
good,"I would say my company is a great place to work and the environment warm and friendly.  I truly enjoy working with my coworkers, they keep me calm when demands can be overwhelming."
good,"The environment is very professional and polite. Your neighbors sit in cubicles all around you, but this only facilitates the necessary hallway meetings."
good,"looking forward towards aerospace domain ,manufacturing and devolopmental engineer"
good,I worked at Rockwell Collins for six years; one as a contractor and five as a full-time employee.  I would have stayed until retirement if I had not been laid off.
good,"At this time, restructuring is occurring throughout its portfolio.  Management is changing and strategic moved are being made throughout."
good,"UTC not so much."
good,"Es una empresa que cuida al personal y su desarrollo, proporciona elementos y recursos para el cumplimiento de las actividades es abierta a las oportunidades y el trabajo en equipo es un valor que se demuestra en el día a día."
good,Good place to work.   Management policies and IT technology a bit dated but that's changing.    Bureaucracy can be a bit overwhelming but starting to see the culture shift toward being more nimble.
good,"I have learned how to work well with people, becoming a good team player. The management staff at this company does not communicate enough with the employees letting them know what is going on within the company.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am doing something that is necessary for the repair of electrical components within an aircraft, which could save lives."
good,"make sure i am on time, learn as much as possible, get everyting done in a timely matter,"
good,"UTC bought us from Goodrich, but the Aerospace industry was in a steady decline, and unfortunately we could not recover.  I loved my job and my co-workers and I will miss it GREATLY!!  The work was AWESOME!!  We were always busy and there were new circumstances every day.  Each day provided new challenges and I learned a lot.  The hardest part of the job was warranty status, because most of the customers had different warranty negotiations as a part of their purchase agreement.  My favorite part was helping the customers, and making them happy"
good,"This is a great place to work, but if you're not in Iowa its difficult to advance."
good,This job was good. I was constantly learning things and moving aroud. I learned what factory life was like. The co-workers werent all bad but the lazy ones mad it harder for others. hardes part of my job was staying motivated because the lazy staff made the others and myself work harder and caused drama on top of everything. The best part of the job was getting to know some good people and some nice managment they really do work with their employees.
good,"There are many area's and location of UTC to which the aerospace division was one of them. The management with whom I worked was friendly, supportive and expected the best from you. "
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager. I have learned exceedingly in NX modeling and drafting, and have even dabbled a bit in design simulation and electrical routing. This company wants you to succeed and puts in the time and money to train you to do so. Most enjoyable benefit is the tuition compensation. It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"la empresa tiene un excelente ambiente laboral, los compañeros se apoyan y rara vez hay lios, en operaciones todo es muy ameno y todos nos apoyamos, sin embargo en algunas areas administrativas hay personas que no toman su trabajo con la seriedad requerida y no atienden tal cual lo deben hacer, pero indudablemente es parte del trabajo el tener que lidiar con situaciones como esa, en general la empresa es una de las mejores en mexicali que sinceramente volveria sin duralo."
good,"A typical day involved tasks dealing with production issues including creating/updating/correcting process planning for new and overhaul units, participating in production cell meetings for discussing production progress/schedule requirements and reviewing production processes for possible improvements using Lean Manufacturing tools. "
good,"Great place to work. Love my job , not challenging enough, unable to make any decisions.  Able to 'play' in flight simulators."
good,Unitied Technology Aerospace Systems (UTAS) is an industry leader in commercial aircraft nacelle systems. Most workers start early and are expected to go all day. Managers typically work through lunch. Customers are large aerospace conglomerates that are extremely demanding. The treadmill never ends.
good,"I hoped to retire from Goodrich, but the UTC buy-out changed the support structure. Most of IT was outsourced or right-sized, utilizing a centralized rather than distributive support model. I was unfortunately laid-off 7/2013"
good,"daily work of 9 hours min"
good,Good company to work
good,I worked on a US Navy project that what very interesting. I would work for Rockwell.Collins if offered again.

good,"A very positive attitude and empowerment management who help you to manage every day as a success"
good,"The work is good, keeps you busy always learning new things and ways too get the job done. I learned that lights are very important for an airplane when flying. Management was excellent, culture was pretty well mix, hardest part of the job is soldering wires when your hands aren't steady, most enjoyable time is learning and getting too know new people"
good,Możliwości rozwoju dobre. Kadra zarządzająca różna. Kultura pracy na dobrym poziomie.
good,The team will support a lot. Very good in Worklife balance. Work culture is good. We can learn a lot from the team and the management. We can develop a lot.
good,I genuinely enjoy working at Collins Aerospace.  I get to travel to remote labs and have the opportunity to sight-see between shifts of work.  This is my kind of place.
good,I was there as to what is basically an intern and from what i gathered while I was there it's a work environment that's always shifting from fast pace to a crawl depending on the days. the people that I worked under were very helpful and informative in what they did.
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits, cultural, and managment. I have had good advancement opportunities. Work life balance is a struggle but they work with you."
good,Avis positif sur cette entreprise (Collins aérospace système)
good,Culture at Collins Aerospace is very important. There is opportunity to learn depending on how well you network. The people are the best part. There is strong focus on quality
good,This was my 1st job out of college did not know better or worse. I was happy there and I got my MBA paid for. Really appreciate tis from UTC Aerospace.

good,"Was hired as a contractor been here for 5 months, was working in the warehouse for the stockroom pulling and staging materials, when work slowed down was told I will be let go, my metrics were higher than most I worked with and still didn’t get permanent hire. Good place to work great people just wish I could have been permanent."
good,"Productive work environment. On lighter days, work can be found to do within your department. Finding your path within the company can be challenging. Tech advisors are always available to assist with any challenges."
good,"This is a good place to work, but it is difficult to advance in the company without moving.  Sometimes you don't get any recognition for taking on more responsibilities, and raises are not that great, but it is a good place to work."
good,Collins Aerospace has a great office space and production space.  5s policies for all production lines are strictly followed.  It has a collaborative environment.
good,Great place to work. I've worked at 3 different business segments in the UTC portfolio and this site has been the best. UTC the parent company has excellent benefits and pay.
good,"Relaxed environment, with activities that help people to relax.  The senior management is not following the latest project management practices which may cause problems in the future."
good,More than a job. An actual career. Management is a little sketchy at times. We'll see with the new acquisition how this company transitions. Overall great place to work.
good,"For the most part, I love working here. I have had some great managers. Currently, I do not. For most people, you are not micromanaged. This current manager loves to micromanage and has no idea what it is that I do. I work in software and this manager was a business major. Overall I like my job. It's a great place to work and I like the people. I have been told though that in my current dept it is almost impossible to get promoted. They don't do much for career advancement. They say they do and have a learning portal however it doesn't mean anything."
good,"Well balance work time management"
good,"Each day could have a variety of tasks such as support technical meetings and take action items, order parts for the engineers, format/review/release documents into eNovia, support the engineers with the Engineering bid process, and many other administrative tasks.  Over the many years that I have been employed, I have learned many applications (such as ALM, eNovia, Ariba, MS Office, SAP, etc).  Management as a whole is very knowledgeable, productive and fair in their decisions.  We currently have a 9/80 schedule and depending on your classification/group that you support, your work schedule is fairly flexible.  The hardest part of the job sometimes is getting everything done in the same day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to obtain training, flexible schedule and multi-task (variety of tasks -- not routine and not only one task to do all the time)."
good,"Product design starting from conceptualization phase to prototyping to actual product design and delivery including Systems & software engineering, Electrical and mechanical design."
good,Good opportunity to work with exotic metals and manufacturing processes.  It is very gratifying to see airplanes flying safely overhead generating profits with UTC equipment throughout the craft.
good,"Culture is great the team we put together their i learned a so much about aerospace manufacturing together  . A typical day at work fires to put out daily which the team had no problem doing and the hardest part of the job is telling management we don’t have the material to,put out the fires ."
good,"Working at Rockwell Collins is interesting.  In my experience, it was this odd feeling of being overwhelmed by meetings and away from desk events, but overall like you get a lot accomplished."
good,"very fast paced and daily changes keep you on your toes."

good,The workplace culture seems pretty relaxed although for the type of materials and the tight tolerances the pay could be better. There is a fair amount of brainwork. The aerospace policies can be a bit overwhelming at times but the work is pretty rewarding. There are pros and cons to management as there is in most places so won't get into those
good,"UTC has provided me with knowledge,skills, certifications, and most importantly confidence to an industry I never considered working in. Pay is good based on union contract though I feel raises should be merit-based rather than time served. Education assistance is a huge perk especially if you want to advance your education for internal or external advancement."
good,"Entreprise de renonmé mondiale "
good,"I had the opportunity to work with some great people. Working with these people, we were able to get a lot of things accomplished for the company. I learned a lot of new things and gained experience to use in my future career endeavors."
good,"Would say it's a pretty stable place of employment., although they haven been known to have lay off in the past. The benefits are comparable to other manufacturing companies."
good,Had a good experience here getting my first experiences in industry. My managers were willing to include me in meetings and plant tours for my own education and didn't use me simply for low level busywork. Coworkers were great and the Chula Vista location is unbeatable - gorgeous view of San Diego Bay from whole building.
good,Managed daily production scheduling of components through the acid strip process. Lead all efforts to reduce materials of concern throughout the plant. Wrote all operations procedures and routing for component through the acid strip processing. Provided metallurgical consulting on diffusion coatings for turbine components. Provided management with monthly updates in formal presentation on environmental assigned program. did trouble shooting on diffusion coating production problem and provided formal technical reports documenting findings and process solutions.
good,"I enjoyed working for UTC for many reasons. First of all, I enjoyed the team system of production which foster communication along the process of producing a high quality product. I liked being able to speak frankly with all levels of management. There were many fun activities for the employees which made it easy to go to work. Finally the climate controlled work environment was a huge blessing in all seasons."
good,"Good place to work, good people and work enviroment. Sometimes challenging in terms of reaching sales goals. Management is good, although they should approach production floor and other areas employees to know about what is really going on around them. Really good benefits are offered to employees."
good,Excellent company and position to develop interpersonal skills.  Many job functions that require the collaboration of multiple departments.  Supportive managers that push you to achieve.
good,"The site that I worked at focused on interior and exterior lights for aircraft. A typical day would start at 6 A.M and production would be building the lights. Doing anything from soldering, crimping and assembly of the housing. I began my work there with a good understanding of most electrical components but I struggled to read blueprints. Now after being with the company for over a year I can say I am very well off when a blueprint is placed in front of me and I am told to recreate that product. I enjoy this job very much because I worked in a cell that has several different products coming through so it was never the same thing day after day. I would never get bored of my job because there was always something new to do and learn and there was a great work environment as well. Management and Engineering would work with me to solve issues related to the lights when those issues would arise. Of course no job is perfect and there were issues that could be improved but everyone would work their hardest to satisfy the customer and get product out the door."
good,Your career can move in just about any direction you want to take it at RC.  There are many opportunities to work on state of the art avionics and you'll have more technical peers in your field than you can possibly imagine.
good,The work environment is very good. coworkers are very friendly.  Generally it is a good place to work but there is no job security.  Management and staff members are extremely nice and this is one of the best places I ever work
good,During my time there I enjoyed what I was doing. There was a good variety of jobs to keep me engaged and proactive. The management cultivated a friendly environment.
good,"Good place to work. Can be drama filled at times, but over all a good job. Competitive benefits and pay. More flexible hours would be nice. Management can show favorites at times"
good,"It was a good company at the time I was there."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance.

good,"Bonne entreprise, avec de bonnes opportunités d'apprendre et de découvrir le milieu aéronautique"
good,Good company to work for with options for career advancement and growth.  It has been some time since I worked there and the company has evolved but performance still seems strong.
good,"Days would consist of checking the Pratt & Whitney shop floor for any parts that arrived over night and any quality issues that came up over night. These would then be reported to UTC at a morning phone conference. Then, throughout the day the team will keep track of what parts are suppose to show up, what quality issues occur, and track down any serial numbers that were at Pratt & Whitney for several different reasons."
good,"My experience there has been substandard but doable. I wished I could have moved more quickly in advancement."
good,"Rockwell Collins is a very solid company that primarily does business in the aerospace and defense industry. The people that work there are top-notch, and the compensation is excellent, particularly in the geographic location of their home base."
good,"This is a good entry level position and also a good place to retire from. Great benefits, if taken advantage of, lots of overtime hours available which makes work/life balance difficult. Climate controlled environment makes for a great summer."
good,Taking care of the essential tools each section needed and also filling necessary materials for builds was always fun.
good,good work environment with good management. work hours are great for personal life. always room in move up your position at work
good,Good pay. decent work life balance. Very large company top level managment is clueless about what goes on at the plant level.
good,"Was a fair and honest place to work.  You knew where you stood and your opinion did count."
good,"Multiple projects to support."
good,So many people at Rockwell have only worked at this one company their entire careers. One of the top employers in the area.
good,"- Expériences sur de nouveaux programme"
good,Enjoyed the family feeling of the work area and the challenges of production. The management personnel were great with setting daily quotas.
good,Great opportunity for growth if you are willing to relocate. Plenty of training opportunities with continuous improvement through the ACE operating system.
good,"Good workplace, very good supervision very good coworkers, very good equiptment  , very close location, short travel time overtime available"
good,"I have worked for Rockwell Collins for most of my career.  The only reason I do not rate them all ""5""s is due to inconsistency in management style and employee performance expectations across the company.  In all fairness, this is a problem with all large companies I hasve interfaced with throughout my career."
good,"They pay, benefits and work/life balance at Rockwell are awesome. The only gripe I would have is with some of the older people there and the culture they sometimes represent. There can be a lot of resistance to change and people stuck in their ways that seems outdated."
good,Overall good place to work.  One complaint is the work/life balance is a struggle.
good,"I gained a good knowledge on australian work culture. The hardest part of the job was the windows we got for deployment were narrow. the most enjoyable part was the work environment, my colleagues, the friendly environment made the work easy."

Clean and friendly environment, with a comfortable climate all year round.  Cafeteria is very clean and the food is excellent.  Best job I have ever had."
good,"In the time of suffering from diseases its very difficult to work."

good,"Great place to work."
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar ahi, tenian muy buen plan de trabajo ademas que las prestaciones eran muy buenas"
good,"I was assigned to typical intern duties. Mostly jobs that senior engineers are too busy to complete. While repetitive and sometimes boring the tasks are a great means of exposure to the life of an engineer. Many of the people I worked with were very helpful and supportive."
good,This company was a great place to work for. Enjoy my job and for the most the part the people I worked for.
good,A busy day of work with friendly co-workers and involved managers. Tons of room to grow and lots to learn. Decent benefits and fair salary. The growth of the company shows sign of good business and economic growth.

They provide their employees the opportunities to learn their product inside out, from engineering and and development to integration, test and delivery.  The company cares about the health and well-being of their employees and allow them to pursue career paths in any direction they choose. They encourage customer account responsibility and creative team management."
good,So many people were willing to help whenever I had a question about work related issues. There are so many highly talented individuals at Rockwell Collins.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"A typical day included reviewing with each project member the status of their tasks, reviewing their budget, and reviewing their schedule. My coworkers were a pleasure to work with and many have become lifelong friends. The hardest part of my job was dealing with limited budgets – government spending cuts have not helped. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with friends designing a product which has been well received in the marketplace."
good,RC has a variety of products such that one can be challenged and remain excited about job and growth options.
good,"I enjoyed my time at UTC, they always provide all of the necessary tools required to get the job done."

good,Managed team for RSAF C130 Full Mission Simulator Aircrew Training Device and USAF B-1B Training System Program VSS Upgrade Visual System & Database Replacement program
good,"Supportive management and culture, they really promote mutual respect and trust. Environment could use a better sense of accountability, but overall the employees and management are positive and pleasant to work with. It seems some employees are on a ""fast track"", where others seem to get lost in the mix, you really have to self-promote and mention your accomplishments and successes to get noticed. Not very consistent in management; some are very hands on and give great feedback and mentorship, whereas others do not do much to help employee development."
good,Family oriented
good,"Busy , Learned all types of units. You will learn and get"
good,I directly work with Program Managers and Engineers providing them support on financials and spending trends. Everyday varies on priorities. Fast paced environment with a great team.
good,"enjoy my work here, challenging dynamic customer environment as I work with Aftermarket support to global customers. Commercial airline engine nacelle responsibility."
good,"Generally, good pay and fair benefits. Sometimes bureaucratic, but not any more so than with other $25B company. High quality products and technology for the aerospace OEMs."
good,"It was a good co-op and was great for giving me an understanding of how the manufacturing process worked. The work was fairly basic, but I still learned very useful skills to use in my future school work and one day, career."
good,"I left to open the door for new career opportunities and often find myself making comparisons with the culture as it was a good one. The downside was a high deductible health plan, but that was compensated with an HSA."
good,"Good paying job with amazing benefits, great team. It will teach you a lot of handy skills you can apply with DIY fixing things around the house. Really great job for young men and women."
good,"If you enjoy what you do while you are there, you will be fine. They struggle with advancement of their employees so keep that in mind. The management positions are very stressful so I wouldn't recommend going into that field. Besides that, it is your standard production facility. I overall enjoyed my time there."
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, muy buenas prestaciones."
good,Good Place to work  Quality and 'doing the right thing' take precedence I enjoyed working there and would encourage anyone that could to work there.  Stable work environment

good,"Enjoyed my time there, but was frustrated with the lack of focus on PM responsibilities and overall accountability.  They did not empower the PMO organization to be effective group at the time  was there."
good,"I have worked for Collins Aerospace since it was known as ARINC Inc  - the pioneers of aviation technology. "
good,the company overall is good. the people there were super nice and some were willing to help you out. they also had days where they did nice things for the employees.
good,"A typical day at work I usually start at 7:00 am, collaboratively plan my day, and that the most urgent work is done. I learn what is the most important thing of the day what job needs to be done first. Workplace management is the key to making yourself more efficiently and increasing your productivity.  I love to improve teamwork . The hardest part of the job is when you are a team member and others are not. The most enjoyable part is I love helping people."
good,Change due to company wide balances of power across al business units. Sometime company is too top level and top heavy. Not enough diversity for leadership positions.
good,"Flexible hours and work from home opportunities for the approved candidates. "
good,"Nice place to work and learn, best part in Bangalore is that Collins has Design and Manufacturing centers at the same location, so we can learn faster. "
good,"The environment at Collins Aerospace is fairly relaxed. There are burst of fast-pace lots of overtime scenarios quite often. It really depends on the production demand and process changes. The management is fairly okay, but your teams are pretty outstanding, because they are who you really rely on. Engineering staff is easy to get a long with and work with as well. Collins Aerospace is a pretty good company that focuses heavily on producing quality products. They also take care of their employees when it really matters. All in all it is a great place to work, and build a career."
good,I worked in this building for thirty-two years. They treated all of us well all the way until the end. They made working in the aerospace industry enjoyable.
good,Like all companies it has its good points and not so good. If you need a job or like to work it beats unemployment. Overall UTC is a great place to work depending who you get as a supervisor.
good,Overall working with Rockwell Collins is a great opportunity. they promote work-life balance and they always making their employee satisfied. Happy to be part of this company.
good,"Being there for 2 decades I saw a lot of changes, some good, some not so good. The growth through acquisition always presented new opportunities to expand the department knowledge and abilities. New tools were always being introduced, but rarely with sufficient training to become effective with them soon enough to actually have the cost savings touted as the reason for the tool.  LOTS of management turnover made for a blurry ""big picture"" and caused frequent adjustments to the strategic planning process. I enjoyed the local team that I worked with the most. It made going to to work each day worth the effort."
good,"UTC Aerospace systems or now known as Collins Aerospace systems is a large corporation that is one of the top suppliers for aerospace and defense products.Although my time working there was unfortunately short lived that doesn't mean that the experience was terrible.After all there was plenty of reasons why you would want to work there.I will not be going into extensive details of the job but I will provide a pro and con list to help make your decision easier."
good,"Working at Rockwell Collins provided great career advancement opportunities. I began in Operations Management but was able to move to Budgets, Finance, and Contract Management providing a very well rounded understanding of the company."
good,"* Provides daily status of EDES to Business Unit Director"
good,"Wages and benefits are top notch along with cost of living raises.This smaller business site is a nicer environment to work in , with a good mixture of people to work with .This is all due to the fact  you are on day shift. There are no shift rotations , therefore you are on afternoons , nights or a weekend shift for an extremely log period of time( over 10 years in a lot of cases ). This ways heavily on time with family and Friends .not an easy place to work in regards to balancing work and your personal life."
good,"I've worked with this company for 1 year now and I have to say, everyone has treated me better than my previous job. I get along with almost everybody at the company and most of them would recommend me to get hired on permanently. I love the vibe of this place, or at least the department I'm in. The only few things I really have to say about this company is that Management isn't really up to par with their employees. I've only been here for a year and knowing so, I've noticed a lot of changes. I can't say much, but the bottom line is, I've only been here for a year and I've noticed that there is no communication between management, engineers, production employees, and test technicians. It seems to me like everyone favors one another. For example, if my department, the test technicians, have an issue with a product during testing and verification, it seems to me when we bring it up to management, every department is always blaming the test team for multiple product failures. To be honest, we're only doing our job, as intended and as we were trained."
good,"First and foremost, the people are what makes this company great to work for. Depending on where you would like to drive your career you can find opportunities!"
good,"As this is my first time working in corporate industry. Rockwell helped me in shaping into a good Software engineer understanding the significance of Project Life cycle, Project Management, Leading a team."
good,"Collins Aerospace is a great engineering job for someone fresh out of school like I was. Training classes are taught frequently, and online courses are in abundance. Project management is handled fairly well by daily board meetings and an engineering manager.

It has allowed me to pursue my MSME at NC State on the company's dime."
good,"I currently work a 9/80 schedule.  I have a variety of tasks which include:  attend meetings and take actions, create/update issues in ALM, create purchase reqs and on times requested to purchase items for the engineers on my corp credit card, etc.  Over the years, I have learned various software applications/systems.  It is a diverse company and gives an employee the opportunity to learn new tasks/skills.  Good training classes are available throughout the year.  Hardest part of the job is sometimes getting everything done when given to you on the same day.  Most enjoyable part of the day for me is I am given various tasks and I am flexible and able to get most of them done in a given day."
good,"Working on components to put satellites into orbit was challenging and interesting.  UTAS has some brilliant design and test engineers and the customers work well with program management. "
good,"Rockwell Collins provides a significant amount of autonomy.  As one would expect Rockwell Collins places a considerable amount of focus on getting the job done with the resources at hand, however the exact method of which that occurs is up to the individual contributor."
good,"I worked on a very small team with a very focused project. From what I hear, I did not have a typical experience, but I enjoyed mine very much. My coworkers were nice and I never felt too pressured to overwork. Hours are flexible. You can typically come in and work whenever you choose as long as you attend meetings."
good,It was a nice job but just is not something in my field of study. I was doing work in my field to start off but my internship went from an internship to a regular job.
good,"The corporate culture is to work harder with less resources. They keep reducing workforce, but not the work. Unless you work in Cedar Rapids, IA, upper management will not consider you for a promotion.  They took most management jobs out of Irvine."
good,Working there was a pleasure the only downfall for Me was the pressure to work overtime continuously and trying to advance if you weren't friends with the right people then you weren't going to be promoted. The grounds were maintained wonderfully

good,Working at UTC aerospace systems was great. I was able gain a sense of what it is like to work for a huge company and how it was in the real world. The hardest part of the job was trying to solve projects with not much help.

good,"When I arrived at Rockwell Collins they had new management wanting new and fresh perspectives into it's sales force.  For a company based in Cedar Rapids, IA, it was a moment open to attract not the best and brightest but talent which reflected its customer base.  There was a big push on diversity and that is when I joined the company.  It was a lot of fun to work the company in those days.  As part of the national sales force we were hungry to take market share from our competitors. We stretched the boundaries of the company's decades old culture but sales and profits grew.  Then they got a VP of Sales who reflected more the old culture and things changed.  One by one guys like me left the company.  I was one of the last of the group hired during the expansion period to go.  Looking at the top leadership today it is reflected of those who grew up and advanced in their limited culture."

good,Great place to work. Compensation follows government rate. On the leading edge of technology.
good,I worked for GR for almost 5 years. The pay was not the best however the benefits I used were one of the best I've seen - which was my main reason for staying.
good,Rockwell Collins has very good benefits. The culture in the work teams is very good. Having the time off during the holidays is awesome. There are some really good leaders in lower to mid level manager positions. However there is one common theme that hold the company back. They have a very political culture that is controlled by a good ole boy network. New higher level leadership is needed to retain top talent. There are some changes in process but the needed change is slow and painful for employees.

good,Good place to work. Commute is excellent. Core hours is excellent 6am to 3 pm. Co-workers are helpful and friendly. Company is growing. Compensation is satisfactory.
good,"Management varies based on department but can range from being excellent to disorganized and unresponsive. You will be expected to put in 9 hours with a one hour lunch break but they offer programs like the alternate work schedule to get every other Friday off. They also promote the option of working from home and tuition reimbursement. The workplace is definitely older  40-60 and does not offer a lot in the way of social engagements. The benefits are okay but they recently took away our incentive plans/bonuses, and made it against the rules for salaried employees to have overtime even though they are expected to work."

If hired directly, the average person stays for several years. There is a lot of turnover due to constant ownership and management changes."

The company supported me by sending me on multiple work-related business trips (I can remember at least seven) and one non-work-related trip to a women's leadership conference.

None of these tasks are terribly difficult, as long as one has experience with young children and can do basic math. However, the hours are a little inconvenient, they're open from 9:00am-1:15 and 4:00pm-7:45. and the shifts are pretty short, the longest that they'll schedule you for are 3 hours, unless they're short on staff.

They are family oriented and tend to keep personnel on-board between contracts, not letting you go like many other companies dependent on Gov't work.

good,"Working for my former employer was a learning experience. My co-workers were friendly and knowledgeable. A typical day consisted of constant movement using power drills and reading blueprints from a computer screen. You are given minutes for assembly of components and if your time runs out you have to document what`s missing in the way of parts and continue on to the next set of seats. The hardest part of the job was not having the necessary tools or materials to complete my task in the time given. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was working for a good company with excellent benefits. I worked with some very knowledgeable people and they were very helpful. Management was ,in my opinion, a little to insensitive towards others that worked under them. All the other leaders were very friendly ,skilled and helpful unlike my manager who lacked understanding when it came to interacting with other workers on the line. The manager seemed pretentious and uncaring."

good,"Daily I was testing and inspecting the inflateable slides that eject from airplanes. A typical day would include checking my paperwork to see how many slides were needed for the day, instructing a team of 4 people to pull slides into our area,and I inspect the folding,packing and effectiveness of the slides by FAA standards. I learned regulations and procedures of FAA and watched actual scenarios of people sliding down the inflateable slides into water. The hardest part of my job was the management changes and authority on different pages with different knowledge giving different orders daily causing confusion amongst many..The most enjoyable part of my job was the experience and importance of my job."

I was treated very poorly and it was suspected that it was because i am gay. I pushed things out faster and harder than the permanent guy that worked there i had a back issue that made me sit down but i still did my job and everyone agreed except the supervisor who got my fired, I stayed late every single day with an exception of a few days but if we got backed up with work load i pulled extra hours and saturdays to catch up and even helped other departments."
good,"Typical Aerospace company with lots of documentation, slow pace work atmosphere, newer technology and innovations at slow pace, middle management fair and too many matrix organization"
good,"Rockwell Collins was a contract position. The organization is very professional and well organized. The task that I was assigned to allowed me to bring the manual up to date. In addition to my assigned task I also evaluated other vendor supplied data in which I critiqued and returned comments to the vendor for necessary changes to their product data."
good,"Equal opportunities to advance, busy days, management was somewhat disorganized but kept things running, good co-workers, hardest part of the job is staying awake on nightshift, enjoyable part of the job is learning something new."

good,The work as Rockwell Collins is for on board flight equipment which must be level A tested.  Spent ruffly 70% of my time testing equipment vs. writing code.
good,Rockwell Collins has good pay and benefits. The only reason why i left is they offered early retirement. Gave me time to downsize and get a place i can afford when i do finally retire

good,I really have nothing to bad to say about this company other than when my contract ended I could not continue due to a miscommunication within management.

He helped me both in the workplace and with personal matters with advice in education paths and possible career opportunities. I enjoyed working with all of my co-workers. They were all easy to get along with and it was easy to contact them and get things done. The hardest part of the job is getting things in a timely manner due to some cases having to wait on a supplier's information. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships and experience I gained from working here. I was able to develop as an engineer and as a person.
