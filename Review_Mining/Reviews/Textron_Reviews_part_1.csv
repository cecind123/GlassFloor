rating,review
bad,Textron is a highly prejudiced place. My supervisor called me the N word and when I  reported him I got fired. The bosses play favorites based on who they have personal relationships with.
bad,"Stay away from the production scheduler position.  You will have a boss who does not have a clue what is going on, and will quickly throw you under the bus."
bad,It was ok place to work never had chance to get my forklift certification cause they had so many in line but was layoff around Christmas time  that ended that job
bad,"After 3 days you will be working 10 hours in a single spot with limited mobility and interaction with other employees is prohibited. Breaks are very short, if you wanted to get clean air there isn't enough time to enjoy it, you have to turn around as soon as you get to the front door."
bad,Was lied on and fired for no reason so that my supervisor could bring into new Caucasian people and five me and the other African-American was doing more than one duty and only getting paid for one was treated very poorly management was poor but I was working on the MAU so I don't know if I can blame text Job but I blame them if I have it in May you run my department
bad,"i worked on military tanks, cars etc ,changed electrical cables,changed headlight worked on tank communications ,i worked on anything that was broken on the tank"
bad,"This is a horrible job, you will work very hard everyday from sunup to sundown plus overtime and then out of the blue you will get laid off or fired. This company does not care about individuals. There is no home life with this company and no room for advancement unless you are part of the clique. Managers display alot of favortism. Interns account for 75% of the work force and if you work here you will probably be relplaced by one within 2 years with the company. There is no structure, no procedures, no guidelines. Alot of backstabbing in this company."
bad,"wiring the army tanks painting them and rebuilding them cleaning up"
bad,Speaking about EZ-GO Textron only; is by Far the Worse Managed Back Stabbing Unprofessional and Unexperienced Team you will ever experience in your Lifetime. It was Mine for sure !
bad,"	Assembly and modeling of wing, escape hatch, rudder and other components for aircraft"
bad,"Textron Specialized Vehicles will not grow or advance as an organization until the entire management group of ""good ole boys"" is completely cleared out."
bad,"If you like a college atmosphere this place is for you, only millennials are hired and promoted.  Program knowledge gone. Recommend working anywhere but for this company.  Declining DoD revenue, layoffs are prevalent."
bad,I am a military veteran of 20 years I have never been in a company with so much pandemonium on education and lack of leadership I was actually one of the top supervisors with no write ups but due to the lack of supervision lack of leadership lack of evaluations  I had to leave for my own health
bad,"The employees were friendly it was a ok plant to work in farely clean management wasnt the best machinery stayed broken needs a system update programs ,are out dated"
bad,"Worked 8 weeks on a contract described as 6 months plus."
bad,"Stressful environment in need of change of processes and leadership.  Policies are not enforced. Loyalty, passion for quality of work, experience and knowledge are not appreciated."
bad,"I fail  to understand how someone is getting food for customers and gassing up company vehicles one month.The next,they’re a plant manager.Watching as this unchecked incompetence is running a profitable business into the ground.Luring in new hires with all of the benefits,which look great on paper.Saying that work and home balance is important doesn’t mean much to employees who are working 50+hours a week for a year or more.Your time with the company  and experience is worthless.The longer you stay the more you’ll see people hired making almost the same money as you.Speak about it,and you’ll be labeled with a “negative attitude”,and targeted for termination.This is how the incompetent bullies in leadership keep their jobs.Playing the waiting game for the next layoff."
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE. TRU Simulation + Training will work you till you leave. Software engineers have an EXPECTATION to work for free to grow the ""new"" company into profitability. Will you learn a lot? Yes. But, you can learn anywhere. Unless you really never want to see your family, or simply like working for free STAY AWAY. No overtime, bonuses, or comp time, yet management will see you in a bad light if you aren't willing to give up your weekends to fix management's poor scheduling issues."
bad,"The team I worked with in Huntsville was great.  The worse part of this company is Hunt Valley.  They forget and don't acknowledge remote sites.  VP was non responsive to concerns and had poor communication skills.  Honesty is the biggest concern with their code of business ethics.  They tell you what you want to hear to keep you around then turn around and lay off key players without thinking of the ramification to the contracts.  I understand business and I know everything is about the bottom dollar but lets not forget those that are making the bottom dollar for you.  The hardest part of my job was staying positive in my position and keep office morale up with no reach to HQ to make any positive changes to keep people happy.  The best part of my job was my site.  We banned together with the downfall of our location and were genuine and hard working to get all the tasks done, while the customer loved our work they weren't happy with upper management usage of our talents and abilities that were limited by Hunt Valley."
bad,"Benefits are the only thing this company offers that is good. Temp employees get no benefits though.  They lie to the employees and the temporary help.  Tell you what they think you want to hear to hope you stay around a lil longer.  Promised employees raises and don't deliver when you are truly deserving.  Promise the temp employees (which is all they hire now) permanent positions with benefits but don't deliver when the time comes.  Lots of turn over in the workforce due to this.  Poor management and no accountability so if you are good at your job be prepared to spend half your day fixing stupid peoples mistakes while they just keep right on making more mistakes.  This company does not know how to treat good people.  If you are lazy and dont care about your future or the future of the company this is the job for you.  Work is comparable to shipbuilding but on a smaller scale.  Really a shame, even lower management doesnt like the way they have to treat the employees."
bad,"Sacramento Location Exited December 2014."
bad,"Management is changing hands faster than they deal cards in Vegas. Co-workers are a toss up, some good some bad as expected anywhere. No room for advancement, improvement or outside ideas. If you don't want to drink the kool-aid you wont fit in. "
bad,A small subsidiary meant to supplement an existing finace entity. Plan was poorly developed and the company ultimately closed
bad,Would not recommend this employer. Too many politics. Regulatory compliance issues.
bad,"When you walk into Textron the negative people try to drain the life out of you. Everyone is supposed to be working together yet somehow everyone is worried about everything but work. Supervisors show favoritism and fail to handle any employee complaints when it matters the most. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here , definitely not full time anyway. I would recommend better management (people who actually care about their workers) and remodeling. The place looks and smells like death"
bad,"Attending endless meetings to figure out problems.  Fundamentally, the use of meetings is used for all concerns, status, and communication.  Group thinking and teamwork is stressed.  There are many meetings with no agenda, person identified to work on actions, and cliquey type behavior day in and out.  Being unprepared isn't a concern as long as you attend the meeting."
bad,Lack of leadership across the organization has left most people with out any idea where they are heading.  Management has no regard for visionary people.
bad,"After 10 years the company I would not advise any one looking for a rewarding job to seek employment here Advancement is not offered often.. Many people have been laid off, while others have been demoted. The work level is high with people made to work 50 hours a week and others taking work home. Raise are bare to none."
bad,"Poor recruiting, poor management, poor team lead, employees purposely get others fired. HR based out of Georgia. Easy to screw their employees over via time off/vacation. Really high turn over rate due to above reasons"
bad,Management is poor no job security at all. You never know when your operation or shift is going home. The upper management works against you as a whole
bad,I was hired for the accounting department but somehow had to work IT technical tickets and take over HR responsibilities.  I had a hard time learning anything because my boss was constantly changing my responsibilities before I could learn them.  The IT department sent all system issues concerning time keeping software to me because they did not know how to work in the system nor did they want to learn.  I was hired as hourly and told there was no overtime but my boss always called me over the weekend asking me to check the system or time cards.  I ended up working every other Sunday because management never did their job responsibility concerning time cards.  I could never enjoy my days off or holiday breaks because my boss would call or send my texts (on my personal phone) to work.  Was told by my boss that I should always take my laptop home in-case she needed me to do something after work hours.  My boss had no concern for her employee's work life balance.
bad,"This company is a joke (well, at least at this location). First of all, their office stinks because there are dogs all over the place ""yes dogs in the office all day"". If don't like dogs (or dogs jumping on you at work with an excess of drooling all over your clothes and your belongings, then keep moving). They are a very small team but cannot understand and work in harmony another (always loud arguments and disagreements between the manager and his employees). Everyone watches his back there. The manager is very unprofessional and thinks he is on top of the world (very poor management skills). He talks to employees like his own dogs and has no patience for whatsoever. One thing for sure, if you work there you will have to interact with him almost everyday. If you're looking to get into a stressful and unprofessional work environment go ahead and take a chance."
bad,worst place to work and the staffs are clueless and not very helpful at all. the people in the HR department is very discriminate and not treating people with respect and unfair.
bad,human resources doesn't know where to place people for their qualifications if you want a big paycheck that's fine if you want benefits forget it you will end up paying your own health costs until you meet your deductible. Their training process lacks if you are just starting in the field good luck.
bad,I find it to be ridiculous that they have this position still open and yet i applied for this position almost a week ago and they sent me a denial email stating they found someone that's more suitable. what I find to be even more ridiculous is that I met all of their qualifications for this job and they still claim they found someone else that's more suitable.
bad,"They produce UAVs but the mentality in most areas is drone-like, how ironic.  Production workers here tend to gravitate to the moody, aloof,  opinionated and some are manipulative and backstabbing.  Lots of territorial aggression is a big problem with a few of the more ""seasoned"" employees.  On the bright side there a lot of really great people there and there are a lot interesting systems to work on and develop. A difficult to advance in good ol boy network seems to be prevalent. Stay away and find a place that employ more adults and pays real wages...."
bad,"Some of the employees try to be nice, but when you have worked there 6months and the manager comes thru everyday and calls everyone by name, EXCEPT YOU, you realize only certain people matter ."
bad,"At one point a friendly place to work now a operation of lies and people who dont know what they are doing. They dont pay well, and to save themselves from scrutiny you will be the scapegoat."
bad,"Textron does a great job at implementing changes but fails miserably with the Control phase. For every step forward they take 2 steps back. Product quality is at an all time low and there is no real structure put in place to help employees succeed."
bad,"Toxic managers"
bad,Unrealistic goals. Poor management. Constant corporate restructuring. Health benefits are non existent. Ultra high deductible plans are the only option. Mandatory overtime to try and reach unattainable goals. Employees are not treated well. Pay is low for the amount of stress and responsibilities placed on you. Only thing that matters is meeting the bottom line.
bad,"If you work the third shift, you mean nothing to the company. You get hand me down tools if you get any at all. Requesting a tool or weld jacket will take months to receive if ever. You can request a code for the vending machines 12 times and still won't receive one. Unorganized. They push production yet don't take into consideration the 2 hours spent on the fork lift getting supplies. First shift employees get hired before th it's shift. If 2 employees start at the same day and 1 is on first and the other on third. The one on first will be hired in 3 months while the one on third won't ever be hired. When you email HR asking why that is they will completly ignore you. First shift can have up to 18 hours overtime while third shift gets 0. If you ask them if you can come in on Saturday they say they will let you know but never do. The parking on first shift is a joke. There isn't enough parking spaces with a full parking lot, but then they go ahead and park the completed vehicles out there too. The company is a series of dumb decisions."
bad,Poor management but good employees. If they want things to change it needs to start with the top down. You will have no work life balance but the pay is pretty good no complaints on this end.
bad,Textron used to be a good place to work but a downturn on production has made it a very stressful environment constantly taking on jobs with unrealistic schedule dates.
bad,Ok if all you want to do is get a paycheck for a few years but no career growth path and manage is always wanting more and more for less and less
bad,We work individually and not much team work is done. I listen work with other business units making sure the PO's can three match. Management is not good.
bad,pay is not that great and they are not flexible on hours at all
bad,"Implementation and setup of cellular manufacturing"
bad,"Had the oportunity to learn new positions in little time of employment , Management needed more people communication skills , good co-workers ( a little intemendated of my advancements ) , INCONVIENCE when you dont have necessary equiptment and man power , Some morning meetings the management gave good reviews with a smile"
bad,One of the coworkers was an Donkey. Went to HR and they just brushed it off. After seven months I couldn’t take the BS any longer. There were plenty of people that wanted to leave but couldn’t do to personal situations.
bad,"Just your typical job. Nothing great, low pay. Started at the defense sector, which does not exist anymore. The best part of the job were the co-workers, hardworking and extremely friendly."
bad,"Work is pretty standard, 8 - 9 hour days on average, above and beyond as required. Management is very focused on the political plays, which make it tough to get things done."
bad,"consistent change with no direction of improvement or goals. "
bad,The Union runs the place.  Changes come at a glacial pace. Company makes a great product.  Safety record top-notch.
bad,"• Assure technical compliance, accuracy of information and conformance to company military and commercial requirements for all Engineering Drawings, Engineering Orders, Limited Design Variations, 2D drawings, 3D models and other engineering documents that are used in the release of engineering information"
bad,"I worked at AVCO which was taken over by Textron in the 80s. I had been there almost 31 years, and that's when they started laying off all of the people who were unlucky enough to be close to retirement."
bad,"Textron Unmanned Systems division is divisive and toxic.  The company appreciates adherence and top-line revenue, at times, at the expense of customer responsiveness."
bad,"The company focuses on reducing cost by looking at tangible items rather than how to cut cost by improving processes. There is so much opportunity for this company if they'd just pay attention. Recently it has just been layoff after layoff! Which make the work life so difficult. The motto is ""Do more with less"" but that can only go so far until you have the rest of the team stressed to the max. "
bad,Textron had too many managers and directors reporting to too many more senior level leadership
bad,"being here at Textron I have learned new software. A typical work day for me consist of processing, researching, and doing metric reports. My co-workers are very helpful. The hardest part of my job is doing two or more things at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job is my check."
good,"At Textron we like to force employees 50+ out so we can hire new college grads for a 1/3 the cost! Some would think fantastic business plan until you realize all the knowledge goes out the door with those employees. "
good,At the time of employment defense spending was big and lots of programs for America's defenses. Massive workforce and security clearances needed on a lot of projects. Constant training and meetings. When defense spending cut all jobs disappeared. Not solid employment
good,"it deals with a lot of running around and moving."
good,Life work balance is not great for Production Managers and all departments are stretched thin. There are not very many opportunities to advance once in a management role.
good,"It is very hard to get promoted on merit.  It is a Texas good ole boy company.  It is a normal 40 hr week job.  Management consisted of family members,"
good,"Not a nice place to work. Bad middle management practices. Some disrespectful people in power positions. Culture of fear and obey."
good,"The atmosphere was treated like a high school. Forced to work extended hours with little to no notice, and little to no on the job training."
good,In all fairness it has been almost 14 years since I worked at Textron so any experience I have of the company is most likely stale. At the time I worked there I lasted 2 years and was considered long term.
good,Long hours and  lots of overtime. I learned so many new things working here. I was doing final inspections where I worked before and here I had the opportunity to see the parts comming in the door
good,Management does not promote from within and it is hard to transfer between departments.  Management does not communicate will with the employees.
good,The culture had shifted at the former company from a product centric organization to a profit concentric organization from the recent acquisition. The people are the best in the organization but the corporate mind has shifted from a customer first mentality to a must meet unobtainable profit targets drive. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet the goals dealing with a non-technical management structure. Great satisfaction in creating innovative designs and leading highly competent individuals.
good,"I would start my day by separating the invoices to each member of the accounts payable team. I would enter bills in the computer to be paid, and I would go over expense statements from the sales team; to make sure they were correct. My co-workers were all women, so at times it was tense to work in, but the majority of time it was a fun environment to work in. The most enjoyable part of the job was the communicating back and forth with the customers on the telephone."
good,"Learned about heatsheilds and associated GSE required, all types of castings and machinings, parachutes, rocket motors, EEDs and explosives"
good,Very busy place - the volume of work does not come close to the number of hours in a day. My manager was great - allowed me to take ownership of my work.
good,I worked there for 6 years. There is room for anybody to move up but the management is so poor nobody never stays or take the position. benefits are good and the pay is average in the area I worked. The company does not tell employees anything until the last minute and expect you to work over at the last minute. A lot of favoritism in the company an a lot of people who worked over 30 years that doesn't understand change but I'm grateful for the opportunity
good,Not great but good. Keep your head down. Don't rock the boat. Don't expect to exceed any expectations - there are processes and calculations in place to ensure you can't and an HR and management team willing to ensure that you don't. Over time is often times available. Decent benefits. Very slow turnover rate - we've all been here for years. Just don't rock the  boat.
good,"A decent place to work, but nothing exceptional.  Like many larger companies, your job situation will vary greatly depending on the organization, program, or site worked at.  Compensation is fair, but the company does a poor job of recognizing the contributions of various employees.  The Hunt Valley site is over populated with too many people packed into small spaces.  They need to expand that site or move people to different locations."
good,"Textron is a LARGE Holding with No Personality."
good,Not a bad place to work however the work environment is negative overall. Team moral seems to go down every year. It is also very hard to climb in the company. Even with years of experience the company will not promote you without going back to school to get your masters degree. Pay is also not as high as competing companies.
good,very busy work environment learned a great deal about benefits and the different unions. The most enjoyable part was being able to help employees.
good,Enjoyed working with the company as a whole. The co-workers in my department were all overwhelmed with work and that was normal but were always available to assist with questions.
good,"Textron has a great set of products across various domains. job satisfaction depends on the team in which you work. Salary and perks are on par with the industry. Not so agressive projects and pace of learning."
good,"If you are a snitch or a butt kisser you will go far. Sorted. Favoritism shown in management. Redundant. Lackadaisical. "
good,A typical day was moderate. I learned how to assemble fuel tanks less than 2 months.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with hot temperatures in the warehouse.
good,"Show up, clock in, toolbox talk. Strict punch-in/out rules and penalties. Production quotas need to be met. Can be annoying to work there but it was not too bad. Long hours"
good,Loved working with my team and developing new products. Leadership more focused on replacing experience with college new hires on a quarterly basis.  This practice makes long-term career growth limited.
good,"Great people. No advancement possible. Management continues to cut head count in all departments, with no regards to length of employment. Respect is great among peers."
good,Had no problem with workplace except for the fact that it was very unorganized and there was no room for advancement in my position.
good,Co-workers are unfriendly and not willing to help each other
good,"Great company but they are in a constant state of flux , always changing and never stable for very long. if you can handle the constant and normally drastic chances then this job is for you."
good,It's a okay company the insurance isn't good and there wasnt a union where I was so at times that wasnt a good thing either. It's a fast past company.
good,I worked from home office so I wasn't too familiar with the office environment.  I worked in an office and factory with John Deere and both were good experiences.
good,"culture is all about the youth movement, if you are over 45 yrs old forget about promotion. If you are over 50, you are part of the Jurassic Park nation."
good,"- Good coordination between India and US team"
good,"There is longevity in Textron Systems and pride in the products that they produce. "
good,"This is a good shop to work at for low to medium skill levels. Shop politics have been a distraction at times. You will find success here on the shop floor if you show up, keep to yourself, and do your job."
good,"Fairly representative of an traditional manufacturing company, management may not always be open to new ideas. Very receptive and interested in offering new learning opportunities and getting the right people in the right positions."
good,"I enjoy working for the company. There are always opportunities to work on projects and assist coworkers. There is also a great emphasis on teamwork, and giving back."
good,Working here was great and I learned a lot about machine operating. But I also learned how the warehouse environment works. I was able to learn many new things from my coworkers and team leaders and they were helpful in helping me prepare for a new journey in my career here at Textron.
good,Textron gave me a lot of work related experiences that I would not have received if I did not work for them. They treated us well for the most part and wanted us to succeed.
good,First job out of college was really looking forward to pushing myself and to learn new things but Textron was not good for this.  I found myself doing nothing for about half my day and when I did have work it was mostly trivial tasks with little to no impact on actual decisions made.  If I was preparing for retirement this would be a great place to work as its laid back and not very exciting but for a fresh graduate it was disappointing.  Also my experience may not be representative of other departments
good,"I don't have too much to say about Textron. It was my first job and it was a great experience for me. A Textron I worked for different managers, but it helped me reaching my highest point of my career."
good,"Great place to work. Would appreciate good project management discipline to take projects forward. Several technological areas are underdeveloped, in some areas."
good,"Supported quality and safety goals set by my department while completing jobs within a reasonable amount of time."
good,"Textron has several highly diversified business units. Bell Helicopter, for example, is a large, military business and has a different culture from Textron Specialized Vehicles which is a medium sized business unit in the private sector. "
good,Typical day at work could vary based on the week. Environment is decent. Management is ok. There could be more effort placed on development. Good benefits.
good,Not sure if the know what they are doing. They have paid holidays. They go to happy hour ever Thursday. They alos have some other activities that include sports.
good,Came into this knowing it could end but got used to the schedule and the stress of contract renewals every 6 months or so. I love my job and the people I work under but want a bit more security.
good,Moderate follow-through on contractual promises such as security clearance. Unstable management structure and duty assignment but that goes with the territory of the occupation.
good,"Work long hours. Great place to start a career or learn on the job. Flexible hours. Great supervisor. "
good,"i enjoyed my time here to an extent when there was no drama between co workers. if your looking for a steady job this is the place to go, as long as you can put up with some questionable rules and people. easy to not get fired all you gotta do is your job and show up."
good,"As its always said, there is no I in team. I have the best group of fellow co-workers from engineering to production and everything in between.  We all have specific skills and work hard to accomplish any task."
good,"•	Assure technical compliance, accuracy of information and conformance to company military and commercial requirements for all Engineering Drawings, Engineering Orders, 2D drawings, 3D models and other engineering documents that are used in the release of engineering information."
good,"Boa empresa, mas devido a informalidade das operações no Brasil deixa a desejar. "
good,great work schedule. Four 9 hour days and one four hour day (Friday)
good,Read blue print and Drilled and riveted aft and fwd straps to the fuselage.
good,"Hard to work at the Corporate Division, when they allow the companies they own to run separately most of the time."
good,Ok for just starting or ready to retire not good benefits don't go out of town for them ........dont look for any big bonuses or raises at all go for it
good,there was always someone telling you to to do this that way when you you was shown by another person a different way to do your job. There are three or more people on each side of plane very confusing about what to do when to do it.
good,"Textron is a relatively average company. More good than bad, with the day to day of your job being the best part and the lack of transparency being the worst part. Still, middle managers are the ones who will give it to you straight and are largely who you work with. Job security can be good or bad but it is difficult to know where you stand. Try to address all things upfront and I think working here can be a good experience."
good,"Summer Sys. Eng. intern. Assigned to 3 overworked engineering managers who had no time for me. Annoying, but figured things out alone. Paid very well!"
good,"Office manager overseeing 2 employees in the AP and AR positions. Responsible for payroll, human resources, creating and coding to general ledger accounts, bank reconcile, accounts payable and accounts receivable reconcile. Utilizing Peachtree Quantum, Excel and Outlook"
good,"Lots of paperwork, with 3 to 5 hrs. of inflight reveiws daily."
good,"I worked at both a business unit and at the corporate office of Textron as a young financial analyst. The culture and people at the business unit were extremely encouraging of process improvement and professional development. They were also warm and fun to be around, which made going to work very enjoyable. The culture at the corporate office is cut and dry, systematic changes are rarely considered, and the people are not very friendly."
good,The work was ok but the management was horrible. In order to get ahead it was all about who you know and what you where willing to do to get the position.
good,"A decent first job, but manufacturing companies in  old fashion defense industries are stagnant and not very exciting for most positions. Stick for 2-3 years tops."
good,"we entered very early, everyone knew what he had to do,i learned a lot, all  the manager very respectful and kind with all staff, the administration was good, and the hardest part was it was done rework, it was to change the parts of all kinds and averything dis all ."
good,I enjoyed my time at Textron.  The employees were the best part of the organization.  Was a family atmosphere with room to grow.  I was at Textron 10 years prior to my departure.
good,"good working team and environment"
good,Had been a productive and fun workplace - tough times in the defense industry really hit hard
good,Give them a 5 out of 10. The day to day work was fine. A typical day at the office was pretty busy cause we are overwhelmed with excessive job duties due to short-handedness. Compensation should be a lot better for a company of this size and nature.
good,"My overall experience at Textron was not bad. Although, they did have a delay on hiring people full-time from the temp service. Once I was hired on they made feel apart of the team and the benefits were good."
good,"Early on there were great mentors. Towards the end, experience and compentency were not valued. Over emphasis on young inexpeienced, engineers killed the business. Really enjoyed my career there, great people and interesting programs. Management was good and bad, pay was good."
good,The flexibility of the the hours great pay working for the government.  Dynamic company that specializes in building great technology for today's time and needs.
good,"It is a very good workplace, but you need to think about your own growth professionally and personally."
good,Culture américaine très marquée parfois difficilement applicable en France
good,la entrada era a las 6am el ambiente de trabajo con las compañeras era bueno las cargas de trabajo eran buenas todo el dia tenia .la parte mas dificil era la hora de almuerzo no habia un comedor
good,"My time with Textron has been a tremendous opportunity for growth and develpment, as well as a source of pride for the product lines that we worked on.  There are a lot of great people, and a number of opportunities that are available for those that excel, work hard, and are diligent."
good,"Long hours overseas and good compensation for doing so.  Pay in the states is not as good/ with long work hours.  This section of the company is not family oriented, so if you have a wife and children and want to keep them around I would suggest something else.  Management has very little understanding for people with families, but it is great for young single people."
good,"Good place to learn how supply chain operations work, but Textron is not the best place to learn about innovation. They are good about moving people around between business units but management in the smaller business units is flawed."
good,Very positive corporate environment with good work-life balance culture. adequate benefit and retirement package. diverse multi-cultural environment.
good,You can move within Textron if you try. Get out of E-Z-GO and get a real job in the parent company as soon as you can. Great people and stupid upper management is the quickest way to sum up E-Z-GO. They had a theft ring operating there for some time that was busted recently. Over a million dollars in loss estimated and the FBI is investigating...How could management not see that?? Top echelon is empty suits mostly.. The good folks usually leave ezgo and move to a better position within Textron. Good old boy net work is navigable - just be aware it exists. Great people working in the trenches mostly. MAny life long friendships are formed there.
good,Okay company to work for. Health insurance is just awful.
good,Textron Fasteners in Greenville Ms was an awesome place to work the supervisors and hourly employees were very helpful and knowledgeable. Textron wanted everyone that wanted to learn about every area in the the plant by cross training.
good,A place you really enjoy working in very interesting place just to walk round in. Great people.
good,La empresa no valua la excelencia profesional ni la pro-actividad. La empresa da mas prioridad al tipo de empleado que se limita a seguir reglas.
good,"Worked in Textron Systems divison developing simulation software. The deadlines, workloads, and expectations were constantly out of project scope due to poor up front project management."
good,I advanced very quickly within the company. I really enjoyed the advancement that they gave me. I also appreciate all the people at Cessna that really tried to help my advancement.

I had a standard work day, i.e. meeting about floor issues with management team everyday, SQDIP  (Safety, Quality, Delivery, Inventory and Productivity.  This was discussed with Floor operators everyday.  The most difficult part of the job came towards the end.  We had to make schedule with all of us knowing we were losing our jobs.  They all gave 100% to make sure it happened.  We didn't get to many ""I'm done attitudes"".  Everyone took pride in their work. The hardest part of the job was meeting schedule when people were out.

good,"Textron Systems was certainly a place where they casually check in with you to see if you have a grasp of whatever it was you were learning. Soon after, they'll take that to heart and be offering you more tasks/responsibilities to keep you busy and active to push yourself while making sure stuff is getting done for the well-being of the company. Once you get started in Accounting at Textron Systems, a key thing is understanding your roles during the given part of a monthly process to understand how your work week is going to shape up. The hardest part of the job is when you do have to learn the new things eventually because you have to then remember it more on your own the following month after not really practicing it much since you were taught it. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you reflect and see how much more new things you are capable of doing compared to when you started with the company."

I learned a lot about a companies security and how crucial it can be to the success of a company. It kept my productive all the time, whether I was signing people in, answering phone calls, or doing the patrols of the facility, I was constantly doing something. I enjoyed the job and the pay was decent for a college student. The only hard part about the job was the shifts. Working in security for Textron was a 24 hour/365 days a year job.
