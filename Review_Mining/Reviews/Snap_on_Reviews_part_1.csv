bad,Horrible environment. Bad place to work. If i could give 0 stars all around I would. It was horrible management bad attitudes. People had clicks so starting there you would take break by yourself could find the lunch room or bathroom charged you for anything and everything they could. Would not pay you for overtime. Overall Opinion is do not work here
bad,"Lots of false promises during the interview phase. 6 weeks training , work from home and bonuses did not materialize.  Was shown maybe 10% of what was necessary to do the job , then they just threw us on the phones and told us to ""sink or swim ""  because they were either too lazy or too incompetent to train us on their computer systems thoroughly.  Many people dropped out during training. Sink or swim is a system destined for failure.  The turnover is so high they have an employment agency on premises. Callers were often frustrated due to our lack of knowledge to help them. Those that were supposed to be assisting when we were on the phones much too soon , were busy using their cell, talking to friends and generally not paying attention to us. When we did ask for help they were often annoyed. The environment is filled with cliques and favoritism.  Their customer service department  is disorganized and ineffective."
bad,horrible managment long hours and favortism runs rampant avoid this company at all cost it is worst place i have ever worked managment wise all thoough coworkers are great despite circumstances
good,a great place to learn and launch your career but there is a lot of politicking. there is no job description you will be involved with whatever they demand or needed at the time.
good,Too much mandatory overtime.  Very few advancement oppertunities despite the company's success.
good,"The company is well established, training is on-point. "
good,Good busy job where time passes by fast by working so much. You pick up work order and pick and pack what ever is on the order.
good,"This was an excellent opportunity to develop and hone sales, marketing, collection, and time-management skills. Work/Life balance was not what I wanted it to be, but it was acceptable for the time. There is very little room for advancement on the Franchise side, as you are typically hired in synonymous to being our own boss. Strict adherence to company policies, to include sales route schedules, is a must in order to be successful."
good,This job is not hard and time moves fast. The people are friendly. They pay decent as well. There is a chance to get hired full time.
good,"Snap-on "
good,The management is friendly and like a family. The office is a productive work place not afraid to cut off dead weight. The hardest part of the job is probably the grind that comes with office work. The most enjoyable part would be seeing the fruits of the grind.
good,It is a great company to work for that discounts are awesome people are great work with I found it to be a little racy against white people and black people
good,"typical day lots to do with tools."
good,"When i first started there my job was to pick tools and package them for customers then as time when on i was moved to the shipping department.My responsibilities in the shipping department  were to scan the packages that were complete into the computer system, print the shipping label and place the packages onto the truck."
good,"Typically the day started with a meeting, then each employee was given a stack of 60 items to put into plastic containers. Afterwards employees were sent to their designated areas to complete orders that needed to be shipped out. This included picking items for the aisles throughout the warehouse and putting them in the designated boxes to complete the order. Then after about an hour of doing that I was sent to put the order review and tape boxes so they could get processed to ship. The hardest part of the job was that it was third-shift and on Sundays it would be extremely hot since the air system wasn't on during the weekends. The most enjoyable part was the people you work with. Everyone was always so friendly."
good,"Snap on is a amazing company to become a part , good team member , nice clean work area . really good about working with you on things highly recommend to anyone intersted in the tool world ."
good,Work in a very safe and caring facility. Management is helpful in achieving my goals as an employee and have my safety as main priority.
good,Typical day in the call center environment was a challenge that I loved everyday. I loved the fast paced work day. For me there was no room for advancement as it was a clicky office. I kept to myself and got my work done with great reviews to show for it.
good,"Awesome and fun place to work, loved what I did, but had to relocate or I would still be there. Had a ton of fun over the years. Learned a lot that will help me in future opportunities."
good,I love the job and what I did and people I worked with was awesome just need new management and hr lady other than that it's good place to work my supervisor was pretty kool
good,"Itâ€™s great, i get along with my boss and the customers are fun to talk to and get to know.  Have learned new this to work the computer software well. Am exited to continue learning and possibly making a career there."
good,Went to different business and delivered tools. Daily paper work.Attended monthly meetings demonstrated how tools worked. Made daily deposits from sales.
good,The paid for my schooling and gave me an intern position in the job to help me learn more about my field of studies.
