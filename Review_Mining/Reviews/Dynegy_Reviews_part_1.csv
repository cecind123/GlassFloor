bad,"Worked on the Acquisition project...Dynegy's mentality is ""the contractors.""  Upper Mgmt. in Plant and Corporate has a lot to be desired.  Their own employees are not happy.  In a meeting regarding the acquisitions, the plant acctg mgr stated that employees should bring their sleeping bags and pillows.  When another manager stated the employees could just check into the hotel a couple of blocks from the job and she countered, ""they won't have time.""  The worst part of it is that she was serious.  She came from Calpine and has only been there approx. two years and obviously has an ""I AM THE Say-So.""  Managers under her only have the titles without the authority.  Dynegy just came out of bankruptcy and I can see it coming again....KARMA."
bad,"Stuck in the 1980s work ethic. No advancement to higher positions, management has deaf ears when new ideas or recommended/suggested improvements are mentioned. Supervisors do not encourage/or want you to learn more efficient ways of how to do your job-for fear of you taking their position. The morale is very low."
bad,Its a good environment except on the management side they don't know how to handle their employee at Moss landing Power plant they have Favorite cause the color of your skin like a bad child and a good kid.They have employee at Moss he don't get in trouble no matter how bad mistake he do still ok and his father is in management in Main corporate office so no matter how you complain to Human resources nothing happen.Its not a pleasant company to work with.
bad,"Diversity and Inclusion does not apply to this company, they try to screw anybody that isn't in the good old boys club. They are not very labor friendly."
bad,"Slow, reactive, mismanaged, bookish, elitist. Have no clue how to retain and grow talent. This company is a haven for predatory consultants. A very stifling environment."
bad,was a good place until management has ran the place into the ground. health insurance out of pock expenses so high your better off without it. job placement is based off seniority and not knowledge or work ethic so a lot of dead beet know nothings will have a $40/hr job and you will be stuck at $17.
bad,Flex time was an advantage and most of the co-employees were nice and friendly.  Senior management was a different story.
bad,"you work you go home. this is a no thrills place to work. 12hr rotating shift work a lot of overtime. there are different positions to cover ops inside covering bottom ash, out back there 5 positons to cover."
bad,"Dynegy Inc. offers  good benefits and salary to their union employees. Unfortunately due to the coal industry decline, the plant will be closing in July 2017."

good,"The culture between management has gone down hill. They recently close down the two super critical boilers and laying off half of there work force at Moss Landing. Dynegy as a company pays well they have a 401K and 6% to portable retirement plan. But the union was with out a contract for three years while Dynegy was in bankruptcy which led to morale going down hill also. I left in 2013 for a more stable job. PG&E did not renew there operating contract for the super critical boilers, 2017 California SB law had Moss Landing decreasing there output to the sea by 50% killing the two super critical boilers."

My typical day involved working with a team of talented engineers and researchers to delineate new strategies and deploy new products.
