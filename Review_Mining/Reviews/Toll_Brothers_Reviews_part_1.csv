rating,review
bad,"Low morale, lack of support from management, lack of purposeful work at times.  Some work was not used.  Work life balance was decent.  I dont really support their mission of building mcmansions on farmland."
bad,Terrible experience liars and cheats promise advancements that don’t happen cover up workplace accidents steal from their vendors and place pressure on warranty to fine vendors or offer blackmail
bad,"Toll Brother's does not train, they have employees that hate working there train new employees but they are so scared of losing their job they only teach you the basics. The manager i had micromanaged only me, and showed favoritism towards my fellow co-worker that would talk about them but kiss butt every chance she had. I would definitely not recommend this just to anybody."
bad,A complete overhaul is needed to make the division effective.  System is comprised of nepotism and politics.  Competent people see this and leave knowing they don't want to waste their time.
bad,On the property mgt side of toll apt group... very disorganized. Property falling apart they spend no money on maintains occupied units. I was the 6/7th property manager in less than a years time.
bad,"The coworkers were snotty and demeaning. My boos was unavailable and rude.  They were judgemental and nasty people. The product sold like hotcakes, very well thought out and marketed."
bad,This company never promotes within they always hire out. They don''t give you the opportunity for growth. They also do not like to give raises. They are horrible at training and quick to fire people even if it is 3 days before Christmas. If you do not have goals or don't like change this the place. But if I you want an opportunity for growth in a company I would not recommend this company. They have great benefits but you may not be employed long enough to enjoy them. They will over work you and under pay you.
bad,"The culture at Toll is at best...lousy.  They don't care about customer concerns and care even less about their employees concerns."
bad,"I was hired as a loan officer at the horsham pa office. Was mislead on how much average loan officers make. The way they do business is very outdated. They were still sending out hard copy disclosure packages. Compensation is very loan compared to any other mortgage company. "
bad,They need to learn to accept feedback from employees when asked and not retaliate against them when they offer the feedback.
bad,"Working on a golf course for toll brothers not the best idea.  They may take care of some of their employees but in the golf maintenance dept they leave us hanging.  A billion dollar company should be able to provide full paid holidays...you would think.  Here at toll brothers we get 6 hours for 5 major holidays.  6 hours for Christmas and new years?   Really?  Who pays there employees 6 hours for a holiday?  So if we want a while day off for Christmas was have to use our own paid time off.  How is that even fair?  We work 5 days a week usually 6 for this company and they can't even manage to give us a whole paid day off on a holiday?  So I worm all year for what exactly to save my own paid time off so I can have a normal holiday?  Do we get overtime for working the holiday..."
bad,Don't bother unless you want to be miserable...im sure each location is different but it was a very CLICK environment. And LACK of direction from management.
bad,Interviewed here worst experience I have ever had. HR department extremely unprofessional. If you are an  experience LO look else where this is not a good place to work for loan originators.
bad,"I transferred to the Orlando branch and it was a terrible, unprofessional experience. I loved working for the company at my previous location and transferred highly referred from collegues there and collegues in the corporate office. I was extremely disappointed in how I was treated by the Orlando team and would not recommend working for them. Not to mention my salary and transfer negotiations were less than half of what I was making with the company up north. Unprofessional people with no regard for good employees."
bad,"This was not a good experience for me when I worked here.  There is a lot of favoritism and no room for advacement.  If your not in the corporate click, you can forget about being promoted."
bad,"Very Corporate! Relaxed worked environment, culture is golf club membership/ club house. Very tight blue collar networking  system, they hire people that fits the companies image."
bad,"I gave 10 dedicated years of my life to Toll Brothers as a management salaried employee. While off on a serious medical leave I received a letter that stated they could no longer hold my position. When I called to enquire about this and ask for some sort of severance package I was told the decision was made not to offer me one. In the 10 years I was with the company I don't recall ever hearing of a salary employee being let go without a severance package of some sort."
bad,"There were some amazing perks and great potential to be a fun and productive environment.  Unfortunately, lack of strong management, as well as clueless management sapped all of that.  Sales was in charge of processing, and people who had never processed a file were telling you what to do.  Favoritism was rampant.  Work/life balance was the lowest priority."
bad,"If you thrive on unnecessary stress then this is the place for you! This club will say anything to get you in the door. They will tell you that you have the resources to perform at a high level but that is nonsense. When you become frustrated after beating your head against the wall, the GM will tell you that you aren't managing things correctly. The horrible culture in the food and beverage department has led to a completely apathetic staff that are only there to earn a check and go home. Staffing levels are kept to an absolute minimum, so maintaining any type of a clean and organized kitchen is nearly impossible. Workspace and equipment are badly outdated and in poor repair. If this place were inspected by the health department it would fail miserably. The hardest part of the job as a manager is leading and motivating a staff when, as a manager you are working 70 hrs offsetting labor. The benefits are great and pay is decent but well below industry standards for managers. They are perfectly happy with mediocre staff if they are cheap. This place is not where you showcase, refine and expand your skill set. They participate in no professional associations that high quality clubs do,  so networking and exposure to your industry is not encouraged. The best part of this job is  leaving at the end of the 13 hour day. Oh yeah, if you were promised a raise or bonus, there will always be a reason why that won't happen."
bad,Very poor management  They seem to hire only promote management from within their small pool of construction managers   They regard sales people as being only as good as their last sale.
bad,Not a friendly place to work . Constantly talked down to and berated every day. Nobody has your back and you are on your own as team work is unheard of. Paper work is always being changed and being back dated to cover upper management not doing it on time or to cover mistakes. Sales is even worse about promising homeowners the world and not being honest. Setting false expectations and being terrible about bad paper work .
bad,"The Arizona mortgage site is horrible. They have no leadership and no direction. The VP's/site presidents last about 2 years max then get fired. The systems are about 10 years outdated compared to other mortgage companies. This could be a great place to work at if the upper management could find a leader to run this company from AZ not PA. They also have no clue how to handle Jumbo loans which is the majority of their business in the AZ site. The pay is decent but nobody can close enough loans to make any real money. I would recommend looking at a different builder prior to coming to this company as your will either quit or get fired prior to hitting your two year mark. The longest lasting employee at the AZ mortgage site is 3 years and the avg. tenure is about 8-12 months, that should say it all. The Toll Brothers sales managers and production managers hate dealing with TBI Mortgage as well."
bad,"As a Greeter I might suggest working in retail sales instead you may make more. Greeters are not given benefits and are expected to work ""up"" at the low pay they give even for the full time position. I don't recommend Toll Brothers because they take advantage of and don't pay benefits to Greeters. The others in the sales office all make better money so it's difficult to feel like part of the team. This produces resentments and conflict. They hire many part time greeters, some who have worked there 10 years, for low pay."
bad,"Mostly carpentry, remodeling, painting."
bad,(I don’t have time for Toll brothers ). information I have sent it to the email email address email and send it out to me the receipt is on the phone number for you and send you the o address email
bad,"Did not enjoy working in this company. The management, and procedures in place were based on supply and demand, rather than providing great service. Do not recommend this company."
bad,This is the place where I learned I am burning out with helpdesk. Boring work culture. Misogynist atmosphere. Just plain boring place to work. I hope not to go back.
bad,You are alway stressed and you will never get caught up on your work.  You will work more hours then you think.  There is no communication between departments at all.  You will work more then what you get paid for.
bad,"The team handles everything that pertains to the Toll infrastructure; operations, implementation, and design. While this presents a tremendous opportunity for learning, there are just a tiny number of resources that are responsible for a rather large network. This consists of NOC duties, turn-ups of WAN circuits, design and configuration of the MPLS network, and even video conferencing.  In addition, management is very controlling; assignments and procedures are dictated. Frequent updates on progress are also required, and there is a good deal of focus on minutiae which creates great inefficiencies.  "
bad,"Toll claims that as a PM you will run the community as your own, but that is not entirely true. Strong micro management in a unstable division with lots of turnover in construction and management. Division is fragile and vulnerable in many ways. Has never gained traction in the San Antonio market for a number of reasons. Toll will work you to death rather than higher the necessary staff. As PM you will likely will be held responsible for things outside of your control. Cut throat environment with little sympathy or compassion. Little chance for advancement unless you move to a larger division in another city."
bad,"Assisting new homeowners with their material selections for their purchases was the highlight of the job. Working in the 10K square foot Design Center was absolutely fabulous - I developed a packet describing the selection process; overview of the options available to the homeowner's development including cabinetry, counter-tops, appliances, flooring and tile for their new home. The homeowner could display samples of their selections and document their selections in the packet for reference,"
bad,There is almost always work to be done so you will never really be left wanting. Just dont expect things to go right or be done in a way that makes sense.
bad,"Although it holds a great group of solid, salt of the earth people, Toll doesn't value its employees which is evident in their sometimes ruthless nature. "
bad,"I worked for toll brothers apartment living, which was new to toll brothers inc... my entire work experience there was inconsistent , to say the least because they were constantly trying to figure out policies and procedures. the pay scales and policies varied from property to property, and nothing ever made sense. in my last year there, they changed regional managers, property managers, and understanding my role was really difficult. the will sell you on the idea of getting trained, and certified.. as well as the idea of getting promotion from within. none of that will happen. ever. don't work for this company."
bad,The company consists of micro managers who surpress any ideas to improve work conditions. Plus nepotism is very obvious within this company so unless you are a family member there is no job security.
bad,"Toll Brothers could be a great place to work.  I truly liked 99% of my co-workers but management completely fall short. I worked in IT and the job was great but the Managers and Directors have huge egos. My Manager didn't have a degree and knew nothing about what my job entailed, he did not understand what my co-workers and myself were actually doing. He also played favorites and it was very apparent to others in the department. My Director was very compulsive and a bit of an ego maniac who only thought his ideas were the good ones. This man has lost Toll Brothers lots of money because of his compulsiveness with ideas that were not suitable for a Corporate environment. I was terminated after being with the company over twelve years because of my Directors ""great"" ideas that did not work and my Managers lack of any IT knowledge."
bad,The Seattle Division needs more time to integrate the Toll Process & Procedures. Toll Brothers purchased Cam West 3 years ago and has had difficulty merging the two companies.
bad,I had no benefits. I could barely handle my bills. I always got overlooked in group projects. Or when I'd stay hours longer for no extra pay. Don't come here if you're looking for a reliable job or anything to take from it.
bad,"Learned at Toll Brothers, that every item reviewed has importance in the Construction Industry"
good,Job is in Hobojen NJ at The Hudson Tea Building. It is close to home. As a concierge I greet all tenants enering the buildin and greet and lof all visitors. Mangement provides little incentive. The pay is terrible and the benifits are few. They do provide 10 sick days.
good,They need to live by the standards that they set most of them were not enforced. The people they hired or not drug tested. I was made promises that were never fulfilled. I probably would have stayed if I got the help that I need it but the company did not seem to want to have a sit down and talk about everything that is not right with the sidewalks in the parking lot. Safety factors everywhere
good,I am concerned that the opportunity to grow isn't equally given to all employees.   employees get stuck in specific locations and not allowed to explore other opportunties
good,This particular property is a struggle based on location and clientele. The team at the time (mostly Level 42 employees) was great and put forth a great effort. Toll/Property Owners have invested a great amount of time and money in this location and in my time there things were changing for the better.
good,Good company- sketchy employment practices. Lovely working enviornment.  Versatility in job location and not confined to a cubicle.
good,After I began working at toll Brothers I do not have experience working with complicated saws there was room for advancement overall it was a good learning experience
good,"Loved working there, would work on filing, parties, fliers, talk to the prospects when associates were with other clients. Couldn’t get enough hours, slowly pushed out of th office."
good,"While much depends on the home-building results, the copmpany has remained focused on its goals and had positioned itself well to survive the downturn in the housing markets."
good,It was OK.  It was an OK company with benefits to work for.  People are Ok with work and get to know the business.  The company has been in the construction business for a while and they know their business really good.
good,"It is a great company to learn at ,not excel.Overall the people are great and very willing to teach.I was treated very good at this company."
good,Great place to start your career with great training & support! Very corporate if that is what you prefer. That's it in a nutshell - Have a nice day!!
good,"If you are a forward tinker this is not the place for you. The culture is one of great sucess while sales are strong, however the overall montra through management's actions are don't change anything...I want to contribute to make Toll stronger but the local management cannot get out of their own way..."
good,"Enjoyed the hundreds of customers from all over the world.  Got along with most co workers. Lots of pressure for home sales. Management did not appreciate if you did something good outside of your job responsibilities. One time I received some appreciation and I had to ask for it. The management loves you when you are the top performer. Very well kept model homes. You work alone most days except weekends. It gets lonely. Pay was fair, but no benefits for contingent workers."
good,"Beautiful design center but a seasoned employee with archaic design concepts limits the experience."
good,Toll is a great place to start out. Its not easy to advance. The communication is horrible but where is it not? Everyone kind of just takes it upon themselves to figure out their job and where they stand.
good,"Busy work schedule, weekends and most holidays a must. Customer relations are very important as you work with potential customers you walk them through the entire home building process from contract to closing."
good,"Long hours fun place    Work hard everyday"
good,Always something new to uncover in my role.  Great opportunities to increase your income with the selling opportunities within the state markets.  The hardest part of my job is managing new team members being added to our state team.
good,Toll uses you until you are no longer needed. It's difficult to advance once in  a position. The work environment is beautiful as they produce a fabulous product.
good,"High pressure, low pay. Not much flexibilty on schedule. Resources stretched to thin at times. Management seemed burned out. Worked there a long time ago, so maybe things have changed."
good,Builder that is focused on customer service.  Their goal is to make the homeowner happy at all cost.  Attention is given to homeowners from start to finish to ensure homeowners are satisfied with the end product.
good,"Do your job and keep your head down, Must interrpert what management is looking for.  Management did not forecast work well, Great co workers, worked in office that was overall fun."
good,I just needed to find something closer to home and that worked more around my life style. I felt as if I was strongly underpaid for what the job duties entailed.
good,Toll is a solid company to work for. They are in a structural transition at the moment and will be well served to begin hiring more employees who know the business in detail.
good,I have nothing good or bad to say about Toll Brothers.  It was a place to go to work.  The pay and benefits were fine for the time.  Nothing to complain about.
good,"Typical day for Adm/Receptionist consist of answering the phone and greeting vendors.   I learned about purchasing material for building a new home, the background check for the closing on a new home and accounting responsibility of the company that builds the new home.   Work place culture is great for young pretty ladies and old man.        After two years and two months; I guess i was not a good face for Toll Brothers; being a senior citizen and not a pretty as the young ladies in the office.   It was time for me to be let go with a great stipend and able to collect unemployment when stipend completed."
good,Lots of turnover and changes to the business unit.  Don't listen to the field employee concerns regarding problems that exist and how to rectify the issues.
good,For such a large company they could have done better to promote within and training.  Suggestions were not taken to heart when given.  CEO was not involved with the going ons in the field.
good,Great place to work with fun people and a fast paced environment. Large company which allowed room for growth and pay increase. Never a dull moment working.
good,"Company offers good trainings and it has a nice work environment."
good,the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people at all different places. the management was great. the hardest part was finding out early in the morning where the place was where i had to go work.
good,"Always trying to make things better, consistent change. hands-on guidance is a necessity. continue to build better service.  need to make better use of updated technology."
good,The sales associates aren't as valued as the rest of the work force.
good,"A very busy day with lots of interaction with the public. I learned to sale homes and to use software to prepare contracts. The management was somewhat supportive from a distance. Homes sales is a competitive business so my co workers were guarded. The hardest part of the job was closing a sale. I loved being outside showing lots, showing beautiful homes and introducing people to their dream homes. "
good,"Due to the current situation and the contract I was hired to do, I feel that there could have been better communication and organization in this company. Overall, however, I enjoyed working here and had wonderful people I interacted wtih."
good,I would help out with the last finishing touches on a house to get it ready for the homeowners arrival. My duties ranged from getting all the garbage out to patching smalls wholes in walls
good,Different ways of doing business between corporate and the division office.
good,"Good place to work. Good pay"
good,Toll Brother's was a good company to work for.  They are a true 'big builder' and are successful due to their business model and having the right people in the right places.  Good support from management.
good,"Depending on which sales manager you are assigned to, you may have a great or lousy experience.  Sales managers are supposed to train you to be their equal, but often are threatened by those with experience or potential and attempt to stunt your career path and train you only to be their assistant.  Your entire livelihood, knowledge and employee reviews depend on which sales manager you are assigned to."
good,Management was always willing to educate and help.  I liked working with the other employees.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the consumers.
good,Daily at Toll Bros. Inc I would work on files for communities assigned to me. Opening all files and entering file information and custom home options in company data base. My coworkers were very nice and helpful. They were always willing to help when needed. I enjoyed working at Toll and working with my coworkers and peers from the departments in the building. Everyone was friendly and willing to help. The hardest part of the job was making sure that all information and steps were completed and completed in a timely manner. There were a lot of steps to opening each file and entering information into the system.
good,If you don't mind working with grumpy sub-contractors and home owners then it's not a bad job.
good,"Great place to work, good hours and pay. Depends on the location. Horrible communication with the managers, i wish i would have worked for someone more experienced,"
good,"Toll Brothers provide room for growth, there are sever opportunities for you in many different  fields. .Excellent job and work environment. Established a rapport with government inspectors and contractors for timely completion of home sales while maintaining the integrity of the Toll Brothers standard The company has great people are willing to work as a team to get the job done. You have plenty of resources to complete your daily duties. When lunch time arrives, you have access to a nice cafeteria."
good,Was put in many situations which I grew and learned from. From directing events to moving clubs. There was always an opportunity to gain further knowledge and experience.
good,"Typical day included loading and unloading trailers/train cars. Pulling orders for outgoing loads."
good,"It was a fun, relaxed place to work but management was too quick to make decisions without proper preparation, then employees felt the repercussions.  Lack of communication from upper management left everyone guessing."
good,"Working at toll was a I started from the bottom and work my way to supervisor position quickly, by being a hard working employee and working well with others and helping my fellow co workers with any work issues they my have had"
good,"Ok place to work, management not clear on expectations, frequently giving mixed message.  Told homeowner one thing employee another.  Great co-workers"
good,"it is a good company to work for and coworkers are great "
good,"Met buyers and showed them community plans, properties and floor plans.  Showed properties by golf cart and reviewed how new homes would fit on various lots available."
good,"Great place to work, friendly staff.  Didn't see any room for advancement."
good,"Great organization with a stellar legacy"
good,Working at Toll Brothers was an ok position at the time. The pay was decent for the time that I worked there but you could not sustain a lifestyle much above the poverty level at that time.
good,It can be a fun place to work if you are in a busy community with a great team that you can trust and rely on and the pay and benefits are good. The schedule is tough with only weekdays off and  weekends tough to get off. Training is poor and there is a lack of culture.
good,"good company that gives fast experience, a lot of building that leads to good habits that are ingrained quickly - lots of mentors around that help advise"
good,"Corporate management is first rate! Overall a great company and great brand! Local Division management can be hit or miss. Little opportunity for advancement in responsibilities/contributions, pay or recognition."
good,"Toll Brothers is  a great company to work with, it is time to move on."
good,Toll has been a great place to work.  Managers are supportive.  There's opportunity for growth.  They could do better with vacation time and sick time.
good,Managed incoming mortgage loan applications on the east coast of Florida for new construction homes..Composed closing and pipeline reports for senior management
good,"Having a new management team has helped out since the previous management was never there. My day is never the same which is nice because it always keeps you on your toes going from back of the house to front of the house, setting up events, and talking to members."
good,"Managing new clients, sales office, and model homes. Assisting Buyers from their initial visit, through contract and home selections, and managing Buyers needs until settlement on their new home. Realtor/Broker outreach. Following up with leads, and nurturing leads. Marketing and community event creation. Preparing sales and marketing information, market analysis, and other related items for quarterly reviews. Multitasking in a very fast paced environment. Always met or exceeded sales and customer service goals."
good,I loved working at Dulles Greene Apartments. Residents were mostly easy to work with. Staff was eager to learn. During my employment with Dulles Greene Apartments I was able to train two leasing consultants.
good,"I dont have an early opinion about the company.Give me a month of work."
good,Toll Brothers is a great place to work.  The people there are friendly and willing to help if you have any questions.  I've learned a lot with working in the Construction field and home building and how the process is from start to finish.
good,"Met with homeowners and helped them design and select  their interior options. I learned to deal with different types of personalities, cultures, and backgrounds and meet their needs. Communicating well with  management and co-workers is crucial to the well being of the company's productivity  as well as serving the clients.  The hardest part of the job is when the team-work spirit is broken.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I achieved  the goal of creating the homeowner's ""dream home""."
good,"Toll is a great place to work with an entrepreneurial work environment for anyone in the Operations group. Very diverse responsibilities and the ability to learn all aspects of the Homebuilding business. Access to some of the most talented individuals in the Luxury Homebuilding industry. Fast paced, demanding work loads. Definitely for the ""A"" type personality."
good,"Good culture, slightly less technical user base. Does have opportunity for advancement. Adequate working conditions. Salary slightly lower than industry average."
good,Self-paced atmosphere enable me to complete most jobs without undue pressure. I was given blue prints for each house to use to measure off foundation for exact placement of each footing. I was never under undue pressure to complete more than I could comfortably handle given weather and ground conditions particularly in winter and early spring.
good,"Great to start in New Construction, but management needs to work better with the sales team . Not much improvement on moving up within the company. not consistant around the country"
good,"Toll brothers has been very good to me over these past few years, and the only reason I am seeking a new job is because my current position does not provide enough compensation for the next stage in my life."
good,"Toll Brothers was a great company to work for. I was there before they relocated to Horsham, but enjoyed the people, the company, and the team-building events."
good,"Constant contact with sales to obtain coding, process inovices for payment and filing,worked with accountants to create new codes"
good,"I loved my job at dominion valley country club, the people were great and hours weren't insane.  It's a shame there was an accidental fire in the end."
good,"Great members, relaxed and fun atmosphere. Pay was good, the benefits were very good. Health, dental, vision, life insurance as well as 401K and retirement with stock options. Paid vacation, personal and sick days."
good,"Great benefits, as long as you have positive customer reviews and maintain the company goals."
good,"A typical day at work I would open up the sales center 30 minutes before hours of operation to prepare for the day. Check the model to ensure it was customer ready. Greet potential clients and qualify them accordingly. Find the right home site, right floor plan, and right options that fit within a buyer's budget as quickly as possible. Take ready, willing, and able buyers through a sales process to ensure all hidden objections are covered. I learned how to manage high end buyers at the million dollar price point in new home construction. The workplace culture was about growth and giving back which I loved. The hardest part of the job was not making adequate commissions. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping buyers find their dream homes and watching them live and love the community they bought in. I have lived in the area of my last community for the last 9 years so it was an easy sell for me. That was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"very good management,"
good,"Great place to work with great people, but I am currently making less than half of my projected annual salary.  I wish they would have been more upfront and honest about the pay structure."
good,"A self starter is needed for this position, I learned so much in such a short time it was one of the best jobs I have had, My team of construction managers were great to work with and the hardest part was staying in budget and the most enjoyable part was making the deadline."
good,Toll Brothers offers average salary along with an extremely nice benefit package. The corporate office is very helpful and supports the remote division offices. Each division office is run independently and they are subject to the management style of the Division President in charge.
good,Members and employees made it fun to work there. Beautiful course.  Would run into a few problems here and there but besides that I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
good,"Working at tull brothers was not as bad as I thought it would be when I first applied. I had never done this sort of work before in my life so I thought it was gonna be near impossible for me, but it was not so bad after all."
good,Toll have always delivered some of the best houses in the industry.  Their model homes speak for themselves and I was proud to represent them and the pride reflected also in the homeowners.
good,"Been working with Toll Brothers for 2 years now"
good,"Good place to work. Stressful though. People who work at Toll Brothers are awesome. Everyday is different and brings new challenges. "
good,"Working at Toll Brothers was both rewarding and exciting.  My managers always walked in with a smile on their faces even during those times of high stress when faced with million dollar deals on the table."
good,I show up at 7 and we get work. We gather all the necessary materials for the job that day. I learn something every day whether it be safety or work oriented. I enjoy being around my co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job is working in the heat all day. the most enjoyable part of the day is lunch.
good,Worked with amazing home buyers who provided me the opportunity to help them build their dream home.  Management were very supportive and provided adequate training.
good,"I was excited when I found out that I was hired by Toll Brothers, Inc."
good,"Good work environment with lot of scope to grow."
good,"Manager at the design studio has no management skills, however great benefits and pay.  "
good,good job. I managed 25-30 open warranty requests at a time. Coordinated and supervised repairs as needed. Worked directly with homeowners.
good,"Secured the neighborhood which included the entrance, pool, model homes, golf course and residential areas. The best part of my job was greeting the residence and visitors."
good,"I enjoyed working at Toll Brothers, Inc for the time I was able to. Home sales at this site were very slow, unfortunately last man tobe hired is the first to go."
good,Enjoyed working at Toll.   The people were a pleasure to work with and you were able to have your own schedule and freedom in my position.  Was able to build great relationships with the team.
good,"-Helped strengthed my estimating skills for landscape construction."
good,"Toll Architecture is a fast pace company that focus on construction document completion for client custom orders to new design prototypes. Working with in-house structure engineers, you have the advantage to learn more about structure compontents and in field situations. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay within the provided budget for each job task given."
good,The company gave me a new perspective on life. What it takes to build these amazing homes for people to live in. Great experience overall. They have great benefits and they treat their employees well
good,"I learned a lot from my fellow coworkers.  The Company was good about making sure we got quarterly sales training.  "
good,"My direct manager was very supportive and allowed me to work on my own. He was flexible with our hours and made it a point to work on continuing our education to better our knowledge of construction. When I told him I was leaving Seattle, WA, he did everything he could to help me transfer down, even though it ended up not working out. I would still be with Toll Brothers if I didn't move to Oceanside, CA. If I moved back to Seattle, I would go back just to work for him. He made work fun and cared a lot about his team."
good,Toll Brothers is one of the best builders in the industry to work for.  The management team is outstanding.  The stability and direction of the company are fantastic.
good,"Toll values everybody's contribution to the team.  Everyone has the autonomy to make decisions and not be micro managed or second guessed.  Each day brings new challenges, but that is what keeps it interesting.  You will have to wear many hats in this company.  That is beneficial because you will be thrust into different aspects of the industry that you may have not been exposed to in the past, broadening your experience. Having worked for other home builders in the past, Toll is definitely head and shoulders above them all."
good,Work pace is just enough. Learned so much from the job. My supervisor was supportive and knows how to appreciate a good job. Benefits were great. Co-workers are very friendly.
good,Toll has been a great place to work.  Managers have been supportive.  There has been opportunity for advancement.  They could do better with vacation hours.
good,"Toll was a relaxed company that allowed you to do your job without being micro managed or pressured, however the hardest part was having deadlines and making sure they were met at all times."
good,"Working at Toll Brothers was a great experience.  It was my first time in corporate america.  I loved the people I worked with and the people I met every day.  The buildings were beautiful and I learned a lot from the people I worked with about customer service, real estate development and sales."
good,"The company has great people are willing to work as a team to get the job done. You have plenty of resources to complete your daily duties. When lunch time arrives, you have access to a nice cafeteria."

good,"every day was a good one, helpful co-workers always had someone to go to if you needed help with anything at work or other.like most places do your job and every things ok"
good,"I handle contracting vendors for work on our homes. I work with the builders and vendors to coordinate the contracts from start to finish. I also set up all new vendors and coordinate with corporate to ensure we receive all the correct paperwork to begin the process. My biggest challenge is getting vendors to reply in a timely manner in order for work to begin. I enjoy the relaxed atmosphere as well as being able to work independently. I like the moral the company provides to keep us motivated to work together as a team. The cons I find are being required to work standard 8-5 hours. Previously I worked 7-4 or sometimes even 6:30-3:30 and enjoyed that option as long as we worked our 8 hours. I feel flexibility really encourages an employee to be their best. It's a wonderful perk to help accommodate each employee's needs, even if it's a matter of only one hour or less."
good,Toll Brothers provided an opportunity for me to assist in the development of the Maryland Design Studio from start to finish. I gained valuable knowledge. I was thankful for the opportunity.

good,"great work life balance"
good,"I loved working there, looked forward to go to work the next day. The pay was great and the people were even better. I worked there for 13-14 years, so I had to like it a little."
good,"Real nice place to work.  Managers had there favorites but what place doesn't.  Might just mean those workers worked harder than others.  I learned a lot about construction, blue prints, and estimation."
good,Productive and fun workplace. I learned a lot about the industry and what to expect in a career in architecture. The most enjoyable part was the employees and the environment.
good,They care about their employees. They also have a great communication within which is rare. Highly recommend this company. You will not be disappointed.

Answer phones, greet prospective buyers, tour the models w/them if sales person was not available.  Enter data from visitor's cards, send thank you notes to those that came in, sent fliers and mailers.  Arranged for events and holiday parties for residents and/or realtors.  I learned a lot about real estate, up-grades, build time and the competition.  As there was only myself and the sales manager five days a week and only me two days a week, it would sometimes get quite hectic with many people arriving at the same time.  I loved my job because it was working with people and seeing their reactions to the possibility of building their own home."
good,"Warranty manager for 1,000+ home community. There are many challenges that I must handle day to day."
good,this company has the best benefits to offer.  Great people and great activities.
good,"Toll Brothers is a great company! As a project manager too many jobs too manage. Production home building is not for the faint of heart. Managing, sales, marketing, construction, buyers, company aspects and day to day problems, created less time to be proactive and successful."
good,The hardest part of the job was poor communication within the management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see clients satisfied with their houses.

good,"Day at work consisted of whatever was on my schedule for the day. I was a part of the survey team and I've learned a lot from my co workers while on the job. Management was great and willing to work with you, the work place was great, and the people made it worth it."
good,It was a great place to work.Achieve a lot of goals. Kept the company in my collections up and running smoothly. I am proud to say I was a great employ and enjoyed working there.

Managment was very supportive in teaching and ensuring understanding of lessons. Co-workers were the best to work with, great group of people.

good,"I've been temping for different builders, at Toll Brothers a month. I knew of them, when selling RE in Boston.  Toll Brothers is the cream of the crop and I'll get hired soon. Each community is different depending on location, weather and rural or urban.  Do your Research.  I'll go into Project Management, because it fits my background best and I enjoy the responsibility. "
good,"Toll Brothers is a challenging place to work in that they set the bar extremely high for their employees because that level of performance is what is necessary in order to deliver the product and experience customers have grown accustomed to. It's quality and reputation is what differentiates the Toll brand from other builders--both internally and externally, so, as an employee, I have a sense of pride in going to work every day and wearing the Toll logo proudly on my polo shirt."
good,"I have been at Toll for over 10 years now and like any job it has it's ups and downs. But for the most part my team members are just that ,a TRUE team. That team work has made all the difference. All the management has been supportive to me in the 10 plus years I have been here. I was even laid off back in 2009 and (thank GOD re-hired) so I know the truly rough times. There are times when I get aggravated with situations at work but if I have found if I just stick it out , things tend to get straightened out one way or another."

good,They have division activities to get everyone together. The work home balance is really accommodating. Team building activities between departments and division
good,"One of the best companies I have worked with. Like all companies it has its downsides, but none that undermined my loyalty to the company.  I would not have left were it not for the housing downturn and the predatory defect litigators that swarmed the industry to profit off of the downturn."
