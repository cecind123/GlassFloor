rating,review
bad,"Terrible management and candidate care. Operations does not care about employees, or clients. There is no work life balance. High stressful, and very emotional. Training was not good had to learn as you go"
bad,"5e année et toujours le même salaire. Zéro avancement, zéro perspective de carrière."
bad,Discrimination the first day of the interview my boss did not like me because I wasn’t Hispanic and spoke no Spanish I was hired down in south Florida worst interview experience ever.
bad,Will not recommend to work here Increament is very less 1% sometimes. No projects in Mumbai and have very bad  project allocation process. RCM are very rude.
bad,"Manager was not open to opinion, spoke in rapid fire manner and became angry if you asked her to slow down or asked questions. Easily angered and stressed. Hours were unpredictable and often 12 hour days. Insufficient training and guidance provided."
bad,IBM is all about the Utilization rate but the projects aren't set up in a way for you to hit that goal without working ridiculous hours. Then their is a severe disproportion of pay.
bad,project i work for is just horrible. Lots of politics with no proper hikes whatsoever. No proper work from home options though IBM is known for it....
bad,"This is a company that does not value employees.  It cares about earning money and uses tactics such as allowing remote work, then taking it away and forcing candidates to relocate to keep their jobs."
bad,"IBM has lost it's way under very poor leadership.  Sales are way down, layoffs happen constantly. Technology is old and falling way behind.  Terrible environment."
bad,Did not like the staff hr tl manager work culture at IBM INDIA. Did not give Senior Level no proper free tea coffee milk facilities at the pantry. Worst shift timings.
bad,IBM is a company people work there. Employees get paid in terms of salary and wages. There is less onsite in ibm india compared to othercompanies. The end.
bad,"back staving culture from upper management."
bad,Before you work in IBM Dallas make sure you have someone to recommend you  from the top management  otherwise you gonna feel the rot of the cartel men. All the care about is to get you in trouble. Never give you pay raise and if you complain watch  out for setup.
bad,pesimo prefiero no comentar al respecto ya que no me gusto el trabajo
bad,"- was not paid on time"
bad,"You are just a number waiting to get laid off."
bad,Excellent company to  work and very good learning environment and I had best working experience. Senior and colleague are excellent to work with. Lot of flexibility to explore new innovations in day to day work.
bad,It was a terrible mistake on the manager part to hire me. I made the mistake but not quitting sooner. I didn't fit into the culture there. The Manager kept me there anyway. He wasn't working in my favor but his own.
bad,"They hire you for 45 hours a week, pay you for 45 hours a week, then they tell you about ""utliization"" where you must meet goals of 60+ hour work weeks."
bad,"Terrible company"
bad,"Toxic work culture, managers dont have human values"
bad,"Poor management and leadership here.   After the IBM aquisition, employees hoped that things would change, however, IBM allowed the same behavior to be continued."
bad,"Laying off everyone at age of 55. Regardless how smart, talented, intelligent and skilled you are."
bad,No se preocupan por nadie solo por ellos como empresa kelly Services e IBM
bad,"no es un ambiente serio y profesional de trabajo, donde lo que premia no es tu esfuerzo, sino si te lo llevas bien o menos con los colegas, en concreto los que cuentan con un amiguismo especial con los jefes. La clase de gente que hay ahi es de todo menos sana."
bad,"Es una empresa que laboralmente no te apoya como empleado en el área de producción, así mismo es muy exigente con el personal y no valora lo que tú haces por ellos, soy muy egoístas y tienen demasiados jefes innecesarios."
bad,"What makes for a great day at work? "
bad,"Poor management, too many processes and policies which makes tasks and projects inefficient and non profitable. HR unhelpful, extremely demanding working conditions. No salary increases, no company year end functions or team building."
bad,"The back Manger there treated you like a white Person"
bad,"You will never get any where with the amount they pay you, neither you will advance in your career. the management treat you as a tool to fulfill the client deadline."
bad,Management has their favorites.   Rating system is bogus and means nothing in terms of how your clients think you’re doing.  It’s kills morale; employees do the work of three for the same pay.
bad,IBM is something to be avoided. There is no job security. Too much red tape is enough to suffocate event the least creative of minds. There is little career progression and is therefore best avoided.
bad,It seems like a great company with good benefits and generous paid time off for paternity and maternity leave but the only people who are in higher positions are people who socialize to get their. The managers are incompetent. They pay people who are terrible and lazy way too much money and pay barely anything to people who work hard. They also have low cost centers where the people are worked to death and not compensated enough. Career advancement is not possible unless you know someone and they like to offer work remote options but as soon as you’re transferred to a new manager (it happens way too often) they revoke those privileges. You’re just another number at this company and not valued at all.
bad,"IBM leadership is toxic. Pure evil. ruled by the financial quarter. Treats  employees like garbage."
bad,Cut throat mob style work place.   No support.   High turn over and burn out.   Survival island runs on intimidation.    Customer is always last and profits are first.  Most unethical tech company.
bad,"There is no career path offered for senior positions. When Leaders at SVP level asked about career path, the answer is ""remind me in 6 months"". "
bad,"If you are good at something then forget about doing or pursuing it here. This is where dreams end. The management is very poor lots of politics around this place. No value for you or your aspirations."
bad,"Management is overstaffed, micromanages terribly. Only recourse for employee is through your management team which means if they are the problem you have no one to talk to or address issues with. Managers with zero experience in a department are regularly offered the job over someone with tremendous experience. Longer your in the company the harder it is to be promoted and receive raises. Constantly adding to job duties with no corresponding salary increases for often doing multiple job positions."
bad,"When they swallowed up the company I woried for originally, they promised us we would be kept on, cared for, and would have all these great opportunities. Nothing could have been further from the truth. As soon as they absorbed our product, we were all laid off without warning."
bad,There is no real strategic direction. Executive Leaders are slow to make decisions or do not ever make them.  Integrations of acquired companies is nonexistent. They treat employees as assets instead of people- even giving them a serial number versus an employee number. No analysis of impacts of decisions. Way too many financial groups asking for the same data in many many different ways and giving different directions.  Silos and competing groups. No customer focus.  Only how to provide the most minimum service for as cheap as possible.
bad,Constant resource reductions create a difficult work environment. Not enough resource to meet customer expectations. High performing employees laid off on a regular basis.
bad,"In simple words, never join this company. It will ruin your career. Worst salary worst workplace worst Management, no clear direction to your career.."
bad,"Es una empresa mal organizada por la agnecia , tiene favorlitismo por parte del gerente , malos sueldos , mala comida , existen muchismas cosas que hacen que se desprestigie el nombre de IBM a causa de la agencia ."
bad,"Was a nightmare, no respect for their employees, no care for employee well being. Treated everyone like they were replaceable in an instant, relied too much on quotas, made employees feel like they didnt belong."
bad,My experience when working at IBM was horrible. HR and management have no morals. They treat there employees like a number. Stay clear of this company.
bad,IBM was by far the worst place I worked.  It was a sweath shop.  You regularly worked long hours and unrealistic on-call requirements.  They regularly worked to ship most of their jobs offshore.
bad,"I've never, in my professional career, seen a more toxic, and dysfunctional work environment. Management is completely politically run; truth and ethics in day to day work is completely optional."
bad,IBM is a PR machine.  They sound good on TV but will work your tail off and pay you little. Managers get all the money while you bust your but  get 0.
bad,"When your staff fears management that just seems to be on a power trip, they don’t want to remain employed with your company. If management instills fear into your employees, it creates tension and unneeded stress that can negatively affect an employee’s performance. "
bad,"They require unpaid on-call hours, unannounced furlough for 5 weeks, no benefits at all.  No chance for hiring, in fact they IBM keeps the company from hiring you."
bad,"I do not recommend working for IBM."
bad,"Muy mala gestiòn de los recursos asignados a clientes y desprolijos con la asignaciòn de tareas."
bad,"No good management, no proper maintanance, not well mannered people, worst salary status too much preassure, no proper facilities overall bad experience, not suitable"
bad,"Employees are elastic, disposable assets that will be ""right sized"" quarterly by management in order to reduce the impact of negative top-line revenue growth by temporarily reducing workforce expenses. Essentially, you will be asked to take several weeks a year off as furlough in order for management to maintain the appearance of positive growth to the stockholders."
bad,"A typical work day would be reviewing previous shift logs,email, meetings with operation team, management, support staff and clients. "
bad,"Empresa mezquina, argollera, elitista, con imposibilidad para progresar"
bad,"I was a professional hire into IBM after successfully working. The company is no longer what it was when I hired on - poor executive and middle management, no leadership, etc. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Manage service calls for trouble electronics. Priorities calls and create a route for success. Resolve hardware, software, network related issue. Repair pc, printers, point of sale, phones, servers, switches, satellite, alarms, installs, relocations, de-installs, upgrades, and projects. Just a man in a van doing what we can."
bad,was let go via email and was never spoken to. When my parents passed 10 days apart in February I got no bereavement days anf had to use vacation days to bury them.
bad,"I was hired to learn the ropes, finish out the contract and get let go without warning. I wasn't told that, though.So I had to scramble for my next job. I had no opportunity to look for work or put in resumes. I was offered another contract that was not at all the same rate of pay or the same hours, and no one was willing to work with me. I was told that I either signed the contract or there was the door. I had no idea that meant that they weren't going to find me another contract. So I had to start looking on my own. I finally found something after a month or so."
bad,"No preferences are taken by any fresher when they join, with regards to the technology they wish to learn, or the project they wish to work on, or the city they wish to relocate to. Shifts are all over the place, which leads to health issues for a lot of people. As a fresher, you are at the mercy of whatever your managers tell you, you don't have a say."
bad,"No work life balance ,No growth , No good work cluture, No facility in changing project . Not carrer growth. Performance bonus is not transparent. Carrer is not moving ahead"
bad,"Management where I worked did not value any employees, had awful pay for an ""IT"" job, and was understaffed so workload was meant for two people with one person doing it."
bad,"Não reconhecem quem dá o sangue, valorizam mais os terceiros que ganham o dobro e ainda vc tem que ensinar,depois te demitem e põe o cara no seu lugar."
bad,Work Culture is very bad and employees being treated in rough manner pay scales are very poor too over all very bad place to consider for even option.
bad,"The management at IBM is terrible. They don't know how to treat their employees and they don't know how to run a business. Their goal is to make their entire business only India based. Due to this they don't seem to care about their US employees. They also offer no benefits, health or otherwise, and no time off."
bad,"on a typical day we were required to maintain systems , sometimes systems just go down weather it be hardware etc. there is nothing that can be done to prevent this its a part of life. Any sysadmin know this and a good one will quickly fix the issue to be back up with minimal impact .But IBM straight out says that we have to spin it to be the customers fault or we will no longer be employed . This is a daily thing."
bad,"Not recommended . the worst company ever to work for. "
bad,"I lost my respect in IBM approximately 8 to 10 years ago. Every year around March or April there would be layoff (IBM's word was ""Resource Action""). About two years years ago IBM layoff a large portion of their technicians across the U.S.. Many technicians lost there jobs and fell into financial hardship while the CEO and management under her received bonuses in the millions because they saved the company money."
bad,"After 17 yrs of working for Wilshire Credit Corp, Merrill Lynch, Bank of American those were GREAT Company. Then IBM Mortgage/Seterus came along and that is when the company took a turn for the worse. They started laying off people and raises was a thing of the past. So I decided to leave the dysfuntional company behind me."
bad,"Empresa de nome mundial que no sitio de Porto Alegre está mal gerenciada, sem comprometimento com o humano, salário não é compatível com o quanto se trabalha e não pagam hora extra em determinados setores. Sem chance de promoção, a não ser se for bem relacionado, gerentes despreparados para atender capital humanos e auxilio pessoal de RH e está totalmente em desencontro com a cultura promovida nos outros sítios do país bem como nas outras sedes mundiais."
bad,"I worked from agent."
bad,"Paid worse than the cleaning crew. Took 7 weeks to gain security clearance to work in server vault, constantly required to train in many certification courses; no benefits; required to work 12 hours Thanksgiving and 12 on Christmas but only paid 8 hours of Holiday pay for each; no raises ever; and, the guy emptying the trash was paid 33% more than our team members."
bad,"Narrow minded, limited training, no team building. The hardest part of the job is tolerating the conflicting personalities, to many people just out for themselves."
bad,Bad experience; No loyalty to employees. Avoid like the plague.  Do not work at IBM unless you have to.  There are better places to work that value your contributions.
bad,Worst company to work for ever. Lousy management. Lousy corporate culture. Lousy internal processes and burdensome bureaucracy. Lousy onboarding/training program. Lousy corporate tools. Can't say enough bad things about this company.
bad,"I was micro-managed.  Very long working hours expected.  "
bad,"IBM is not a place to work, they steal my projects and I never receive an explanation about it. Good ideas won't help you to progress in there, will destroy the join to create new ideas."
bad,"I did rack prep all night, every night, was bullied for not being a full member of staff, and learned absolutely nothing about the IT Field from this job. It was a simple, brain dead job that internal employees give to their High School aged kids to keep them doing something during the summer. I was scrutinized far further for this dead end position than any others I have had in the past."
bad,"When IBM purchased the company I worked for, the first thinkg they did is to remove free coffee/soda pop. They told us from the day 1 - done like it- leave. Very little respect for people. Keep in mind, if you work directly for IBM in IBM's buildings- things are very different."
bad,"Would not recommend IBM"
bad,"Although I worked for a long time, the managers were not at all good and never appreciated hard work.very mean minded persons, egostics, needs to hire managers who have at least a MBA degree."
bad,Culture is horribly - if you are a US citizen.  They do not care on iota about people - only $$$$$$$$$.  You only exist to be replaced by someone cheaper as soon as they can.... regardless of your abilities or accomplishments.
bad,I have only worked for one other company as terrible as IBM and they are of course another multinational conglomerate that does an awful job of keeping employees happy.  Prepare to spend your time using ancient ineffective tools and talking to managers that do not understand the basics of IT.  Don't forget to keep your PM updated on everything that you do and be sure to explain what you are doing because I guarantee he/she has no IT knowledge at all.
bad,"They have a strategy that is based on bus words and not facts, the strategic direction is not supported and critical resources are not respected or retained.  People are just a bottom line number to this company."
bad,when I was there I trained a lot of people and some become lead and supervisor and I got layoff. the manager at the time don't really care but after they lay me off a year later that department end up sending to Mixco
bad,"Client was Brighthouse Financial.  Manager located in New Jersey and made decisions from a distance.  Disorganized, disrespectful work climate. Would not recommend."
bad,"Terrible management, no room for advancement, lousy pay and too much work. The company has posted billions in losses over the past few years, but executives get paid millions either way. The lower employees on the totem pole get scraps."
bad,"Beefy very bad place to work."
bad,"IBM does not value its employees, or its customers.  Massive layoffs are frequent which impacts the ability to provide customers with the support that is needed to do the job correctly."
bad,"Don't miss the company one bit. Retirement package of about half of social security. "
bad,"Terrible place to work. No increases for years. Literally a bubblegum company, they use you till you can not give no more and then get someone else. Salaries way below market related, they get foreigners from Europe to work for half of an European unemployment benefit luring you under false pretences of ""watching elephants in your free time"".  Poor management and top performers are rewarded with ""a day of""  If you want to eat noodles every day, please do apply to work here."
bad,Executive management team is only focused on return for themselves. No clear strategy. Always behind in technology. Employees always wondering if they will be next to get laid off
bad,"Terrible management, horrible pay, no benefits. Stay away. They extract as much from you as they can without ever appreciating it. The worst company I ever worked for - that is saying a lot."
bad,Average doesn't support work life BALANCE . Join if you'd like to be core technical else the growth opportunities are very less. Bit company provides many learning opportunities.
bad,"Apparently, if they can make something simple complicated and exceedingly difficult, they do"
bad,"This is not the IBM it used to be. Management is very poor and makes decisions and enacts policies that have no logic or common sense behind them. They do not hire when people leave and just expects everyone else to not see their families and pick up the slack. The management here at IBM really does not care about their employees one bit. No raises and they pay less than what the entry level for my career is. The buildings are old from 1970's IBM and not at all modern like other companies around Columbus. The buildings are really disgusting to be honest, you would never think it's IBM, but sadly it is."
bad,"making collections calls to delinquent borrowers, have collections  goals to meet, and if not met, you would be terminated after only a few weeks , they offer a bonus if you made goal"
bad,"IBM is imploding inside, its a matter of time before its broken up and sold off in pieces, major leadership problems, morale at its all time low. Focus is on cost cutting and exec spec about strategic imperatives such as AI and Cloud; however, IBM is getting killed in those areas and has no change with the focus on cost cutting"
bad,The area of IBM where I worked was very stressful.  It is very difficult to get ahead there.  Very poor communication adds to the stress level.  Last minute expectations are common.and sudden furloughs make it difficult to make targets.
bad,Culture could use major improvement. Focus is on bottom line and not on employee wellbeing or engagement. Poor communication between levels of the organization and management leads to a lot of confusion and overlap in work.
bad,Overall working at the GBS/IBM was a complete waste of time as there was no real work culture that promoted development of one's skills. There was no team work and collaboration.
bad,"A typical day at work would find yourself being constantly micro managed. "
bad,"The work I performed at IBM was valuable to the company, in that my position helped servers stay secure, but it didn't seem that this was a high priority to the company its self.  I didn't like the work because it was monotonous, and had too many exceptions to the rules.  There was minimal consistency.  My manager (first time manager) was pushy, uninformed, and rude.  This manager was let go from IBM within months of me leaving.  Management was not his thing."
bad,"IBM doesn't care about their employees at all.  It's all about their bottom line and the as soon as they need to improve it they start laying off employees.  They lay off thousands of employees every year while the CEO and VPs continue to receive raises and bonuses."
bad,Poor Management and no opportunity -- absolutely no loyalty to the employee and the focus has always been to find the cheapest labor source based offshore.
bad,"Being a large organization,career growth in Service domain (IBM GBL) is very minimal. That even affects the monetary growth . Hence overall a dissatisfied experience."
bad,Part of group that were reassigned to IBM when Sprint outsourced project management to IBM.  Stayed wilt IBM for 16 months until Sprint brought project management back in house.
bad,"New Leadership brought in former colleagues and ignored the talent they had in house."
bad,It is a very negative place the people are all serious and rude and do not except new people.The management is not human they seem to not care at all about there employees.
bad,Working for IBM was not a good experience for me. Very poor management. People were allowed to do things at work that they should of been fired for. I would not recommend this company to anyone to work for.
bad,"If you want to be overworked. Under appreciated. Under paid. And sitting on the edge of your seat waiting until IBM decides to replace your team with a overseas team. Then this just might be the place for you. "
bad,"High expectations, high workload, ongoing online training, lack of support from management, too many meetings, low salary,  too much rework and poor management."
bad,I feel very under valued as an employee and a person at IBM. Due to the fact I am a contract employee (when hired told I would have opportunity to become IBM regular employee with benefits but because the account I mainly work on am restricted from becoming an IBM regular employee because of hiring freeze. )
bad,"Having only worked for the company for 8 months due to them relocating our roles offshore and making us redundant, after being TUPE'd into the company from my previous company, I am unable to provide a positive review."
bad,"Good one but this one is managers company , if the manager is not capable of handling few things then will not be going in right way, better to have process defined company"
bad,"At IBM, I was judged on office politics and immovable metrics some manager who didn't have any idea what the job they were measuring entailed and not simply by the immense work I was getting done. They also grade on a bell curve and are unable to reward employees that are all performing well. IBM is a soul-crushing place to work."
bad,"The pay is not competitive with other oil & gas companies, most especially since they only do the primary accounting for Marathon Oil company.  Sad really that they think of the executives before the employees who actually do the work to give them the high salaries and bonus' they give themselves."
bad,"poor pay, high cost of benefits and low bonuses if at all.  Poor management.  Started with unlimited sick days..flex time..all is slowing being taken away."
bad,"the only enjoyable thing about IBM is that I am not there anymore. the managers were uncaring, the work was unfulfilling, and the pay was substandard to say the least."
bad,Was a very stressful environment. Had to work in shifts that were unorthodox (2am-4am + 8am-5pm on the same day). Wasn't paid fairly (Was paid extra wages for the first shift and not the third shift). Hurt the health and social life. Had insomnia and anxiety during the whole time there.
bad,"Missing financials and market expectations for last 5+ years, with no sign of any change. "
bad,"If you are ever thinking about having a Career at IBM think again.  They are sell outs, they sold the company to Global Foundries and no longer exist so you can't work there even if you wanted to."
bad,"I am in the external consulting practice. The company as a whole does not care about employees. They only care about profit. While there are many opportunities at IBM, if they want you to stay in a specific project, you can never take advantage of the other opportunities you were aiming for to expand your skillset. Everything I was told during the interview process was not true. What recruting says to sell you on the firm isn't how everything actually works. There is no alignment between Recruiting and leadership."
bad,"Too much work, too little employees, no interest from management in anything but their own pockets, no chance for advancement, on contract for 4+ years, no job security, no benefits, no perks, Forced to work OT without getting paid, hours are sometimes rediculous, 24/7 on call is rediculous and little to no personel training."
bad,"Management is absolutely pathetic, I don't know what are the interview parameters on which the candidates are selected, the interview process is also long drawn. Once u are inside the company its like a jail no hikes no bonus and the threat of job loss every second day. "
bad,"Lots of project managers that had their PMP certification but zero experience, right of the boat from India.  Caucasians were in the minority by 5 in 100.  Teams were cliquey where my opinion did not count and was very fast taken over by one of the others in the team.  Lots of discussions in Hindi, or very poor English that I could barely or not understand. "
bad,"Each team was/is always out to throw one another under the bus, Cutthroat environment. Constantly undermining one another in front of management under the guise of ""oops did I say that""? Or ""just joking""... avoiding one another all together. Ignoring anyone that wants to address an issue..""Silent treatment"" for weeks at time. At least it was quiet..."
bad,"The job description that was given to me before I took the contract was incorrect.  Even though I was capable of doing the job I was hired for, I was not satisfied with it."
bad,"The Recruiting organization is horrifically ineffectual, management chokes creativity with dictator like precision.  Process improvement suggestions are seen as an attack on leadership."
bad,"No benefits, low pay. No career advancement. Upon entering the company I was enticed with the allure of unlimited growth potential. Once I was hired it was discovered that this was not the case. I had hit my growth potential on day 2. Sprinkle in no benefits, poor management and  inequality of pay and you have the formula for IBM."
bad,"IBM is a company that incentivises its senior management by the promise of substantial bonuses for meeting targets. Senior management usually achieve these targets by pushing staff to work long hours under high amounts of stress. The overall feeling is that management are happy to push people until they crack, and when they do make them redundant and replace them with cheaper off-shore resource who don't know how to do the job."
bad,I work Specifically for Lenovo contracted with CGS and they are horrible. Worst job I'VE ever had. they expect you to sit at your desk with 2 15 min breaks and one 30 min lunch.you cant' use pto if you work overtime for the week.They give you pto but its very hard and a hassle to get it approved to be off. The management is sorry they are the worst. They think they are better than you and you are the ones that make up the company. Who would take the calls if every body walked out..
bad,IBM has forgotten what made is successful.  The company has out sourced every one and you can't find any one to help with difficult problems.  They expect you to work 10 hours a day and only get paid for 8 hours.
bad,"Shoveled coal"
bad,Destroying the legacy business while floundering on new initiatives. Lack of focus and direction.  There is a new strategic plan every year making it impossible to do any tactical planning.
bad,"nothing - everything is spiders with this company"
bad,"Employees are treated as resources not human beans with families, there was not work balance and I had a temporally contract with very low salary rate, definitely not good for the market."
bad,"A typical day at work was fine"
bad,"Managers and teammates in leadership roles spread rumors about other teammates."
bad,"extremely poor management with no people skills - a lot of favoritism going on..if you know the right people especially when you know nothing ( not the sharpest tool in the shed) - your job is secure and you will be promoted.  "
bad,"Pomeroy is a very just get on with it sort of company"
bad,Entry level support position. Fast paced at times. Gets very slow during the holidays. Good entry level support position for people looking to gain experience.
bad,"This company has had a ""TOXIC"" environment to work in for the last 10 years.  It is NOT the company it once was and I don't believe it ever will achieve greatness again.  It's very behind in all current cloud architecture and especially, implementation.  I would not recommend this company to work for OR, invest in to anyone!"
bad,I personally had a bad experience so I could not in all honesty give a positive light to the company based on my own experience. The manager was not the welcoming kind judged me before even knowing me.
bad,They set their consultants up to fail.  Sending them out to client sites where account managers oversell products and services that the project teams can't possibly deliver as they were promised.  Horrible leadership!
bad,IBM continues to find ways to get more money for the stakeholders regardless of the impact to employees. Decisions made a corporate level with no input from lower management.
bad,"absence total de considération humaine dans le cadre de la gestion des ressources humaine"
bad,ibm was the worst job I had in a long time. it was very unprofessional and unorganized as an organization. the management team were not adequate leaders to drive team members to perform.
bad,Lay offs have been numerous times a year. Shameful policy changes four weeks of severance no matter how long you have worked at IBM when prior year you received up to two weeks per year of employment. No clear advancement. Poor wages. Poor management. Placing employees on Performance Improvement Plans with no documented performance issues. No morale. Extremely difficult to do job when resources on teams needed to complete your role are laid off.
bad,"Never again.  Place is ungood.  Outsourced, uncaring ""employees"", and I use  the term loosely, don't know how to think outside of the box.  Management is solely to blame here.   They only care about the bottom line."
bad,They don't treat workers well.  They do paycuts and layoffs regularly and then hire back and repeat/rinse.  This does not inspire confidence in their leadership.
bad,"This is not the IBM you may remember from the last century. Their only imperative now is to pay the least salary they can for people who are minimally qualified for any job positions they have. Off shoring jobs is also a primary focus for IBM. Layoffs occur regularly. Client satisfaction is not a priority. If you work as a contractor for IBM, in addition to not being allowed to work full time, work furloughs are a way of life. A job at IBM is not one you can plan your life around without a lot of stress."
bad,"Philips is a great place and culture to work for. As a group, we work very well together and with a family atmosphere. Very flexible schedule and no micro management style."
bad,Nice place to work. Good benefits. Nice people. Good advancement opportunities. Constant on the job and off the job training provided. Good management.
bad,"lay off , was temporary after acquisition"
bad,IBM work day was stress free. We worked hard as a team. I learned how to manage loans& close them quickly. The most enjoyable part  was paid for trips.
bad,"This company has no future it seems.  Culture is toxic, everyone afraid for their jobs, meanwhile the C-levels pretend the sky is not falling and put a spin on legacy IT without producing any new innovative solutions that the industry values."
bad,"Not a great place to work with, Poor management, bad work culture, no hike for ever, It is a sinking ship. Even if you join dont try working more than 2 yrs"
bad,Slecht management; geen enkele empathie; alleen geïnteresseerd in besparingen; dolgedraaid hoger management.
bad,todo excelente. Buen sueldo. Buen ambiente. Muchos beneficios
bad,I live in New York and had to travel to Vermont to work at the facility.  This added an hour and a half commute to my 12 hour shift.  This was not very productive for home life.
bad,Leadership has no clue what to do next. keeps clients guessing and their employees by restructuring the org every quarter.There is no single IBM for the customer. 10 different units land up for the same deal.
bad,"My work has been sabotaged and I have been mocked and harassed on a daily basis in order to make me quit my job. The complaint I filed with  human resources has been swept under the rug. I have all the evidence to prove my claim but HR will do nothing but protect the company which is ridiculous since all IBM talks about is how ethical, transparent and honest they are as a company. Those are supposed to be their ""core values""."
bad,"Empresa, nao paga bem, nao possui uma estabilidade, com baixos indices de promoção, e um culto empresarial pouco dissimilado"
bad,"Unfortunately IBM no longer cares for its employees. IBM is looking to offshore wherever possible. Instead of cutting the layers of management, it is cutting the dedicated workforce. Instead of trying to come up with new ideas to become more profitable, they see layoffs as their basic alternative.  I do not recommend working for this company"
bad,"Good benefits, low pay, no opportunity for a advancement, no raises given, bonus is embarrassingly low, opportunities given based on who you are buddies with and nothing more. The environment has become very toxic in 2016 and early 2017 and I sleep better knowing I no longer deal with it. Call center mentality and pressure had infiltrated my previous department leading to long time employees being passed and all but ignored for young kids with no experience fresh off the phones. All about who you know!"
bad,IBM doesn't care about people. They will layoff workers that have been SME's for 5 years to hire someone who has never worked on the product and then expect you to train that person.
bad,"I like to stay positive most of the time, but it is difficult when trying to describe my time at the Application Delivery Center for IBM."
bad,"You are treated as a resource, not a person."
bad,"trabaje con una subcontrata , es la peor empresa en la que he trabajado"
bad,"I was worked in IBM through Alchemy Techsol. Alchemy Techsol is not good one as it does not provides 1st month salary, less package, no increments after 1.5 years as well, no bonus, no extra payments for the work done on weekends or extra hours, no proper response if something happens about salary or other issues, not employee friendly nature, no last month salary, no pf amount, adds only one pf but gives by deducting some percentage. If a person is on bench they won't give salary and won't show any other project. Simply says to leave the company. Not provides good payslips as well. Salary structure is not followed by them. They just provides alternative salary for example says 13500₹ as take home but gives only 11000₹ based on their mood at the time of salary pay out."
bad,IBM is horrible to work for they continually reduce benefits and expect more from their employees. Complete disorganization with little thought put into making operations more efficient.
bad,"I gave IBM 7 years of service and then did contract work for them. Well, today I walked in and received an email from my boss asking me to call her. I was advised my position has been outsourced and this would be my last day. No notice, nothing."
bad,"no te dan posibilidad de crecimiento personal. ambiente envidioso y muy competitivo. tenes que tener un padrino para que te tomen en cuenta"
bad,"I worked for the Company for 5 years with only one raise, bad benefits, and horrible management. I would stay clear of IBM and Pomeroy both are horrible company's to work for and the benefits are not worth the trouble. Pay is far below average with no room for advancements within the company both as an entry level employee or as a manager looking to move up past site supervisor."
bad,Was not happy working at IBM. I prefer to work for a smaller company. There was no work life balance and the management team was only concerned with advancing their careers.
bad,"As a contract employee, I received no benefits and no rate increases in over 12 years.I was forced to take a pay cut of approximately 12%. I also had no opportunities for career growth."
bad,You can learn a great deal but the politics and lack of a team environment are very frustrating.  All the things that are bad about a corporation are here.
bad,"dont join this company because they dont treat you like an employee "
bad,need to focus on the customers and less on IBM VPs marketing themselves internally. Company would do well to their immature executive staff that their customer comes first and marketing their own careers 2nd.
bad,"Old dying dinosaur trying to stay relevant ."
bad,"Management not good at all, specially with who I worked that's why the 1 star rating otherwise IBM is great when it comes to job security."
bad,"Least Payer. No growth at all. Even the best performers are never recognized nor given appropriate growth. No onsite opportunities."
bad,"There is no security of your job...  They can kick out as they get better candidate than ours and they do not manage their team members,  shifts and job timings..."
bad,No job security at all. All jobs tends to be transferred off shores. Management is not organized and lots of confusion in the work place.  Salaries are very low.
bad,"good promotion avenues, flexible work arrangement, good management support, nice training area. I would welcome the chance to return to this company"
bad,I set up job interviews for the Supply Chain Management team. I would occasionally go to job fairs and set up interviews. The job was not something I would strive  or thrived in.
bad,There's nothing fun about working in a place where layoffs are continuous. None of the morale-boosting efforts mean a thing.
bad,"People are marginilalized for the smallest project level gainels. Constant outsourcing and next to no benefits. No transparency and instead of letting people know what kinds of changes are comjng, management stonewalls until people lose their jobs."
bad,"There is no job security."
bad,The management was very unprofessional. Lots of co-workers all around you and sometimes they could be real rude. Not enough quite space to listen to your customer
bad,had various job from maintaining equipment to Technical engineering support.  Debug test programs and various test equipment.  Order parts and design test fixtures.
bad,"Depressing work environment with no JOB security. CEO is running the company into the ground.  No benefits.  You pay your own,  Poor 401 K matching.  No real health care,"
bad,"It is a Good Company to work with great manner,and highly motivating leaderships ,and always giving opportunity to build career . i have completed one and half year with IBM"
bad,"no respect for employees"
bad,"This company is pretty bad not going to lie. "
bad,"Good culture, good team work, good environment, close cooperation with clients. Agile delivery mode. Learned a lot on project management and team work for different projects."
bad,Not as expected as a Brand company. Some projects have good work culture.. but some has worst. no work life balance. GTS is worst.
bad,"IBM has always been on my bucket list of places to work but after 1 year,  there was nothing I could learn from them, horrible management, work ethics, philosophy .........  poor compensation and benefits,   Nothing good to say about IBM."
bad,"Did not receive a lot of support from management staff, overall not an enjoyable place to work, people are not friendly, culture is boring serious and talent is low."
bad,Nothing new to say excepting that I may have structured my CV incorrectly so that this application is not able to discriminate between the various headings correctly.
bad,"Work day is surrounded by fear of being let go on any given day. No matter how well you do your job, it does not matter. All the execs are after is driving the stock price up so they can line there pockets with more money."
bad,"Terrible company to work for -- low pay, no job security, poor treatment of employees. Was once a great company with an excellent reputation for job security and fostered employee/employer loyalty, but not anymore."
bad,"Poor work life balance. I worked weekends, and 12 hour days. I had peers get divorced due to not being at home. IBM allows its workers to pay for health benefits of 15,000 per year. The cost would go up 2000 per year and IBM would maybe give a ""pay raise"" of 1000. The reason I departed was I keep getting a pay depression. I lost money to stay there. There is no job security. IBM keep shipping work to India and Brazil. My group was next. "
bad,"No loyalty to employees , moved many jobs oversea's and upper management is all people 35 years plus under their belts m and are not willing to change process to be up to date with today's employee!"
bad,"IBM has lost its culture, they are recruiting people from T3 companies and its driven by bunch of people in Kolkatta who are using their power to influence their own people. There is no job security now."
bad,My Review is Works Culture is very good and We get some time to learn new technology by Taking some Tech TalksOverall Good Atmosphere for working in IBM
bad,"work day -12 hour shifts rotation between 3 & 4 workdays"
bad,"No job security"
bad,"The environment has over the years.  The Company is down sizing its Consulting division each year and outsourcing to it's non US divisions within Global Business Services.  There is not much of a future  in the US GBS division.  No matter how you perform, you are looking over your shoulder at the end of each quarter. Hopefully, this will change.  The people I have worked with there are truly amazing."
bad,Currently perform Lead Quality Assurance duties for Century Link communications. Also performed Development and Analysis.
bad,"Even if you are desperate for a job, I highly advise against working here; it is by far the worst job I have ever had and I spent a summer cleaning septic systems.  Senior management doesn't care about you as a person at all (you are simply a resource to be used until depleted and then promptly discarded), the pay is ridiculously low for the work you do, and did I mention you will most likely be on contract; you can forget having any sense of job security."
bad,that is all. IBM just takes contract jobs from other companies and runs them into the ground. this company is terrible to work for.
bad,"Heavy at the top outsources most of the work , admins even have us e-mails lies your data is not secure Oursourcing everything to India which promotes slavery they are treated very bad and are scared they do not have the experience"
bad,"I will resist saying anything positive about this IBM Cloud. Because, there isn't any! Always over work their employees. I can rant forever."
bad,"IBM looks fantastic on one's resume; however, it is not worth the difficultly to get the company on one's resume. IBM tends to pay approximately half of the going rate for employee saleries, they demand that employees be available to work 24/7, management is completely unresponsive and unconcerned about managing, the training is lackluster and not useful outside of IBM. Over all the company is falling apart at the seams and has been laying off employees world wide every year for the last several years. There is absolutely no job security."
bad,"IBM is just a service company and now handing over all it's Enterprise account to Apple. A very dumb management team."
bad,Work hard and don't expect any rewards or loyalty.  All US jobs are moving off shore and haven't increased revenue in the last 15 quarters
bad,"Join IBM only when you want to retire happily without work, have enough time to pass, gossip and enjoy salary without working. For this, while joining IBM, as for 50-70% hike and you will get it if you have good connections in IBM. Join on Band 9 or above because employee below Band 8 are unsecured, laid-off suddenly and does not have any power to control or manage own job. People having Band 9 and above are all go hand-in-hand to protect ourselves, keep safe to each other, easily move on safe positions and enjoy job with all employment benefits, intensives and get salaries smoothly till retirement while working from home."
bad,"* Difficult to get promoted"
bad,"Transparency"
bad,This is a manager driver company. The grievances are not really probed in right manner. Managers is the ultimate decision even tough the employee is hard working and innocent.Not a employee friendly company.
bad,The best thing was dealing with the client doing my best to provide an excelent and high quality of service.
bad,"IBM could be a great company."
bad,There is no fun at work. It is all about SLAs and huddle calls. No career advancement. Only contractors are preferred over employees.
bad,Very large company.  Hard to get recognized in.  Feels like a large aquarium and most people are guppies.  Good Technology and training.
bad,"Never work here, they just use you, you never get raises only pay cuts. "
bad,"Compensation was fantastic, and working hours were short."
bad,"IBM is not the company they once were. You will be expected to work 60-80 hours a week, but they will only pay you for 40. They expect you to ""Flex"" the time over 40, but still get your work done."
bad,"This job introduced me to the world of computers using programs such as internet, excel, and word. Those days I didn't understand why the computer was so popular and didn't know how the programs/systems helped individuals at home, in other words had to ask a lot of question to see if I wanted things services like internet."
bad,Unethical Organization. Employee Doesn't exist. They might say they have several policy to safe guard the employee rights and integrity but ground reality it is manager centric org. even case management people will not reason to you. Outside world is far better than this IBM smarter planet.
bad,"It was good while I was finishing my graduate studies. I had a chance to interact with other scientist, my boss was very supportive, and I wrote my thesis,  towards my Masters Degree."
bad,"Very stressful, way too many projects to do any of them well, long hours like 65+, mediocre pay, no job security, no advancement, no bonuses to speak of, no salary adjustments with for COL, or to reflect hours worked."
bad,I could go deeper but really...its just beyond depressing. There was so much potential here. And it is failing miserably. We had five people quit this week alone.
bad,"Divestiture of divisions and products with a rotational management team to avoid ownership of issues.  "
bad,"IBM needs better management skills, and it needs to appreciated it skilled employee more, management needs better people and soft skills."
bad,"Not a good place to work. You are a number, compared with every other number at your band level. Your manager will be useless and friends with the right people, so untouchable. Work/Life balance doesn't exist, despite the five million emails they send daily telling you something to the contrary. Half of your time will be spent working with cantankerous, miserable managers and the rest will be spent doing ridiculous IBM admin requirements."
bad,"- Focus on EPS growth took away from moving/reacting to market"
bad,"Demanding and expecting everything with no gratitude or cost of living increases for over 9 years of employment. No lunch or breaks and guaranteed to work 8-10 hours a day with no OT. Any OT has to be pre-authorized well in advance. If you have a family and are a dedicated parent, you do not want to be working for this company."
bad,Management at the IBM Dubuque site was a cliche. If you asked questions then you were instantly dislike. They did not want to hear fresh ideas. They wanted you to work for little pay and OT but demanded you work weekends. Management lied and only awarded those who did not question them. I would never work for this company again. They wanted you to complete training plus meet all request from customers but gave not clear direction on what to truly prioritize first. Management had no communication skills either. sad.
bad,"Clearly all these overly generous rear kissing reviews are being padded by HR folks at IBM."
bad,"force holiday to contractors, under average pay."
bad,job responsibilities in conjunction with education and skill level are not compensated properly for this job.
bad,"This was my first ever firm I worked for. I learned good things technically on how to service a computer, printer, monitor, UPS etc."
bad,"Role: Test Lead 																			 			 "
bad,I did not like the work environment and there was a huge disconnect in communications with remote teams.
bad,"The rating applies only to IBM GSDC Brno not IBM overall."
bad,The management and full time employees had bad attitude.3RD shift so couldn't stand the hours
bad,Supply Chain Management for 25 months in Infosys BPO . Closely to work with account team .
bad,Poor employee management. Management rarely lives up to their promises.
bad,Not much good to say about the company.  They have way too many managers for the numbers people actually doing billable work.  This has led to lower profits.  Their solution is to layoff off workers and keeps the managers; most of whom are clueless about the operations.  No positive social atmosphere at all.  Everybody seems to be unhappy with management for good reason.
bad,"I would highly recommend not to work at this firm. Unless you like working remotely and traveling this is for you. Starting your career you realize how bad morale is at this company from all levels. Employees are treated poorly. It is all about the shareholder. Networking is almost impossible because you never go into the office. It is all about utilization (hours worked per week), which is generally outside your control as a consultant. A lot of hot air coming from senior management. IBM could care less about attrition for consultants."
bad,"Glad this was a contract job and nothing more, this job was one of my worse job experiences I have had to deal with in the contract world and I would not only not apply for another contract job here but would not accept one."
bad,"não cumpre com um sindicato que realmente represente a empresa, fazendo com que a carga horária seja de 44 horas semanais e não 40 como na maioria das empresas, porém a maior parte dos projetos cumpre com um horário de 40 horas fazendo com que o funcionário sempre fique devendo horas, salários bem abaixo do mercado e muitas horas extras para alguns, programa de estágio fraco que prende a pessoa a empresa e não desenvolve bons profissionais."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"Management takes forever to get you the tools you need to do the job. No Active Directory or other software tools, until you need them, or ask for them several times. No Swipe card to get in the building, you have to be escorted and you have to sign in every morning without a swipe card. The bureaucracy is bad. Can't do anything. I have worked a lot of jobs over the years, and I can honestly say IBM is the worst job I have ever worked"
bad,Department is not organized and no proper training. Management is not friendly.
bad,"IBM didn't know what they were getting in to when they bought the outsourcing division of PWC.  They didn't understand accounting, they never came down from their corporate offices in Armonk to Tulsa OK, to see just exactly what it took to keep a customer happy,  After a while we were not allowed to use the word Offshore, we had to use Out Sourced.  I don't know what the climate is like there now, but when BP and several other major customers took back their work, I was glad to get out of there when I did."

bad,"Used to be a great place to be 10 years ago. But then bonuses got cut or disappeareed, layoffs at least once a year, no appreciation for work done well or bringing in additional revenue. Frequent changes in management and restructuring with no apparent strategy."
bad,"sometime alone in shift and u get 3 or 4 major issue. then you have to decide which one is most critical. if required u can call to your co-worker for remote support. thanx god i got support from all side. hardest part is expections from my juniors and to help them for automating their task if they are over loaded is enjoyable part. In IBM you can learn any thing no body will stop you untill and unless if u r free. Whether its IIS, ESX, Cluster, Storage. Instead of it u will get appreciation for it. I learned here scripting as there is too much bulk job like monitoring or security compliance job."

bad,"IBM has great policies for employees, but its only for managers, not for actual employees who put in their efforts in working."
bad,"Not good place to work , too much Indian politics ."
bad,"no vison"
bad,Stressful. Management is challenging. Old company trying to find its feet. No guidance or career progression. Old boys club. Some decent people but most peers untrustworthy
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, as there are two faced people that would stab you behind your back at any moment of time. Hence, making it a waste of time and effort, simply, you give everything in return you get nothing. Then why would you want to join such a toxic environment, with no growth."
bad,"no good employment culture,no training was given but selected initially with trainee period for 6 months, salary very poor, over burden with work, shift based"
bad,"IBM started turning downhill since 2008.  I've been managed poorly and finally left the company in 2016.  The culture is toxic, technical staff are treated poorly, even beyond the point of being illegal."
bad,empresa ibm nao valoriza seus funcionários adequadamente
bad,Trabajo temporal sin posibilidad de planta contaste rotasion de personal cada 3 meses .
bad,Management kept getting in the way of progress. You are tested as a disposable asset. I would never recommend them to anybody else looking for a stable fulfilling placement.
bad,"I had the worst experience of professional life in IBM. In IBM everything depends upon your manager. If the manager is good you can get lot of benefits like training opportunities ,work from home etc. If the manager is not good you will be suffer just like I suffer. "
bad,"By far the worst corporate job I've held."
bad,"Mala visión, tienen a jóvenes con preparatoria en puestos de ingeniería de pruebas y manufactura"
bad,Great company to work for!! Positive work environment where people feel valued and appreciated. This organisation has a good plans and policies and all are very easy to understand
bad,"A Place, where the managers do not know to manage. They are always hiring people from their own town or culture or language and then make them support them in all their stupid endeavors where there is no vision."
bad,"IBM no longer cares about people.  They are just number.  If one is over 55, applications and resumes are ignored.  The unwritten goal for the target IBM workforce is average age 35, with 5 years experience - very light for a deeply technical solutions company.  One will face a Resource Action every three years, and hopefully survive.  Over 60, one will be hit with a Resource Action every year."
bad,"On a typical day at work, we did not know what to expect from management. The workplace culture at IBM was not what to expect from a major corporation, no a family oriented company. As a Veteran with a disability, I was told that I could not go to a Medical appointment by the manager. The hardest part of the job was, to leave your regular and assigned job to go do, Lenovo, Dell, Walmart, Kroger, desktop support and forget the customers you have been working with at the Data Center."
bad,"Worse place I ever worked. Worst management ever. Very rarely gives raises and if they do it is under 2%. Horrible employee morale due to management. Management plays favorites, is sexist and ageist."
bad,"This is not your father's IBM.  Management is clueless as to strategic direction for company.  Work/life balance is heavily skewed to Work.  You will log 60+ hours per week if you are in IT.  If you only log 40 hrs you will receive a poor assessment at rating time."
bad,"The position has been fully based around CBL's. There is little direction which is sold as ability to control your career. Try and find busy work because management hovers over your shoulder. Atmosphere is very hostile, and mentors are unwilling to train because they think you will get their jobs."
bad,IBM treats contractors like furniture....... they will cut your hours or lay you off to meet stock price/quarterly goals. Pay was permanently cut on two occassions
bad,"I joined IBM in 2018. Less than 6 months after I joined, IBM sold off half of our business unit. It is just changes after changes. "
bad,"PHH chose IBM based on agreed SLAs, IBM failed to achieve results due to decisions to outsource to areas PHH was unwilling to send hardware to. As it became certain IBM would lose the contract the last year they cut the pay and hours of the contractors and even forced furlough causing further trouble staying within the SLAs."
bad,Stay away from this company...unless you know someone that can assist you and literally pull you up in your career. otherwise- inexperienced managers play favorites and look out for their own.
bad,They always keep low head count and it cause engineers to work day and night. Also not caring about any benefits.  I would say their motto is employee is a slave
bad,"Despite the hype and talk, they treat staff like kleenex, use & throw."
bad,"Definitivamente pesa en el CV incluir a IBM, pero provee un ambiente laboral extramadamente cargado en el área de testing. Es considerablemente difícil escalar y los líderes de grupo exigen horas extras a modo de poder da run feed back laborable a la gerencia, además de ello no hay una cultura empresarial que sea favorable para el empleado de TI."
bad,"The company has invested in online learning.  You can pick up skills for your current job and future roles via the online learning material, build your own learning roadmap to your dream job."
bad,"Él trabajo es muy complicado para él sueldo, kelly solo contrata no hay planta, la comida es carisima y malisima para él sueldo que se maneja, no hay crecimiento.. Nada recomendable no pierdan su tiempo aqui"
bad,Politics were there tuff to survive if your boss was dominisating you. Otherwise it good. One thing I learnt boss is always right. Don't fight with them for your team members always pull their legs
bad,"The name ""IBM"" looks good on a resume, but that's about the only quality thing I can derive from the job. The building is dirty and not taken care of, not many people put care into their work and there is rarely any opportunity for advancement."
bad,All they care about is cutting costs and cutting people loose that have given their lifetime. Within a month time I started they are already losing their clients to be outsourced to another country
bad,"The Cleveland Clinic outsourced part of their IT to IBM, and it been a disaster from the beginning. IBM did not have a very good plan to take over internal responsibilities and rushed to get things in place. The culture was extremely toxic from management down to end users. They do not compensate well for the amount of work, and responsibility they give you. They are now cutting jobs after the first year of taking over. I cannot provide one reason for why someone would take a position here. They have led employees on for entire time they have had control."
bad,"IBM acquired my company. After working on the software for 12 years, with a stellar record and high peer, management and client reviews, I was given a completely untrue and false negative review and then was let go during the next round of layoffs."
bad,"Poor management, dirty environment, and generally negative atmosphere all add up to a place to avoid. The benefits are good, but should be for a company this size, but some of the benefits have fallen behind the industry (time off / flexible work hours / etc..)."
bad,"Experienced managers skilled at developing people and ensuring the quality of client offerings were systematically replaced by others who only direction were to sell, sell, sell. It was a nightmare of shoddy  and hastily prepared Statements of Work used to create quick sales;"
bad,"There is no longer respect for the individual.  They have great PR, but there is no work life balance.  The only goal is to bill, nothing else matters.  They treat you like a number, not a person."
bad,Many IT contracts through IBM sent to India from Canada. Has no work culture or concern for employees. It is not transparent and management heavy. Not a friendly environment.
bad,"Whenever IBM management want to reduce their man power, they will show silly reasons and ask you to resign. If won't resign they will terminate you."
bad,"I only worked for IBM because they acquired my employer, and they promised us how totally great it would be and made all kinds of overtures about ""round tables"" and ""collaboration"" and all the rest of it.  As it turned out, they completely ignored our advice and proceeded to govern us in a top-down, patriarchal fashion while making every counterproductive and idiotic business decision imaginable.  We were the engineers who knew our product, knew its problems, and how to fix them.  Oh no, IBM is about MANAGEMENT.  Only MANAGEMENT can produce great products.  Your MANAGERS will guide you to greatness, you lowly engineers couldn't possibly know how to make that happen.  "
bad,Company had layoffs every quarter. Every US worker knew they would be let go via a layoff. This created undo stress and individuals did not take risks.
bad,"I still worked from home processing contracts, talking to customers, and Sales reps. Assisted Billing with answers needed to contact customers. I answered to IBM. Never enough time to get everything done and properly research issues."
bad,Deadlines constantly changed to get compliance requirements completed in unrealistic timeframe. Workplace culture was confrontational environment which was a hard workplace culture to deal with if you are not used to it.
bad,IBM provided IT services to Disney corp. Disney provided a cubical and a phone. The Cubical forrest had few people. It was challenging to get access to the Computer room at first.
bad,Current employees have to absorb the workload of folks who leave. Advancement is stalled because there is not a workforce to backfill the current position.
bad,"Good company to start , nice work culture, happy hours, worked as fresher  and left as lead, worked in telecom buisness and happy culture, telecom buisness"
bad,"Your only working for IBM as they figure out a way to offshore your job. Most IBM employees are taught to be like a robot which sours their real personality. This company acts as if they are family oriented and care but it's all a facade.  This company has ruined hundreds of thousands of careers, caused stress which caused divorce, family issues and bankruptcy. Their only goal is the bottom dollar."
bad,"low pay, and jobs go overseas.  they constantly make you take furloughs, at least 40 hours a quarter.  "
bad,"Entry Level , was a good first experience but not long term job I would like to maintain. The Hardest part of the job was telling the client's that they had to wait 4 days for help with their issues that weren't able to resolve."
bad,Escasa valoración de talento real. Promociones a dedo
bad,this was one of the worst experiences of my career  I had 3 boss' in one year moved to a team that I didn't want to be a part of and told I was going to sell something that I really never got to sell
bad,The management is poor and very limited growth opportunities. I would not recommend IBM. While there is a lot of hype about the new technologies other companies are way ahead. Revenues from the new technologies is minimal compared to the total revenue.
bad,"Gone down hill...if you aren't the sexy technology, you are disposable.  IBM talked a big game about company culture but in practice it doesn't exist."
bad,"Company has been around for over 100 years.  Albeit that companies have its ups and downs.  Current leadership does not have a vision of what lies ahead.  Since innovation was part of its core mission, the cloud business should have been entertained and placed into its main strategy several years ago. Now it is just getting into the cloud technology and I believe its a bit late and will need a strong leader to compete with others that are already been in the business for quite some time. The layoff provisions were totally unfair to employees who have been there for over 20 years.  A month of severance pay provided to those people that were laid off I believe is against the law."
bad,Most of the good consulting people have departed this organization over the past 2 years.  Limited consulting opportunities in supply chain
bad,"They will kill your health and family life.  This company is not what it once was.  Don't go to work for them!"
bad,IBM india is a big name but nothing inside no job security purely HR Manager driven company in which manager is your.no hike even on getting highest rating they can fire you any time.specially no job security for fresher's.
bad,"Multiple activities to be execute with poor guidance, focusing only on productivity to the company, Management is handled by one person and act as supreme Lord deciding on the future of the employees."
bad,"Negative culture/environment."
bad,"A typical day depends on the type of person. Motivated folks take the majority of the workload and since this is noticed these same individuals are forwarded more work/responsibilities to the point of exhaustion. Unmotivated typically spend the day shopping or on social media while complaining they have nothing to do. It's a perplexing work environment. While the HR team struggles with attrition, they do nothing to help. "
bad,"Mismanaged, no-one really cares, no incentive to do well."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked in 30 yrs of IT,  thought it might improve but didn't.   Very inexperienced management, no values or ethics.   Model was created to bring offshore IT support back to US which was being demanded by US clients.  Positions filled with inexperienced college graduates and H1B workers.  They wound up adapting an offshore culture and utilized offshore workers as well."
bad,"management has no authority, personnel job performance rated on unrealistic requirements due to the consistent personnel layoffs, layoffs used to meet corporate quarterly finance expectations"
bad,"There isn't any funding for anything. Managers pay out of their pockets for team picnics or for a team luncheon. There is no training - you are thrown in the fire and expected to meet deadlines and know how to complete your project. Documentation is lacking or non-existent. Raises are had to come by, and bonuses are rare. Even market based raises are scarce and given out only if you receive a very high rating."
bad,"1) Won't pay variable component "
bad,While the work was challenging I found that the IBM business model treated its employees in an exploitative manner. The only thing that mattered was the hours.
bad,"IBM se esconde detras de muchos blabla pero es una empresa inestable, nada interesada al empleado, cinica y aproximativa. Se pide cada dia mas sin dar nada a cambio. Ni gracias. Los skills medianos son bajisimos tanto en los empleados como en el management y esto hace que la empresa sea lenta y aparatosa. Dulcis in fundo los contratos que se hacen firmar a los empleados son muy a menudo al limite de la ley con el evidente proposito de exprimir al maximo los recursos humanos pudiendo deshacerse de ellos en la manera mas barata posible al acabar su utilidad."
bad,"1) Processing invoices daily basis"
bad,"Grande stress e pouco benefício, trabalhei em um horario de turnos e não tive opção de mudar."
bad,"I feel I covered that up previously.  Plus, I need to meet a bus in 10 minutes."
bad,"The day at IBM would be very busy as it involved continuous work upto 9 hours of work in front of the system with only about half an hour to 45 minutes break in between. The management, staff and other departments of the organization were very rigid, tight and unprofessional in their approach. And the work environment was rigid, tight and unsystematic."
bad,"I learned a lot from IBM and it is great company to work"
bad,Bad management.. Political environment.. Haphazard policies.. Government office type bureaucracy.. Unfriendly support and HR staff..  
bad,"management would not work with you on your availability, the hrs they schedule you for would change several times within the year (5 times for me) when i selected the available hrs during my interview i was called 3 or 4 times and was asked to change it. harassed by management when asking for help on a call. co workers would talk about drugs on break. co workers are inconsiderate to you when your talking on the phone with your customer. "
bad,"• Customized desktops and laptops for end users; set up work stations, laptops and peripherals"
bad,Always have to watch your back. Very petty work environment. Not a happy place to be.
bad,I life got ruined after joining this company .. All policies are there but in practical manager's are your god ...
bad,"This is a very big company. It will take you years to acclimate to the endless systems, processes, organization charts, policies, politics, cultures, values, etc. causing otherwise high-performing people to constantly be dealing with low-value-add nuances."
bad,"Few marketing people are trained or even experienced. They don't typically hire MBAs. It is a challenging environment for change agents and younger professionals. They just recently started using marketing automation and have been using social media for some years. In sum, they are behind 10-15 years as compared to other companies in the same industry."
bad,This company gives great training in some areas but lacks proper training and tools for their employees. They do not promote within and you end up being a temporary for 6 or 7 years. The pay is not very good and the management teams do not provide the proper mentorship to make it within the company. There are a few good managers but the majority are only there to do a job and nothing more.
bad,"No rewards for a job well done, had very little communication with management. No job security. Computers where 2 rate and was very difficult to do your position."
bad,"Benefit usati come ricatto. Bullizzazione nell'ambiente di lavoro, colleghi che si credono manager e danno ordini, carico di lavoro sugli ultimi arrivati. Overtime non pagato ma richiesto per rispettare deadlines. Totale disorganizzazione del lavoro. Stipendio ridicolo. Due pesi e due misure nei confronti dipendenti. Management inadeguato e disinteressato nei confronti del personale, promozioni senza merito."
bad,"Lack of clarity between job interviewed for, and actual job you will do. Job role keeps changing very rapidly. Lot of politics . Lady manager not good towards working mothers with small babies. No lactation room, no on-site crèche. No job security. Hire and fire culture."
bad,"My mentors were worthless & didn't teach me any required objectives or treated me like a secretary. They & my manager were both disrespectful. I passed through added volunteer work. They claimed work your own hours as long as 40 every week w/remote work options, but complained if not in office 15 min past 9, even if I worked late the night before! 60+ hrs/wk, no extra pay"
bad,"Gerência péssima, agem com vingança punindo e desmotivando o funcionário."
bad,"IBM is lost. Mangers have the golden ticket, but they don't know how to run the business. Culture is lack of responsibility, hire, fire. No regard for their employees. If you are a new to the work force, think twice about going because IBM is going no where and they pay well, but there is more to a career than pay."
bad,"Burn and churn, low cost countrry, incompetent management. No respect for the individual. Losing marketshare fast due to poor management, and mske ip for it on the back of employees."
bad,"Pray that you have a mgmt team that is actually capable of managing and hiring people that can properly do their job so the work doesnt pile onto others."
bad,"I was transferred to IBM from another company when they bought the business, and over the years managed to kill a very profitable business making it a double digit loss in just a few years.  Management is the biggest problem and until 1/2 the executives are let go, the business will never improve."
bad,They need to cooperate with new interns. Money doesn't matters always i believe the productivity of individuals matters so it can automatically increase the productivity of a company.
bad,"I have been with this company for 9+ years. I've had one raise in that time frame, even tho I have elevated my job roles and skills. I wasn't even given the last ""cost of living"" raise the last year, because I had just rec'd my ONLY raise from the company. I was brought in at the wage minimum, and was forced to get a 2nd job on the weekends, just to make ends meet. They do not compensate for loyalty and Skills building."
bad,"During my first 4 years at IBM, the work and enviornment and culture was quite good and exciting as it was a time of tremendous growth and change within our organization.  As a function of multiple Leadership changes throughout my last 3 years in the practice the new leadership management experience presented challenges.  The most challenging part of the position was delivering client defined goals and maintaining qualified staff given a competitive talent market. The most enjoyable part of my postions and career at IBM were working with my direct peers, the delivery team category managers, supporting global clients, learning global protocols, supporting multiple roles and developing a deeper knowledge of certain sub categories."
bad,"Far from an agile culture, folks too worried about appearance of being an expert/go to person to share information, culture seems to pit employees against each other."
bad,No free time to think about your career.Just work work work and work. No job security. They will ask you to leave without any prior notice and give you 3 month basic salary
bad,"Management is horrible.  They're too busy virtue signaling to actually accomplish something.  Bad decision making, they don't care about their customers, and they treat their employees like numbers."
bad,This place is a mess. Managers don't manage. No one seems to care about anything. Nothing seems to get done and you feel stressed out about it constantly.
bad,"Did not get fair pay compared to male coworkers.  I took over messed up projects that men were running and fixed them for IBM and the customers, yet was paid less and did not get the same accolades as male counterparts. Also got laid off due to my age, which was conveyed to me thru my management."
bad,"2 years as a temp without health insurance prior to hiring, mandatory overtime, 10-hour days, some 6-day weeks, constant schedule changes, team changes and ""musical desks"", absolutely no opportunity for advancement or a more appropriate position as promised (hard collections presented as ""customer service""), punishment for seeking medical attention"
bad,"Another Temporary job without advancement opportunities. "
bad,"What was once a respected and trusted technology juggernaut has been driven into the ground by greed and ineptitude.  IBM no longer innovates anything; it has become a financial engineering company with stock buybacks, divestitures, layoffs, and outsourcing, all with the sole purpose of propping up the stock price and projecting the image of being 'profitable'.  The CEO needs to go, and the BoD needs to be purged and replaced with forward-thinkers who can bring about the change that is needed within the organization, but it's probably too late and never gonna happen.  Sure, there are still pockets of good people doing good things at IBM, but by and large the company is becoming less relevant and unable to get out of its own way to compete in today's marketplace."
bad,lots of layoffs in USA . very poor culture where are the focus is on internal competition.  No teamwork between departments.  Maybe a good place to work for offshore employees.
bad,They off-shore roles to cheap in-experienced staff. Make all the older more experienced staff redundant due to cost in the local Country. The relocate off-shored staff to local Country to fill for local staff that has either been made redundant or off with stress due to local resource issues.
bad,"At every level this delivery was filled with illegal actions and predatory management practices.  Worked 9 to 5 plus evening, plus mandatory weekends with no additional compensation.  Older workers were happy to have jobs, so they would work 70+ hours every week without complaint.  Very toxic environment.  Heard management talking about who to keep and who to fire based on culture bias."
bad,"More stressed in the office than at home with a husband, newborn and a first time school ager. there is a lot of micro managing on the team. the leadership is poor."
bad,"The entrenched management in GBS is utterly and completely toxic. I have never seen such self-serving, vile behaviour in my entire life. Jealousy abounds, sabotaging junior staff, talking behind people’s backs, actively attempting to make projects fail in order to prove a point. Management treats staff like slaves and only want “yes-men.” They play favourites constantly, nobody is promoted based on merit, performance reviews are often falsified to get rid of “non-favourites.” Not to mention the constant threat of redundancy."
bad,"Hire and Fire at a whim and fancy. I was hired and praised and suddenly let go before the holidays for no reason, other than the big boys fought and fought like children."
bad,"I managed to get this job 6 months after leaving college. I had a degree in an unrelated field and managed to land this after doing a little bit of searching."
bad,"They laid off their staff, forced them to become contractors for another company and then let them go before their pensions matured. Rotten company from the top down."
bad,Its hard to believe that company with a reputation such as IBM could be so woefully difficult to work for.   The dog eat dog culture with little respect for ethics or customers is just so difficult to bear.
bad,"Difficult Company to work for.  Benefits are very expensive, and management/culture is very different. I woul dnot recommend working for this company at all."
bad,"You are always torn to balance between customer demands, and administrative work, and fear of being laid off.  Your continued employment at IBM is not contingent upon your performance."
bad,"IBM is a sinking.  It is sinking.  It may sink today, or tomorrow. Who knows when but this company is sinking and there is no coming back from it now."
bad,Came in through an acquisition. Its an awful place to work. The leadership in Watson Health is awful. There is no room for advancement and they only promote from outside the company. The place is a disgrace.
bad,"IBM needs to hire qualified people. Right now they just let people quit or retire and never replace them. On top of that they want you to seek out more contract work.  We do not have enough people to cover the work already assigned, people are working all different shifts through out the week, it is horrible."
bad,"Been here over 7 years so seen a lot, but generally company lacks leadership, it has a bullying culture to get oversold promises delivered... Delivery capability is now mainly India...."
bad,"IBM, I Be Moving. "
bad,"Lack of overall leadership and/or direction from Upper Management....Exec's get to bounce around every 1-2 years while everyone else is stuck... Workplace culture was toxic.. I don't know anyone that was happy to be employed at IBM.  It was hard to retain top talent for any length of time... Just big and slow... Too many folks needed to make a decision... Triangle sitting on one of its angles, top heavy with middle and upper manages with too few lower level Engineers to help sustain and let alone grow anything in the back of the house... Everything is going to low cost regions (ie - under going a Transformation) Software Enterprise solutions are overly complex... Why do you need a service engagement to deploy these solutions successfully still today?  Why do you need a PHD to maintain these products? Competitors are running circles around IBM, doing things faster, quicker, better.. Every quarter one can expect a Lay off and/or Resource Action.  The alarm for this is when the GearBox process begins, allowing employees to find something else in the business quickly....  The offshoring to low cost regions starts with the HCL Technology partnership (swg legacy brand acquisitions). HCL is becoming IBM SWG, resurrecting the old technology through many new Software Developers in Bangalore with tech Support provided from Manilla.... Good luck getting a phone call from the Philippines anytime soon.  Its not about NSI and NPS... its about reducing their cost... These guys think support is a cost of doing business, an expense... You can not recover from 20 years of intellectual property"
bad,"Not much to say here. IBM ruined Explorys when they acquired them. Red tape everywhere, our benefit costs increased. We had to eat our own dog food (Lotus Notes..who uses Lotus notes?)"
bad,"Work at home allowed. Flexible work schedule. Medial, dental and vision plans offered. Job security is an issue, layoffs and cutbacks  are frequent along with cost cutting measures."
bad,"People practices need to improve significantly.  Work life balance needs to improve especially in case of client facing roles."
bad,"Very sad to see such a great company fall so far. Many of the laudable qualities they preach were true in years past. The technology is largely outmoded. Projects to develop new solutions are under funded. management is clueless about WHY they have so badly missed the mark and disinterested in trying to understand why."
bad,"Typical day: "
bad,"This job was bad was on IAM for 2 years had degrees and so forth.  After 2.5 years was still not making 37k.  Had no raises at all ever.  Management would not even talk to you.  You were hourly and they expected you to work extra and not put it on time sheet.  "
bad,Very selfish culture. Most managers are out for their personal advancement and do not do enough to develop talent. The different levels of management are trying to survive in an ever changing company that is struggling to stay relevant.
bad,"Prior to 2015, a career at IBM was rewarding and reserved for the best talent. Thereafter, it has been plagued with annual layoffs and poor management. The company's best talent is leaving in droves and executives are frantically trying to reallocate workload to keep this massive company afloat. No one has a single job, everyone is overworked and underpaid."
bad,Take advantage of their technicians and than dump them.  I have no more to say about IBM except that I will not work for them again.  I should have learned from the first time I was released.
bad,If you want to be in an environment where they rarely vacuum/dust and managers like to have big egos go right on over to Seterus. There is no unity!!!
bad,"Not a happy place....always overworked and understaffed, terrible management and always playing the favorites game for advancement.  Good training poor, poor management."
bad,"For a company with such a heritage, my experience was ironically unwelcome. The people I interacted with were political, believed in not-so-ethical practices to achieve results etc..."
bad,"I was a female team lead, leading mostly male team members in India.  They did not want to be told what to do by a female, and purposefully failed audits, sabotaged metrics, etc.  I had multiple documented examples of this - my first line manager and I went to my second line manager who said he would look into the issue.  I was then told that I needed to ""better understand the hierarchy of the Indian male culture"" and whenever telling them something they need to improve, I need to include two items that they are doing correctly, so as not to bruise their egos.  I left the team shortly afterwards."
bad,"The time I was working there I got totals of six managers, and managers without any idea about the job, so it was not direction we could get from managers. It is very importatn to have a manager who is well knoeledge in the area, so the staff could go to."
bad,"Over my time at IBM, I never had personal contact with either the management team from IBM, or my direct supervisor. I was pretty much  left to my own devices to shape my own position without any guidance from my manager."
bad,Self focused management teams. Focus is on bringing in new staff. Working to move out senior employees versus retraining committed employees Senior employees are at risk.
bad,"I found management to be very inflexible, not willing to take feedback from the employees."
bad,No Job Security at all. Work 70+ hrs and get paid 40 hrs. They promise you the world and work you to death and than complain about the hrs you work and tell you to comp anything over 35hrs.
bad,"We built the machines that put the M in IBM, yet that wasn't good enough in the end.  We were given to Global Foundries with $1.5 Billion (with a 'B') cash to get off of IBM's losing quarterly statements.  We were basically fodder for a $20 per earnings roadmap to the year 2015, but eventually even Ginni Rometty had to throw the towel in on that.  If you're in hardware design in any shape or form, look at other enterprise companies first."
bad,"I have nothing positive to say about IBM.  Management is poor, upper management is lost. IBM is always a day late and dollar short, late to market, can not win the business, pricing too high"
bad,"There is no drive in the employees, hard to gain progression in IBM Ireland, Salary is not great. But it is easy work and you can gave a good life style."
bad,"Terrible place with no chance of advancement, no job security, no benefits and low wages. Management was always looking to lay off employees to cut costs constantly."
bad,"Not at all good company . Salary is only given once, no increment life time. No free guddies not even tea . Bad transportation . HR is for name sake . Never join"
bad,Managers seem to be the ones who're best suited to scamming and cheating. You really have to get everything in writing with these people.  IBM/Seterus is known for being a horrible place to work. They will fire half your team and then ask you to take up the slack.
bad,"IBM is not the company it used to be 25+ years ago.   The three values of IBM are often meaningless words these days.   I value the time I spent at IBM and loved it's people.  However,   IBM's dedication to it's clients success is not there from what I have seen.   Great people,  Great Clients,  but getting anything done for a client is often more painful than a root canal w/o getting numbed."
bad,Worked at IBM for over 20 years and have witnessed the downfall. Years ago it was a great place to work. These days there is no work / life balance and it is all about making money at all costs.
bad,"Toxic culture.  Management failing yet they are enriching themselves.  CEO and senior management lie to the public about creating jobs, hiring veterans, etc. when in fact they are laying off WAY more than they are hiring."
bad,Used to be a great company.  Current management is driving towards a cliff.  Layoffs once a quarter and reorganizations are the norm and not the exception.
bad,Gone down hill for the last 10 years.  Zero Job Security.   All the jobs are going offshore.   Nowhere near the company it use to be.   Layoffs every quarter.
bad,La falta de comunicación de Gerencia hacia los empleados de alguna cuenta hace que IBM pierda nivel de servicio y profesionalismo en los proyectos que están en ejecución por el personal a cargo.
bad,"Company is stacked with so many layers of management and technical resources are constantly being reduced wherein the network engineers are overworked and always stressed. Since company earns revenues in executing new projects for the client, the mantra is to take as many projects but there is no planning of resources with the result that the network/security implentors have to juggle multiple projects at a time"
bad,"IBM is as the logo says a machine, made to take out any personal touch or enjoyment out of the work place. "
bad,"Dont expect to make a career there if you are an above average engineer. This is not a tech , its a sales company, that steadily moves into medieval ages work environment."
bad,Not good for women. Job security zero. Dnt help people in worst. Thinks employee as machine.  Workplace not good. Make difficult situation in front of employees to drop papers. Managers thinks they are god
bad,Best thing for me was getting laid off from IBM. If you are in the GBS division there is no hardcore technical training available other than IBM way. Was given flip phone for support. I could upgrade to a better smartphone if I wanted to pay for half the phone price. Good luck if you end up working fort his company..
bad,This was the worst position and company I have ever work for and with. Internal fighting and backstabbing at its finest.
bad,"IBM was a great company in general, but facing a lot of challenges, poor management, a lot of people just laying back, waiting for others to feed them"
bad,"Great company that is doing layoffs every quarter and not valuing their employees.  Changing direction every 6 months to a year, so very hard to get momentum with constant change."
bad,IBM has taken its eye off of developing it's resources and delivering excellence to the client.  The focus has completely shifted to irresponsible cost cutting.
bad,"Lack of Oversight, Horrible Management. Job Work and Life Balance was not good."
bad,"IBM's managers are mostly people who lack the technical skills to thrive as engineers.  Therefore, technical skill is not valued or rewarded at IBM.  The employees that get ahead are usually the ones who are favored by managers for non-technical reasons.  Very talented older men are screwed over in favor of new hires and the managers' buddies.  You could work your butt off and do great things and still get shoved into a lousy job because your manager is taking care of his buddies.  Upper management is constantly cutting back and increasing workload without any corresponding compensation.  The only product they really care about is IBM stock.  Pay raises are extremely infrequent for older employees.  They shamelessly take advantage of people in compromising positions such as middle-aged workers with families to support.  Work-life balance?  Yeah right!"
bad,There is no company loyalty to employees. I've been laid off twice by the company and have witnessed many people in the same situation.
bad,"If you are looking for job stability..look elsewhere"
bad,"Bad culture, substandard benefits, they don't care about people only the bottom line. the quality employees have left as there are much better positions outside of IBM. constant fear of layoffs. long hours with no recognition for your contribution. "
bad,"The saying goes that ""anyone can take your job,"" but IBM is the living embodiment of this phrase. There is no job stability. Managers praise you one day while lying behind your back. This is not just my situation, but for the other hundreds of employees working there opinion."
bad,"I worked out of the Frisco Tx office. I was absolutely not impressed with this company. The training was less than impressive, management didnt help you grow or give honest feed back to help you improve as an employee. Favoritism is awful within this office as well. I have worked for many companies and this is the only position I left feeling defeated. In past positions I felt like I grew as a person, employee, and Recruiter...but not with IBM. They wanted me to work endless hours and not report any overtime, if overtime was reported, you got in huge trouble. I went from a salary employee to hourly after 6 months of working there due to company changes and it was horrible. Unfortunately they promote employees that are not professional, one ""leader"" literally sending me an email telling me how ""stupid i was"""
bad,"La IBM  que conocemos de hace 25 años atras es muy distinta a aquella empresa desastrosa que vemos hoy....yo no recomendaria trabajar en ella a menos que uno no tuviera muchas alternativas..."
bad,"When you join you get great training an corporate values and encouragement for initiatives. But on the job, people with too much expectations are quickly brought back to reality and discouraged from sticking their head above the crowd with new ideas. No wonder IBM didn't had any growth for years, their middle management is totally inadequate and ineffective. This is a place where experience and know-how becomes embarrassing as it makes the young managers look like they know nothing and first thing you know you are out the door. Pity."
bad,Contractors comprise 90% of the workforce.  Annual turnover is 94%.  There is very little room for advancement.  No opportunity to become a full time employee.
bad,"Employees are given so much work. Business is the top most priority even at the expense of health of the employees. I had done a workload analysis when during my tenure on the company. It turned out that an employee's workload should be done by 3 people. "
bad,"- Its ok if the person join as manager in the IBM  will get good returns."
bad,"I enjoyed the people. I did not enjoy the type of work I did. I had to travel 100 per cent even though I was hired for 30 per cent. Traveling is tough, especially if you value family time."
bad,"A company to build your skills and leave them. They don't appreciate you. "
bad,Learned a lot about the mortgage industry. Unfortunately its nearly impossible to advance within the company. The pay/benefits are good.
bad,"This used to be a good place to work, good pay, good benefits, thoughtful management.  This is no longer the case, pay is low compared with competitors, they are unable to retain decent technically staff."
bad,Don't plan on making a career at IBM.  The new hire program claims advancement opportunities and ability to find your dream job --- but it is rare.
bad,"Good place to learn.Excellent opportunity, Management not good."
bad,no care for employees. worst environment and you can find rats working with you. completely unhygenic!!
bad,"El desinterés por los empleados de parte de la empresa y sus políticas de vaciamiento, el favoritismo excesivo demostrado por las gerencias de casi todas las áreas, los negociados internos de los mismo, el desprecio por el empleado subordinado y por el esfuerzo ejercido sin darle oportunidad de crecimiento o aumento, los paupérrimos y denigrantes ajustes salariales, la falta de pago de las horas extras, la falta de capacitación y los interminables conflictos sindicales que estresan la jornada laboral cotidiana (sin respuesta por parte dela empresa); todo esto convierte a IBM como una experiencia laboral de pésima calidad."
bad,It is not the IBM of old that you THINK you know.  It is a sad place ....
bad,"management is dumb nobody knows who should do what, and they pay you the bare minimum for maximum work. i learned not to ever buy an IBM product EVER"
bad,"Most of the managers had no managerial experience. They took advantage of a bad economy and paid approximately 50% of the compensation for the same or similar position anywhere else in the United States. "
bad,"Great company!"
bad,"Mostly its highly pressurized environment."
bad,"It's almost 12 years now that working at IBM means just keeping low profile and hope you are not part of next layoff list. The layoff are managed without common sense and/or intelligence, it is just a mere mathematical equation, no long term thinking. People are getting sick from a psychological point of view, just looking at them you can see it."
bad,"Not my kinda of job, (IBM) it was too big and little customer service."
bad,Review of critical jobs that needed to be done first
bad,we were working for Australlian Bank.St.George Bank.
bad,I have nothing positive to say about my time at IBM. I am very good at what I do when I'm given the chance to show and do it. This was not the case at IBM.
bad,"IBM downsizing 50,000 employees.  Unless you are work for a growing area your position will be eliminated.  This is because of Red Hat acquisition that spent $34 billion.  Now all other IBM solutions are being either sold to pay for Red Hat acquisition or more layoffs are being done. Most managers are politically motivated to reduce head count and they do.  Plus, the managers hired former IBM associates in jeopardy to work for them and then they lay off people they have no past relationship with.  It is a very toxic environment. Be careful!"
bad,"The job started off being very good with work-life balance, but it gradually became more and more restrictive, with toilet breaks being monitored via a telephone log-in system. And the pay was insultingly low. Absolute rubbish."
bad,"This is ALL contract work.  Once you are hired, then you are required to search for an account from thousands of jobs on the internal website.  You are required to interview before getting the role.  Oftentimes you are required to work 45 - 50 hours per week with no additional pay for the account.  There is little management and what there is - it is not consistent.  Most meetings are via phone conference and a lot of times with people you do not understand because of their dialect.  I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"Management participated in numerous meetings, which were a waste of time.  Direction is cascaded down from above.  No ability to be creative.  Pay was good, but environment was toxic."
bad,"When our department was outsourced to IBM, we thought we'd be treated fairly and have full benefits. Found out they lied to us and fired most of dept."
bad,"IBM has acquired a lot of companies, including the company I worked for, then failed at integrating these acquired products into the IBM portfolio.  They systematically drove off experienced people and targeted older workers for firing."
bad,The whole work culture is Internal focussed to meet unreliable objectives. Most of the work is on hope. Talent or skills has no meaning. Only acquaintance and visibilty is the way to work.
bad,there is no work life balance and there is no HR support or help if you place any complaint they will tell the person you reported. This is not a culture i would recommend
bad,"IBM only cares about the bottom line and money and not about their loyal, dedicated and qualified employees! Since they allow you to work from home they expect you to work during your vacation and even sometimes when you’re sick."
bad,Pay was extremely low nothing else mattered. So many women cried because of the low pay it was deheartening. Many promises of higher pay for all of us but nothing came. Was there two years and many of us had master's degrees and four or more years of experience earning only forty thousand a year!!!
bad,"The GTS division is basically the red headed step child of IBM.  C-level doesn't see it as a money maker and treats it as such. Benefits keep declining, numerous people that have been there for years have never seen raises.  Performance bonuses taken away.  Middle management changes mean ""reorganization"" which is a funny way of playing a shell game with employees and first level managers and if you get left out, you get an unexpected pink slip.  No motivation to innovate, even though they beg you to...why should I put effort into making things better when some middle manager is going to steal the idea and champion it as their own...and then potentially get rid of valuable colleagues?  You get beaten down by clients and management and the days just drag on."
bad,"Conversations about chattel slavery will suddenly break out around you. Folks openly racists with mob like mentality. Employees like to throw things when they're upset. If you're not part of the clique, you're targeted."
bad,"Peoples in America have to work in real time with peoples in India; someone obviously have to work outside business hours and it shows in the quality of the work."
bad,Outsourced to IBM from Walgreens. I don't know the answer to this. IBM bought us out from Walgreens and didn't really give any support to the process.
bad,I currently work from home and am a manager which I enjoy very much. The hardest part is finding new customers to work with the company. The culture is some what stress as well to work in.
bad,aucun avis sur la société IBM à laquelle je n’appartiens plus
bad,"Benefits are surprisingly mediocre. Leadership is just a word and people are promoted with no experience or idea how to lead. Opportunities for advancement are purely through political connections and appointments. Internal tools are out of date or not useful to the objectives. Leaders will speak out of both sides of their mouth and are not interested in employees but are focused on self- preservation and promotion. Culture fosters shredding and disparaging colleagues to make yourself look better. Rare exceptions can be found but they don’t stay. Compensation is very good but you must compromise your values to have what it takes. Highly political environment that values tenure, position and rank,  over ideas. Blame and finger pointing are common and unless you have someone to point to, you’ll be held accountable for things beyond your control  if you don’t make your numbers, you're gone. This is not the IBM it used to be."
bad,"Open office environment where they don’t respect the rules. They play video games, shoot nerf guns every day and play outdoor sports next to people who are trying to work."
bad,"le cadre de travail n'était pas agréable, IBM était une grosse"
bad,"The ability to define oneself as an IBM'r was truly a great honor for over 25 years, but the simple truth is that the company has not had any meaningful vision or direction in the last decade."
bad,"A typical day would include hours on conference calls without the key decision makers on the phone. Everyone works remotely so you don't have the opportunity to work directly with your colleagues except during set staff meetings and then that becomes a separate meeting. Colleagues are spread out from Ireland, Brazil and India so immediate resolutions/answers are extremely rare. Advancements are rare as most promotions are given to career IBMers versus newly acquired talent."
bad,"My boss did not know the names of the people who were on their team for almost two years.  Constantly changing things for no reason in completely unproductive ways. Three times as many hours spent writing down what you were doing, rather than doing anything."
bad,If you are over 40 there is a target on your back after 20 years got 4 weeks severance far below former employees. CEO is trying to show profit to shareholders by cutting employees.
bad,"I was only with IBM for a year as a contractor working from home. I transitioned due to the company I was working for prior outsourcing all their IT to IBM. The job was okay...until I was laid off just before the holidays. The worst part was my boss didn't tell me. He delegated that to my account manager...and she forgot to tell me on Friday."
bad,"Working at IBM is not what it used to be.  Now every man and woman for themselves.  There is a great group of very talented people who are creative being guided by a bunch of accountants chasing the stock price."
bad,"Required to stand and work for 12 hours with little to no interaction with other employees. "
bad,"I wasted my career in this company. The management is poor and work culture is highly regressive. It is unfortunate that we have people join this company for careers and their careers get destroyed without their knowledge. This happens for people who are dedicated and honest. The career just stagnates. By the time you realize, it becomes too late."
bad,"Not a good company to work"
bad,They took over our company with then intention of outsourcing IT. We were all scheduled to be laid off within a year. So you either found a job before the layoff or stay around to get laid off. Those that they kept are overworked and understaffed. This is not what they told us when they acquired us.
bad,No raise in salary increases for the 5 years I worked there even with excellent work reviews. Any career advancements go through a long involved process that is initiated by the employee. Shows little concern for assisting the employee in advancement.
bad,Very high turnover and we are forced to move.    I would not recommend this company to anyone.  There is no strategy.  The vision is there but no one can execute
bad,"Diversidade não é somente cor, raça, sexo; e sim respeito."
bad,"Work culture is good."
bad,Typical large company.  24 x 7 work environment.  expected to work through vacations.  Poorly managed.  runs 2 sets of books in order to pay sales people less.
bad,"I started in IBM as an intern in 1985 and have seen the respect for its employees and clients decline.  By the time I left, there were significant layoffs every year, benefits were continually reduced and work demand continually increased while average pay increases were 1% at best."
bad,No job is safe. Management doesn't know what they are doing. They are not client centered. They are not employee centered. Massive layoffs. They are only concerned with selling.
bad,Company is poorly run.  No longer cares about U.S. employees.  More concerned about bottom line than provided good service to customers.  Roughly 10% of U.S. workforce laid off each year.
bad,"Company is prone to using people and not paying what they're worth.  Corporate culture expects employees to work round the clock, to be available on weekends, days, off, etc.  Politics are vicious."
bad,"This review is about the Baton Rouge Center.  A typical day here is you come in and sit down and watch Youtube or play around on social media all day. The center hardly has any projects so you have to find your own using barren wasteland of a job board called Professional Markeplace or PMP.  It's trash.  They have more people than they can staff for projects which leads to long periods without one unless you're one of the extremely lucky few.  Pay is absolute garbage.  They start you out at 40K except if you're a CBDer, then you can make a little more. Good luck getting a raise. They don't like to pay people and look for any excuse they can to not give one. "
bad,sitting on the phone would be a typical day. I learned that under qualified people are put in management. The culture at Seterus was stressfull and it would seem that management were in fear of losing their jobs so they made sure other employees felt the same. I enjoyed the benefits but the stress level far out weighed them.
bad,"The management is not at all concerned about the employees and they just look at the cost savings, hence just for only work life balance you can chose IBM however if you are looking for a good career then dont chose IBM"
bad,"If you're looking to push yourself and flex your knowledge, no better place then IBM.  You can always be assured that there is no lack of technical issues arising which require extreme pace and hands-on.  There is plenty of support, but you must find the right people to aide and assist you."
bad,"IBM (GTS specifically) is now a place of maximum cost reduction, very little progression and a race to the bottom. Too much inefficient middle management creating interference, red tape and undue stress in the work place, plenty of buzz words and corporate speak, talking the right talk but they do not back it up. Unfortunately IBM used to be a great place to work and still has some great people but it has lost its shine and is no better that any other major outsourcing firm in the race to the bottom. Skeleton teams are now over worked and under appreciated. Which leads to regular fire fighting and more often that not you have to figure it out yourself with very little guidance. Further your expected to ""Over"" perform to gain any meaningful bonus and honest hard work is rarely recognized. The problem is IBM over sell their services and under deliver which invariably leads to the brunt being taken by the line staff. It's a pity about the short sighted approach and has taken a massive toll on IBM's once great name.  Good job security with IBM but no a great long term prospect, go for the experience but don't stay too long."
bad,"Typical Day at Work: Get yelled at all day and still be expected to deliver on every single project. Get chewed out on a regular basis for their poor hiring decisions."
bad,"A good job to ""cut your teeth"", but little opportunity to advance without moving into management.  There was always a multitude of different challenges to face and this kept the job interesting.  Oversight could sometimes be overbearing, yet is to be expected in an entry level position."
bad,"Horrifically mismanaged company floundering to achieve one thing and one thing alone; shareholder value at any and all costs."
bad,"No respect for individuals, only interested in earnings, not innovation. Purchase innovation through acquisition. No Job Security and poor middle and upper management."
bad,Don't recommend working for IBM. They expect a lot from you. They will terminate you and hire someone less qualified. Management is very poor. Very stressful place to work.
bad,"IBM was once a great company to work for, however, over the past decade or more the company has declined. It places almost no value on it's employees and makes all decisions based on the current quarter results. Senior leadership lacks the courage to do the right thing instead they simply blindly follow the CEO's pronouncements even when the lack specificity, direction, and market value."
bad,Management was only worried about themselves and continued employment. Didn't care about the customers or the people who worked for them that made the company successful.
bad,"The people at IBM just love making sure you're working hard, even if no one is calling and your email box is empty. Just avoid this company unless you're truly desperate, or love working 13 hour work days."
bad,"Position is very challenging as is, however with the style of management can make the experience very intimidating and scary.  There is not a lot of genuine care in the growth or employee development if you are not accepted within the departmental ""click crew"""
bad,I do not recommend working for IBM.  The company expects loyalty but does not deliver any.  Managers do not engage to help but only to CYA.  Company eliminated my job along with hundreds of others despite years of dedicated and effective service.
bad,"A huge company that operates in sheer chaos, rules are made  up on the fly when needed, no real management but lots of people walking around with the title."
bad,Upper management is clueless and wastes the lives of their front line employees.  They pour money into research that will never come to anything while letting their money-making products languish.  The fact that IBM has now posted 20 consecutive quarters of declining revenue is no fluke.  Their upper management is full value for it.
bad,IBM is all about the CEO's making their bonuses they will lay off at least once a year to ensure they get their bonus does not matter how well you perform. They will make you lie to customers about the hours you work inorder to make their numbers.
bad,"Came aboard in July of 2016 as a Validation Engineer Consultant.  After six months of hard work, was let go for no reason.  Management was never around for support and training lacked consistency.  There was little if any culture in Cambridge.  "
bad,IBM gave me the opportunity to grow and learn as an individual. I have had many different career paths during my time there
bad,I think ibm is moving away from service. They are moving away from hardware and into more of a admin type of company. Every year less employees and more shifts and overtime.
bad,"IBM is a great place to learn skills, and gain experience. It is not a company I recommend for people looking to plant their feet into through the rest of their career, no job security. IBM is exactly what it stands for, an International Business. Job placement is more so off shore than on native soil. Though that is not the only downfall, it is the scariest when looking for that long term commitment in a job. The salary at IBM is not competitive at all. Salary is based on a national average, not on a cost of living by location scale. So if you live in an expensive metro area, more than likely you will find yourself disappointed in the salary figures more so than someone in a less developed area."
bad,"Me echaron sin explicación alguna, estuve 1 mes y medio sin tener máquina y cuando dispuse de ella me despidieron, sin ningún motivo."
bad,"Aparentemente sería una de las mejores empresas para trabajar, pero desafortunadamente se manejan muchos círculos cerrados donde compadrazgos incluyen sobre la vida laboral. Las personas que ingresan a través de terceros no son tratados con justicia ni con respeto. No es un lugar donde me gustaría laborar."
bad,"A empresa ainda vive do nome. Paga-se muito pouco e esperem que você não reclame por isso."
bad,"A large bureaucratic company that lost its way and is now late to the game to transfrom itself - in order to save itself. "
bad,"I came to IBM as most people do, as an employee of another company who's role is outsourced to IBM as part of a contractual arrangement for IBM to provide services previously provided inhouse.  "
bad,It has been learning on your own. The culture and the environment is corrupt. You are forced to be logged inn even when you want to have a dinner break.
bad,"build proof of concept in the ucs space using polycom, cisco, citrix, apple and avaya products. these products were used by sales force to demo and sell mobility solutions to customers"
bad,"As time has passed, more and more layoffs have reduced U.S. based staff to a fraction of where it was a decade ago. IBM leadership is fixated on the bottom-line."
bad,"By far the worst place I have ever worked.  Out of an office of over 35 people, all but 2 had quit due to failed management during my one year contract.  Once the year long contract was up, I quit immediately."
bad,"I have been with IBM 18 years and I can say every year I am astonished at the lack of service provided to customers.  IBM has declining revenue the past 11 quarters and the answer to resolve the issue is remove employees from the business to try an compensate for the loss.  This is the classic treat the symptom and ignore the cause way of thinking.  There are reasons why customers are buying less from IBM, service anyone?  There is little to no movement, formal education(Skillsoft), bonuses, and raises for employees band 8 and below working in IBM Global Services SO."
bad,"The first few years were very gratifying. A typical workload for a Senior PM was one of 8 to 12 projects. "
bad,IBM trims over 10% of employees per year causing threat of firing.  The company is cramped and overseen my multinational company.
bad,"If you like working 24/7 with no hope in getting rewarded this is the company for you.  They continue to cut benefits and pay.  There is no growth, unless you want to move to India."
bad,Lots of work.  Plenty of multi-tasking but no rewards. I've learned that hard work doesn't pay off.  My co-workers are a great bunch of people.
bad,"Impressive aspects of IBM are you get to work with the latest software and hardware technology.  Excellent opportunity for education and growth. A lot of very smart people that work together to get a job done."
bad,"tedious and boring"
bad,I worked with IBM in 2007. Worked there as a CSA. And left the job in same year 2007.
bad,"About the only nice thing about IBM are the vacation days. You get a lot. Management would routinely crow about how well paid we are. Turns out that I was in the 13th percentile for my job, nationally. With salary cuts, elimination of overtime, and the elimination of shift premiums my income has dropped 33% the past two years. The cost of insurance has been skyrocketing the past few years with dwindling coverage. I know many IBMers who have to get a second job to make ends meet. This is IBM and we have to get a second job! No wonder morale is so low and turnover is so high. Don't forget about the twice-a-year layoffs! Avoid this company."
bad,This applies to all contractor positions.  There is very little chance that your responsibilities or compensation will change from what you were hired to do on day one.  This is regardless of your competence or incompetence.  Your options are to continue working in your current role or find a new job.
bad,"Good co-workers"
bad,"extremely, a project based on managing with different types of errors, and having a enhancement activity into it"
bad,When there are lot of call flows
bad,IBM espouses virtues such as:
bad,Enjoyed working for IBM until I was laid off without any warning.
bad,"IBM used to be a great place to work until they decided they needed to outsource all the jobs. There used to ""respect for the Individual"" , their motto, until that point. After that management started treating people like they could do no right. It's one thing to need to eliminate jobs, benefits, pensions, etc., but you don't have to treat your employees like they are dirt. I would never recommend my recent college grad to apply for a job with them as they will bleed you dry and then throw you to the curb 2 - 5 years before you reach full retirement. Since the mid 90s a depressing place to work for living in fear of losing your job, being treated like dirt."
bad,"Sem nenhuma consideração com o funcionário ou seu futuro profissional, imediatismo total!!!"
bad,"Very demanding, but when you reach your 50's be prepared to be layered off."
bad,Was outsourced to IBM who subsequently laid off almost the entire team that was brought over as part of the effort. Billing hour expectations were beyond unreasonable.
bad,"High paced stressful environment where scope creep is chronic and outdated management fight new rising business practices. Train you to be AGILE, but implementation is against policy."
bad,Work culture is not good but timing is very good. Not recommended to go and work. Partially in work. Seniority in a work culture. Recommend not to join
bad,"Although my manager was great, the overall experience was a disappointment. When they bought the company I worked for, we were making a profit. After a few years with IBM, the product and customers were neglected to the point where IBM got rid of at least 50 percent of our staff. My group was affected even more so. Only one out of 7 people was left to sustain the workload. It's a great place if you're young and need to get experience. But, don't expect to live out your career there. The older you get, the more likely you are to be part of the next round of layoffs. Get the experience, then find a better place to work."
bad,"Typical day 8 - 5 work day"
bad,old technology. approval driven.  don't feel like I'm making a difference.  Monitored alot on time.  too many on-line classes that don't pertain to job.
bad,"IBM has laid off so many older employees that it has resulted in class action law suites across the country."
bad,"The company has lost it's engineering edge.  It's mission now is financial engineering vs. creating great products.  Buy a company and mike it, the only innovation is in marketing speak, not product."
bad,Not a good place to work.   I felt as if I was just a number at this company.  It was not easy making personal relationships with coworkers.  Everyone is spread out across multiple countries so it is hard to make connections.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Minimum I can say here is that there are several Facebook sites devoted to how bad it is to work here. Jobs are relocated to India, project managers are apathetic. Managers are checked out."
bad,"What Matters Most For IBM Corporate Management?  Profit"
bad,Sales engineer : training seulement. Formation de départ.
bad,"Poorly led, No vision - Company doesn't care about staff or customers.  Customers are regularly screwed over and contracts breached.  Staff are treated as expendable."
bad,"It all sounds good on paper, but its just assembly line work.  No creativity, no though, just get ticket process ticket.  People were confused, process was weak and undefined.  Top talent did the work, others coasted."
bad,IBM has changed a lot since I first started there. Lots of cost were pushed down directly to the employee and benefits were reduced or cut entirely. Management was a good ole boy system and often folks who should have been let go were saved. Layoffs twice a year made it increasingly hard to complete assigned work load and you get to a point where the environment was very depressing.
bad,Too Big couldn't get anything approved without jumping through thousand of hoops. Bad bad management incompetence. nothing free even coffee. facility falling apart
bad,"I am currently a full time IBMer, I actually love my job but dislike the company.  They have made it clear time and time again they care more about stock prices than anything else.  They RA staff, furlough contractors and have the gull to give the CEO (as nice and pleasant as she is) a 17 million dollar raise with 8 consecutive quarters of loss on the stock.  The morals, or lack there of, of upper/middle management are unlike any others.  They won't hesitate to get rid of large quantities of staff to save on costs at the expense of all the other workers in those departments, that are usually already overworked.  They constantly cut programs that increase employee satisfaction as well as constantly decreasing what they cover thru medical benefits.  "
bad,"Poor communication skills from management; quota-oriented for Tech Support staff, bad culture if the management is Chinese, they don't care about the safety of their staff, little knowledge of  labor code.It feels like a sweatshop in China."
bad,"IBM is an OK company to work for, Nothing special unless you get a great manager to support. The rest is just fluff to fulfill this needless exercise. That's it."
bad,"The management was either micro managing or non-existent. We were thrown on the phone with little to no training when we were promised a months worth to prepare. They also expected you to pay for parking and it was one the most soul-sucking, un-enjoyable jobs I have ever taken, even over fast food positions."
bad,Was told this was going to be a contract to hire as full-time but the promise was never kept. I don't recommend anyone to work here. Always layoffs looming around the corner. Not much to learn and grow technological career either. Just  high talk and unnecessarily complex and twisted ways of doing things.
bad,"IBM's revenue has now fallen for 20 quarters in a row and the CEO is still at the helm of the Titanic! It's already hit the iceberg and laying at the bottom of the ocean! IBM wants to make their money being the worlds largest patent holder. They would rather buy up companies for the patents they hold then create their own. They've sold off as much hardware business as anyone would buy. The others like the Mainframe and Storage die a slow painful death. They have this crazy model of culling off the bottom 10% of employees. Eventually your number will be called. When your boss gives you a poor review or they jack your quota up- You know it's time to start looking. We had more managers on my team than actual workers. They would rather hire from outside than allow you to go to another group. They say it's a company where ""Good people go to die""!"
bad,Involuntary layoffs upon reaching retirement age.  Layoffs without allowing other internal positions.  Layoffs without regard to performance reviews or relocation options.
bad,"IBM does not only offer education and development courses for employees, it mandates them to the extent that one can almost never work an 8 hour day or take a full weekend off."
bad,"IBM, once a great innovator, has transitioned to a services company and is too focused on making a quarterly profit rather than on long term R&D and technological innovation."
bad,Don’t waste your time working for a has been...Go with the FAANG companies. IBM missed the boat.  Last time they reported “good” earnings was a case of good running accounting!!
bad,"I am a senior top performance IT professional with over 20 years of experience in the Canadian and"
bad,"You give your heart and soul to a company for 22 years and they kick you to the curb at the drop of a hat.  After 22 years of hitting utilization targets and all years as an Associate Partner hitting Sales and Delivery targets, I get get caught up in an RA because I happen to be on the bench when they run a report.  Heartbreaking.  Products and offerings are all marketing and going downhill.  Only a matter of time before their reputation painstakingly built over the last 100 years is in ashes."
bad,"MAJOR change over last few years.   IBM Used to have long term health of their employees top of mind.  Those days are long gone.  "
bad,I was put into a job that I had no business being in despite my numerous requests to continue doing that job I have experience in.  This company spends too much time managing upward to make finance people happy. There is no thought to ones career or career trajectory.
bad,"Treats sales people horribly. No regard for human dignity.  Constantly 'balancing' the workforce (firing people).  On three different occasions, refused to pay commissions over 100K."
bad,"There pay rate is extremely low, the amount of work people do they dont pay according to that . The management is also very bad they dont interact and help there technician"
bad,IBM is not the company it once was.  Senior management has lost their commitment to customers by constantly breaking account relationships.  Employees are just numbers and are expendable.
bad,"Top performer, no advancement in years, no comp time for working nights and weekend. Paid 25K under industry average. Was a much better in previous years. Management disengaged. Look elsewhere."
bad,"I can't even tell you about the hordes of people I've personally known and met over the years that all had horror stories to tell from their experience at this place. IBM was nothing more than a tech support megastructure that housed a thousand people with an unbelievable turnover rate. You had to be in your seat 3 minutes before your start minute- down to the second. Your computer has to be powered on and logged into windows. Your programs all have to be running at your start minute. If you find yourself logging in before you're ready to take calls, you're penalized. If you log in one minute over your start time, you're penalized. 3 offenses equals termination. 3...2...1... Back to Indeed..."
bad,No hay equilibrio vida laboral/social ademas que la remuneracion esta por debajo de la competencia
bad,"Horribly managed company. "
bad,"IBM has had 21 quarters of revenue decline and are drifting in the wind, trying to find new business and products to fill their revenue needs. The strategy that they have taken is to pay only for hot skilled and executive talent, and to move most other jobs to where they can be done at the cheapest possible cost. "
bad,It is a place where the job security is missing and very difficult to demonstrate your qualification because every 4 or six month you get a new manager.
bad,Not a good place to work.  Very poor promotion opportunities as well as job placement.  Working for was the worst the job opportunity I have had in many years.
bad,"new policies and trainings so on"
bad,There is no good leadership at the company IBM/SETERUS. They do not allow the employees to be heard. They too micro management. They show a lot of favoritism.
bad,"Not a place for people who wish to learn something. Work is majorly of supporting US projects. Also, it is of kind which they won't do for such small price."
bad,"Stressful work environment in taking calls in call center environment with talking with difficult customers. Also, the quality assurance metrics for all calls taken or received is ridiculous in trying to keep some consistency because every call is basically different unless it is a collections call for payments to be applied to customer accounts."
bad,The people are still great and the culture (or what remains of it ) is still great...  but the management has effectively destroyed everything else post Lou running things...
bad,Everything going nice but I have learn something new  and improved my communication skills  work experience  new things new atmosphere and people characters
bad,"Enjoyable part was learning new stuff.  Equipment is old and slow, some major programs kept crashing. Was an interesting job, but everyone lives in fear of their jobs being eliminated."
bad,IBM is not the company it used to be. Poor management support and lack of opportunities. IBM in general is not going in the direction. The earning numbers tell the story.
bad,"This is not the IBM you've known in the past.  Integration of acquisitions has been done poorly.  Management takes no responsibility for the state of affairs nor for future direction.  "
bad,"Good starting salary. Management is clueless and working with other team especially ones from purchased companies is difficult if not impossible cough cough softlayer. Deadlines and requirements are constantly changing. Lay offs happen roughly once a year in the spring. Bonus are nonexistant. 200 pretax with a pbc 2 at band 6."
bad,"Average place to work. Lack of management & useless work pressure."
bad,"This job with suck the life right out of you and there is no room to grow. "
bad,The company has been on a steady progression downhill and that has reflected over the years as they continue to care less and less about their actual employees. Much lip service occurs but truly most management has very little relationship with their employee's and furthermore have very little say - so or power to help you advance your career. If you value your skills or career this is not a great place to build a long term career.
bad,"Old CEO cut development to an empty shell to milk the customer base.   For some reason that has resulted in the customer base fleeing the company.   New CEO has not restored funding to base products, but is moving into new areas ... big gamble."
bad,If you are not a college grad engineer you will not be a IBM'r. If it is not being done by a contractor then it is off-shore
bad,Too bureaucratic. Very little opportunity for advancement.
bad,it's not a secure place to be right now. benefits were good. Most of the people I worked with were great.
bad,"•	Acted as a single point of contact for IBM in client’s location for SAP ERP implementation projects and ensured implementation with zero deviation. "
bad,always on the phone trying to collect payments from customers on past due mortgages
bad,This company is good for those who wish to break into the IT Industry.
bad,"If your not a programmer, don't work here. You dispensable. They throw ""reg"" tickets at the most undeserving individuals & make promises but under deliver, keeping individuals as ""supplementals"" forever."
bad,"•	Liaise with cross-functional initiative to achieve IT Service Delivery and Service restoration for the defined SLA for the Banking Customer by managing major, critical incidents, publishing MIR for RCA analysis for Problems."
bad,"Working at IBM Global Service was a good thing for me. I worked on an account(Retail) that IBM has as a Customer. A typical night for me was making sure that the requirements stated in the contract was met at a timely manner. I've learned the ends and out about Point Of Sales and End of Day processing in a Retail environment. The hardest part of the job was, when time waited on no one when you had a problem that was taking a long time to fix. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you met the deadline for this customer. My co-workers were great, it like we became adopted families,."
bad,Some of the teams and products at IBM are the finest and you could learn lots of new things everyday. However there are some teams which are legacy products and you could get stuck doing out-of-market technology and tools. They are very investor friendly and getting any hikes could be a real challenge and their salary is not to the industry standard ( as far as Software Engineering positions are concerned ). However you will have a very good work life balance except during product release time..
bad,"Looking for job in the profile as in my Resume."
bad,"This used to be a great place to work 20 years ago but no longer. I was in Corporate and we worked 60 hours a week, including xmas eve. Management will work you to death and then your job will go overseas. HR is never helpful if you need them. Everyone is so worried about losing their job, some co-workers will stab you in the back to save themselves. Every year is the same message (for 10 years now), IBM is not making that much so your yearly bonus is very small (or your raise). If you have the wrong manager, then life is not good. It used to be easy to move around but its no longer so. Because of budget cuts, you can only move within your organization because other orgs cannot add another headcount internally. There are many places to work. Go to one that will appreciate you."
bad,dont do it..IBM has nothing to do with this job...it's ALL seterus! Dont do it..ask somebody..it's hood too!!
bad,Very great if you are given the right team and job placement. The main reason I am trying to leave the company is because the lack of respect for career development. It is a money business rather than for employee business.
bad,"Unreliable, takes forever to get paid (MONTHLY after finishing a month). Can be dropped WITHOUT notice. I would avoid this company."
bad,"The regional manager and director of operations are very shady people. They undermine everyone and don't give people a fair chance for promotion. Most of their decisions are illegal for instance, overlooking a candidate for a position because they are on short term disability. I highly advise not to work in the Dallas area for IBM."
bad,"IBM uses contractors for most of their work, they do not care about them and lay them off very often, they also reduce their pay and cut their hours....."
bad,"Upper Management is by and large unhelpful and very limited prospects for advancement."
bad,"When you reward mundane engineers for uninspired, not-invented-here behavior rather than producing a good product, maintain a thick layer of incompetent middle managers, and have top management that believes the yes-men it has surrounded itself with, you have a sad and unpleasant place to work...assuming you wanted to actually work."
bad,"Combine lack of product vision with lack of leadership and investment in employee development, it’s not a recipe for success and no longer a place suitable for long term career growth."
bad,"IBM wants the world to think it's a 21st century company - all communications are via some form of social network.  However, they are actually firmly entrenched in the 1990's.  Jump into an industry you know nothing about and can't grasp?  Lay off the very workers that could pull you out the mess you made!"
bad,"Demands of you are unreasonable. Its discussed openly that its not work/life balance...its ""work/life integration""."
bad,"Zero job security...for anyone. Constant layoffs.  Way, way too much bureaucracy. Very poor management team....and it starts at the top."
bad,Middle managers were more concerned with their own promotions than with helping their teams. There was no clear way to talk to someone about middle management issues.
bad,"Executive leaders compensated almost entirely on profit, not revenue growth (Wall Street analyst reports confirm this and have even called for changes in compensation and governance), so layoffs are every year, if not twice a year. And they happen even in strategic growth areas where the company should be investing, not just the legacy hardware and service businesses. Also, the company doesn't invest what is needed to make most business lines successful, either in development staff or marketing funding."
bad,"Not much to say. The company isn't competitive in today's market, and forces its employees to sell products that the market does not want. The CEO also is very insensitive to important issues like storing and sharing personal data on social media."
bad,"Very bad experience with IBM, no growth rate. Treat employees as slaves. No technically important work provided. Managers feel they are gods and treat employees like monkeyes"
bad,"Management was non-existent and very inexperienced.  It's a shame because IBM has potential, but I don't think they are going to sustain in the future."
bad,"Where to start? Upper management is misguided. Culture is non existent, everyone hanging on for dear life until the next round of layoffs which come every half. Systems are outdated and archaic. No room for advancement, there is either a ""hiring freeze"" or no headcount available. They have systematically ruined every acquisition they have made, so the products are now horrible. Cloud does not work, no real strategy. Watson is a failure. Stay away from here. Only pro is work life balance-if you get the right manager. Salaries are fairly competitive too. Not your fathers IBM anymore...they are in trouble."
bad,"Declining revenues and hyper aggressive cost cutting have created a near constant state of layoffs among the sales organization that don't get advertised.  Sales leadership is perpetually in crisis management and near constant state of stress.  Each quarter the sales organization is thinned, account assignments are moved, and product portfolio's are re-organized around who is left.  For any given account, they can have as many as 4 different sellers change out over a 1 to 2 year period as the sales group goes through a near constant state of re-org.  The IBM culture is one that views sales reps as interchangeable parts with no regard to relationships when making staffing or account re-assignments.  Many if not most of the existing sales team is either newly hired college ""summit hires"" with less than 5 years of experience, or, those who have been there longer and constantly looking over their shoulder to see if they will be impacted by one of the continuing rounds of layoffs taking place.  For a long period of time, many of the sales team being let go were 45 and over - more tenured and higher paid sellers.    Whenever you get two or more IBMers together the conversation is guaranteed to turn to the drop in morale among the sales teams, shoddy culture and employees not feeling valued.  Unfortunately, this is not your father's IBM."
bad,IBM I've be moved. Worst company to work for they buy out jobs from other company's.I was working for American Express untill IBM took over. It was ok in the beginning untill they started down sizing and letting everyone go.
bad,The work is easy but incredibly dull. Managers have no interest in your career progression. The smart ones don't stick around for more than 2 years...
bad,"The days of the old ""Blue chip"" IBM are over. All work that can be pushed out to India is gone. You will have no recourse. the will make you redundant after years of service with the basic government minimum. the culture is one of dog eat dog. IBM have not innovated anything in the last ten years. They are on a vertical slope into oblivion. China will soon buy up the entire company for buttons. Even the IBM pension fund has sold its IBM shares. The hardest part of the job is seeing customers not get what they pay for due to the inane and circular Indian support. The most enjoyable part has long gone and IBM as you know it will cease to exist. It will become a parody and nostalgia brand  item to feature on Chinese tablets. if you need a job and can force your way in just to put that once proud name on your CV then do so but keep looking since your tenure is liable to be shorter than a candle in the dark."
bad,"Management : pas de contrôle ; ne tient pas ses engagements"
bad,"IBM has a lot of great people, but it's a really big ship so change takes a long time, I had a lot of success helping customers grow their business and improve services with IBM's solutions, the clients are worked with were great!  It was assume to learn about so many great enterprises and people."
bad,"IBM is a company in decline, sadly all that was good is gone. The good don't get rewarded and the bad seem to thrive as they play the game and move from job to job (as is the companies want) so they are never held accountable for their mistakes. No salary rises in 6 years without any sort of explanation or apology."
bad,". Work is monotonous, once you tag to one technologies moving up in the chain is tough. Technological growth is very less. Management is not responsive all are short sighted."
bad,IBM used to be a great place to work with a good work life balance.  The management does not appreciate the employees and wants to suck the blood out of you.
bad,"Leadership at the upper levels has created an environment of little to no trust.  Hard work and dedication are rewarded inconsistently, if at all.  Stay away from this employer."
bad,It was a scary place to work as there are constant lay offs never sure if your going to have a job tomorrow it is not safe they. it really is not a good environment
bad,"Extremely poor management.  Company is moving into a direction that no one completely understands and there is no plan to get there that is articulated to its consultants in any meaningful way.  Basically, everyone must figure it out for themselves and a path to get into the new organization or leave.  The good consultants are all leaving on their own or being let go."
bad,"Upper-level management is out of touch with the personnel who are down in the trenches doing the real work. Communication of vision and strategy is almost non-existent. Too much bureaucracy!"
bad,"Being re-organized every three months with stealth layoffs. Laying off staff with quantities lower the what is required to report. Jobs are going to India. Target is 80% India labor, 20% US labor. Funny thing is, the more jobs are going to India, the lower the company's revenue. Clearly, executive management is failing at running this company."
bad,"Minimal support from management. Flexible schedules, low salaries, expect a lot from you. Hard to find mentors. Bad culture to be part of. If you're an individual who likes to collect pay cheques and not care about anything else then IBM is best for you."
bad,"This is big company and it should be one of the best places to work. Unfortunately working for a Delivery Center is not good place to develop your skills. Daily activities are focus on ""ticket"" activities. "
bad,"Gone are the days of innovation and customer-centricity.  I'm sure some divisions of IBM still respect these values, but STG (Systems and Technology Group) somehow has lost its way.  "
bad,"With out getting into to much detail (afraid a rant will ensue) this place looks for a ""culture fit"". They are not concerned with the quality of designer or the work that gets done. Bar is set very low as far as quality of design. It's not hard to exceed expectations since IBM software is not known for its experience or overall look being well done in the first place."
bad,"not good company in terms of overall career."
bad,"It was a great work life balance where I could manage my own time, work, job with little or no supervision.  Co-workers were home based and very helpful at times.  Found the management team, from Kelly Services/IBM, not helpful most times.  You were left to ""sink or swim"", and when taking steps to be proactive, were reprimanded.  As a temporary employee, not given the same treatment.  I was asked to cross train a new person (male), in August 2011, which I did.  I was then told a week later, my contract was up.  I later found out that this person I trained, a friend of the Director at IBM.  They had a personal connection, and I reported this insubordination and discrimination to IBM executives, so that it didn't happen again.  No reply, or acknowledgement from IBM, or Kelly Services.  My manager at Kelly, was fully aware of this situation, and did nothing to assist me.  I am 58 years old now, hard to find any job, age is definitely a factor.  "
bad,"I have 5 years of years in Finance and Accounts"
bad,"Typical date starts from 7am~8pm, whole day in chat room also on phone conference call with your team till your manager told you can drop"
bad,"Overall rating                                   low"
bad,"it is a place where work is fine but pay was not"
bad,"IBM Management in Dallas has great employees but the Management is nit picky and demanding. As contract workers IBM should not give direct orders to contract workers nor ask personal questions regarding other employees. I haven't been there for two years but have several friends who say things have not changed and the pay increases were less than 20 cents/hour. Poor problem solving skills by IBM,"
bad,"empresa solo para aprender, la gente es muy amable, lo unico malo es que por los siglos de los siglos perteneces a Kelly"
bad,"Empresa estressante; excesso de hora extra; plano de carreira fraquíssimo; difícil ser promovido; gerências fracas; sistema de trabalho baseado na competição entre colaboradores com avaliações feitas por meio de produtividade, mas não necessariamente meritocrática; bons benefícios e flexibilidade (possibilidade de homeoffice quando justificável)"
bad,There is no job security with IBM. If they can offshore or outsource your job they will! Do not depend of this company for a long term career! Insurance benefits are ridiculously expensive if you have a family.
bad,The direction changes almost every year and it was difficult to mange the expectations. Management constantly changed to prevent continuity for projects.
bad,IBM's been on a downward spiral for over a decade.  There is no long term vision and the strategic direction of the company is constantly changing. Every quarter for the past 10 years employee's are let go in order to keep IBM going.  There is no real growth for the company.
bad,"Very poor management. They got rid of all Walgreens management and didn't know how to assimilate the Walgreens technicians into IBM's work place.  "
bad,"The Extreme Blue program is an interesting idea that is poorly executed. I was placed in a team of 4 interns (1 business, 3 technical) and given an idea for a new IBM product that we had to create a proof of concept for. There was too much pitching and arguing over product decisions for my liking. Working in a team of interns haphazardly hired and little oversight or support didn't work well for most teams. The Markham office is extremely drab and is located way too far from downtown Toronto. Outside of Extreme Blue, IBM is using interns instead of full-times because they want cheaper labour. A lot of the management doesn't trust/respect their employees. There are almost no perks, aside from the recent and extremely limited snack program. (You have to queue once a day in order to get a limit of 2 snacks.) The median age is probably 40~50. So many people have been working there for 15, 20, 30 years. This is not a place to have fun or work on something exciting. It's like the company exists to suck up to clients. I don't know how anyone has any enthusiasm for this company."
bad,"Not impressive, not impressed. I never understood what the mission was, what people in this were expecting from me. Nonetheless, I am grateful that I worked there because I now know in which environment I should not operate."
bad,"Wish as many as seven levels of management between the CEO and me, I felt completely removed from upper levels of management."
bad,"After 40 years on the job, I taught my replacement in India and told to find another job. Having to look for a new consulting job and move to a different city every couple months after leaving in the same city for 63 years."
bad,There are a great many things I could say about IBM.  They don't get end users.  They don't understand software.  They over-market and under-deliver.  The company strategy is unclear.  Etc.
bad,long hard no work life balance furloughed 30 days with 1 day notice twice in 4 months. A typical day was very challenging and management was not helpful.
bad,"At first I was very excited to start working for IBM as it is a major IT company. I quickly realized it was the equivalent of a working for technology sweatshop.  Ridiculous workloads with under market pay and empty promises from upper management. I'm fine with putting in the extra hours when needed, but at IBM it was expected that you regularly put in at least 50 hrs a week and if you couldn't it was reflexed on your annual review. No life/work balance at IBM, it was strictly work/work balance."
bad,"Negotiated contract Lead Developer position at IBM for RBC eApp project via The Employment Solution recruiting agency. Interview with end client (RBC) went well and they were ready to sign an offer but only if I drop already negotiated rate by 2 dollars per hour. I have refused since rate has been negotiated and confirmed several times. Client disappeared for two weeks. Possibly looked for cheaper candidate. Then client (RBC) requested second interview. Second interview went well and offer has been received. All paper work required several days. Once everything has been ready, end client (RBC) requested to drop already negotiated rate by 10 dollars per hour. I ended up process."
bad,enjoyable experience.. good workplace culture. the hardest part of the job for me was wanting perfection in my results. Th most enjoyable part of the job was delivering to the client the best possible results.
bad,"It is a great company to start your career with. But after you reach intermediate level seniority, please leave the company. They will not give you salary increment or promotion."
bad,"There are some fantastic people at IBM, absolutely wonderful.  The first line managers I've had there, the good to exceptional have outweighed to bad at least 4 to one.  "
bad,"Avoid offers from GBS and GTS. Join only if offered from research wing, don't expect good hike, There will be good work-lige balance. Suitable for ladies with kids"
bad,"IBM has gone from a positive productive place to work, to one that is punitive and bureaucratic.  IBM just imposed a 'co-location' policy where NA marketing professionals must be located in one of six designated cities/hubs.  Most of these required employees to move.  I have heard that up to 80-90% of employees did not move and will be out of jobs by years end, or next summer if they received an extension."
bad,"Encouragement to learn is a lot there."
bad,"If you've been around too long or make too much money, you will not be around very long.  Leadership has no strategic vision for making the company profitable again.  IBM's most valuable resource - its people - have been minimized and forced out the door as more and more jobs are offshored.  Not a safe environment.  There is no work/life balance.  You are expected to work 24x7.  Until new leadership is installed at IBM and they get back to valuing the kind of employees who can make the company great again, I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"I’ve worked at IBM for ~10 years on three different occasions, each time I was working for the consulting division.  Overall I have a very negative opinion of the company.  "
bad,"Working in IBM China is enjoyable but tired. You need to prepare for the extra working without and compensation. I love my colleagues and the working environment of IBM. However, I think the upper level managers need to pay more attention and care more about their employees instead of focusing on profit only."
bad,I enjoy working as a DBA and interact with my clients and peers. Management has not much interaction with the team since they manage multiple accounts. It is the team Leads who run the show.
bad,"Very little employee focus, all the management decisions are based around reducing people expenses and increasing their margins. "
bad,"The money is great and thats about it. Management are project managers are typically clueless, non-technical but yet make decisions and directions even though they dont have a good grasp of the task at hand."
bad,"Good Team player  & floor support and solving employee issue and providing update and quality issue .Giving feedback about quality and training  for new joinees"
bad,"Good for learning and flexible work culture."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"•	Consulted clients in virtualization with workload consolidation opportunities on power systems"
bad,"Deja j'etais avec un soucontracteur et j'ai fais un contrat avec IBM, j'ai pas aime la culture, c'est une environnement sexiste que ne supporte pas les femmes vraiment, j'ai pas eu de soutien de mon patron, j'ai quitte apres deux mois de travail."
bad,"Good for your resume coming out of college. Put in a few years, use any opportunity to improve your skill set and then find a new job outside the company. "
bad,"IBM is like a recruiting agency. Only difference is that if you're not on a project, you will still get paid. Once you get hired, you will still need to interview for other projects. The managers do not help with preparing people for those interviews. If I knew about this before hand, I wouldn't have taken this job. Bad training as well. Only had two weeks of training. You might be hired for one thing, but after you start, you might find out that you will be doing something different."
bad,Used to be a great place to work when I first arrived 12 years ago.  Now it is motivated by wall street and trying to keep the stock up.
bad,Night Shift - big problem for health.
bad,There are few reasons why people work
bad,Not a good experience working in IBM. Not happy with the roles and responsibilities. Management is not able to justify Band with roles and responsibilities given. Typical day at work is like less work usually. The hardest part of this job was to find suitable roles which justify the Band given. Work life balance is good usually. My learning curve after joining IBM got exponentially down.
bad,"People are very set in their ways, they don't support development of younger less experianced individuals even though they hired them on the basis they would need time invested in them."
bad,"En general, la burocracia de IBM ralentiza el crecimiento dentro de la empresa, las promociones son lentas y tardadas, las evaluaciones no son imparciales y siempre hay alguien de quien depende todo el proceso."
bad,Not a great place to work. Essentially paid substantially under industry standards just because of who they are. Management tend to micro manage and not let you flourish. They preach for people to think outside the box but what they really want is for people to just be  quiet and do their job.
bad,"Este un loc de munca care iti ofera stabilitate, siguranta."
bad,"IBM talks about being essential, however they lay off anybody, and I mean anybody. They don't seem to really care for their employees, yes there are events that are supposed to boost morale, but the decisions we see made on a daily basis say that they do not really truly care for their employees from a high level."
bad,"IBM says that they value working smarter over working harder, and yet never put it into practice. They frequently resist change, higher management is constantly demanding unrealistic results from the people below them (which trickles all the way down), and there are never enough people for the work that we need to do. It is a common practice for IBM to take on new contracts and instead of hiring the new headcount their contracts provide funds for, just saddle existing employees with the new account - which they have to learn about and then teach others before fixing all of the problems the accounts come in with. So, someone somewhere else in IBM profits and their employees just become more and more stretched. I spent a large portion of my time trying to make this environment tolerable by standardizing documentation and writing procedures, and no one ever enforced them. They demanded them, and then ignored them until there was a fire that they had to put out - and turned to me and asked why no one was using them. The environment is toxic and unrealistic, and I was only sad to leave because it meant I had to move out of my hometown to find another job in my field. I certainly do not miss the stress. They're constantly changing their mode of thinking and re-organizing the business to try to provide better service when the previous one hadn't even been fully implemented yet. Having more people would've solved the majority of their problems, but even though they were always 'hiring' they weren't actually bringing anyone in. The job postings are farces because IBM executives don't"
bad,"Extremely polarized culture with low values in treating employees fairly. Old school culture makes it very rigid and bureaucratic introducing inefficiencies.  To avoid fair severance package for downsizing (not based on the performance but only because of over hiring and miscalculating the future growth), IBM without even giving personal evaluation ever, gave me lay off notice. In fact, I had exceeded the goals given to me but I was only considered as one headcount to be reduced at the end of the day. I admit they hired me with above average package to steal me from the previous company. Ethically they were wrong to let go people giving the right reasons. The internal systems are old (they are still on Lotus Notes) and the internal processes are cumbersome. Leadership has great credentials and can pull off amazing case studies and relationships."
bad,I feel that the instability began when other computer companies came in place let Dell and HP which could sell their products much cheaper with the same functions.
bad,"Technical Sales at IBM is a great job, except for them constantly shrinking the number of technical people at IBM. It's depressing watching your friends and peers get laid off every quarter."
bad,"Good work life balance and salary.  However, job cuts are EVERY QUARTER.  Health benefits cost more to employees every year, yet they cover less EVERY YEAR."
bad,"Good place to advance, no work life balance for the culture, Bad management, Good pay and benefits, very reactive company"
bad,"very driven by gross profit margin, little regard to critical teams"
bad,Trabalhei 5/6 anos na IBM e não gostei.
bad,I´m Sr . Exchange and AD Admin I work for IBM Argentina from the last 7 years
bad,They will hire you under false pretenses. I was hired as a banker and ended up doing a dual role as a teller. I found this out my first day at the branch. This was totally different from what I interviewed for. The manager was all over the place and the associates at the branch were very unpleasant and there was a lack of team work.
bad,"This slow moving company is far too bureaucratic and political. The group I worked in had a ton of potential, but, the rest of the organization was unwilling to adapt with the times. "
bad,Enjoyed the people I worked with but did not like the constant travel and long hours. Very hard to get staffed on projects and roles that actually progress your skills and career.
bad,IBM has a lot of older employee's which they are working to weed out discretely through resource actions. IBM is trying to reinvent itself into a younger culture while disregarding the people who invested years of their lives into IBM. Everyone is in constant fear of being let go from the company.
bad,"IBM has stopped being a cutting edge business, leading the charge into the next IT development. Now it seems to be more interested in selling off its assets and business to other countries."
bad,"Work life balance is there"
bad,It is great pleasure working in company like IBM. I got lot of opportunities to improve my skills and knowledge. Handling employee Transportation at Multiple locations.
bad,nice experience with company.. very good culture.. nice environment. good people.. good learning location for all the new emp.. lot of things learnt from here. managing people is very nice thing learnt in this company. overall good experience

bad,Work & Life Balanced but No Career Progression. Work politics a lot.
bad,"Vivência muito boa na empresa, mas sem qualquer tipo de incentivo e muito menos plano de carreira para o funcionario."
bad,working for Seterus was very draining and a lot of the teams i had worked for many of the top producers looked for different places of employment due to the atmosphere in the company and how unprofessional team members and management can be.
bad,"Bad employer.  No paid time off, despite pretending it is available.  You must bill 44+ hours per week.  If you take a week of vacation, you must make up those hours (preferably ahead of the vacation)."
bad,"IBM used to be a phenomenal company but slowly, benefits have been taken away with the latest being working remotely.  Employees now have to move across the country if they want to keep their jobs.  I don't understand the direction they are going and wish those that are left only the best."
bad,"As my first job, I learned quite a bit -- mainly through other people's mistakes."
bad,Worked under System Service Engg For 1 Year.iam happy in that work while joining in Fresher after my carrier i changed my profile in to IBM info in IT field . iam satisfied need to learn about server's and networking basic knowledge shared with my colleague...
bad,"In the last my employees I did support and maintenance over 100 servers and 25000 clients in National Bank Canada 70% users spoke only France language, plus 75 servers in Alberta treasure grope and 15000 users. My team did full migration in this sites from Window 2003 and Linux enterprise to Windows 2008 R2 servers. And 70% servers was in VMware and Hyper-V virtual systems. We did installation and continue deployment Citrix Presentation servers in NB and in Omers. I and my team did installation and in continue management, support and maintenance BES-5 in all us sites."
bad,This was from 2007 to 2011 - they gave no increments to anyone in the whole LIMIC department - there was high attrition when I was there. Heavy politics.
bad,IBM has been cleaning house for a while with lots of layoffs. Jobs are uncertain and people are very stressed about it. Morale is low and management isn't doing anything about it.
bad,"Since IBM bought Red hat they are cutting expenses in order to recover the money wasted in the deal, this is why they are laying off thousands of workers around the world, they micromanage a lot and the CEO is taking the worst bussiness decision, the company as a whole is very unstable."
bad,"IBM has a very bad culture, everything depends on a manager. A person has no voice everything goes only through the manager. Workers are not appreciated and their interests are at the lowest priority. Training is not paid for. Lay-offs are very common."
bad,"They promote upon seniority, not knowledge.  They constantly are outsourcing jobs...2 different of my jobs were outsourced.  5 days before I would have been vested for retirement funds, they laid me off."
bad,"IBM has been in the process of sending US jobs overseas for at least 5 years.  US employees know its only a matter of time that their number is going to come up.  ""When"" not ""if"" you get laid off.  IBM has also been reducing employee benefits along with severance packages, which basically are non-existent."
bad,"Unless you buy in into the entire ""IBMer"" Kool-Aid, they treat you very unfairly.  They refuse to take any HR action when someone is reported for bullying, harassing and demeaning attitude"
bad,"Losing market share and market cap because management has been slow to react to market demand and can't market their way out of a wet paper bag. Now desperately selling of parts of the company, and downsizing in hordes."
bad,"Nothing much to say, they're outsourcing every job they can for cheap labor.  Not a secure place to work. No stability with this company. Very unorganized as well."
bad,Read the STAT articles.  Business people using technology to solve a healthcare problem.  If the technology worked you would never read about the problems in the press.
bad,"IBM has a good reputation and it's trying to live by its rules. "
bad,"I used to work in IBM India .It is a very good company to work and enhance your career."
bad,This company has a great reputation from the outside in but is draining and has not evolved. Minorities still aren't afforded the same opportunity as the majority.
bad,I have yet to meet an employee or former employee that has good things to say about IBM.  Poorly managed and more time spent on reports than on focusing on clients and innovation.
bad,IBM has been co-opted by the finance wing of the business. No money for education  of employees. Profit is insured by layoffs. No innovation of product line. Back-stabbing sales force in the U.S. International Sales force much better to work with .
bad,"Managers always want to keep the budget minimum by denying senior associates projects. Not a good place if you are experienced."
bad,"The people in upper management were not qualified. They would lie to potential clients about their employees' level of experience, which eventually caused loss of contracts or clients. Very unorganized."
bad,IBM is no longer the company of the past.  It's a shrinking company with no direction and only short term financial goals.  The company does little for employees.
bad,"I had a great job until IBM decided they are no longer an American company at heart and that Diversity was more important than ensuring competent people where placed in the correct positions. "

bad,"IBM was a very fun and employee oriented company. As the years went on, more emphasis was put on the bottom line and less on employees."
bad,IBM is not a good place to work at all. They do not treat their employees very well. They manage for the next quarter instead of the long term. Both their employees and customers are entirely unsatisfied with IBM's service.
bad,I learned quite a bit with regards to data analysis. The work and the people/coworkers made it a pleasure to go to work every day
bad,Work environment is not that good. Need to spend 12 hours a day in office. But IBM provides huge learning opportunity to all its employees. Very very nice coworkers.
bad,great company but felt insecure kept on consistently laying off all the time.  Too strict but great work life balance benefits not really good

bad,"No good job profile and no motivation to work. Even after talking about career aspirations, there is nothing being done and hence frustrated to work."
bad,"-Proved instrumental in handling the end-to-end project management for Chennai & Bangalore Offices"
bad,"Company was originally acquired by IBM. IBM doesn't really train employees from acquisitions on their software. It is up to you to download the software and ""play with it"". When you apply for jobs internally and coming from an acquisition, you have a leg down on an IBMer who has been there for years, who received the proper training like any new hire would have received. In conclusion, IBM should/need to treat employees from acquisitions like new hires and not like someone who has been there for 30 years."
bad,"IBM Seterus has great managers who truly care about their employees. However, it is a high volume metrics production based environment which leaves no room for a work life balance."
bad,"Empresa com equilíbrio entre a família e emprego, disponibilidade de trabalho home office facilita muito a vida das mulheres e mães."
bad,"trabalho era corrido."
bad," typical day at work"
bad,"pues esta algo ligero pero es recomendable"
bad,"Trabalhei por 2 vezes na IBM terceirizado, gostaria de voltar a trabalhar novamente na empresa, por isso tenho estudado muito o Inglês."
bad,"Nice place to work, friendly atmosphere. Good place to learn and think on the new technologies."
bad,"A typical day at work is like normal day in every working place except for the flexibility and opportunity to learn new technologies."
bad,"Busy, challenging work day with constant opportunity to learn."
bad,"Ensure database is secured.  "
bad,"I have worked with IBM with a vendor payroll, my experience with IBM was totally different from the permanent folks. still worth learning from experiences."
bad,"It should be voluntarily  to write the"
bad,"long working hours,poor management not fun. too much work. no over time. no work life balance. need proper management. need improvement. must take care of the ground engineer"
bad,"I always wanted to work for IBM, growing up, it was similar to playing for the Yankees.  Little did I know that the best days seems are behind them.  The level of inefficiencies is surprising; nothing gets done unless it’s escalated and even then it becomes a pointing of fingers.   Not until it is time to capture income that managers become interested in progress.  I would not recommend"
bad,"This company loves to promise things and never hold up to their promises. No employee reviews or salary reviews. No room to truly grow. Benefits are awful - always ask about everything you get within your benefit package. Make sure everything is in writing. Do not leave until you have everything in writing because if you say, ""it is okay to send it to me later"", they will do no such thing."
bad,"All are know this one for  international company, but this company take employee for contractor only, no guarantee of job one my colleague face this situation, so do not believe this IBM, Salary will not maintain now a situation, if you long term wish work in IBM Company please select on On role position otherwise no carrier no growth..."
bad,"Not a good place as they get rid of you when they don't need you any longer or as soon as their poorly budgeted project over runs its budget."
bad,"typical day is fine"
bad,Bad company to work for now.  Managers could careless about client sat and are all about making short term stock gains. Its sad when a company thrives and then makes terrible decisions that affect so many hard working people. This company is not moving in the right direction.
bad,Entered IBM with high hopes.  I left humbled and determined to build a better life. IBM was once a great company to work for but they are not anywhere close to that today.  A great training program for new sales reps that eventually leave for better firms.
bad,It was good place to work. However there is no  single HR assigned to an Employee. If you have any concern you have to reach out to manager. If you have concerns with manager there is no HR to be reached. Poor HR management.
bad,I enjoy working with computers and technology on a daily basis and enjoy problem solving. Enjoying learning computer technology on a daily basis with no regrets interacting with think icloud machines.
bad,Hi. Pls don't join as FTH employee  or contract employees.. after three years it's only extension. Not giving permanent status.. salary hike is very less when compared to other companies
bad,"When I started working in IBM, back in 1999, I felt privileged and honored.  After 18 years, I watched the company diminished its values on the employees and started treating them like numbers.  I became complacent after the 6th year  working at IBM.  I was passed over for team lead positions, several times and moved around in different accounts involuntary.   My last two years became  a nightmare because I had an incompetent manager who simply micromanaged the team provoking them to quit.  My overall feeling for the company is basically bittersweet."
bad,Low pay lot of work for low pay  these surveys suck and should not be part of a job application.   What is the freaking point of bashing another orgnization.
bad,"IBM offers no stability or does not build a feeling of loyalty among its people. Rather than focusing on work, one is more focused on just keeping one's job."
bad,"The IBM Daksh work environment was not at all employee friendly "
bad,"I liked working at this job, but every job is for every person. Go and apply and you will see if you like the job or not. Never listen to other peoples opinion."
bad,"Good opportunities for freshers. Internal job postings are very well maintained, employees are given trainings at various levels to ensure growth at every point."
bad,"Long working hours"
bad,new building that required a lot of attention in organizing and figuring out how to run a business. Clients were very difficult to work with and no work life balance
bad,"management not willing to be there for support, work environment was not friendly, stress was high about RAs and unsure if you had a job when you came into work that day. Because of the stress of trying to keep working, co workers not always willing to share information. "
bad,"Day start with risk, there is no job security in the company. Each project is having its Project Manager and People Manager. During the appraisal of employee. Employee performance will not be taken into consideration. The decision of Project Manager is final. If the employee belongs to the same region where Project Manager belongs, then that employee will be given more weight-age during  the appraisal. Even if that employee performance is average in delivering duties."
bad,"ujawnię na rozmowie kwalifikacyjnej.Dodam, że nie trzeba wykształcenia pedagogicznego, skończonych studiów ze stosunków międzynarodowych aby widzień, że jest źle."
bad,"Il lavoro non è fra i meglio pagati, lo stimolo arriva dall'insegnamento e da null'altro."
bad,"While IBM was once a company to aspire to, now it is just a dinosaur trying to stay relevant . The stock is at an all time high but it is all smoke and mirrors. 19 quarters of revenue loss really tells the story. The only thing it has going for it was the work life balance but they are eliminating any work from home or summer hours. The management is not smart and there is no career development. "
bad,"Trabalho sobrecarregado."
bad,come in on the phone with banks and customer and work side by side with the lawyer to make sure that everything with together for the closing
bad,"The Consulting Management team has been in the computer business for many more years than the client, but, the main problem is that the consulting management team allows the client to call the shots, when the client management does not know enough about proper Software development to manage it. the client should allow consulting management team to use their expertise and the client should stay out of the software development!"
bad,Overwhelming.  Management is cut throat. It is extremely hard to get a shift that you desire.  Co-workers are friendly.  Most enjoyable part is meeting new people.
bad,Unfortunately there is no opportunity to grow within the Company as there is no appropriate scope / exposure provided as a team member to learn and progress. Hence need a change.
bad,"Installing windows and configuration."
bad,My first job
bad,In my opinion if you're going to be the most expensive then you got to be the best. IBM has a great name in the Enterprise world of computing but is squandering that trying to fit into a more modern Enterprise Computing world that is comprised mostly of software packages and not Hardware.
bad,"hired and promoted friends and family."
bad,"at one point, ibm cared be about employees.  that is no longer the case.  don't go there unless you plan on being temporary because you will be.  "
bad,It would be very difficult to convey just how much IBM sucks without providing PII. Boulder Daily Camera published a story about IBM laying off those workers over the age of 40.
bad,"- Low pay, terrible bonus and stock incentive benefits.  "
bad,"Take half as much money and find another role / employer, IBM's culture is not positive . The Clients and the contracts are Management's focus, little opportunity for coaching or mentoring"
bad,"The IBM culture is no longer one of ""respect for the individual"".  The new motto is ""Do as we say"".  After shifting over 75% of US jobs offshore, they try to claim they have many positions open for hire, that is just not the case."
bad,Terrible work culture. No work/life balance. Way below average compensation. If I knew what I was getting myself into when I accepted the job I would have walked out the door on the first day.
bad,"in my particular experience I felt I was poorly served by being forced into accepting an enormous downgrade in salary because of a life situation involving the death of my spouse - basically, they knew i had to stay for a period and took advantage of that knowingly."
bad,I worked there through an agency that told me it was temp to hire. DIdn't find out until the week before it was decided  we were going to be let go that it was only a temp gig
bad,"My company was bought by IBM and the transition to being an employee there was terrible. They were not as helpful as they would like to think they are and they are extremely against any kind of perks for their lower end employees. And by perks I mean no coffee, no kitchen with a sink, etc."
bad,"IBM has been trough many changes and puts their employees through them too almost every quarter.  If you get on a solid path that is great but if you're in a group that is struggling with identity you will get caught in the crossfire....."
bad,"Long hours, little recognition, and no advancement is what you should expect from IBM.  Working with those who have no ambition or take credit for your work is the norm at IBM.  Managers who take credit for doing nothing other then wasting your time with pointless meetings,"
bad,"IBM is good for college grads, but once you hit your late 40's, IBM does whatever it can to lay off.   Stay a few years to gain experience, then jump to a company that appreciates its employees."
bad,"IBM acquired SoftLayer, but maintained SoftLayer pay scales which is nearly 50% less than other companies. Knowledge is not easily attained for growth"
bad,My manager never knew what was going on. Then would blame everyone because he didn't know what he was doing. He would email able an issue he doesn't know. Then ask you the question several times. He made it an unsafe work place.
bad,"IBM conducts lay offs every year focusing on people 50 and above. The culture has changed to interns which is impacting the business, without concern.  Go to the Watching IBM facebook page and more information is detailed there by the workers."
bad,"* busy work days"
bad,"I wouldnt recommend working at the Columbia Delivery Center if you are married or having children or want anything of a work life balance."
bad,"I'd never suggest a friend work here or consider working here.  They treat their people poorly and they treat their customers even worse.  It was a great company once, but, it certainly isn't anymore."
bad,I was a contractor but it is really hard to get a career if you don't enter as an IBMr. Nothing was free in the canteen and I had no benefits (only free GP). I was a quoter (I think this department doesn't exist anymore)
bad,"Work culture, environment and growth is below the average... All of what you get from here is your monthly salary... Even the job security is not here... They will hire you and fire you as per their needs... Not an employee friendly company at all."
bad,"Management as no incentive to assist people in career development.  Hire young kids and work them like dogs, then discard.  Offshore resources (lower cost) are focus."
bad,I said I would never work for IBM before and I would say the same. Just poorly paid and they never care about the employees. Only top management used to make money the rest were all poor.
bad,"we were outsourced from anthem to ibm.  no ,management interaction.  just a bunch of hired hands.  i had always dreamed of working for IBM until I did.  not a pleasant experience. would not recommend"
bad,"Não tive uma boa impressão nessa empresa, as pessoas não tem direcionamento. Gestores mal formados e muito inexperientes."
bad,The services segment of IBM did not provide work life balance or resources to enable the job at hand.  I found it to be a very unfriendly environment toward employees and customers.
bad,"My former manager stated, ""Your perception is YOUR TRUTH.""  Therefore when someone judges you on their own perception, the quality and thoroughness of your work ethic is NOT sufficient.  If ONE (1) manager ""perceives"" you of being a ""challenging resource,"" you will be passed over selection for MANY projects.  70% ""dancing the corporate jig,"" 10% networking, 10% prayers and meditation 10% talent.  It is NOT the 'BIG BLUE MACHINE' of yester years of team environment.    Local CIC (Baton Rouge) would rather hire offshore resources and bring them to US than properly train current US resources."
bad,"I really don't have anything positive to say about IBM, its' culture or the current level of incompetence, nepotism and operational dysfunctional leadership. Strategically the company knows where a=it needs to go but the people driving the ship are futile."
bad,"What can I say?  This is the only company I know of that places their stockholders and their P/E ratio as higher priorities (way higher) than their customers or employees.  "
bad,"I learned alot about the mortgage industry being in the call center in the time I was there. But at the beginning of this year I was notified I had 90 days left before being laid off after 5 years. I appreciated the notice instead of just being let go but I never felt secure in the time I was there. There were not many opportunities for advancement, and the lack of communication from upper management and between departments made it a difficult place to work. The expectations management has for performance are set extremely high and for most are unattainable, which affects your ability to earn incentive."
bad,IBM was good at making hardware and bad at making software.  Terrible leadership lead them to decide to focus on SW.  The hardware people lose benefits and security until they leave on their own.  IBM is dying and I am sorry to see it go.
bad,"Terrible company, only thing they care about is their stock price.  Management is terrible, no vision. No training and travel budgets are all spent on upper management who sit around congratulating themselves for the work of others."
bad,"It was not an ideal place to work, everything was OK but you never feel any enthusiasm. Everything is distant and you never feel a chance to interact with other people."
bad,"No advancement or trainings provided in the job."
bad,I worked there because it was an easy Job while I was in school. They did not have any Advancement for me and was there for three years. Typical day was taking calls and escalating any issues if basic troubleshooting did not work.
bad,Management is disconnected from day to day operations. Low employee moral and even lower pay. Too much overhead and paperwork required for every action.
bad,No advancement opportunities. Managers and supervisors treat employees horrible. Co-workers were all nice. Enjoyed assisting user with technical issues.
bad,"IBM in Wayne couldn't have more anti patterns. It is incredibly dysfunctional. Salaries do not reflect your skill at all. Management is incompetent and useless. On the plus side, IBM does get some good discounts. There is no advancement or merit increases. This has been a really horrible place to work. Other parts of IBM may not be as bad but I will never work for this company again. IBM corporate is lost and confused. They waste a lot of time on senseless things. I expect IBM to have serious problems in the future."
bad,Contractors do not receive any benefits or any paid time off. Regardless of how long you have been with the company. The company has a high turn over rate.
bad,"It is good for fresher to learn and grow."
bad,Poor morale and a great deal of apathy prior to x-series divestiture.
bad,"Don't expect that you can work in consulting for IBM and have a personal or family life. I was able to manage this very well for a couple of years, but unless you live in a big city and you get paid respective to that cost of living, this is not a great culture or fit if you want to have work/life balance during the week!"
bad,"Lot to learn."
bad,A job acquired through third party companies. Survival job for me. Workload is heavy and the pay is low as a contractor. No room for advancement and no pay raise for anyone no matter what you do. Good for experience if you are just starting out other than that no real reason to take this job unless your skills are lacking or there is nothing available out there.
bad,"Empresa com processos demasiadamente burocraticos."
bad,"I joined IBM as French customer service representative for Skype."
bad,"I my work day involved taking onsite service calls. managing parts inventory. Taking online courses to keep skills updated. I was trained on IBM service hardware on servers,blade systems. I became A+ certified working under IBM. I worked on other vendor products such as DELL,HP,NetApp,Cisco"
bad,"nesta empresa a muitos superiores,e nenhum ajuda so mandam."
bad,"EMC modeling was interesting, but with the loss of the focus on hardware development, it's clear to see the EMC skills are not of much use."
bad,"Workload varied from busy to slow, there was not a set pattern. I learned various skills in inventory management."
bad,"IBM used to b a company that everyone would crave to work for. As an IBMer I can tell you that IBM doesn't practice what it preaches. They have great policies for work/life balance and values, but they don't support their own ideas."
bad,It was so much pressure and not good for one who does not know hindhi
bad,"Low pay and disposable people culture in the particular position i was in a healthcare Learning management administrator, defefintely a company where tech support and contract management is a liability."
bad,No opportunity to progress and the management is poor as they look down on you and try to micro manage and blame you for irrelevant things. I am glad I don't work there anymore and wouldn't recommend.
bad,"Work week expanded as more clients were added to workload. Finally left when work weeks levelled out at 80 hrs, with no overtime pay. You definitely learned a lot as you were working all the time."
bad,"After 9+ years of dedicated service and positive service reviews, I received 1raise. Disappointed, and frustrated, it forced me to get a second job. I had positive reviews every year. I have had favorable reports from my clients every quarter. I was passed over for the latest cost of living increase even tho I was stated well under the average in my area."
bad,In IBM GBS projects are understaffed.  The work life balance is questionable. Their yearly review process is tedious and normally results in very little pay increases. Hold out for as much salary as you can in the initial offer process or simply stay away.  Their HQ human resources and recruiting areas does not understand the global business service model and struggle to perform. Worst few years of my career. Went to a competitor and relieved I left.
bad,"To be blunt, IBM is a terrible place to work and a worse place to get salary increases or promotions.  Company culture is simply terrible.  No work/life balance.  Lousy management.  Doing their best to replace older workers with younger workers.  It's a real thing!  I need not go on.  Stay away."
bad,"its good to work in company , but work pressure is  at peak , but its good as helps to develop overall employee working skills and stay confident under real time scenario"
bad,Very stressful place to work. I was working for IBM Global Business Services (working with clients) which I understand is very different from working with IBM.
bad,"If IBM can make a buck by letting you and thousands of others like you go, they will.  They will insist on loyalty... give up vacation time for the project, etc, but will show none in return.  You're a number.  Oh, and don't forget your number, you'll need to identify yourself by your number every time you talk to people internally (HR, IT, etc).  Your name doesn't really matter.  No number, no service."
bad,"There are some managers here that are excellent, sadly they are lost in a sea of highly prized, inept and inexperienced former graduates that are indoctrinated into the IBM belief system, people worth their salt don't tend to last long as they are plucked from supporting the company they were tupee'd from to support more lucrative accounts and are quickly overwhelmed, overworked then cast aside, there is a reason people say IBM stands for I've Been Moved."
bad,"No increment"
bad,"Most of the staff that existed at Fiberlink did not exist with IBM 2 years after the acquisition. Fiberlink never hired anyone with less than 2 years of sales experience, IBM hired sales staff straight out of college with zero experience. Quotas went up under IBM. We were expected to hit quotas while being hit multiple training's that took us away from work for hours each week. Management changed multiple times. We were forced to move away from software and processes that were faster strictly because they were IBM. We were required to sit in on so many useless meetings on average 1.5 hrs a day."
bad,"IBM was a good opportunity to start after I completed my certification of MAA. Although I was thru a temporary hiring organization, I'm grateful for the experience of processing electronic Medicaid claims."
bad,"There is not much growth opportunity at IBM. Also, regional and caste preferences and politics play a great role here!!! So, until and unless you work under a manager who is of the same region or caste as you, you cannot expect much growth, career-wise, as well as salary-wise!"
bad,The age discrimination there is rampant. I was there 13 years and every year it became more toxic. Wave after wave of targeted layoffs to get rid of older workers and offshore their jobs. The leadership is short sighted and fixed on quarterly earnings. Customers and employees be damned!
bad,"The work was personally satisfying, Consulted for great client companies."
bad,"Des salle souvenir pour cette entreprise, je vous le deconseil"
bad,Not really a place I recommend to other. Worst management and the level of impotence is extremely high.  Culture is kinda whitewash and doesnt take input likely.
bad,Have got good exposure by working with some global clients. Where I have got to learn the work culture of various international IT environment. Which was amazing.
bad,"Getting Interaction with/responses from Management takes persistence.  Perception was that lack of responses was plausible deniability.  The major up-side was the ability to work remotely, as well as some co-workers."
bad,"this company has seen it's best moments and they are behind it. The culture is mostly non-existent since you almost never meet the people that you work with. There are plenty of smart people there, although I doubt new people stay for very long."
bad,"With 2 ""Resource Actions"" (an IBM term for layoffs) per year, older experienced workers were always under the threat of being fired or forced into ""Early Retirement""."
bad,"On conference calls all day, every day with very little time to actually work.  I and many others on this project were contractors.  IBM mandated a 40-hour work week cap, therefore, I was off work mostly every Friday because they scheduled meetings all day and maxed out my 40-hours by Thursday PM, including time for me to actually work.  Manager's where yelling and threatening on a near daily basis."
bad,Most in the TA org have been at IBM for 20 years + and are completely out of touch with how TA has evolved. Workforce planning is totally disconnected from Talent Acquisition resulting in incorrect coding and accuracy of employee skills.
bad,"IBM considers their people interchangeable parts."
bad,"This organization is incredibly large therefore departments are silos. I was fortunate to have an excellent account manager but a dis-engaged direct manger. My training was looking at powerpoint slides then sitting with a ""mentor"" one hour a day. I would ask the same question of 3-4 people and get all different answers. Weak and ineffective team lead, lack of training, and inconsistent messages all caused me to leave the company."
bad,"lost with leadership, poor morale, certain managers get raises, worker bees get  zero put in extra time , work weekends, management and employees close to retirement just watch the clock and at the end of the day they say to themselves ""I beat another day out of the company"" I got mine""."
bad,"The middle management is absolutely lost.  If they keep paying these guys inflated salaries to pretend to work the company is doomed. A lot of productive and amazing young blood are held back the opportunity to progress."
bad,"If you are full-time, you probably will have a different review.  If you are contract, you will never get an increase in rate of pay (not even cost of living increase) and you are more apt to have a contract end even prematurely than an employee being laid off.  But, salaried employees are not exempt for sudden, mass lay offs."
bad,"Terrible company to work for -- low pay, no job security, poor treatment of employees. Was once a great company with an excellent reputation for job security and fostered employee/employer loyalty, but not anymore."
bad,"IBM is a good company but not so good."
bad,"Seterus is IBM-owned and work primarily as a foreclosure company for Fannie Mae/Freddy Mac.  One example of the environment is the tightness of the schedule.  Adherence is draconian to the point that at the start of each shift, a member of management would stand at the door and check his watch when you entered.  An example of management defects is related to the insistence of the client on implementation of a specific micro-managed customer focus program that dictated actual verbiage.  This program was given to Seterus a year before, but not implemented until the client insisted.  Then there was a rushed training and instant accountability.  no change management."
bad,"I've had good and bad experiences with IBM.  There were good managers,  but they have all left for greener pastures as have many of the good IT professionals. "
bad,"IBM Chile fue una experiencia totalmente diferente a la experiencia que tuve al trabajar en la misma empresa en Venezuela. "
bad,Every day you would be reminded that some people in India would do your job better for lower salary. You get your own serial number like a pair of shoes.
bad,"Typical IBM - take over as a 3rd IT Service provider. Hire (some) of the company's employees and then turn around and lay them off so they can bring in contractors at an extremely reduced rate and of course increase the work load. Management is 90% remote, they do not see how hard an employee works yet they feel that they can accurately give a performance review. Mine may be a narrow view but from what I have experienced no one is happy working for them. The only good thing I have to say is that there healthcare is affordable."
bad,"Once on boarded at IBM, it is nothing short of a miracle to accomplish what would be a normal, daily task anywhere else. Constant interruptions, and firedrills from management are a constant distraction. I did learn how to navigate a mountain of red tape to better serve my customers. Management often times have zero experience in both how to manage a team as well as how to efficiently perform the team job roles. The culture within the office is that of a frat house. Very surprising, however the first 3 yrs were in a different location, which was much more diverse and welcoming."
bad,"I was asked to move over to IBM as part of an outsourcing initiative at my previous employer.  The offer included assurances that I would become a permanent employee of IBM.  Further I was assured that my responsibilities and working hours would remain as they were in my previous role."
bad,The only advantage of working here is the ability to work remotely. There is no possibility of promotion or salary increase. Contract employees are promised to become full time/permanent employees only for it to never happen. The process they follow is ineffective and wastes time. It only pushes contractors away to find work elsewhere. The managers are the actual definition of micro management and distrust. The work environment is not welcoming and does not promote any sort of appreciation for work done; only scrutiny of how it was completed. The only people who should work here are those who are okay with settling for over worked and under paid days.
bad,"IBM spent lot of money on my training but I never gave the chance to be productive instead a Friend of manager got promoted due to POLITIC i was told "
bad,"There is no salary raise once you are hired, you are under constant stress in fear of the next layoff. yet the CEO gets millions more each year. "
bad,IBM lost the plot decades ago when they started gutting their hardware and services departments. In their infinite wisdom they decided to layoff a large portion of their management staff who are over 50 and decided to hire managers in their twenties without adequate experience...so they can pay them less.
bad,"Once a formidable and generous company to work for,the fortunes of this giant have been in decline for a while. There are many fine people still working there with a few pockets of investment in new areas. The majority of long serving loyal staff has been discarded as much of the work is out sourced or sent off shore. I would not recommend this company for a career."
bad,"While IBM is an iconic brand, unfortunately the management at IBM India is myopic in vision and believes that employees will just stay because of brand name. There is no strategy to re-skill or educate employees. Managers believe in competing with their reports to take credit for work that the reports would have done."
bad,Management has to work on process when it comes to new account. Sufficient work force and technology assets has to be deployed before commuting to new projects.
bad,19 quarters of declining revenue says. Once a leader in innovation. Worst kind of financial management model. Impossible to move quickly to capitalize on opportunity.
bad,"IBM = outsourcing every possible job outside Canada, to make more and more money for upper management and shareholders."
bad,Re-orgs every 6 months creates poor customer relationships and poor employee morale.   CEO gave herself a $4M bonus the same week she laid off 10k employees.
bad,It does not matter how much you do for this company when you are up for review they ask what you have done for them lately. The management's job seems to be to get you to have no life and only exist for them.
bad,"busy"
bad,"Most training classes available are for sales, selling the company, manager just manages and knows nothing of the work you do or what a regular day entails. Too much stress on ticket count and letter of the law for support, no leeway or friendliness towards clients is supported. Useless trinkets offered as rewards. Company offered to subcontract me back into my old position at two-thirds pay."
bad,It  is pleasure to work with such huge Brand name and Friendly surroundings ...good cafeterias and good productivity..great celebrations  and  games for Employees
bad,The work space provided was in the basement in a room with 20 other engineers . No cubicles just 4 foot tables and a chair. My manager supervised 75 engineers
bad,"Great team ,fun workplace and management .Great learning experience .Basically more of process oriented company. Worst with transport facilities for female employees."
bad,"A typical work days start with 8 - 1 hour meetings, multi-tasking to meet a deliverable to your next Company.  Management is unaware of the work necessary to satisfy our Clients, and customers seem to be the last item on their priority workload.  "
bad,very draining for me to work here. the environment was hostile. co-workers were nice most of the time. hardest part was trying to force people to pay old debt.
bad,IBM used to be the greatest place to work but has slowly become the worst place to work. They do not pay well compared to jobs in the industry they also have consistently lost money since 2008 and squeeze that money out of their employees through cuts.
bad,"I was hired by IBM to work at one of their large clients.  The IBM manager colluded on the rates with the recruiter and ultimately offered a slightly below-market rate."
bad,"As many companies are doing, IBM is moving too many jobs off-shore and laying off too many U.S. workers.  They are also backfilling many of the positions with sub-contractor workers without the skills needed at 1/3 the cost of full time IBM Subject Matter Experts and charging its clients the price as if they are providing the expertise."
bad,"IBM is an American icon, a huge global corporation with amazing pools of talent and a proven record of delivering innovation over the decades."
bad,Has lost site of technology from a managed services standpoint. Driven more by bottom line numbers instead of customer needs and keeping up on technology.
bad,IBM has lost it's way and has lost it's respect for individuals which used to be it's mantra.  It has surgically cut jobs / costs over past few years and continues to push work to overseas (non-US) countries to perform whereever possible.  All in all it makes it impossible for me to recommend anyone working there as the restructuring actions continue which has caused much heartache throughout the company.
bad,Great colleagues to work with. Good projects to work on. Direct report manager was very supportive of working remote as long as targets and deliverables were met.
bad,"IBM sells great promises but ultimately they cannot deliver.  Cost reduction is removing talented, competent resources in the name of increasing profit margins in the short-term."
bad,"help desk role answering calls as they come in and routing them to the proper department for solution issues while solving equifax inquiries. "
bad,"was a great company lost it ways bad management lose good staff, bad management retained thinking that will solve issue by hiring cheap staff as they think cost was the issue, How about value add vs skills"
bad,"Salary hike: Very rare"
bad,"Nothing much to write.  It's Dilbert world and then some.  Culture, both physical and spiritual, is bland and does little to help foster engagement.  More concerned with time metrics and other measurements that do not allow innovative and creative minds to shine."
bad,IBM tries to brainwash employees into their mode of operation and management. Employees are afraid of losing their jobs if anything goes wrong or you are senior and will be replaced with global resources making a fraction of the salary. IBM does not care about their employees except for those who 'walk on water'.
bad,"Pretty Good company to work with"
bad,Company has already outsourced most of their IT clients. Only accounts remaining are those with ITAR or HIPPA restrictions that cannot leave the country. Company I work for is no longer pursuing these type of accounts and letting the contracts expire. The need to to move on and find new job is evident.
bad,My review is the management should offer the benefits and fun full environment in the work place to employees.
bad,The business is going down hill fast. IBM has gotten to where they do not care about their employees nor their customers. The last few years working there was very hard. Within the last year they took 10 percent of our pay away and increased insurance rates. Stopped all IBM's contributions into our 401K until the Dec 15th paycheck. If you do not make it to Dec 15 then you do not get anything from IBM. Then they laid us off.
bad,Challenging work environment with no work/life balance. Long hours with poor compensation/ benefits.
bad,Difficult work environment.
bad,Was hired on through a job agency. Trying to show my work habits to create a career. After at the position for a few months they started letting full time employees go to replace with all temporary positions
bad,IBM is a place for learning and add experiences to your resume
bad,"Felt like there was no room for growth and you were forever stuck in the support organization.   We asked to take on more work, then they cut our pay by 10%.  Never got merit increases even when exceeding expectations.   Compared to other companies, was severly under paid as was most of my colleagues.  Why we all left."
bad,"Hablo de IBM Colombia. Contratan a través de un tercero, mientras hagas parte del tercero olvídate de estabilidad laboral y crecimiento profesional; te mienten con el tiempo en que puedes tardar de pasar de ese tercero a trabajar con IBM, además te ofrecen muy malos implementos de trabajo, los computadores son viejos y cuando mucho (en el mejor de los casos) te ofrecen una mac book air; es posible que el salario que te ofrecen en el tercero sea más alto que el que IBM te pueda ofrecer, así que al pasar a IBM en varios casos las personas deben bajar su salario."
bad,"The RPO business doesn't fit within traditional IBM business lines and products and therefore is an after thought and not connected well within IBM.  Employee engagement is incredibly low and there are absolutely no growth opportunities if you don't live and work in Frisco, TX."
bad,They really killing every contractor employee life in IBM and project manager and team should not think all the contractor employees are slave for them
bad,"IBM did not have a good concept on how to run a servicing company. Our company went through many changes some good, but I believe this company left out the human element, and did not understand processes that were already in place for speciality departments."
bad,"Some people were good to work with. Others complained when  you expressed your views but expected you to listen to and accept their views.  The work was simple, no challenge at all. The pay reflected that also. The pay was extremely low and since they silo'ed every role, they typically paid lower than anywhere I have ever worked."
bad,"El ambiente es muy relajado, pero los salarios son muy bajos, ademas de que solo se contrata por agencias."
bad,"Good work life balance. Low salary. The company is left with people, who are not getting any job anywhere else and hence staying here. Company does not bother to retain talent but want the talents to leave and want only low paid workers."
bad,"No review. Not good as far. I would like to suggest to management to see the employees and care them. Also, pay scale should be good to survive. That is it."
bad,"At IBM, essentially you are an independent contractor working inside the company, responsible for finding your own projects and maintaining a specific billable level."
bad,Lots of smart and capable engineers across teams. Some flexibility in teams but requires very focused networking to take advantage of such opportunities. Processes and politics are very specific to IBM and important to master in order to navigate the organization effectively.
bad,Depends on your team and manager and luck. You can end up loving it or hating it.  It can be a great place to work or horrible if you are under a bad manager. Don't expect any hike at all. Bonus is also only on papers.
bad,Very oppressive atmosphere with clueless leadership about how to focus on viable and legitimate opportunities.  Management are not very engaging with subordinates and would rather dictate then collaborate.
bad,"There is nothing special about the Blockchain practice. They were blockchain pioneers but two years later, they are falling behind the industry. Smaller and better startups are giving them a run for their money"
bad,"Worked for contract agency both times and IBM was the ""middle man"" for IT services that supported Mortgage/banking and Healthcare companies."
bad,Not interested in keeping experienced subject matter experts.   Several lay-off and now being asked to pick up the work of three positions.  We have no Strategy and no direction from the GM down.
bad,"IBM is expert at laying off employees.  They skirt the federal mandate of publishing layoff details, notably worker ages.  Morale is super low as experienced workers are laid off with few, if any, plans to transition work to other employees.  The only communications you see regarding promotions are for upper management.  Contractors are frequently furloughed for weeks at a time to reduce costs. Any and all work that can be off-shored from the US is or will be.  I went 6 years with no pay raise.  Annual pay raises and bonuses, if you get one at all, are a pittance. There are no end-of-project celebrations, recognition, or bonuses (at least not in my organization)."
bad,A once great company that has been ruined by off-shoring; outsourcing; lay-offs and constant internal restructuring. The number one topic of conversation each week was who was being made redundant that week. A very negative culture. Some of the people are very loyal & great to work with.
bad,The experience was an overall lesson about trusting a very small amount of people. Stay focused on goals and create/complete them quietly. Attend necessary events and participate when necessary.
bad,"Leadership talks about supporting the employees, however, there is a real disconnect between senior leadership, middle management, and 'line management'.  Support from middle management is for the most part good, but without similar support from senior leadership, without a continuous flow from top to bottom, work stalls and frustration grows, making for an unpleasant work environment."
bad,"my typical work day started and ended with meetings.  I did have time to do my work in between or after.  Management was very rude and disrespectful.  Personally, it felt as if we treated and spoken to like we were children.  The culture felt very very tense. Honestly, the hardest part of my job was waiting on other departments so I may complete my tasks.  The most enjoyable part was being able to work from home."
bad,Only worked as a contractor.  There were no opportunities for permanent work.  Direct hires were all unsatisfied with their jobs and would not recommend IBM to their friends.
bad,"International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries. The company began in 1911, founded in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed ""International Business Machines"" in 1924. "
bad,"There were 4 companies involved in the contract, each only allowed to interface with the layer above or below it.  Total silo approach.  Worse, the manager's biggest concern was not being CCed on a customer email, not getting the job done, nor customer satisfaction.  Paperwork first, and job second."
bad,"I will never accept a new position in IBM, never."
bad,Management was never accessible long training period with little focus on the technical support we were supposed to provide to answer questions we did not know  there was a database that was not user friendly.  A paper free work environment long times between calls usually about 25 mins with nothing really to do.
bad,IBM is a large global company. It is very important to work under a good manager and have proper mentoring. I can tell the difference when I was well guided a good manager versus ones who weren't. All-in-all I would say that more people at IBM are at least average or above average intelligence.
bad,"I served in the Military prior to my experience with IBM.  I thought the USAF had bureaucracy, buy I discovered it was nothing compared with IBM. I have wondered over the years how IBM stays in business.  In the early 2000s they were generating cash by selling real estate properties in the northeast, but they cant be doing this still.  I can only think that they are still ""shrinking themselves into a position of world leadership"".  IBM is literally no longer a leader in anything.  They retreat from any market that seems difficult:  Servers:gone, Desktop:gone, Network: gone: Mainframe: gone, Services: gone.  What do they still do?  A few junk yards in New Jersey?"
bad,"Too much job stress for any position.  The constant threat of workplace reductions, layoffs, budget cuts, etc, made it painful to work there.  The inability to speak with Management about issues in a frank manner was prevalent."
bad,The company is currently in bad shape and in dire need of new management from the top down. Very low morale as employees live in constant fear of resource actions (RA/layoff).
bad,Company started cutting costs and corners in 2000. More focused on upper management than the employee. Became way to heavy with 1st and 2nd line managers. Also started laying off employees that were nearing retirement and moving jobs overseas.
bad,"Worked for IBM India for 2.5 Years. 1 year in Kerala & 1.5 Years in Mumbai. Work Pressure is tremendous, with extreme working hours. There is 0 Work Life Balance"
bad,Management is getting worse by the day which people are competing instead of working together to stay above the water. IBM had a great culture but all that is going out of the window. Someone needs to save the company before all the bright people leave.
bad,"While my immediate team (whom I worked with for 12 years) were great people, the executives running this company (into the ground) are terrible. Out of 12 years, bonuses were not allowed for 7 of them, and raises were not allowed for 5.  Yet after 19 consecutive quarters of declining revenue, the C-suite execs were still raking in multi-million dollar bonuses every year."
bad,IBM offers excellent pay and benefits however there is little job security. Many jobs are sent off shore as cost cutting measures. The IBM Sr Management Team lacks strategic direction which has resulted in consistent in the lack of year to year growth.  Net IBM is a company on a downhill trajectory for American workers
bad,"In the division I worked in, there were a number of events in which the manager failed to provide guidance, was never available for escalations, as well as unprofessional behavior with those reporting to her. If her behavior was reported and supporting documentation, there was retaliation from the manager towards the reporting party."
bad,"Lay offs were frequent and unfortunately it's a matter of WHEN you will be laid off not IF."
bad,would not recommend to anyone; been a temp agent for over 5 years and not once look at for a permanent position; no room for growth. culturally divided. poor pay
bad,Things went downhill when EIT bought us. They had too many layoffs and did not pay fheir bills forcing us to layoff workers too many times and forcing sw on erveryone
bad,"Not a place for most, especially not for those with any vision or ambition.  IBM is ready to go to pasture - nearing the glue factory - and the senior executives, and all executives for that matter, have their own craniums buried you know where."
bad,"After years of dedicated work and commitment, they issued my first raise. I questioned my pay and they said it didn't look like as much as they promised me because ""tax brackets"". It wasn't ""tax brackets""."
bad,"Report making for Marketing and Sales"
bad,"I did not like the extensive travel even if there was no work to be done on the project. Independent consultants are able to work from home, but that option wasn't granted."
bad,"IBM has minimum hike no promotion given to deserving em[loyees, only given to favs of management. you can work from home though. so its flexible in that way"
bad,"The only thing you can count on inside technical services at IBM is regular cutbacks and/or layoffs. Everyone's days are numbered. The review structure is annually and pits each employee against each other; the culture does not promote a team or collaborative mentality. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer, the worst part of the job is having your hands tied in being able to assist them."
bad,IBM is slowly reducing staff until they are left with a few services and their patents.  It looks like they are positioning themselves to be sold out.
bad,"I started IBM in 1999 and it was a very nice place to work for."
bad,"Work life balance is not friendly. "
bad,"This was one of the most sought brand in the job sector , however in the years something happened and almost everything changed. Plenty of people left and some got jobs in other places. Still remembering the good old days when it was really fun and a good learning."
bad,Career advancement is made to be very difficult. The raises are a joke. The bonuses are almost offensively low. However they do have a lot of resources for career learning so you can go somewhere else.
bad,"My role was autonomous as a remote sales employee. Expectations were high and with an unrealistic timeline to achieve. There were heavy requirements for documentation and manual reporting. There are not enough hours in the day to accomplish unless I worked through the evenings."
bad,Going downhill faster and faster! Everything is going to India. No employee loyalty. Money grubbing top management. The haves are out to get the have nots.
bad,"IBM sold themselves as a place full of opportunities to make your own career whatever and wherever you want it to be. Turns out that's the furthest thing from the truth, at least where I landed. Management is only worried about increasing revenue, at any cost to employees' careers and with no regard for work-life balance. It's all about reaching billing forecasts."
bad,Utter lack of integrity among management. Toxic environment where solid engineering takes a back seat to cronyism and incompetence in management. Did I mention that the management team was singularly execrable ?
bad,There were only 2 teams of 5 SA's doing 24 hr oncall support with a week on/week off schedule. This was over whelming after 4 years and over 20 plus agencies to work on at multiple locations.
bad,"Para ir de cargo nao é por merecimento, competencia mas sim por ser puxa-saco. Isso é ruim. Jornada de trabalho flexivel para gerentes e acima"
bad,"Work/Life balance is not considered, poor leadership and management.  Company can't make up it's mind on how to succeed.  Direction of the company is unknown.  Not innovative as you expect."
bad,"where to begin? good job but management is very out if touch...my manager had absolutely no knowledge about the division I was in and the type of work we did. all about the ""numbers"" and not about the ppl doing the job. No advancement and no raises, to get even basic training was like pulling teeth and required numerous emails calls ect...very disappointed w my time w ibm and it's to bad because it has the potential to be the best job going. management seemed to protect ""lifers"" by dumping the majority of work in the newer guys and blocking any advancement opportunities. Overall the poorest management I have ever seen"
bad,"bureaucratic"
bad,"Work itself isn't bad, its the culture. Recently a 'work is my life' manager took over iX and things have slid down since. He allows his engineers to be harassed, and does not encourage or support his team at all."
bad,"Work collegues are ok, but management have no clue how to turn a profit other than reducing head count and moving jobs to low cost countries"
bad,"The only good thing I have to say about IBM is that they offered me a job when I was unemployed. However, they took full advantage of that and offered me ridiculously low salary. They made me relocate but paid nothing to cover the relocation cost. The HR lied to me about the cost of living in the city I was relocating to being much lower compared to the city I was moving from. Not only the cost of living was at the same levels, the cost of groceries was almost double. "
bad,"Leadership's lack of vision is the issue at this company.  Very talented people, but leadership is a follower in the industry not a risk taker or visionary.  "
bad,"But due to the IBM company philosophy, the people in my group were constantly subject to layoffs, furloughs and wage modifications(pay cuts). If the company wants to save money, then I recommend that they begin by laying off some of the 1000 VPs that are redundant."
bad,"Trained offshore replacements then released without warning for over delivery?  Terrible treatment after almost two decades of service. Shame on you, IBM."
bad,I worked for Merge Healthcare (subsidy of IBM Watson health) and that company is ran by imibciles and bullies. The place is a joke and people were walked out weekly as layoffs we're prevelant. Stay away from technical support analyst roles in hartland Wisconsin
bad,"Not a good place to work logn term   ."
bad,"A IBM não e ruim para trabalhar, mas precisa se inovar no seu dia dia para que possa ficar atrativa. Seus colaboradores precisam ser ouvidos e levados mais a serio,"
bad,Não gostei de trabalhar devido ao ambiente de trabalho não agradável.
bad,"the positive of the job: is that i learn a lot from internal training and colleagues- great to be able to work in such a multicultural environment, great learns taken from it. "
bad,"Work life balance was amazing at one point, allowed to go to school to better my career, until the good leadership left and was taken over by sales people running an IT shop, all they believed in was numbers and this made work very difficult.  Could never made leadership happy, poor handling of employees."
bad,"Accepting incoming calls from customers, max 100 calls every shift. Assisting customers depending on their needs and the line of business you are under. However, rest days are not fixed, schedules are not fixed as well."
bad,"Management lied to me about advancement/education opportunities."
bad,"Management is not helpful, Not much salary compared to market. Politics in some places. Great company turned into bad management company. Career is on employee responsibility."
bad,"At IBM Global Consulting Services, you are truly just a number. advisers to the bare minimum and there is no office culture.  Travel is extensive and while the starting salary is good, promotions and raises are hard to come by."
bad,"Very poor management, managers are not properly groomed, they think themselves as Boss, also at onsite, employees are very much pressurized and humiliated as if they are at onsite having a favor form managers."
bad,Executive Management has lost touch with the customers and employees. Any time I miss my targets which is usually because we don't have the staffing or resources to  handle the work we get put on a plan. The CEO has yet to make a target and got a bonus.
bad,"this was a contract assignment that offered very little learning/training or feedback on performance and little to no advancement track, low paying and all you did was sit the entire shift and wait for something to go wrong or glitch."
bad,A day where you have to strive hard for every small thing. No employee caring. I worked here nearly 6 yrs and still feel the same that  I am a new person in the company and employee caring is very bad.
bad,"Call center environment.  Not enough room for advancement.  No room for fair compensation.  24/7 Call center. Forced to work holidays, weekends. Supported IBM employees and Lenovo customers."
bad,"a day at work is assigned server configuration work,builds and creation of new filesystems .I have learned different configurations of linux and solaris platforms. Configuration of complex cluster systems. in both linux and solaris servers.  Management is not focused on overall job performance. Hardest part of work is being given tasks that I have no experience with and expecting a a quick response. Most enjoyable part of the job is learning new cutting edge technology."
bad,"IBM has really declined over the years!  For example, they used to have ""respect for the individual"".  IBM has since removed that motto."
bad,Scrum teams are fun to work. I have learnt a lot and grown a lot with IBM. Great Job security. There are so many departments within the company you don't need to look outside for a job.
bad,"IBM provides a nice salary and benefits, however, you're just a body to management. Once they're done with you, they throw you away. You have to go find a new job very quickly."
bad,"I am one of a lucky few who get to work for a wonderful manager. He actually treats his employees fairly. But over all the policies and benefits at IBM have turned 180 since the 90's when they were ""the"" place to work. Now there are almost no benefits, most departments have been outsourced and the entire crew laid off without warning, and every department that is left is running a skeleton crew. The contracts they enact with customers are not staffed or upheld which leads to the employees being overworked and worried about job security because the short staff causes contract penalties which in turn leads to further lay-offs. If you do keep your job, you won't keep your pay. There have been 3 pay cuts in the past 3 years. Even management isn't safe. Every manager in the Atlanta office is visibly stressed and worried over their own job security and have had to pick up the duties of at least 3 co-workers that were laid off in addition to continuing to perform their own jobs."
bad,"Keine richtige Unterstützung."
bad,"What was a flagship company in solutions, capabilities and customer successes is no longer.....unending reductions in force is taking its toll on morale and viability of being able to support customers."
bad,"- 工作充满毫无意义的加班，只为达到UT指标"
bad,"Innovation by acquisition never works.  Company morale at an all time low.  ""Strategic Imperatives"" that aren't strategic.  No promotions.  No raises.  Way too many middle level managers."
bad,"IBM is on a decline. They roll out products that are 5% baked and announce it to create an image that they are leaders in the space. "
bad,"IBM has changed drastically they used to care about their employees   there is no work life balance   it just became all work no balance and you were in fear of beling laid off every day which is exactly what happend to me after 23 years and one months severence a nice slap in the face after working an average of 17 hr days for years   All the great employees with great skill are being let "
bad,"2012.. Started with IBM on a promising note, but after a year, found that the whole IBM only works, what a manager says. You cannot get a promotion or a band progression, until a manager says yes. There is no HR in IBM. There are no guidelines, on what you are rated and cannot argue with your manager"
bad,Answer over time to a review would certainly change in a negative direction.  Many have left leaving more work and even less opportunity .............
bad,"every year there is a random re-org which brings uncertainity, low morals and less structure and a lot of mismanagement. Lot of politics that higher up do ..so that people who want to work and get things are are always frustrated"
bad,"In terms of benefits and salary, it is very poor. You are just a headcount, if you are not dealing with ibm products or salesman."
bad,"IBM threw out all its trained staff years ago, now they pay bottom barrel prices to get temporary workers to do 6 figure jobs for hourly wages. Horrible place to work, boring."
bad,Major changes affecting the company. Continued layoffs just to reduce head count. Top performerers are being let go left and right. All the best people have found other employement elsewhere.
bad,I don't like to be disparaging of past employers. Unfortunately IBM did not put enough research into this project. They seem to have dived head first into the offshoring process without fully studying the different cultures and politics with in the supported opco's and adversrtising industry. I'll leave it at that.
bad,"Not a  environment, constant job cuts, not a pleasant environment to work in. Not selling lot of the smarter commerce portfolio."
bad,"The Gains you got here were purely academic as you can learn a lot and gain experience, however favouritism and nepotism along with bad management very quickly deteriorates any notions of working for a big brand IT company such as IBM."
bad,"Career advancement in IBM is very slow. Salary and benefits is also not that competetive. Vacation leaves are not converted to cash, there is no annual increase, no quarterly bonus, no christmas bonus. Only 13th month pay and performance bonus. In my opinion, IBM is a decent company for starters but if you're looking for carreer development and growth I won't recommend this company. Recently they have been a massive layoff and some of the employees including me are not well compensated. Team leads are difficult to deal with. Accounts are dissolving."
bad,"IBM has low employee moral and is not a good place to work. They don't offer any job security and everyone is overworked and underpaid. The one good thing about IBM has been the ability to work from home, but that is now changing with their new co-location strategy which will force employees to move or lose their jobs."
bad,"Muita pressão e trabalho por salario muito baixo, exigencias para entrar que nao são usadas, falta de incentivo ao plano de carreira e oportunidades. Falta de extrutura e consideração com ergonomia para o bem estar do funcionário."
bad,"Suas políticas corporativas e culturas, são difíceis para aceitar. E a IBM paga um salário baixo, o valor de seus benefícios também são baixos, apenas o auxílio médico/odonto que são bons."
bad,"Anybody looking for a job in IT and Business Consulting, my advise would be to look elsewhere."
bad,"Fragmented & Micro management"
bad,"IBM has experience 16 quarters of declining growth, and is currently in the midst of massive resource actions. I fear that my job will soon be one of the ones that is outsourced or no longer needed."
bad,"Employees who come as a part of a outsourced venture, IBM's assistance in finding placement within the organization once the contract is terminated isn't the very pleasant. Provided an old laptop with virus and incompatibility issues to search for internal jobs which couldn't be performed."
bad,"Rien à dire que je n'y retournerais pas."
bad,Management spends all its time trying to find the next person to cut and keeping there name off the next cut list. Very little to none of managements time is spent on running the business.
bad,This was a short term contract. I prefer working as a direct hire. Because contract employees are not treated like a direct hire.
bad,"Fast paced environment with daily challenges, makes the place very interesting to work."
bad,"I was there for about 2 years, and was excited to join the team until I actually got there. A typical day involves answering calls all day for pennies on the dollar and management expects you to do your job and their job. Management is horrible! No one knows what to do or even how to help. All they care about it numbers and how workers can out more money in their pockets while paying the people that actually do work nothing. They don't care about the workers. They expect you to come through the snow to work and sleep in the building on concrete floors. I am so much more relaxed and stress free now that I have left that company."
bad,"Don't work here in the present or immediate future. It is EXTREMELY top heavy and its core workers bear the burden of practically ALL the work. To meet impossible shareholder promises made during a very different corporate world, culture, and economy- management has GUTTED EVERYTHING to save their jobs. Big Blue is quickly moving to Circuit Cities end..."
bad,"the employee squeeze gets bigger and more demoralizing every year.  you are treaded as a serial # at IBM.  not much more.  People are smart, management is disorganized and micromanaging."
bad,"But no reward and recognition culture"
bad,"It's all about managers and band game."
bad,es una empresa la cual tiene una mala agencia ya que eliminan mucho personal muy bueno para la misma
bad,"IBM used to be the leader in management and really was reinventing the IT industry.  However, especially in the past two years, but for others I am sure it has been longer, the management has really become an issue.  For those who are remote employees, there is little support other than you can go to the IBM office and take paper and basic supplies, otherwise you are on your own.  Management has turned to the dark side with undercover methods of laying off resources with fundamentally flawed reviews and IBM eliminated the 360 degree review for management altogether.  Benefits are good, but constantly being cut.  Pension the same way.  It is also a meat grinder of workloads always getting bigger, few if any pay increases and poor life balance for employees as a result.  It is a good place to be out of."
bad,"The company is run by Finance, not by any strategy or determination of where the company is headed.  As a result, if you live in the US, your job is always at risk - count on two layoffs per year, and in between that time, working long hours.  Further much of the culture is based on Bully Management.  This is not the case in all instances, but it has become much more pervasive. "
bad,"Most folks are overworked.. More with less being the current mantra."
bad,IBM is a huge multinational and it is always hard to engage with interns as the organization is too big and your role is not as required.
bad,"No longer a good company to work for. I would not work there again unless I had no choice, The drive from management is to drive out the high salaried employees and, replace with younger less expensive replacements. This causes a loss of experience and the one that suffers is the customer in the long run."
bad,"I worked on the Cisco Systems help desk taking calls from Cisco employees across the globe. Worked on Windows systems, VPN software, arranging hardware replacement when needed."
bad,"A typical corporation responsible treatment of workers, work as a job, not as people, not skilful management, enhanced reporting systems occupying a lot of time. Systems and procedures complicated by killing the spirit of the sale"
bad,"Loved working as a Lotus Notes programmer. But minimum of 50 hours a week, no true vacation (no one to back me up, plus being required to make up the hours I was on vacation). Laying off people left and right means work needs to be done with the remaining people."
bad,Although IBM has the potential to be a very good company the management team is too focused on controlling cost to meet Gross Profit Percentage targets. The drive for higher margins without revenue growth means cutting people. This is a very stressful environment to work in.
bad,Good group but a bit disorganizedzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
bad,"Boring to work."
bad,"I was directed to work slower so that we didn't complete our contract early, losing money. I spent literally months without any work to do, while on a project, and was instructed that this was not an issue as long as I was ""billable"" to the client. I had about 5 managers who had no idea what was going on with me, nor did they appear to care whatsoever. It reminded me of the movie ""Office Space"" with numerous bosses and meetings that held no real value for productivity or advancement. I also discovered that IBM was charging customers as if we were ""level 7 programmers"", but paying us as ""level 3 programmers"".... which seams almost criminal."
bad,"Working hours were 7am - 5pm"
bad,"It seems that IBM is trying its hardest to eliminate all non-executive jobs in the US.  They chronically understaff finance for the work expected, making for extremely long hours.  Their compensation packages, once among the best in the country, are now barely average.  If you are offered a job in finance, plan to have no life.  Do not plan a long-term career there; gain a couple of years' experience and then move on."
bad,Working in IBM is good but no salary hike won't be there for years to gether
bad,"Most of the time I was thinking to quit. Finally I did it, best decision it was."
bad,"Offshoring of jobs.  Several rounds of layoffs per year.  Unmanageable '2015 Roadmap' by which the pledge is to increase earnings per share to $20.  Great for stockholders, the writing is on the wall for US Employees.  As employees and team members are layed off, the division sales quotas go up, so performing at 300% of 2011 quota with only 30% of headcount.  It used to be THE great American company.  Their headquarters are all but shuttered, yet they enjoy all the perks and tax breaks of being a US employer.  In 2001, they had over 300,000 US employees with appx 85,000 employees outside the US.  In 2012, they stopped publishing the total US employees as it had fallen below 100,000; but they continue to push 'globalization', boasting 'over 300,000 employees worldwide'.  They are now selling off bits and pieces to 'create revenue' as the clock is ticking towards Roadmap 2015."
bad,IBM is a good company for growing as a Manager. Excellent place to learn.
bad,Over the past 10 years working at IBM has changed dramatically. There is no longer respect for the individual employee.
bad,"Worked at IBM for 15 yrs and the sign of the times for them is layoffs. Seems like every 6 months there is another layoff, and for those that aren't laid off, you get a huge amount of additional work. They cut out the profit sharing bonus this year entirely, and raises seem to be a thing of the past."
bad,"IBM was a good company at one time, but they aren't that same company any longer, and have the same pitfalls as I imagine all companies that size do."
bad,They have no understanding of work life balance. They have steadily over the last 10 years cut away benefits and pay from their employees.
bad,"Poor Air Quality"
bad,"Each quarter they do a ""Cost take out"" and remove hundreds of jobs, placing the work load on the remaining. Fire full time employees to hire back months later as contractors. No job security with very high turnover. The pay is not competitive compared to smaller companies."
bad,"Empresa cobra muito dos funcionários, mas não valoria os mesmos da maneira correta."
bad,"Trained and certified new employees on inspection and tooling "
bad,"Niche Technologies"
bad,"I had several different roles at IBM. Starting with tracking Revenue and Signings for a World Wide entity and reporting my findings."
bad,IBM is the cheapest company they don't even supply their employees with a Key Board or mouse. You have to by your own!!!!!
bad,a lot of cost cutting and incompetent managers. You do not progress on merit only on who you are friends with.
bad,"I spent 11 years with IBM. Planning to retire from there. IBM's corporate values change with the flow of the economy. I wanted stability and needed to adapt to indifference. I think if you can hold on to constant change and technical vitality that may be a plan for successful retirement. Otherwise, IBM tends to be a use you then loose you company."
bad,IBM is not the company it once was. Your job security is always an issue and with just that hanging over your head it does not promote a healthy work environment. You have to do more than your job description states if you want to be considered for an annual salary increase. If they want more then it should be part of your description. I would not recommend this as a safe place to have a career.
bad,overworked / underpaid
bad,You're told to do what's best for the borrower but the job is basically collections by any means necessary
bad,Was a great company to work for...
bad,"IBM is a Big Company, inspite of getting much profits YOY it will not give hikes or bonuses because if of number of employees."
bad,"While my day-to-day work remained largely the same from the job I had when this company was acquired, the interactions with management changed. Quality was sacrificed, as was compassion for personal challenges employees might face. There was very little clarity around career growth and development. The motivation to take on extra work and projects was lost due to a lack of acknowledgment and reward."
bad,"When I first started working at IBM, it was a great place. As time went on it became worse. They really take advantage of the employees."
bad,"No words to describe, contractors are treated really bad and management is not at all understanding.I wouldn't recommend anyone for the issues i had to face and the hr department sucks."
bad,"IBM used to be a company with a clear vision and purpose. Respect for the individual, quality and the pursuit of excellence at the heart of our core values, they were once the essence of our DNA. No longer! In today's IBM it's unclear what the core values of the company are. With today's ""strategic imperatives"" there is no clear communication from our executives to the workforce. In the US IBM is NOT a growth industry, we continue shrinking as more and more of the jobs are being outsourced overseas. Commitment towards customer satisfaction, quality and field service has fallen by the wayside. Management decisions are not being made with a focus on product quality, rather to appease continually escalating demands to reduce cost. In short, IBM has lost its soul."
bad,"IBM is run by inept senior management who missed the cloud, and continue to make bad choices to support clients moving to the cloud."
bad,A typical day at work.  Manage a requisition load of 75-90 positions with a 30 day time to fill SLA.  Generally there is rarely time to look at the positions due to HIGH volume emails and phone calls.
bad,"although worklife balance is not so great"
bad,"3 years ago, IBM Global Technological services started cost cutting and ever since they started, situation got miserable."
bad,"Impressive as the name sounds, IBM is taking advantage of its newly graduated college students. The environment (public sector) can be tense. Head down do your work type of environment, higher up managers are not willing to risk their positions for the sake of the younger groups of consultants. They put on a great front and face when recruiting during job fairs and then completely different aura when on job sites. Don't be fooled by the charade."
bad,"Workplace culture varies from site to site and team to team, although the overall culture now, in the NY area is, ""when am I getting laid off?"" The company seems to be spending a lot of money in a lot of different areas, but none of it is improving the business."
bad,"I learned that it's important to seek opportunities for yourself every six months to keep your career growing. I found it difficult to find opportunities to advance without specific technical expertise, everything happens by networking."
bad,"Lo positivo: flexibilidad, capacitación continua."
bad,"Worked for Manpower at IBM, the work was simple and straight forward. The working conditions where average and no real benefits. Colleagues where nice enough"
bad,"to many bosses, to many bad decisions, layoffs 4th quarter, next year sell off of top end GBS consulting. Benefits are just ok, no more pensions, insurance going up, deductibles going up, big company with small company benefits. If you can't bill to a client you are going to be out of job very quickly."
bad,"Great Job , colleagues are the best part , Manager not so much , since the trust factor is non existent , it's almost like who you know not what you know , this has not changed over the many years i have been there."
bad,"It provides very poor wages, and very poor people management, and poor salaries, and poor bonus and rewards, and not effective work assessment. Not a very good place to work."
bad,"IBM isn't horrible to work at if you are outside the helpdesk and don't live in a high cost of living area. If you work in their helpdesk in CO the cost of living is too high for the income they provide and more than one person has either gone homeless or had to leave because of that reason only. "
bad,"It’s an ok place to work if not for the constant Resource Actions seemingly every quarter following the financial reports.   Job security is nonexistent at IBM... definitely not like yesteryear where the term IBM lifer actually means something.  Now,  meeting an IBM lifer is like a yeti sighting."
bad,"Did internship, not a good experience. no training given, just expected to self learn. good work environment, lots of activities to do, and a comfortablework area"
bad,"Op je werk aangekomen de computer opstarten, bakkie koffie erbij, applicaties openen en wachten op de je eerste foutmelding."
bad,"IBM has gone from a software plus services company to a services only company. If you are not in services, you are always nervous about your position going away. If you are in services, it depends on the current workload, no one is safe. There is always someone younger and cheaper they can hire to do the same job, not a place to build a career anymore."
bad,"Parts of IBM are very ""advanced"" and there is career growth. However other parts seem to be forgotten and left to ""fend for yourself."" There is autonomy in places, but there is also some conflict between large internal organizations that make life difficult."
bad,"I would not recommend it. Actually, I would highly discourage working at IBM Watson Health for most professionals except Human Resources or Information Technology."
bad,"I don't have much to say about IBM."
bad,"IBM will dangle the carrot in front of your face, but you'll never get there.  Each year you ""might"" get a review, but it seems your department will never achieve the desired goals."
bad,"Some employees here think that this is the best job they've ever had.  I disagree.  Top management treats employees like ""Expendable Crewmen"" on a 60's sci-fi TV series.  Compensation package for me was good, but oh, what you have to do to get it.  Workplace rules that at times change hourly, incompetent middle-level management, underbid contracts, workplace tools that don't work half of the time, unceasing ""training"" you must perform mainly to satisfy the Legal department.  Overtime that was forbidden without approval, but you couldn't contact the required supervisor most of the time, and got a verbal reprimand if the work didn't get done.  I was part of a ""package deal"" negotiated by IBM with my previous employer to ""transition"" us and maintain their service level without suffering mass defections and paying millions in severance.  My position was guaranteed for 1 year.  At 13 months 70 of us (out of 220) were given 90-day layoff notices.  Some of us were not replaced, some were, with high-school grads on 3-year contracts at less than half of my annual pay.."
bad,"Too many empires that tend to fight against each other, including in front of the customers.  Too many times work being done was meant for another department, but done by another, without proper documentation to cover the expenses incurred."
bad,"Old stodgy workplace.  "
bad,Never received professional development conversations with management. Senior managers did not interact with staff. No sense of partnership with lack of communication. Not a fun atmosphere.
bad,"Great place to learn, and meet good people.  The pay is fairly competitive.   This not a place for an older person.  HR has an unwritten mandate to bring younger people on board.  If you join IBM, plan to learn, develop and leave.  Warning don't stay past your prime. You will not be rewarded.   As a manager both first line and second line, I learned that HR gets the managers to do their dirty work without fully disclosing what their ultimate goals are.  They use an HR system that automatically gives certain employees raises without disclosing to the managers why they were chosen.  "
bad,"IBM is a sinking ship, that the lower echelon employees want to save, but executive leadership seeks to maximize personal profits over long term business success"
bad,The company needs new executive leadership.  They need to hire a CEO who is NOT an IBMer.  The company needs to bring in a CEO and executive team from outside of IBM.
bad,"As an ""acquisition employee"" I did not voluntarily choose to become an IBMer; IBM iX (their interactive experience division) bought and absorbed the digital agency I was employed at. Simply put, they systematically dismantled everything about the smaller agency that was working right and replaced it with 40,000 foot oversight, zero regard for employee passion and/or purpose and expected absolute adherence to their monolithic corporate rhetoric. They destroyed something beautiful, didn't understand or appreciate the creative and conceptual skill set we brought to the table and then, when they realized they could monetize what we did properly to make a nice fat profit, proceeded to lay us off one ""band"" at at a time because we weren't being utilized properly."
bad,As a consultant it can be hard to get on projects since IBM is lacking signings. There is not much of strategy work causing it hard to navigate such a massive organization. Job security is not there for good performing personnel and pay raises are low and far between.
bad,"Its really tough to maintain a work and life balance, its very bureaucratic and long process.  Management is not that helpful and the deserving personnel needs to wait a long time for recognition."
bad,I was put on 2 project where both projects were going badly.  The first one had a very unclear SOW.  The contract people made the deal just for the sale.  The team members did not get proper role definitions and tasks.
bad,"The IBM culture has been in decline for years as they struggle to maintain profitability. This seems to be in large part do to the persistent efforts to lower the age of their workforce at all costs. The employees have come to know that the company does not care for their well-being so none (that I knew of) invest themselves emotionally in the well-being of the company. "
bad,"My first 12 years at IBM were fantastic.  I felt like I was part of a family/community and didn't want to leave.  However, things changed and the bottom line became more important than the employees and the culture.  Also, IBM still insists on only catering to businesses whereas its competition learned to adapt and cater to both business and consumers.  IBM chose to die instead of adapting."
bad,"J'ai passé 10 ans chez IBM dans la partie Global Services. "
bad,When I hired on with IBM they rewarded employees for their hard work. Now they keep picking away at employee perks and benefits. Not a nice place to work.
bad,"IBM is bent on moving away from the ""M"" in IBM, machines. Those of us who worked thankless field and support jobs while they were mismanaging the hardware side of the business into the ground and were over 50 were shown the door with insulting lack of consideration when they sold the x86 spaces to Toshiba and Lenovo. Can't say I'd recommend IBM except as a start but get out quick!"
bad,"In recent years, the company has shifted from a Work-Life Balance environment to a 70 hours+ unpaid overtime environment. Work satisfaction has dropped considerably and I'm happy to have left this company."
bad,"very tough to work at client location,"
bad,You will learn how to survive on your own without any help or support from the company which is good for your personal growth. The people management is not good in handling contracts.
bad,"I worked at IBM for 15+ years and the last 5 were the worst. Company is lost and leaderless. Sr mgmt is afraid and lacks inspiration to motivate the many great people who devote their lives to the company. Excessive focus on “skills” rather than performance and results. Until they get a new CEO, IBM is spinning out of control."
bad,IBM es buena empresa Kelly Services la que presta servicios es pésima administrando y estafa a los trabajadores
bad,"IBM FRance is currently hiring after years of decrease for technical population. Don't be attract by light - That is an illusion except if you - as Faust - accept to sale you to the devil"
bad,"Organization has moved from the most ""employee"" centric company to one that places very limited value on their employees.  It has gone from ""respect for the individual"" to an employee centric meaning of having a ping-pong table in the break room."
bad,IBM is a once great company that is currently lost and probably will not recover. Management is clueless and the constant layoffs are seriously hindering it's ability to succeed. Why would anybody work for a company with no job security. That is hardly a formula for attracting the best and the brightest. This is not a place to spend a career or have any loyalty to.
bad,"Zero professional development but yet the expectation you will be proficient in the latest technology available. "
bad,I learned the pros and cons when it comes to buying a house a lot of things I learned realtors don't mention to you so it was great opportunity to be in the know
bad,Overall needs complete transformation . not the mark in the industry
bad,"it was not good work wise but very flexible work timings. leraning opportunity was not there."
bad,"IBM could have been great but is let down by onerous bureaucracy, favoritism and poor or non-existent leadership."
bad,"First 20 years were great. Last 6 years you were treated as a number that could be replaced in a second,  Manage had no clue on how the dept. worked and was unqualified.  The culture became stressed and everyone for themselves."
bad,"IBM requires far too many hours and mandates far too many administrative tasks for the pay received.  It is a service provider with too few innovative initiatives for its employees.  Too many good old boys holding positions for 30+ years leading to a very stale, slow, old-fashioned atmosphere.  Sucks to be a woman there even though the CEO is female."
bad,I was essentially traded to IBM when AECOM decided to outsourse their IT department.
bad,"Seterus is a subsidiary of IBM. They are bound by IBM company policies which are impossible to change and outdated by 50 years. They hired mediocre or incompetant managers, many of whom were lacking in integrity, and were insecure.  The company culture was such that the good managers were driven out, or left for better companies.  This left the employees in a difficult situation."
bad,"My company was acquired by IBM and I knew right away my time was limited at the company. IBM is highly skilled in the ways of schmoozing newly acquired employees making them think they are now fellow ""IBMers"" when in reality they are holding on to you just long enough to figure out exactly what you do and how it can be sent over to India for half the cost. There is no movement in to the IBM company itself and few that did were laid off in the same amount of time anyway. It is a shame because I would have gladly been loyal to such a groundbreaking company. Sadly IBM no longer looks out for its employees and props itself up on this too big to fail attitude."
bad,"Dealing and meeting clients, travelling, presentations. Learnt a multitude of things around the technology and workforce science that organisations need to develop their employees, worked at C Suite and Director level."
bad,"Regular  , siento que falta mas comunicacion con los teabajadores ."
bad,"IBM is run by accounts,,, they don't care about their employees, just their shareholders - There is no job security... IBM puts so much effort into things they are not good at and not enough focus on thing that can really make a difference... They are also a big fan of Einstein's definition of insanity... paraphrasing: doing the same thing over and over and over, expecting different results... ie releasing seasoned professionals for cheaper young help resulting in the lose of client trust and business... realizing it 5 years later and looking again for the seasoned professionals again... dumb... also, management does not allow thinking out of the box any longer... everything has to be off of the back of the truck... innovation from IBM has been lost... 10 years from now, half of the company will be sold off and most of it's resources will come from overseas... sad future for Big Blue..."
bad,"The pay was good, the people were not. Treated like a second class citizen, people refused to admit what they did and didn't know, and on the list goes."
bad,Changes forced onto sales reps on a quarterly basis.  Accounts would change as well as roles.  The last couple of years I could not get in a groove with all the changes.
bad,"Management was poor"
bad,"Not for family working people, no life-balance and moved across country without any discussion."
bad,"IBM needs to revamp remote worker management, especially tenured employees that seem to take off on vacation, training, time during projects, putting the project and the project manager at risk."
bad,Excellent staff and resources. The main issue is that IBM is aggressively offshoring large segments of it's service delivery business making staff uneasy knowing they're jobs will eventually disappear.
bad,good learning place..it is like an institute. So you can get the knowledge but not money. Brainless and direction less Managers. Only focus to get billable hours...if you give them they will be happy. rest forget about any good salary.
bad,"Politics, luck and economy all play a part in which engagement you get. In lean times, the competition is high, and nepotism or who you know gets you the gig. In busy times, you have your pick of engagements."
bad,"Stick long enough for growth"
bad,IBM demanded a lot.  You had to work long hours to keep up.  Management changed often but did little to nothing for employees.  Evaluations stunk.  Billable hours were the main driver.
bad,"IBM never offer promotion, there is no job security, they fired my friend who worked for 35 years in IBM in a week.Working from home is only good part"
bad,Growth is very less. HR role is very limited and not employee friendly. HR will follow Manager without supporting employee even on valid points. Promotion scope is very less and career will not progress.
bad,Great people awful culture.  Long hours no respect.  Product offering all over the place.  three bosses in 3 years as well as new product line up every 6 months
bad,Cut throat culture. Management focus is on cost cutting rather than innovation. There is a heavy emphasis in offshoring job to India and the Philippines.
bad,IBM has completely lost it's way.  Management is either unaware or doesn't care. Off-shoring positions have left gaping holes in knowledge and departments.
bad,"Poor pay, no career advancement, ever diminishing benefits, management does not inspire confidence or loyalty.  Peers are constantly being let go from the company."
bad,IBM SO was the largest services organization at IBM in the year 2000 and was a growing business.  Then clients discovered that outsourcing was not great if you have change in the environment.  After 4 years clients were re-negotiating contracts and the profitability started to erode  .. then IBM cut staff and tried to provide services which were hard to achieve with good satisfaction
bad,"Job: "
bad,"Learning as trainee is good . But management , job culture, work ethics are not to satisfactory level. Holidays are not followed. Trainers are not professional. It was a great disappointment working in us based MNC IBM."
bad,"Rapidly declining company that is only focused on satisfying Wall Street and investors rather than customers,  Acquires technology and does not invest in new solutions.   House of cards."
bad,"good place to work but more employees at night operations and hectic tensions while handling cabs,employee and vendors.and also only night working from evening 7 to morning 7 there is no day shift for parking co-coordinators. cab facility for employee is very good and also its free for transport workers as well."
bad,It is flexible but pay wise it is less. Band progressions are in managers hands and it is not transparent. Managers can show biasing and can threaten employees.
bad,"Very Bad management."
bad,"Very busy day with calendar constantly changing.  It was very stressful atmosphere, but people generally were nice and upbeat.  There were many internal meetings, within the United States and abroad. Raises were few and low pay for the work done."
bad,Maison dirigée par des financiers dont le but principal est le profit au détriment de toute considération des individus
bad,"Going in to IBM I had high hopes.  I felt they had a reputation as cutting edge with initiative and independence.   It turns out  to be a company with a huge ego, extreme pricing, processes that do not work and no culture or team environment.   The leadership is under so much pressure to turn a profit, they have result to cut-throat management tactics.  If you can't immediately hit your ridiculous goals, you go to a PIP.   No discussion allowed on goal setting.  The company is stuck in there old ways with out dated tools."
bad,"Leadership difficult to partner with."
bad,IBM used to be a great company to work for however that has changed. Long term strategy seems on point but as senior management struggles with resolving decreasing revenue it is every man for himself as they cut technical and sales positions.
bad,IBM is a sinking ship. Get your skills updated and get out before you go down with the ship. IBM will be gone in 10 years so get out now while you can.
bad,Workloads and expectations are more than can handle. Work life balance not possible. Workplace culture could use a little more integration.The clients serviced are awesome!
bad,"This is a tough review to write.  IBM was a great company to work at and I hope one day it will be again.  The people who work at the company are dedicated, intelligent, loyal and fun to work with.  The work can be both interesting and challenging and the customers are wonderful. The culture is one of innovation, collaboration and learning.  The lower level managers are decent hardworking people.  They perform a job made difficult by an ineffective executive management lacking a competitive long term vision.      "
bad,"Timings are very tough"
bad,"When you first start out, you'll get handed an outdated training manual. After the first couple of days to week(s) you'll get enrolled in a confusing, unorganized computer training which has a lot of mistakes and misinformation."
bad,"Worked for the IBM Lenovo help desk."
bad,"With most jobs being outsourced to India, folks are walking around with knots in their stomachs wondering if they'll be next.  Organizations use archaic tools and no funds are being put into upgrading internal systems...although I must say their Watson commercials on TV are fabulous, albeit far removed from reality."
bad,"great place to learn and evolve."
bad,"IBM is a company with close to, or more, than 50,000 employees worldwide.  Nearly half the workforce, I am told, are contingent workers.  This means you are under a contract for a specific time period, there is little full time regular employment offered."
bad,"Company culture has changed so much over the years.  Today,  in my opinion all decisions are based upon what's the quickest way to show an increasing bottom line as opposed to long term.  All recent ( last 10 years)  growth is thru acquisitions as opposed to internally growing."
bad,"The once great ""e-business"" technology company is trying to find a new value prop as a foundation for the future, but is killing the poor slobs who are still working there in the process.  Very sad to see."
bad,"Good for freshers as they invest in setting up a good foundation."
bad,No two days are the same. I work in a fast-paced work environment in two time zones. I am driven and results oriented. Colleagues are diverse and there is an opportunity to learn from different personalities every day.
bad,"I worked in IBM for 3 years. "
bad,People are very dedicated to work but overall management focus is on REDUCE REDUCE REDUCE. I spent 14 years at IBM with excellent reviews but was unfortunately released during one of their regular Resource Actions.
bad,A typical day at work depended on the client that I was assigned to. It was a demanding job that required me to be flexible and adaptable to ever changing environments.
bad,"IBM missed the industry move to cloud and is now in a state of transition as it tries to find direction.  The organization is in turmoil.  The top line has fallen consistently over the past 14+ quarters.  They hired a consultants to ""fix it"".  However, they seem to be making things worse.  The bulk of middle management adds no value to the sales process.  They are ""spreadsheet jockeys"".  Sales professionals spend too much time on cadence calls."
bad,"Constant worry about your job being sent to developing countries."
bad,"Hire in at the highest possible salary because you are unlikely to see any increase for quite some time.  Benefits package is average for employee only, but high cost for family coverage.  You will have to fight to maintain a work-life balance and to experience any career advancement."
bad,"A good place to start your career, however, the work was very routine-like and repetetive."
bad,"Péssima recepção de colegas novos, politica de ""faz tudo"", e péssimo relacionamento com seus funcionários."
bad,A company that is really struggling to find it's way.  Has some great technologies but is so focused on short term financials there is no long term investment to ensure that those technologies will be successful.
bad,Tuped so a challenge. IBM offshoring model and globalisation meant no real role for UK staff. I maintained my own personal and professional standards.
bad,I was told that the best part of working for IBM was being able to put it on my resume and that was true.  There was freedom working from home and being able to come and go as needed.  However their benefits package deteriorated over the years to where they covered very little.  They have outsourced over seas the majority of their technical jobs. They used to pay out 26 weeks severance but laid me off with 4 weeks severance after 19 years combined service.  In addition I had to train 4 resources from India and 2 from Brazil to do my job.  Brutal company that does not care about it's workforce.  16 straight quarters of declining revenue.  You know why.
bad,"Unfortunately the more business IBM is involved in, the less it values its employees.   There is no reasonable explanation as to why current valuable employees are being cut, while inexperienced and incompetent staff are given jobs."
bad,"Started out great many years ago, has now dissolved into a toxic work environment.  Please stay clear and look for a forward facing environment"
bad,"Work itself and life balance needs to be managed by yourself, but it can be done.  The area of service delivery to clients is no longer a focus to grow."
bad,"IBM is in a constant state of change. As though the senior management don't know what field to be in. To enter a new market IBM now buys existing players - gone are the days of IBM leading innovation. "
bad,"Empresa mal organizada, no qual possui muitos cargos de chefia e isso dificulta até mesmo para quem você deve responder; salário abaixo do mercado e a empresa possui uma cultura individualista."
bad,I would not recommend IBM as an employer unless it was on a short term basis or that there was an immediate advantage to the prospective employee for purposes of initial career experience or immediate employment required. You want to continue to actively look for a reputable and respectful employer.
bad,"Foi uma das piores experiências que já tive em uma empresa. Carga horária altíssima, mesmo para um estágio. Eu saía mais tarde do que o acordado nos contratos e costumava me atrasar para a faculdade. "
bad,"Clients are good."
bad,"with the new plans, the motivation of employees is reduced to zero."
bad,"But manager driven company,There is no employee concern from management and there is no basic facilities,people who is job less only fit to work in this company,There is no good project always work pressure is more,its really worst company."
bad,"Check out the listed cons. That sums it up. I was hired on as a CSR/SME but management wanted me to continue serving as a trainer (served as trainer as a contractor for 6 months before becoming an IBMer). Then my supervisor said I was the training coordinator. But my pay and job description didn't reflect such duties. Stayed after hours to work on projects (due to heavy pressuring from the backup team lead) without pay because overtime was frowned upon. No respect for personal life and no room for creative thinkers. Too many staff meetings with higher ups where nothing is accomplished. Resigned after 16 months as an IBMer because of the low morale, overabundance in work load, and the fact that the working environ kept making me physically ill (air ducts aren't cleaned regularly and mold infestation caused me to get a sinus infection among other maladies). Contractors and IBMers alike dumped their grievances with management and the higher ups on me and then I was expected to solve their problems. I was often chastised for doing it when the team lead wouldn't. It's pretty sad when several people call me their team lead because I solved their problems. Sadder still to have the same people call me the team lead in front of the team lead."
bad,The hardest part of the job with IBM is not being rewarded or acknowledged for the work and efforts you put forth.  The constant change of the processes and procedures make it very hard to properly do your job.
bad,"Line managers could be good - mine mostly were."
bad,"It has become a cliche to say that IBM is not what it used to be. "
bad,"IBM has a culture, as of late, of not worrying about its customers nor their own workers. The management and executives do not seem to appreciate the work being done. Promotions and upward mobility are , in most cases, non existent except at the Band 10 or higher level. Bands 4-7 are considered ""expendable"" whenever the stock prices drive downward, or when the financial reports are not favorable."
bad,"IBM was once very good w.r.t all benefits and have gradually brought down its value of co-ordination with employees. Less wage with same productivity is always expected, clipping employee benefits is concerned area..."
bad,"IBM has changed drastically since being employed.  I was an employee for over 10+ years and in the past 3 years of employment I've seen jobs being off-shored to other countries who do not understand the business and it was hurting their Customers.  The bonuses received were very low and to receive a raise would be from an ACT of GOD.   Managers were directed to pass out low performance reviews so IBM could save money when laying off their employees.  The performance pay was tied to your severance pay."
bad,"The work is great.  We learn constantly due to the nature of IT job.  My co-workers are great.  However, IBM is laying off people and shift our jobs to Brazil or India every quarter therefore nobody has any incentive to work harder."
bad,"IBM employees work very hard for their customers mid level down to the mail staff, unfortunately IBM has lost it's feel for IT and technology as a whole. "
bad,"I learned a technical process in this feild,I have discussion with client for sharing the feed back about customers given."
bad,"Very interesting and satisfying machine to work on. Every year we are told that we are lucky to have a job when they gave us our pityful profit sharing bonus. During performance review and increment, we are told the same thing and told that its good enough that we are even able to get any increment. Politics are very bad there, not in good terms with anyone, u could loose your job."
bad,"Too Big to Compete and Succeed. Some Sr Management is scrap from other companies, extremely slow and shows so sings of improvement after 7 quarters of negative growth"
bad,"Employees are not treated as important as they showcase."
bad,Had fun learning and tried to absorb everything as quickly as possible. Had good experience learning curve with Linux and some other new applications in the short time with IBM. Everything at IBM it was new and not ever exposed previously. You always had work when you would arrive and sometimes crazy busy. Management was different style and for the most part they were busy with there work so I had to learn on my own most things. The co-workers were very helpful when you had questions and steered you in the right direction. The hardest part was getting familiar where everything was on your Laptop they are in so many different locations. I enjoy learning new things and trying to get the best possible results. I get excited and reward myself by feeling good when I accomplish things on my own.
bad,"My previous review applies to my work at IBM also."
bad,Worked on an account that was outsourced to IBM for 14 years then got layed off. They started laying off people 18 months after the account started. Eventually any 'dead wood' was gone and they went after highly qualified and highly rated employees.
bad,"IBM back in its hay day was a number 1 or 2 company to work for. Employees were treated with respect, and if you performed you had a job for life. That culture no longer holds true, the change in culture has hurt this company. The dynamic's of the market does have an effect on companies culture, but it should not have an effect on the core culture."
bad,"Less salary hard job, Its less number of people in team so workload is very much high."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"IBMt is not what it used to be, people-oriented.  Now it's all about near-term numbers to prop-up the stock price."
bad,A day with IBM was waking up to work and sleeping to work the next day. My scheduled with IBM did not allow much room for anything. The management was never really around. The employees were great to work with on a typical day. I learned a lot for this job skills that will help me further my career in the near future. The hardest part about this job was not having time to myself.
bad,"very busy - multy tasking - keeps job interesting, over the years I have learned quite alot - hardest part of my job is not being recognized for work done - co- workers are great but everyone is so stressed -"
bad,"They had to reach a staffing level of 1,300 by end of year 2010 after entering Dubuque in 2009. So they hired anyone and everyone. And they put individuals in first level management positions who never managed before in their careers. There was a lot of manager/employee affairs wherein the employee received special privileges. (allowed to do poor work, allowed to bully other employees, allowed to work from home all the time.)  All in all it was the worst work experience of my 30 year career."
bad,"Would not recommend to anybody who is currently employed. If you need the job sure go work for the company, but do not make it your home."
bad,They're a large IT firm with many smart people. There are some very interesting projects going on in there.
bad,"Eventhough I usually stays outside the office, I always start my working day with an appearance in the office before covering the hospital account."
bad,"Des journées de travail tous les jours differentes. Travail de equipe efficcace, developement durable et respect pour l'environement."
bad,"É uma empresa que exige muitas habilidades e competências dos funcionários, levando-os a ver até onde conseguem ir para realizar as tarefas. Apesar da forte pressão existente tenta oferecer um certo conforto para bem estar dos funcionários. Aprendi a lidar com a pressão e a cumprir as várias tarefas sem perder a calma. "
bad,"Poor management understanding of performance parameters."
bad,"IBM peel park is in no way a good place for progression, training or development. Its clear there is no intention of providing a good quality service to the client."
bad,"Without question the worst place I've ever worked. Management is completely out of touch...with anything other than the stock price."
bad,aperfeiçoe o meu dinamismo e minha capacidade de aprendizagem.
bad,"Many times during interviews at other companies they will ask, ""How did you like IBM."", Reluctant to say bad things about an employer, I'll lightly dodge the question, and then often after they will candidly express their stories of how they worked at IBM, and then quit or got laid off after so much frustration. "
bad,"Current Organisation is huge network world wide and key business is their products and making client to experience their products."
bad,A lot of BS to go through. Business Conduct Guidelines? How about Executive Ethics and Morality Guidelines.
bad,"Good co-workers"
bad,"Work is good."
bad,"I work 12 hour night shifts. I have acquired an abundance of knowledge in the field of electrical engineering. Management is inadequate. Hardest part of the job is simply boredom, the company's tools are down on a regular basis. About 40% of the time. I enjoy the work I do and learning more about computer chip development.   "
bad,Current focus seems to be lowering wages and long hours to improve bottom line profitability.
bad,"As an IMAC Coordinator, it is my job responsibility to process requests for Installing, Moving, Adding or changing anything about a user's office equipment. This includes everything from getting a new hires ID's created and office equipment setup to phone and cabling work or even moving a user and all their equipment from one location to another. Processing these requests includes: working with the End User to ensure that all of the information provided is correct, requesting approvals from the necessary people, and assigning tasks to all the necessary teams in the correct order to handle all that is being requested. In addition to assigning tasks out to the correct work groups, I work as an intermediary between the End User and the various teams, making sure that the teams complete their work completely and in a timely fashion and by answering any questions or concerns the End User may have."
bad,"If you live in the Denver Metro area, the commute will get tiresome. Nice location and campus. Exposed to a lot of new technology. Management is off in fairy-tale land. It's a shame, IBM was once an IT leader. Now it's a joke."
bad,Too much work for the small pay you get. Co-Workers are great but it is like high school with gossip and stuff like that.
bad,"If you want a good job with IBM, you will need a Ph.D. They expected me to work 7 days a week with no overtime and only $60,000/year. I had to be in the office for 40 hours/week plus late night Wednesday and all night Saturday. I often missed my church obligations on Sunday mornings because I was still working from 8 PM Saturday night. The only good thing I can think of was that I could work from home on Saturday nights."
bad,"The IBM Corporation primarily wants young workers. This Corporation is a high-stress job. The employees go from January to September/October proving their worth during evaluation time. Once the evaluation is done, there is a little breathing room. IBM does not care about a pattern of good service, they have the 'what have you done for me lately"" attitude. Although there are a lot of good employees and some good management, this is the environment that IBM promotes. Its employees are really good, however, IBM has no loyalty. There are several layoffs a year, and everyone knows there time is coming. This is Work/Life Balancing, but some managers do not implement that part of the company policy."
bad,"The goal was to initiate workout programs to prevent foreclosure, we analyzed mortgagor's financial statements, evaluate debt ratios review payment records and educate borrower's on alternative money sources/payment options to bring loan current. Minimize losses to the company and accurately document accounts in accordance with Fannie Mae guidelines and company policy and procedures. Minimize losses on loans that are in default or are future potential defaults by offerings workout options that will allow them to retain property or liquidate the property to avoid foreclosure."
bad,IBM is not the company it used to be. The partners running the consulting division are clueless in the sales department so they are always underestimating their proposals just to get a deal sign. This results in multiple projects being under staffed to maintain budget but resources being overloaded with work and ridiculous timelines.
bad,"aprendi acerca de procesos ,el ambiente era muy relajado ,el dia empezaba con checar los pendientes del turno anterior"
bad,"adequate staff."
bad,"Office Building was bad with no facility .Canteen was very bad."
bad,"Great way to get your foot in the door, but I saw people get fired left and right. People who were about to get their tenure got fired months before. Office went from about 300 to 50 people and accounts were left with no one to govern them."
bad,Was one of the top companies to work for when I started now it's one of the worst.  Executives think otherwise because they have no clue about employees and do not listen.  A very obvious discrimination effort in the last 15 years against older workers.  Younger workers don't stay because they don't have too and they see through the executive failed leadership.
bad,"Constant fear of being downsized in resource actions, and little appreciation for the time and effort spent. While some areas of the company were growing, most were stagnant, and many were actively being shopped for transfer to outside organizations, all while the employees were kept in the dark about future plans."
bad,"Very low salary, and with lot of variance with in the team ."
bad,Management cares mostly for customer success and it seems that nobody cares about their peers or company culture. There is culture for advancement or progression and not an understanding of roles and responsibilities when instead monitoring just performance by amount in contracts signed
bad,"so they cannot be a bad employer. I had various roles, mostly managing post sales technical support and I had opportunity to work with customers around the world."
bad,"Bad environment in ibm. Non supporting team."
bad,"It is a struggle to do the most basic of tasks anymore since everything is cobbled together and there is no support.   You do not get the needed hardware or time to complete any task, and i mean, complete it."
bad,Professional and personal life balance is perfect for IBM employees especially for working females. Some projects allow work from home option and some do not.
bad,I didn't stay long at Kenexa/IBM.  I was laid off within 6 months of hire so I don't have much of a positive review for this company.  I felt my team lead wasn't very helpful and at times she would freak out when things did not go her way.
bad,"The manufacturing environment has changed over the years.  Originally, it was a competitive, fun, and appreciative workplace.  Now, it has become a high stress, lack of talent, and a grinding place to work."
bad,"the job would be good if management didnt require 2x / day meetings.  these meetings can be summarized in a single email message without breaking everyone's concentration.  in addition to this, management is the red tape in the organization meaning there are far too many managers wasting resources instead of working."
bad,IBM is no longer any different than any other major corporation. There is no such thing as job security. If you get a good manager and wind up in a department full of good people you are one of the lucky ones.
bad,"When I started at IBM it was a company you were proud to work for and be a part of. Frequent raises, training classes were often, that’s all gone. So I must admit I may be biased because I was laid off, apparently working 12 hour days and taking conference calls while on vacation wasn’t enough.  It pains me to be so negative because I really loved the company, but I think it was the “old” company I loved. Maybe you’ll have better luck."
bad,The company does not value individuals.  No concern for worklife balance.  Low profile layoffs continue twice annually.  Would not recommend unless you are in desperate need of a job.
bad,A good day at work is the best day at work. The management is good. A good job to be at. Supervisor works with you on major issues. Good benefits and Health insurance.
bad,"Full of corporate politics and constant threat of layoffs  Compensation didn't keep up with industry.  IBM tools were difficult to work with, but at least got to work from home."
bad,"IBM is good company for Work From Home only. No financial or policy benefits being at higher bands in company, however, it is dangerous in terms of internal and/or client Billing."
bad,The management level is not according with the history of this company
bad,Focus is entirely on share price. Late to market. Missed the cloud by 5 years. Most experienced staff have been made redundant with many roles sent offshore as IBM focus is on cost cutting.
bad,"IBM acquired the company at which I worked for over 20 years. In the two years that I worked for IBM after the acquisition, they had multiple rounds of large-scale Resource Actions (job cuts and lay-offs). This is seemingly all about numbers and not job or skill value based. Many key resources to business success have been lost due to these actions, including my own."
bad,You’re always having to look over your shoulder within the quarterly/semi-annual layoffs. Neither skills nor experience are valued. They value youth and inexperience to save money.
bad,"The mist enjoyable part of the job was management and their ability to give their team autonomy to make decisions."
bad,"When I first started with computers in high school, I dreamed of one day working for IBM.  I always believed IBM to be an ideal place to work."
bad,Bad place for US Contractors. Do not work there if you expect a long term job and a full 40 hour work week and the full salary you were approved for as it will be reduced in the first 6 -8 weeks.
bad,"IBM = I've Been Mismanaged"
bad,I loved the problem solving.  With the steady job cuts it is very difficult to find the right people to actually fix the problem that was discovered.  Not a very fun place to work.  So sad that IBM has become just another company driven by greed and not a persons work ethic and determination.
bad,"Remote facility is provided by giving laptops  and round the clock available."
bad,Horrible place if you do not know someone that can mentor you through the maze of Nepotism. The Company does not value employees the way one thinks the big tech companies do.
bad,"IBM missed the boat when it came to cloud computing. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft arrived first and dominate the industry. IBM's focus on cotract work was a disaster. Offshoring and outsourcing were IBM'S method of operation while I was there. Quarterly Resource Actions (RA's) kept staff on edge as employees were left to wonder who was next. No employee loyalty."
bad,Leaving as soon as possible. Most jobs are being moved overseas and little consideration is given for experience or client satisfaction. Work-Life balance is low and expected to answer phone and work 24-7.
bad,"*Growth is not good in this company"
bad,Great leader and team player. He always meets the required metrics for the years. Great ability to learn and understand new things on the fly. He also develops a great  relationship with customers which results in Great customer service reviews and customer satisfactions.
bad,You have your day planned and management micromanage remotely from home and gets you all backed up. They get rid of higher paying employee's and get new hires with no experience for a lot less. No Matter how good you do it feels like it's always negative. They force you to work 6 days a row and take a day off in the week so that they don't pay you overtime.
bad,"The workplace has great people and flexible working arrangements are available. However, management is terrible and opportunities for advancement are very limited."
bad,"- band progression is very very tough"
bad,"IBM forced employee to give up office space and work from home. Then all sudden they force you to relocate to different state. If not, you get RA. They don't care who leave project and replace with contractors."
bad,"My typical day is always busy , I did not get chance or time to learn any thing or improve my skill even though resources are available."
bad,As a contract employee you are a second class citizen. Don't do it! Only work for IBM if you get full time and benefits.They usually work with Manpower or ACS.
bad,"A IBM é pura fantasia, com a questão da flexibilização de Home Office, a empresa paga super pouco, todo mês, o funcionário fica devendo 16 horas, e a empresa te suga ao máximo, o funcionário não tem feriados ou finais de semana."
bad,"below average market rate salary even to the top performer."
bad,"IBM is constantly re-organizing. They hire you, and move you, and are so busy with 'structure' that you don't have the opportunity to do much of anything. It's all very disorganized, and after being recruited away from a company I loved, it was one of the worst experiences, ever. It only lasted 18 months, then they cut my whole work group. The pink-slip package is pretty good, but they should put that effort into keeping good people."
bad,"IBM is only suitable for freshers."
bad,"Anyone with experience is getting their job shipped offshore. You are told to get training, but not given the time to train. They do not want to spend money to train you."
bad,working from home- no managers around ; on your own; you work on your own..expectation is high to deliver without any guidance from superior.  High attrition.
bad,"Enjoyed the weekly travel.  Did not like pitching for a project with a client as an SME/implementer, getting the project then being replaced with cheaper resources."
bad,"I worked 11 of my 20 years for AT&T at IBM so this review is specific to that contract however unless you are in the cloud, quantum computing or AI departments, from my experience most of the other ""second tier"" contracts operate the same... "
bad,"IBM is nice to get on your resume but I wouldn't stay here. Public Sector-work culture is terrible, nothing is done to improve this. Everyone complains about work/life balance. Unless you are on a really good project, you will most likely be wasting time for advancements and practicing your skill. Be wise, and ask the recruiter lots of questions."
bad,"Too big company....they do not do what they promise competition. Very stress full work life balance. If they stood behind there word of rewards and compensation it might make the stress worth it. It's a rule by fear at IBM. Layoff are constant stress. I was not impressed by there tools provide. As mechanical Engineer I was required to use my own tools to put prototypes together. They accuired my company and quickly laid everyone off with the knowledge they acquired. Doing contract for them after lay off, the new people had no Idea that there questions were answered years prior. They just laid off all the knowledge, IBMer simple thought they new everything. They did not know they got rid of the talent that made the product they bought worth buying. You don't buy the company, you buy the knowledge. Not impressed at all."
bad,"Empresa líder em novas tecnologias, mas muito burocrática. Baixa qualidade de gerentes em todos os níveis."
bad,o periodo na empresa foi muito curto para poder avaliar
bad,"Used to be a great place to work. I left and came back and the lack of training, information, or even ability to get information is almost impossible."
bad,"Empresa apresenta dificuldades em promover o funcionário, com diferenças gritantes na remuneração, mesmo que os funcionários desempenhe as mesmas funções."
bad,"Interesting client transformation projects but increasingly less so."
bad,This was a job that was through a temp agency that allowed for me to get a job in the IT field while I added experience to my resume. I was 1 of 2 employees on site with very little management involved. I was furloughed 40 hours every quarter and was required to do so in order to reduce cost.
bad,"Communication regarding Watson Health's direction and timelines was erratic and inconsistent. It was very difficult to plan projects, get answers to technical questions, or collaborate across the company/division. We were very isolated from our colleagues by both geographical distance and lack of integration across the division. Management changed frequently, and goals and expectations were barely communicated at all."
bad,Global Services (Consulting) is more staff augmentation work than actual consulting. Be prepared to not have any real say about project work. Onboarding process is very bad.
bad,Praca w firmie zalezy od zespolu i projektu do jakiego sie trafi. Moj był naprawdę super zespołem. Super ludzie.
bad,"If I were a white male, my career advancement and placement would have been assured at IBM. But alas, I am not a white male. I had high hopes when I was first hired and I drank the ""Blue Kool-Aid"" as it was called. "
bad,"A typical work day would be receiving mail/packages, deliveries, shipping mail/ packages, collection of assets, ordering supplies, delivering paper for all printers through out the building. Keeping track of in and out mail/package and basically  everything I do for end of month reports."
bad,My typical day at work was to make sure my old company was satisfied with all sla's. I worked for my previous company for 30 years then outsourced to new company. I enjoyed my 3 day 4 day work weeks.
bad,"Upper management is so disorganized, and appears to have no idea what direction this company is headed.  The lack of leadership is rampant within the company."
bad,"- beaucoup de temps perdu en réunion"
bad,"Management is filled with low skilled people, driven by politics and boot licking, loses its clients very easily, developers life is very dull and depressive."
bad,"Het bedrijf is innovatief, jammer is echter dat de winst en niet de mens belangrijkste zijn."
bad,Opportunity to learn everyday.  Reasonable compensation and benefits.  Meet company objectives before customer's.  Very few managers were trustworthy.
bad,"there is no scope for techincal knowdlege,no opportunities for people have good tecnical stuff,the importance is given for people have more experince but no knowledge..."
bad,"The job at IBM is challenging and one typically ends up working for more than 12-13 hours a day other than weekends. Although, the company would like to promote work-life balance, it is really upto the immediate departmental management to ensure that the employees have a work-life balance, which really gets lost in the melee of meeting unrealistic deadlines, unreal expectations and a complex web of learning."
bad,"I worked for the Retail Consulting arm of the IBM Global Services, and was not impressed with the Management.  The group was very clickish, and positions were not assigned based on your hired skill sets and or back ground and experience.  Not set up to succeed."
bad,Top level choices made with little information on impact.  Management became less about doing a good job and serving clients and more about positioning.
bad,To był nowy projekt i oprócz nadgodzin była praca w weekendy.
bad,"Many positions change quarterly with new assignments and required tasks.  It appears that management is throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. Rather than release staff they will move employees laterally into positions employees neither want nor are qualified for.  It has been determined that IBM may be in trouble with the investors and are trying anything to improve the bottom line to appease stockholders and investors in order to attain a favorable stock market rating.  Not the same old ""Big Blue""..."
bad,"Over my 33 years I had changes on retirement plans to losing money, added hours, threats of layoffs, pay cut over 6 month period. "
bad,"I found it a work environment where projects seem to be left to the last moment and then rushed. Staff are pressurised to complete these projects to meet  the Senior Manager's, usually unrealistic, timeframes. Getting authorisation to order equipment is very bureaucratic and has to be signed off at every stage.  I have only worked on one client site, so it may be just that site alone where this happens. On the positive side, I have to say my fellow project managers were very helpful and professional."
bad,"start up for IBM that does not exist anymore, company pulled plans to continue the project and I was sad to see the job go away. It was a plus to add experience in my field at that time."
bad,"Like any megalithic entity, they don't see employees as people and proceed as such. I did not like the cookie cutter don't ask questions style of their support structure but it does work to an extent for rotating people in. I do owe them for giving me a break and getting some work experience, but I can't say id want to go back or recommend it to anyone else."
bad,"I had a negative experience working for IBM. There was no company culture and for such a reputable company, felt there was a huge lack of communication and disorganization. During my short time there, I had 3 different managers, and felt as though I had little control over my career trajectory there. Would not recommend working there. They fired many people and have no loyalty."
bad,"No work-life balance, poor management. No career path or training provided. Work long hours, Contract staff might not able to continue the next renewal."
bad,Would not recommend working at IBM especially at the Boulder site.  It has been there since 1965 and the buildings look like Alcatraz but no water.  Too many other companies are taking over expensive site.
bad,IBM which was once a top 10 company is now trying to establish its place in this mobile market. Lack innovations and lot of attrition is hitting IBM badly.
bad,"IBM's Revenue has been declining for the past 20+ quarters.   "
bad,"In the early 1980s, IBM cared a lot for the people.  IBM would make an effort to balance the work environment.  IBM no longer appears to care.  IBM appears to make money more than anything else."
bad,Management shifts gear often and there is constant turnover. There is a lack of employee development and instead the focus is on the bottom line. There are no unified goals existing from the front line to top management..
bad,"When contracts end or are modified, there seems to be little to no regard for employees displaced. It creates a revolving door mentality for employee retention."
bad,"É possível aprender muito e crescer e alavancar sua carreira, porém é o menos salário da categoria, mas pode compensar pelos benefícios"
bad,"Jag var jätte glad innan sista tva år. Jag förståd det var inga transparency hos management. Om vi ha ett problem med first line, det finns ingen våg att prata med andra line management. Arbetade för ca 12 år, den sista 2 år jag hade dåligt smaka inom IBM. "
bad,"IBM is a most for least company.  Use them up, burn them out replace with fresh... unless you are a key contributor ie, developer or content creator, you have no long term value.  Quarterly layoffs, picked to maximize dollar savings regardless of impact on teams."
bad,"Poor management and leadership, not innovative, uninteresting place to work.  Benefits no longer very good, just average.   International Business Machines sure doesn't make machines -- or really much of anything of anymore.   Most projects involved outdated technology or required using IBM's own software vs. industry standard and open source.  Way behind in Cloud and modern application development."
bad,Work started at 7am to 3pm and I was given the chance to learned  and used SAP Data processing. With Fair management and Balance workplace culture and without any difficulty in the job we enjoy Team work.
bad,Work environment is difficult for focused work. Managers are aggressive and micro-managing. Agism is rampant. Many aren't happy. Workplace is based on fear.
bad,"Days are long and hard mostly because of the lack of communication and effective collaboration. Tools available and great but alot of instructions and directives are destructive to successful designing and launching of a product for the greater market. Products are often designed specifically for key early adopters and when timelines slip due to development teams lacking front end development skills EA often leave. This essentially halts progress on the product and results in a rapid, uncoordinated pivot."
bad,"We couldn't even give the product that I sold away for free!! You're require to produce regardless of the products in your bag. This can be very challenging at times if you don't have the right products (products that are fully baked, and address market needs)."
bad,"Unless you're right out of college or work outside the US, look elsewhere.  There are reasons why IBM is not a highly rated company to work for and why the stock has been stagnant."
bad,"Enjoyed working for IBM. "
bad,"Ambiente de trabalho agradável,boa comunicação entre funcionários."
bad,Don't agree with the strategy and direction the company is being driven. The decision are being taken with the least interest of the company. The very essence of innovation and trust is lost.
bad,"IBM is a mangers company."
bad,I don't feel IBM knows what how it wants to proceed.They change direction far too often and the employees suffer from it. The company is far to large and gets in it's own way.
bad,"Basically I performed several tasks simultaneously, and whenever necessary I needed to stop to perform other tasks that were brought urgently and with a higher level of priority. This forced us to leave the initial planning aside."
bad,"A long stretch of poor business performance has resulted in an environment where financial targets are met by letting people go.  When this continues for as long as it has, then you start letting go the knowledge and experience that keeps the business alive; and you can no longer attract the new talent needed to grow and to innovate.  IBM is at that point.  A clean sweep of the company's senior leadership could save the business."
bad,"I have over 25 years across various technical positions for a large security depository and post-trade financial services company (“The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation”). I started as a mainframe systems engineer and worked my way up to Systems Director managing the development, maintenance and support of various post trade settlement systems.  "
bad,"Moral was horrible. Good people who were leaving. Confused, disorganized management. Coworkers were good to work with until they weren't but more people left than stayed."
bad,"IBM always looking for new talent for critical jobs. "
bad,My pay is lower than the current market by about 50 percent.   Everyone was forced to take a 15 percent pay cut. No raise or bonus no matter how well you or your group performs for atleast the last five years.  Contractors forced to work 35 hours then get furloughed for weeks almost quarterly.
bad,"Always running from one project to another.  Company claims to be agile but don't adopt the agile practices.  As a group, we are understaffed and attempt to complete too much work.  As a result, we don't learn from our work experiences and adapt."
bad,"Dramatic change occurring at IBM.  While there is more emphasis on innovative technology, there is decreasing emphasis on forming relationships with clients. If you instinctively build relationships with clients, IBM is not the place for you, as relationships have been de-emphasized in favor of technology and products. Nor will you be in your role long enough for clients to trust you."
bad,"Poor management. In order to keep a job at IBM, the company would elect to bring in to our inside sales group people who were account rep's with no inside sales experience whatsoever. They knew nothing about the culture in selling with the inside sales team."
bad,"Due to the high volume of offshoring for IT applications, the morale was very low.  I survived 15 years of layoffs which created a very stressful work life balance."
bad,IBM has terrible management and it is a depressing place to work. Do not work there.I do not like IBM because the management is poor and nobody wants to provide hiring tickets for work.
bad,The only good thing in IBM is flexibility other than that there is nothing good. People are so selfish and company will give hike 8% PA. Atleast people working as sales man will get more than us.
bad,"Except WFH the company doesn't provide any benefits in terms of technology growth or Financial Benefits"
bad,IBM is a very large complex company.  Moving from one department to another is quite a difficult task and not easily adaptable to. While I like challenges and learning new areas of the business it is quite frustrating when co-workers are unwilling to help in your adjustment or when the business is un-necessarily complicated.  It's on the same lines as moving to a new company.
bad,"Long hours, heavy workload, back to back meetings, night conference calls (need to liaise with US counterpart). Good colleagues. Low budget, low chances of job advancement"
bad,"The employee does not care about contract employee. Made them to work like slave. No hike. Does not give any notice about project closure date. Any day, any time they remove the contract employee without any notice."
bad,"IBM has taken a new direction. Eliminate the older workforce and bring in less experienced, cheaper employees."
bad,"IBM as a company is no longer leading or advancing the industry in any meaningful ways. "
bad,No real direction from Executive Leadership.  There is often a shift in roadmaps.  The team does not have an opportunity to complete a project or take ownership of a project.  Each time there is a shift the deadline is set with no clear scope.
bad,"I enjoyed this place when I first got here. As things progressed it became apparent that IBM had stopped caring for the department. We were losing people and it seemed that management did not care, or try to get more people to replace them. Kept a positive attitude while going through this but hard to keep that when it seems the company does not seem to care about its workers."
bad,"The changeover in the management and towards organisation goal was too quick and too harsh to digest for few. Obviously a sense of insecurity has developed across the league. But that is only applicable for non-performers and ""not so flexible "" kind."
bad,The management culture and the HR organization leaves a lot to be desired. There are no proper career growth plan. Its all haphazard and it all depends on individual contacts and their contacts thereof. Merit is hardly recognized. Salary hikes and progressions are done erratically.
bad,"Pros"
bad,it was fun working with ibm and the work place was realy good and the staff was supportive my work was taking calls and helping the customer to trouble shoot I realiy liked my work management was good
bad,"Not satisfied there are many things changes and not proper interaction with the manager TL acts like CEO here. "
bad,"Terrible work place. There is no clarity on the scope of work. The environment keeps changing. There is no stability of projects. By the time you settle down, you might have worked on hundred accounts but added no value to none of the accounts."
bad,"* Job work / Life balance is very excellent with the homeworking"
bad,Many layers of management and it is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  Very difficult to get things done in a timely manner.  Not a good environment for a person who is a natural go getter.
bad,Toxic work environment at a company in decline with clueless upper management.  Strategic Initiatives which were supposed to set the company up for a great future are not working as planned. Legacy revenue is eroding due to lower cost competition. Future looks dim....
bad,Typical call center environment. Great training with great leader. Fun to work with work life balance. Accounts are stable but low pay and no promotion at all
bad,"Workplace plauged by constant threat of job force reduction to make profit levels for management. Have removed over 20000 employees in last 8 months. Pay is below industry levels and although supervisors and staff are great group, would not recommend joining company"
bad,"Was here for very short span, do not have much of a review. It was a good staffing company. Good management and transparent process. I was deputed at client location."
bad,"A declining workforce with low morale.           "
bad,"Building mainframes for manpower Low wages no benifits no time off no sick time.no room for advancement.some of the people are really nice and friendly and helpful,some not so much and a few are downright nasty"
bad,"Intern, I was doing my testing as a they kept extending my contract for short periods andi needed more than the time they were giving with no benefits"
bad,It was a good run at ibm.  the last few years have been awful where they do not care about their customers or employees.   They reorganize every 6 months and do not pay the sales reps for commissions
bad,"Good company to work for if you can build a good relationship with the manager, your growth is completely at your manager's disposal, decent pay and facilities. No work life balance, too much expectation from the employees."
bad,The company has no regard for it's employees. Employees are just a number and are picked not based on experience or quality of work but on how cheap their hourly rate is.
bad,"O problema da IBM atual é a transição de negócios da companhia."
bad,Good in learning but no job security for contract positions. People are good in helping you learn. Very good place for women employees. Have heard feedback about permanent position colleagues that salary hike is not good at all.
bad,I was very disappointed with my time at IBM. There are constant layoffs which creates a sense of fear in everyone and a very poor culture. I do not recommend this company and don't see a bright future for them.
bad,Where can find 100% Work and Life balance. the kind of project handled here is awesome. the technologies used here is great. we can actually learn so many things.
bad,Most of the time as a contractor I am force to be surrounded by negative people. I believe this company does not allow growth at all. There not fair treatment and there is a lot of favoritism
bad,"I was placed at a client-site by IBM to support the client and every time we had to do overtime, we weren't paid for it because of our salary level (even though other employees in the same salary range at other companies got paid for overtime).  We still had to claim the overtime so that the client would pay the overtime to IBM but we (the employees) wouldn't see a dime of it."
bad,"Don't count on having a long term job here if you live in the US. IBM continually ""reinvents"" their business to provide higher profits. If you are a professional hire you will find that you work a minimum of 30% OT. Benefits are steadily declining. "
bad,I was very happy when I got the offer letter but when I joined HR told me some policy related to increment in every six months. When the time came Management denied to such policies and dint appraised salaries of most of the employees.
bad,This company was a fantastic place to work before the mid 90's. They started to only care about the bottom dollar and not the employees. They took away so many great benefits. They set targets well beyond anything that could be attained. They made billions every year but didn't reach the targets so packaged people out quarterly.
bad,"Things are not as rosy as they seem from outside. Your survival and growth depends on how good you are with appeasing your immediate boss. There is 0% transparency in decisions. A great testimony to the culture is that the line HR does not visit the floor/team for more than 3 years despite sitting 40 yards away. It doesn't matter if you are a great leader and your team loves you, you meet your SLAs but if you ask too many questions then you are deemed as a threat."
bad,"Supporting Sales leaders, sales managers and Marketing heads with analytical insights, summary reports, detailed reports and brand specific reports if needed on a daily weekly and a quarterly basis."
bad,"Management driven company, no fun at work, there is nothing good I can mention. No good food, worst cafeteria, no transparency in IJP. Had worst experience of my life."
bad,Good company to work with IBM to excel your skill set and other multi task activities and nice way to approach management to show case you knowledge and good rapo
bad,"Lot of politics inside management. They doesn't value your work, on, less salary hike, no promotions, worst medical policies, No proper internal technology training for employees."
bad,"Most of budding Indian engineers will jump at the opportunity of working for a global giant like IBM. But the entry-level jobs at IBM have little to crave for."
bad,"•	Provide leadership to plan, direct and coordinate management program activities and key projects. Liaison with different vendors and procure the required Hardware and Software as per projects BOM, Get them setup in the Data centers and deliver to production."
bad,"nothing great. Working model for delivery is different from other service companies."
bad,I have to say I used to love IBM.  I bled blue.  But the last 5-10 years have been hard .  The company has forgotten that it was their employees that made them great.  I made it through over 50 lay off rounds and finally was axed myself.  I have every skill they need and just made to much money for their earnings reports.
bad,My typical day at work is check my emails about 15 min to see of any tickets or customer issues.  Then I check my ticketing queue to see if there is any new tickets. I update my tickets frequently and keep the customer updated that relates to the tickets.  I also close and update any changes/tickets that is in my queue.
bad,"Too many Technician"
bad,"The last 10 years have been cut after cut after cut.  Product quality and support has going down every year.    Almost everyone I know in the US has been cut / RA'd.  If you are over 50, the ax will find you."
bad,"here you have to make your manager happy so that you an be happy."
bad,We were overworked and underpaid for all the 80 hour weeks we worked and the entire project disemianated.  There was no leadership and no direction as to what we were buildfing.  The plans changed weekly and it was dificult to focus on a new concept every week.
bad,"Poorly Managed and has little hope of success.  Very large and has a poor character.  Hard to see how they will be successful, as the Senior Management only cares about themselfs."
bad,"good place to work and meet people with great knowledge. flexible and work at home. hard to get raises. slow on raises ..management is fair, co workers work for themselves."
bad,"IBM is less and less a good company each year. Most managers have less than 8 people, so the management team holds on to the managers to do the layoff work, then soon, they will cut the managers because there will not be enough employees to manage."
bad,Working with a pretty major client but pay is very low compared to industry peers. The job itself is challenging and you learn lots but IBM can definitely improve in their compensation
bad,"It Was good place to learn and with Friendly Environment."
bad,nice work balance no job security manageement is nice nice job culture good place to work too much pressure at work and target oriented job not employee friendly at all
bad,the RPO managers don't get it and don't know how to manage.  very confrontational with hiring managers of clients.  don't get why they take this stance.  this is why RPO/IBM lost the account.  I did work with an amazining team on the IT account and we rocked the account with hires that fare exceeded the SLA requirements that was beyond words on how we performed.
bad,"They hired me 6 months ago and now have eliminated my team and laid me off. It looked like a perfect fit with opportunity to grown into the Big Data/Hadoop area. Then, they laid off 14,000 people and I was one of them. Nice."
bad,"it is good."
bad,I would rather not comment on my review of IBM. The focus of IBM made it a place where the employee does not seem to be a prime factor in job satisfaction.
bad,"1. Day to day work isn't challenging"
bad,"When you consider the expression 'think outside the box', IBM built that box and they live inside it.  Decisions are top-down when they are done at all.  There is little room for ingenuity and lower levels of management live and die by their superiors.  Finger-pointing is very common as is passing responsibility.  There is no team atmosphere and people are only told what is needed to maintain their jobs, and sometimes not even that much."
bad,"IBM is focused on reducing costs through outsourcing and hiring college graduates. Its a good short-term strategy but definitely provides sub-standard services for the clients and is not sustainable."
bad,This was my entry into IBM and had a very successful career there and furthering my IT education. Offered me the option of travel and meeting co workers from around the world.
bad,Worked with a lot of experience IBMer's with a wealth of knowledge. Enjoyed my time as data center manager and my staff that supported.
bad,"IBM's strategy was to send Australian jobs off-shore."
bad,"Department I was placed in was constantly busy so I was not able to receive sufficient hands on training.  Asked managment and co-workers about my progress and what I needed to better, but did not get a helpful response."
bad,"great experience to have."
bad,"I was transitioned from a major financial institution to IBM when they outsourced their  IT Department. I was kept on to maintain the SAN environment, doing the same work remotely. We did a huge amount of SAN storage array and switch life cycles involving thousands of servers globally.  This means you are working nights and weekends as well as your day job and on call. As a regular employee you are expected to work at least 10% overtime, so that mark was easy to get to.  As a contractor you may have one or two weeks of furlough per quarter. "
bad,"My job, applications and myself were outsourced to IBM GBS.  I oversaw outsourced work that was then transitioned into IBM GBS, so the move was outsourced development to a new outsourced development organization.  The transition time period allowed by IBM was too short, leading to client dissatisfaction, missed deliverables and a ton of work trying to mitigate the information and knowledge gaps.  IBM continues to under perform because they are only interested in making the contract profitable; the company is run by the salesmen.  As such, they downsize application support and we lose folks we have just trained.  I will say, my job allows me to work from home, but I prefer an office setting.  IBM emphasizes, not work-life balance, but work-life integration, meaning you are working all the time."
bad,"No learning, like a government job. No hikes for years, no job growth either. Not a place to be in case you want to something more in life."
bad,"I'm working on a contractual job role for IBM Singapore client so it's more of a result oriented work environment."
bad,"no work life balance , working 18 hrs a day . "
bad,"You can work from home or office (when you are in town)"" "
bad,"Management keeps getting recycled into new technologies they don't know or understand (e.g. cognitive, AI), too many lines of business with competing interests to last the tale of time."
bad,"First line management is not well trained and will never be on your side. No support when dealing with customers that harass or degrade you. Constant removal of key people from your team in order to cut costs. Attempts to solve these problems will go unheeded, and the backlash will be merciless."
bad,"Some of the smartest people I ever worked with, but unfortunately company show a unique disdain for its employees.  Despite huge career growth in skills and responsibilities, I rarely saw promotions or raises.   I had to leave to get a significant raise and promotion."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work; however, in last many years had become a place to worry about work being moved over seas.  Each quarter was stressful to see if one's job would be moved.  Due to this culture, movement within the company was non-existent and left one stagnant."
bad,Freshers are not assigned proper work and they wont get a chance to learn but Women employees get good benefits.Good work life balance.
bad,Chaos - Very fast passed with management that does not know what they are doing.  The on-the-floor people are good to work with though.
bad,"Interesting company, people and ideas. It was a pleasure to work with creative minds and leaders in the industry. As a contracted / hired gun I witnessed cutting edge ideas and products before the public."
bad,Consistency in education is not maintined. Proper guidance to employee is NOT given. No other activites. No proper employee benefits.
bad,"we cannot spend with family "
bad,"This was my first job out of college, worked there for 3 years and the over all experience was great, however the last 8 months I was there was pretty bad."
bad,"Required to spend significant amount of time on Admin tasks which normally are done by dedicated departments (eg expenses management, timesheets etc). Annoying politics in place. Silly implementation and waste of money everywhere. No chance on pay rise, no Xmas bonuses or limited."
bad,"a good company to start, but it needs more management, some departments busy all year round, some are free all year round. But the pay is the same. And there is little balance between work and life."
bad,"N/A no pay for performance, reduction in workforce, increased workload. Pepsico transitioned all functions of financial services to IBM in November 2013"
bad,"I felt like more of exploitation of the workers . For example "
bad,"Their payment is way less than current market. It become a white elephant company. "
bad,"No work-life balance. Employees expected to be on call every weekend."
bad,"Many talented and ambitious come and go, no chance for any promotion. Company is very slow and way too much bureaucracy."
bad,Huge lack of job security and training for advancement.  Would be great to have more technical leadership to fully understand the staffing needs of it's clients.
bad,"Interesting place to work, spent five years learning a lot. Will be able to apply this learning to a move vibrant company."
bad,"The usual mix of meetings, e-mails, on-line messages keeps one pretty busy apart from the actual work that needs to be done."
bad,Working at IBM was basically an extension of my 22 years working at AT&T since we were outsourced to IBM. At AT&T learned most of my skills. Very goof company.
bad,"It was okay for a first job, its great to get the experience but not that great of a place"
bad,"I have been in IBM since March 2012. The work culture and employee benefits are very like compare than other organization."
bad,"Good to work as a new comer. You will get lots of training's, hands on to the system. Co -workers are good to you if you are good. Management is ok......"
bad,"Good working environment"
bad,FFIC  & Allianz France  gave me the first broad overview of  domain prospects and  I learned to work with big team .
bad,"good place to learn"
bad,"se realizaba  una atencion al banco y a walmart"
bad,"Monitoring servers and contacting supports for various accounts"
bad,"My department has become a place of complacency. The employees work hard, there is no doubt about that, but we do not see much support from management. We put in our 50 hours a week, checking our e-mails nightly making sure our client base is pleased with the work we put forth, but we are no longer appreciated by our management chain. Bonuses are gone, raises are a thing of the past and career growth is non-existent. IBM must change its ways, as its employees are growing weary."
bad,"Great people, but few benefits and no chance for advancement"
bad,"Ok Management"
bad,"Great for gaining initial experience. No loyalty though, down size pay and work."
bad,"Unable to meet revenue growth targets for 2015 road map in largest division, IT service delivery.  This was once their fastest and most profitable division but with competition with firms using cheaper labor offshore has gutted their ability to increase revenue and sign new business.  Job cuts and furloughs are constant.  Contracts are written with razor thin margins won with the hope of making money on the back end or using IBM infrastructure to gain efficiencies and often based on false assumptions.  Engagement teams and sales architects disengage after new business is signed and are not accountable for the success of the solutions and leaves delivery holding the bag when there are unrealistic customer expectations or wildly inaccurate labor cost projections (which end up causing furloughs and layoffs down the road) Contractors are furloughed and regular employees are laid off and or worked to death by additional responsibilities when team members leave and they do not allow hiring of replacements, no raises . .  and morale is BAD"
bad,"If you like a big company and very complex structure, this company is for you. Otherwise, try to stay away."
bad,The IBM people (colleagues) are great.  The management and management model is terrible and archaic.
bad,"Good Learning Environment"
bad,"The team was fantastic and the work was satisfying.  There was a lot of pressure to perform and solve the issue faster. "
bad,Company is so-so...but need alot more work done in terms of employee welfare and health benefits.
bad,High paced environment. Opportunities to learn new technologies and business strategy.
bad,A typical day is extremely fast paced and challenging.  The people who are left are great to work with and I've been blessed to work with and learn from some of the best and brightest people around.  The hardest part of the job now is that we are so short staffed that it's become virtually impossible to get the job done that needs to be done.   The division and the site I'm in has been shrinking / divesting for close to 10 years so it's time to step off this sinking ship.
bad,"More Pressure No gain"
bad,This review is specific to the GPS arm of IBM which I believe has not been sold to Concentrix. However for the few that were absorbed by IBM beware the managers if they are form the Daksh(GPS) business.
bad,"Pros - good job if straight out of college. "
bad,Its such a large company your just a number. Management is disconnected from employees. They are a multi billion dollar company but uses but use older equipment for their employees. The work environment is depressing. Employees do not seem to be excited to work for IBM. They are shipping most of their jobs over seas to India. They are not a technology company but more of a service company that penny pinches everywhere possible.
bad,IBM is a company that is trying to find itself. Low sales of products hardware has resulted in significant layoffs every year for the last 6-7 years. This trend appears to be continuing as the company refuses to invest in the distant future in order to save a 2015 target. The moral is at an all-time low and few people who work in the hardware development organization believe that they will be employed past 1-2 more years. The good news is that the pay is competitive and the working hours are flexible. The flexibility is nice and it allows most people to work the first 8 hours of their day from their office then they can easily transition home to take late night calls and prepare information for the next day.
bad,"Lo que màs me gusta del trabajo, es el equipo que tengo a cargo y como nos comprendemos para dar buenos resultados ."
bad,les collaborateur IBM se penait pour des super intéllignets
bad,"I started in Hardware test.It was a great place to learn SAN technologies, hardware and OSs."
bad,I do not recommend working here long term. It helps you get a foot in the door of technical support industry. I've learned quite a bit of level 1 IT work that was helpful for the time being. It helped me be better with customer service skills.
bad,"This center is new and the concept for support is amazing, however, there are many growing pains and they don't pay anywhere close to the industry standard for experienced professionals."
bad,"Working on reports, updating the team about the status."
bad,Not much to review. IBM became one the worst companies to work for on the Globe. Huge burocracy and lousy management.
bad,"Maintenance of facilities and infrastructure of the company. Ensuring safety, cleanliness and hygiene in the working environment, Monitoring and supervision of office premises, checking of daily/periodical maintenance activities of office support and taking actions accordingly."
bad,"The location was far out, they had no flexibility when needing to take time off or switch shifts. The pay was low, communication was little, training was minimal, and when you asked questions you got in trouble. there was no room for growth"
bad,"No aprendí demasiado y la empresa estaba mal gestionada."
bad,"No pressure on deliverables."
bad,"IBM é uma empresa onde voce tem hora pra entrar e sem hora para sair principalmente se for final de mês (na área onde atuo)"
bad,"ordinary place to work, poor management, poor utilization of talent"
bad,"Exposed to different roles and responsibilities which was good."
bad,"Systems adminstrations, program management, learned the business side of things, co-workers were awesome, global wide co-workers, worked with folks in India, China, Canada, Germany and Brazil."
bad,"When I started IBM in 2000, was a one of the best places to work.  There was employee still appreciation.  Those days are long gone and possibly never coming back.  Benefits are taken away each yr.  Pay is being reduced and work life balance is non-existent, as there are so few people to do too much work.  "
bad,"Nice team members"
bad,Working for IBM India Pvt Ltd. as Plans & Controls Manager – ( Operations / Project Estimation / Project Management Office-PMO) 
bad,"work only for values and nothing, not enjoyed , all things are ok ,"
bad,"IBM Portugal is not the right place to work if you treasure being participative, creative and have freedom of expression in all senses. It's pretty much like a dictatorial ship with a couple of dictators. "
bad,"Great experience and career builder, but only a short time stepping stone to your next job. No coaching, terrible management - perform on entry or be prepared to leave. Even if you do well, they make cuts without regard to value."
bad,El trabajo es facil de realizar
bad,"Typical day at work involves participating in endless conference calls where production is usually minimal. Management in the hardware areas are trying very hard to slowly reduce headcount in the US and increase headcount in our BRIC geographies. Advancement is nearly impossible in the workplace today. It typically takes 5-7 years to make it from entry level to the next band. No raises, cost of living, or bonuses again this year (IBM management cited the economic turmoil in Europe as the reason why we didn't receive any incentives). Everybody at work talks about the ""good ol' days"" of IBM when it was actually a good company to work for. I'm sure if 99% of the employees didn't have kids, a mortgage, and other responsibilities, they would have all left by now. The only good thing about this company is that you can do a lot of work remotely (from your your home office). If it weren't for that, I couldn't even fathom recommending this company to anybody. Pay is non-competitive, bonuses are unheard of these days, and a major lack of job security. Unless this is your only option, look elsewhere."
bad,It's good company for you if you join at band 8 and above.
bad,"Viver como terceirizado na IBM pode ser, profissionalmente, algo muito enganoso. Por um lado eles te cobram inovação, pró-atividade, etc...do outro lado, você não recebe promoção, não possui as mesmas regalias de um contratado, sendo segregado em cursos, acesso ao RH, etc. É uma eterna promessa de ingresso no quadro principal de funcinários, mas na verdade é uma tática para manter você sempre disposto e ""feliz"" por estar fazendo parte de uma das maiores potências do mundo no setor de tecnologia. Eles fingem que você será promovido e você acredita neles....esse é o processo."
bad,"You can learn a geat deal, because they push you very hard to learn a great deal."
bad,Picked up as part of a large outsourcing agreement. Many/most of the major long-term knowledgeable staffing has left the company or will soon. Dead-end job.
bad,"very stressful, but I enjoyed the work there. Kept ourselves busy"
bad,"'what have you done for me today? that's not enough. you're laid off.'"
bad,"ambiente veloce e scelte HR di tutto rispetto ma poi... ti lasciano a casa da un giorno all'altro pur di ridurre il personale, poco rispetto e chiedono troppo"
bad,Constant riding from upper management in very unprofessional emails. Literal profanity thrown around by upper management when unrealistic and impossible goals were not reached. Goals were so unrealistic that people quit instead of working 24/7. Middle management worked 24/7 or were terminated.
bad,"È un'azienda dove chi ha le carte in regola viene messo sullo stesso piano di chi non le ha e deve aspettare almeno un decennio se aspira a posizioni di management, anche medio. Le competenze, se non si continua ad esortare di frequentare corsi presso il centro formazione, crescono solo per oggetti interni difficilmente rivendibili sul mercato. I salari sono tenuti bassi e l'ambiente è ricolmo di impiegati poco motivati che non fanno una virgola più del dovuto: manca lo spirito imprenditoriale e, quando c'è, la maggior parte dei manager lo castra. Un ottimo parcheggio per gente che ha voglia di lavorare poco."
bad,"Numbers numbers numbers, dont care about employees no trust you need to be in the click and have blue blood in your body to progress up the line, and if you put family first your finished"
bad,Lavoro stressante e salari non adeguati. Management inadeguato. Meritocrazia assente.
bad,"Geen sfeer, veel bureaucratie, slecht management, onvoldoende communicatie"
bad,"No scope for career growth"
bad,"A highly process oriented company, which lags behind when it comes to employee benefits and rewards. The perks and compensation are low and way below market rates."
bad,"Initial days were very good"
bad,Managers do not listen and ruin the careers Of employee. They do not allow to change the projects.They want you to keep hovering around them to get into some good projects.
bad,layoffs changed the culture for the worst after 15 years was offered 2 months severance and 2 months training. Sad after all this time that's the best IBM could offer.
bad,"Years ago IBM was a great place to work... great benefits, cared about it's employees.  That has changed over the years and unfortunately, the employee is no longer cared about as it is all about the bottom line."
bad,"It is a sink or swim kind of culture, everything is about your productivity numbers no one cares if employees are happy, working toward personal career goals, or doing good work. All they care about is that you are being 100% utilized."
bad,Worked 12 hr days 7 days a week and it was more than expected but if we logged more than 10 a day we were reprimanded and actually told not to log what we worked. No real career planning for talent acquisition.
bad,"IBM works it's employees and contractors to death. They stressed me and called me after hours so much, I ended up with a pulmonary embolism. They work employees as much as the employee will allow them too, and contractors are *ALWAYS* pressed to work for free. Getting OT approved is viewed as asking to eat their children."
bad,"The upper management at IBM are clueless. They set goals that are impossible to achieve and then blame the peons when we fail. They lay off highly skilled employees only to replace them with low end contract workers who have zero experience. It's a fine place to work in your 20s and 30s but if you have any aspirations of retiring, from here, you can forget about it."
bad,"As exciting as it might sound to work for IBM, it isn't if you are a consultant. You are constantly asked to find assignments by people in charge of finding assignments for you. If you don't, you get fired one way or another. Partners exploit this desperation to their maximum benefit. "
bad,Poor upper level management has caused demise of micro chip industry for IBM that is why the division was given to Global foundry's at a cost of 2.5 billion to the company.
bad,"IBM was a decent Co. to work for however they transitioned my Department from Verizon two years ago and now have sold our group to a Vendor, which is one of their Entities, I need to find a Co that values its employees and compensates accordingly."
bad,"Used to be the best place to work with great benefits and culture. I learned so much from amazing coworkers. I had the privilege of working on many projects and products which built a solid career. Unfortunately over the last ~5 years, poor executive leadership and spineless middle management stripped out all that was good about the company in an effort to look cool and please stock holders. I and many others left to get away from the nonsense. I have many great memories of IBM and am proud to have been an IBMer but I cannot recommend the current version of the once great company."
bad,Lack of career advancement. IBM were looking to outsource the helpdesk and other support teams to India so the overall mood wasn't great among staff members.
bad,"IBM is a big name in the it industry it is really sad to see how the place is being run here in Cairo, there is not clear vision for any team and accordingly no future or a good career path."
bad,"If you're a contractor you'll be thrown out as soon as a cheaper employee becomes available. Management is political and incomprehensible, team scattered all over the world."
bad,"The Team-lead that was training me actually stole someones account that was pipe-lined to get the bonus associated with it. The environment was very hostile as the managers and the customer service representatives engaged in an endless array of curse words on a consistent and daily basis. i did not feel as though this environment was integral, nor were the people."
bad,There was always a fear of being fired. People considered management (although not managers and never expected to be managers) were expected to work overtime with no compensation.
bad,"Bien pagado,  pero debes tener disponibilidad de recibir telefonasos a cualquier hora y cualquier dia, no se respeta tu vida privada, durante semanas de mayor actividades trabajaras de lunes a domingo ... si lo unico que te gusta hacer en la vida es trabajar y hacerlo 12 horas al dia.... IBM es tu trabajo de ideal."
bad,"Working on customer sites ( High St Banks ) Fixing and servicing ATM's , The staff were often very busy but very pleased to see you. If you managed to fix the customer then the hard  part was done."
bad,"Hire to fire mentality. Everyone I started with (they have a training class) is gone."
bad,"I started at BlueWolf which had an awesome culture. Then I was pulled into IBM via acquisition. All benefits, as well as incentives, were immediately ended when IBM came in. No one at corporate was communicating with anyone in the BlueWolf office. It was basically herding cats in my entire time there."
bad,"Brand name is good for a start of work, but it's losing impact."
bad,"liked the work and fellow co-workers"
bad,There were always layoff rumors and they seemed to hit our organization every February.  This resulted in low morale.  Eventually our organization was sold to Lenovo.
bad,Was notified the day before that i was moving into another group within IBM. The group i was forced to move in was a hudge scale back where i would start my whole life career all over again. This affected about 50% of the field work force. Very unfair and this was used as a tactic to make you quit rather then they lay you off/offer a severance package for the the you spent with the company. Would never again work for IBM.
bad,"Environment depends on your manager. Some teams are great, others...not so much. "
bad,"IBM leads the way in term of allowing employees to work remotely, and to work on exciting projects.  Contracts cannot last for more than 5 years. "
bad,I was part of a outsourcing with IBM. The company took over our IT department and then downsized us after the shuffle with little to no notice at all.
bad,IBM has great core tech but struggles to leverage it into growth markets.  No aggressive model to offer client services to compete with Microsoft and Amazon - at least at the cloud level.
bad,"Great access to online training (earn badges)."
bad,Management is very miser. Employees are always looking for better opportunities outside. Work is quite stressful. Senior  management try to take away the pie leaving employees high and dry.
bad,"It's sad to watch a great company losing momentum but it's even more sad to it falling apart. "
bad,"Zero job security. You will be asked to relocate at some point in your career. You could have several different managers that do not agree on practices. Management allows employees to run the department. Meaning, they will not provide structure to the team. Working from home was nice but that has changed. They want everyone in the office. I deal with bad attitudes everyday. Employees are entitled and have zero respect for management."
bad,"Great team to work with, supportive network of colleagues. Middle-management appears clueless amid constant cost and head cutting to meet yearly targets. I was able to get deep into technical issues and understand the products I supported to a deep level. I got to travel a bit. Not sure how transferable these acquired skills were in the long-term though, now that I have been made redundant. Once the cuts really started to bite I found it difficult to progress my career outside of my immediate business area due to restrictions on movement between business lines."
bad,Old world company and customs. Treat employees as exchangeable resources not at firm IP. Top of the house management is blissfully unaware of how the culture is at the middle and bottom of the company
bad,"During my time at IBM there was a great lack of communication and clarity from management, the company vision was not followed or presented, and there was a total disconnect between the junior and senior workers."
bad,"Opportunities but cultural issues"
bad,I was under a contract with IBM for BP and I had to travel every week for work. It became miserable after awhile.  The management for the team was really good and the meetings to go over tickets was fairly short.
bad,"When I started at the company, the employee was that most valuable asset they had. Many years later, the employee became a number that was treated with little respect and would be disposed simply because it was good for the stock holders."
bad,IBM is going through significant transition. Its behavior are indications that it is still a financial engineering company rather than a technology company. It appears as if it does not support an older work force.
bad,"Be careful if they promise to hire you as a full timer but instead hire you as an LTS employee to ""get you on-board faster"". They will eventually leave you as LTS an drop you when the contract is up."
bad,"People join IBM for work life balance, that is assured but these days without any discussion they are forcing employees to work in client location."
bad,"At my assignment with IBM I was tasked with Unix administration for Carlson Wagonlit Travel who had outsourced all IT initiatives, this dates back to 2006."
bad,"Work at home, begin at 5:30am to mirror east coast times. Long days as the worldwide role I have also requires interaction with Asia and Japan colleagues which require evening conference calls"
bad,"Treated like you were never wanted."
bad,"-Very difficult environment"
bad,All work was done from home. We used messaging tools to connect with the rest of the team. I am self-motivated and get things done to meet schedules. When I need help I reach out to colleagues via telephone or messaging. I also help colleagues that need my help.
bad,"IBM is full of smart people and outstanding technology. But in my area, oil & gas, they have no real solutions and and ignored by most of the industry. Management has converted the company into an foreign workforce firm with US management.  They do not care about their people. And are in constant reorg due to their declining revenues ... though they may be finally stabilizing ... they cannot hold a candle to Accenture. Compare the financial and stock performance and it tells you everything."
bad,"In the 2 years of working for IBM I had 4 managers. Flexibility was the best part of my job, because I did different things everyday!  Account Manager had her favorites and if it wasn't you, it became a very long work day"
bad,Join only for salary and comfort. No HR here . Your manager is your HR. Not employee friendly. Annual increment is not fixed.Even can 2-3% increment annually.
bad,"IBM use to be a great company to work for. We got raises and bonus, they had tuition reimbursement, we felt and were told we were appreciated. Taking courses were optional, which gave us the opportunity for promotion. We had enough people to cover our duties and morale was high.  Starting in 2012, IBM took our 12 hour differentials and shift differentials away. IBM  no longer provided raises and bonus or tuition reimbursement. Lots of work with less people. The morale at IBM was and is very low. Each quarter we never knew if we had a job or not. People who moved on to other jobs at IBM got laid off soon after going to the new positions. IBM outsourced jobs offshore for less pay and to vendors, so they don't have to pay benefits. IBM use to give 6 months severance pay, then in 2016 when people got laid off they changed it to 1 month severance pay no matter how long people work for IBM. There was lots of unnecessary extra task and or duties that we had to do weekly, on top of our daily work duties. We were doing multiple task on each accounts with times and dates, that we did daily. We had to do mandatory completion of 40 hours courses, which we never used or had the opportunity to get promoted. Some people left IBM, either they found another job at another company or retired. People stayed because they needed a job or had so much time at IBM they dealed with the changes at IBM."
bad,"IBM as an organization is large and inflexible. There is a poorly defined set of governing values that promote an overall lack of corporate cultural alignment."
bad,"I was not impress with how IBM utilized resources to the best of their ability."
bad,"Although the pay was excellent, (through acquisition) , the systems were antiquated, and the leadership was lacking. I did get some excellent sales training. However the management was lacking and all about the numbers and not the people. The culture was hollow. The workspace was dreary. Hardest part of the job was working from home but being on the phone from before sunrise to after sunset."
bad,IBM has become a run of the mil company. They do not try and manage resources. They quickly lay people off to meet the bottom profit line. There is no respect for the individuals.
bad,"Dia típico:"
bad,"Poca carrera laboral posible, ambiente con baja comunicación."
bad,Great Place to start your Career! Great opportunity to Learn and grow from many experiences such as being exposed to different projects and travel all over the country.
bad,"El ambiente era muy competitivo, a pesar que solo Había que atender llamadas,  habia que hacerlo en ingles y los superiores no ayudaban,  para realizar de la manera correcta,  te hacían sentir mal,  con comentarios para nada simpáticos."
bad,"IBM has a great reputation but living off past. One great advantage is the benefits package IBM offers. "
bad,"IBM is a large organization with over 350,000 employees. The culture and work life balance is dependent on the group you are in and your individual team.  In my experience, I see IBM as a very hierarchical environment characterized by politics and one where there is a lot of old, traditional attitudes and thinking."
bad,Employees who are acquired by IBM via acquisition do not have as many opportunities to move around within the company.  I do like the training and wealth of technical information to be found within the company.
bad,"I was brought into IBM Global Business Services as part of an outsourcing from AT&T in 2005. I was a good soldier, and ""embraced the change"" as I had been advised, by IBM management. They said innovation was in IBM's dna. Fast forward 8 years, and I'm still doing the same thing for almost the same pay."
bad,buen ambiente laboral y buenas instalaciones solamente no hay suficientes dispositivos para laborar mejor
bad,People are too political and has got a very bad work culture. The salary is not that good and you dont get good hikes very year. Managers doesn't care about you and sometimes they dont deserve to be managers
bad,"Rampant mismanagement.  Worst in my long career by a wide margin.  Dated in every way.  Very expensive benefits.  Didn't even supply coffee."
bad,"good food in the canteen. high security means no phones allowed, minimum wages, no benefits, one must own a car or use bus 38 only. the place is very far from Dublin city center."
bad,"Our medium-sized business was acquired by IBM about 20 years ago.  I stayed with the company until I saw that many of our jobs were getting outsourced, and I was becoming disillusioned with the tech industry.  After I left even more downsizing had occurred and it is now a shell of its former self."
bad,"Fantastic people, great ability to work away or at home but not a company to build trust with employees. Big push to remove UK resources and recruit 80% of UK staff from Poland and India - this means the UK resources are stretched"
bad,It is not a place I would recommend.  They constantly reorganize and overwork their employees.  They don't respect the time and effort put into the business.
bad,Hi churn of employees which makes the environment highly cut throat especially as multiple teams or essentially doing the same work.  Lots of corporate red tape which makes it difficult to do your job effectively.
bad,"Very uncertain company future; poor transparency from all levels, little opportunity to do interesting work. No agency regarding placement within Services area and type of clients you will pursue. Company provides little support to help find project work or train for needed skills."
bad,"I want to see senior management consider eliminating routine resource actions and focusing more on long term growth. There is too much focus on quarterly results at the expense of strategic planning and growth. "
bad,"During my 14 years, it became an increasingly difficult place to work. Layoffs occurred almost every year. Finally they made a concerted effort to get rid of older, higher priced employees and I was hit. There are many things IBM is doing right - blockchain, security, AI, etc., - but they need to refocus on customer service, which means refocusing on employees. Morale was low when I left. If you are young and energetic and creative, it may be a good stop for a few years. Good luck."
bad,"IBM now, at least in the Security space, is like a massive startup - namely because IBM acquired startups and let their respective cultures remain. I like the work I'm involved in, but feel that the company is too big, at times."
bad,"Long hours, tough clients however an innovative company with a focus on new solutions, offerings and services. Complex environment but a rewarding experience and great place to start a career."
bad,I appreciate the opportunity IBM gave me however at times management didn't understand the scope of the work we as programmers were doing. None the less my job got completed
bad,"You will not get learning opportunity if project is not good and technical leads in my project are very narrow minded and will not expose."
bad,"Job work life balance is excellent"
bad,IBM acquired the tech company I worked for and brought in a psychologist to convince us workers this was a good thing and that we may stay if can prove our role as vital to the company.  It was a terrible time and a cut throat atmosphere ensued as one person tried to undermine the next in hopes of being kept on and not lay offed.
bad,"I was an intern at IBM. very disorganized, without any plan, week management, but everything depends on which department you are in and which project you are working on"
bad,the level of accounting here was underestimated. everything is counted and measured. it was an unpredictible place to work with poor leadership on all projects and difficulty in finding an opportunity that didn't involve significant travel. 100% travel was expected and it was difficult to find a good balance. Saw several RA (layoffs) where people doing their jobs and meeting their numbers were let go. Not a place to plan a long career around. Good for starting out but experienced folks find it frustrating.
bad,"If working directly for IBM, the pay is not great. Better as a contractor, however the benefits are fantastic.  Large number of layoffs occurred with this employer. Hundreds within one site.  Management was not wonderful at the time of this employment, but has improved since returning."
bad,There is a change in the company culture which was not a fair measurement of individual contribution to client revenue.  There is a new direction that the company is taking which conflict with current business.  That transition to a cloud provider while maintaining current on prem business is critical to long term success.
bad,"I'm not going to waste my time breaking down everything wrong with this place. False promises, low pay, and you are very expendable."
bad,"This was a decent entry level position (first job out of college), but I know very few people who still work there. Most people wanted to leave after a couple years."
bad,"I worked 3 months for IBM Dublin and during that time felt that I cannot do my work properly with the given tools and team. I did not have time to have my brakes as they were timed and I was usually at phone with customer when my brake started. There was no flexibility within team and team members attitude was not good. There were tasks given to 1st lever technical support that should go straight to 2nd level. Often 2nd lever did not have nothing to do, while 1st lever worked too much. Good thing was that days off were given plenty and also the fact that I was payed every two weeks."
bad,"Constant Lay offs, you have no idea when or how many people would be laid off.  Could care less about employees only stock holders."
bad,"* Typical weekend and on call"
bad,"I loved my job, loved my company, worked very hard for success of our clients.  Then IBM  came along, they only care about the stock holders, clients and employees come last.    If you can get away from IBM prior to them determining your role can be done cheaper overseas then run do not walk."
bad,You never know if you still have a job the next day at IBM. Management are clueless on employee relationships. Very hostile environment to work in. Stay Away!!!
bad,Realmente mi opinion es constructiva ya que entre a trabajar por agencia y el personal que es IBM  es de un trato discriminante viendote como que no funciona el area por ti.
bad,Lack of executive leadership in driving the success of the company.  Culture is more negative than positive.  Employees are treated as an expense and you feel like they are always looking for ways to get rid of people rather than investing in them.
bad,Current environment is completely focused on saving money by globalizing their workforce to cheaper geographies even when those resources have less skill.
bad,Was assigned to Sprint account which was very very heavy on phone calls.  The facility did not have enough working equipment and personal needs facilities making it harder to perform ones duties.
bad,"Au fil du travail les conditions de travail se sont détériorées, c'est regrettable."
bad,Good place to work but no grow Career wise. No Hikes and no grow in company. Doing the same job life long also no promotion. Here most  enjoyable part flexible and most paining part is no salary increment and no promotion.
bad,"The job was great for a few years, the RA came from above and that was it... several great developers lost prominent positions which supported the product and now the customers are not satisfied by no support.  I guess the catch 22.  With the loss of the people who wrote the software comes the lack of support which leads to loss of customers.  IBM.  I now where a bracelet that says ""What Would Warren Buffet Do"" (wwwbd)"
bad,"No two days are the same. Lots of Really really good people, and led by  weak Sr mgmt who are 100% driven by finance and maximizing thier personal compensation"
bad,"Give opportunities to learn and grow, very flexible work culture. Work life balance is good."
bad,A lot of people have quit working at the datacenter due to management running the place using fear. This  is not the place to be unless you like to be ran by fearmongering.
bad,"* The are still trying to reinvent the wheel. "
bad,"You fear for your job every day, you have to work 14 hrs per day to get all the work day, the weekends are typically filled with mind numbing work.  Unbelievable personnel policies that make traveling for your job a miserable, horrible experience.  So my advise is go there to learn, take all you can to become as good as you can and leave as fast as you can thereafter.   Worst of all, they constantly rip you off on your paycheck.  Changing the rules in December and grandfathering them to when ever your compensation period was (Jan of that year, or July of that year) so you make no bonus by the end of the year is a common practice so that the profit margin is made and the big bosses get their bonuses.  Happens every year......."
bad,"Had a great run here until I realized they were no longer willing to pay to keep the higher skilled marketing/communications/writers around. Jobs are available at the lower band levels, but not upper band levels. No room for advancement. Why would I go back level? Poor corporate content strategy and poor upper level management. Not enough resources to do the work. Co-location doesn't mean ""back to the office."" It means ""move where we want you to go, or be let go."" I'll gladly take the latter."
bad,"One step above a sweat shop.  Every day felt like walking into a prison.  They spent no time considering the fact that human beings worked there.  Pay was incredibly low with no benefits.  Very quick to dock pay if you are 1 minute late, but don't pay extra if you stay extra time.  Didn't even have the consideration to provide a coffee pot and I had to walk half a mile to another building to fill my water bottle with anything other than the awful tasting water fountain water.  I would highly recommend everyone stay away from this company."
bad,"Not a pay master"
bad,nice job culture. job environment is very good. Many new things are there to learn. But now I am looking forward for my career growth so wants to move on.
bad,"IBM is an intergral part of my life , where I got to learn a lot. technically I have learnt a lot of things."
bad,Very stressful place to work in. There are no training for new hires. IBM doesn't provide internal training for its employees. They believe a person can learn by taking live calls after they pass certification tests.
bad,"C level execs do not care about their employees or any long term prospects for the company, only continuing their core competency of financial engineering. "
bad,Very haphazard due to so many acquisitions in the cloud computing space. There is nothing standard across the entire business unit and this creates confusion on a worldwide scale
bad,I work with great IBMers! My co-workers are some of the smartest people I've ever met. The dress code casual so there is no stuffiness and people are comfortable with themselves.
bad,IBM at the time I was there was not investing in there consulting groups and they were trying to run it like any other business.  There was no room for advancement.  The partner at the time were just focused on there own needs and not anyone else.  There was no team building or events held to be able to network with other IBM people other then your project teams.
bad,Poor strategy to revive IBM's marketplace. Need lot of shakeups from top to bottom and across the shores. I feel IBM will spin off as a new services company very shortly. I don't believe IBM's investors will accept the decline anymore though Profitability is lot better than many of the other service providers in the industry.
bad,The culture of that past in not longer!. Just search RA (reduction in force) what they call Lay-off's and you'll see the calamity of this Company's self imploding strategy.
bad,I like working there.  I just would like to have more job security.  I do not know where this company is going and management does not tell you much in that area.
bad,"I worked hard during my time there then one day find out, I was being laid off with no warning. I was able to take with me that at the end of the day you are just a number for the company."
bad,"IBM Malaysia is great work place for those who want flexible working times such as working moms, but not a good place for employees who want to experience enthusiastic and extensive tasks. It's hard to develop your own ability in this place."
bad,"IBM tries to employ good methodologies and project management practices, but is not good at managing intellectual capital. There is significant amount of ongoing contention about product and services strategy. There is not a heavy investment in skills development. The hardest part of the job is managing work-life balance that is widely espoused, but not practiced. The best part of the job is the friendships that I have made with peers and managers who have been great."
bad,"Pros- work from home, technology changes almost instantly so information comes out internally for consumption on your time. Hard to progress upward."
bad,There is no real management for employees. Departments refused to communicate or work with each other. May as well try to bring peace to the middle east trying to get assistance from someone.
bad,"IBM is prestigious leading-technology multinational company with a great history. "
bad,"The company I worked 7 years for Kenexa, was purchased by IBM. I spent my last three years working on the integration. The integration was a nightmare. The IBM integration team sold us on tools that didn't work well with our team and presented us with limited options. Later on we found out there were additional options that would have worked way better for our team but had additional costs. It was as if the person in head of the integration was going to receive a bonus if he kept the integration under a certain budget but unfortunately the teams are affected well after the integration was completed as they were stuck with tools that did not meet their needs. Additionally IBM paid their employees way more than Kenexa, and IBM took over 2 years to give any of the Kenexa employees raises while hiring new employees at the IBM rate. So new employees with no company experience were getting paid more than people who had worked there for years. There was also so much process to everything that it took forever to get anything done especially since a lot of the process was not well documented. I stuck around as long as I could as I had made a lot of great friends at Kenexa who still worked there but after a while it was not worth it. I left the company without even having another job lined up as I couldn't stand working there another minute. I needed a vacation after busting my butt for ten years only to have IBM come in and wreck everything I helped to build. I had achieved Directorship for my achievements at Kenexa which came with many perks including stock options and stock awards,"
bad,"Das Interesse des Unternehmens liegt heutzutage nicht mehr in den sogen. ""etablierten Ländern""."
bad,Employees are stretched thin but are usually valued for their contributions. Jobs are fulfilling because you are given the opportunity to solve big problems. Company can be slow to make decisions
bad,This job required extensive travel and long hours.  Executives will stab you in the back first opportunity they get.  Don't trust them.  Working with customers was rewarding and provided much satisfaction.  Co-workers were awesome and I will miss them.  Constantly changing organization structure and constant expansion of required skills and knowledge made keeping up with job demands difficult.  Never felt appreciated for effort put into this job.
bad,This position requires efficiency in multi-tasking due to the fast-paced nature of the environment. Communication by email and other methods is necessary to better serve the foreign nationals we file petition for.
bad,"Despite delivering EXACTLY what was requested, contract was terminated with vague reasons given ""performance just not good enough""."
bad,"L'esperienza di lavoro è stata stimolante, dando la possibilità di vedere delle realtà molto dinamiche e con tempistiche molto ristrette, quindi cercare efficenza e sinergia fra tutti i reparti impegnati alla mission aziendale."
bad,"Very top heavy organization, more managers than working employees. New ideas and requirements seem to be forced on to employees with little regard as to whether they offer any benefit or are even remotely relevant to ones situation."
bad,Hours made me physically sick.  Equipment way too old.  Doesn't feel like anybody cares about you.  Training was near obsolete.
bad,"Desenvolvimento profissional excelente, profissionais bem qualificados."
bad,Lot of opportunities to learn. Very extensive process driven and every single action involves filling in numerous forms.
bad,"WASTE and its waste of time working here specially in IBM India , no good project and there is too much manager politics regarding salary and job . WASTE of time ."
bad,"1. Great experience in team handling"
bad,"IBM doesn't have welfare and they will never secure your job, poor management especially in employees skills utilization."
bad,A good and reputed company in throughout the world and loads of online  learning opportunity. Management structure needs to transparent .
bad,"Good place to learn a lot of career related things, but management rules on the employees."
bad,"Management decisions are quiet stubborn over here!"
bad,"Constant demand to increase billable hours with lots of travel, no regard your personal life and vacation, leaves no time for education or career development"
bad,"Each person is responsible for his or her own action. Work load doesn't matter. Co-workers are great to be around, but management is usually to busy fighting with the client. The most pleasant thing about this job is the team you work with."
bad,"Constant down sizing, no stability.  Great education and training but borders on too much.  You feel like you are drinking from a fire hose.  Processes change so frequently it is hard to keep up. Hours were flexible however work life balance was beyond terrible and zero flexibility to work remote.  Not ideal for families with young children."
bad,"Good Place , with good colleagues . Scarcity of skilled , knowledgeable resources for Off-Shore Projects . Reporting Mangers are not good people managers , and hardly bother for work life balance . "
bad,Manufacturing side of the company offers little advancement.  Bottom line was always production.  Constant threat of layoffs.
bad,"Fun work place but no salary increment for at least couple of years, The management is very slow in terms of response. Decent amount of politics, But being an big company HR fails to address all these employee issues."
bad,"Inept leadership stays in place while those who actually do work get fired. Despite the marketing pitch, the various product and service lines do not work well together."
bad,Its a fun company to work at. You get to learn a lot. It is best especially at the beginning of your career. The growth here becomes stagnant after a certain time.
bad,"Nice work place for ladies, we get option to work from home, work from other location. Managers are very approachable. But compensation offered is very less."
bad,"IBM Security Services is unquestionably the worst division to work in. Known internally for it's arrogance and vindictive culture. Lacking direction and the worst working culture I have have had the misfortune to work in. Many of the people I met either knew no better or where counting the days to retire, on what once was a good pension,or both.."
bad,"O ambiente é totalmente agradável, colegas de trabalho de diferentes andares e cargos humildes e educados, uma empresa ótima para se trabalhar. Porém, o setor ou andar em que estive é onde a rotatividade é super alta pelo fato da promoção para outro setor ser quase impossível, pois é disputada com todos do andar e exige no mínimo dois anos de empresa e o estresse adquirido com o atendimento ao cliente é muito grande. Outro ponto a ser lembrado é que não informam na entrevista e no momento da contratação, que você será obrigado a trabalhar em feriados e finais de semana e, caso não vá, ficará queimado."
bad,"Get ready to work...A LOT!  If you cannot work over 50 hours a week, this is not the company for you.  If you cannot work with very stringent SOP's, this company is not for you.  "
bad,"The boulder site was a very interesting place to work the technology was good and there was good training facilities. This is one of the companies that makes America one of the greatest countries in the world, its amazing. However, they were very unfair when it came to giving promotions. they are some good fair managers however most of them in my opinion think black africans are supposed to be their servants and high positions are for whites only. I think this is the case all over the world until we build our own civilization I guess we will have to go through this. I wouldn't recommend this site for young africans trying to build a career in IT however it can give you the skills to get your foot in the door at another location that is friendlier and accommodating to africans thats if there is one. Its a lot better than most of the places I've worked at but coming here in an open mindset will lead to disappointment."
bad,24 hour a day seven days a week job only to be sold to a Chinese company. No employee loyalty left. All of the old attractive benefits are gone.
bad,"Work in my current Organization is very cool and very knowledge gaining."
bad,Not growth in professional. Only copy paste and Data entry work.More politics in work and management. Burden is not dispersed in the team equally.
bad,"The job entailed planning and budgeting and preparing MIS reports for Twitter(IBM Client). The job profile was of an individual contributor however I was given work load of a manager with eight reportees. The work shift was at night and the place was quite far from my home location. The management was not very friendly, however the co workers were very friendly and provided great company at work. It was not a good experience to work at IBM."
bad,I had a hard time working at IBM.  I was just a number.  IBM is way too big to have any kind of personal interaction.  I worked out in the field.  I worked I got pay.
bad,"Despite having a large name, working for IBM is a mixed experience.  Though the benefits are good, it is hard to work rotating shifts and to be on call 24/7.  It is not for everyone."
bad,"Management is not good."
bad,"7.5 years before employees used to get free tea/coffee. Now no free tea or coffee. Before management was managed by less political people. Now management is very much political. "
bad,Not a good place for moral anymore. Laying off people left and right.
bad,"Job profile was good but too much work load which is not designated"
bad,"Talents are not respected anymore, and a lot of good people are leaving the company. The management cares more about their interest and job security instead of advancing their staff and look out for their interest."
bad,"Good Company"
bad,Terrific opportunity to learn and work with talented and interesting people from all over the globe.
bad,"Good Organization for senior management. "
bad,I worked on the year in this company. My Team is always busy during month ends. Have contacts with finance team. My process was migrated to Malaysia.
bad,"hectic, one cant make out balance between job  work & life there."
bad,I'm disappointed with the direction IBM has taken in the last few years. Customer satisfaction doesn't seem to be the primary business driver as once was. Loyalty to IBM employee's who helped build the company are no longer valued.
bad,"long 10 hour shift,tiring transportation,unreasonable stress on work"
bad,"Learning Management System is very good"
bad,"The job ad said Java Application Developer at IBM, and it described what sounded like a Java Application Developer position - including coding in Java. I took a pay cut of $13,000 a year for a Java Application Developer position."
bad,"great organisation,. great emhasize on the work but employee oriented and working in an ethical  behaviour"
bad,"IBM is a cheap (s h i t) company to work for, they will ask for everything but almost nothing in return except below average salary. I won't recommend to work at any IBM call center unless you have no other choice!"
bad,"I was, variously, a project manager, people manager, technical writer, and information architect during my time at IBM.  I worked on large-scale, enterprise software, such as DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows.  I liked the work, and I did well, for the most part; I was at the band 9 (out of 10) job level when I left.  "
bad,". Working for 18 hours when a critical issue arises"
bad,The only postitive part is that one may expect long term carries if has right connections.
bad,"Workload is heavy but not to far off then what other company's have."
bad,I learn an lot from others around me and my peers. My peers are very friendly and are ready to help you. I always try to be example to my reportees and others. In my current project my work life balance is not very good. Work timings are bad and don't get time to spend with my family.
bad,"Team work, collaboration, sharing our views, learning, Email etiquette, values"
bad,Good company overall but you work some intense hours that does not leave you much time to do anything else.
bad,This was my first job out of school and I immediately realized why their new hire retention was so terrible.  The only management interaction I had was when things went wrong but when you are doing well and saving the company money you hear nothing.  My mentor recently received a national energy savings award for his work in chilled water and cooling towers saving the company hundreds of thousands a year.  They repay him by laying him off a few months later.  The management has very little idea on what's going on towards the bottom line. 
bad,We do real great work for the company and make a significant difference to people
bad,sempre disponibile e in ottimi rapporti con colleghi e titolari
bad,"The good engineers are gradually leaving."
bad,Company provides balanced work life with very less growth rate.
bad,Don't take my ratings on 100% - i was a contractor there. Very good name to put in your CV. Remarquable company culture and princciples.
bad,It was a good experience working within a large team and a huge environment.
bad,Pro:
bad,IBM GPS is a different organization as compared to the original IBM. It horribly lacks leadership. Has a long way to go in establishing itself as a 3rd party BPO organization. Its policies are not suited for a 3rd party business operations.
bad,"A typical day at work starts with reviewing Client's (Alberta Health Services) orders. Then Classifying them to the priority through a data-base that the triage team use and passes to the project team.It continues with arrangements for technicians, getting feed back from client and at the end gather the information for the amount of works that has been done to prepare the monthly financial report."
bad,"No advancement horrible work hours. I did not learn anything. co-workers worked in other states. the hardest part of the job, no work."
bad,"good team spirit that we construct.a day at work is only work,nothing else...taught me to move out of college life and made me a true professional.being ranked as the top performer is the best feeling...hardest part of job are the rotational timings,night shifts.enjoyable pat are the fun fridays that we host,and the appreciations that i got at work.."
bad,"IBM is known for how harsh the work environment is, being very ""dog eat dog"". Pressure is high constantly, with very little reward. The people I worked with are all wonderfully skilled, professional, and fabulous people, but the company drove us all relentlessly, with zero concern for well being. The people I worked with, in all the departments across the years were the best. Management was also wonderful people, but every year, I would have new managers. The last few years I had an average of six new managers each year. Attrition and layoffs were to blame. Benefits were good in regards to health care, and unlimited sick days. The hardest part of the job was the stress and unrelenting pressure to perform."
bad,Overall OK place to work BUT:
bad,"I worked for MMC Group, which was inside the ACS building in Sandy, UT. It was a pretty run of the mill call center. In addition to taking help desk calls from the U.S. Forest Service we also took calls from the ACS side of the house, which involved taking questions from people in several states about their states EBT (Food Stamp) cards. Of the two, the Forest Service calls were much more fun and rewarding."
bad,Everything is tied to being billable 110% of the time.
bad,"Led and drove any IT Security projects to help improve and meet corporate audit compliance requirements. Reviewed and revised to improve security policies between IBM and customer accounts after recommendations from corporate auditors. Supported my current team with co-workers to perform any projects, newsletters, education sessions, wiki publishments, and some more. Reviewed, upgraded and standardized global processes to improve the audit compliance requirements (one of challenges to perform the task)."
bad,Management at IBM Sucks now they are treating employees like bonded labour
bad,INSERTING WAFERS INTO DIFFERENT TOOLS. Management doesn't work very well to convert people to perminent employees. Co-works are great. The hardest part of the job is: Reading the tiny scribes that are on the wafers. The enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with everyday.
bad,"If you live outside of the US or are looking to move to a ""growth market"" country then IBM might be the place for you. However, if you're a US employee then it seems inevitable that you will eventually be let go or will leave on your own. Money is EXTREMELY tight within the company. There is no budget for managers to motivate their teams. Raises and promotions are far and in between. The appraisal system is tied to the budget, so if the budget is small, employees are given poor appraisals even though they don't deserve them. The politics are horrible. Top performers leave because they are not appreciated, and everyone else is eventually let go. The only people that seem to be happy are those who take assignments in the growth market countries. IBM's strategy is to build over in these countries, and US employees willing to go over and get shops set up seem to be rewarded handsomely. The only good thing left for US employees is the flexibility. Managers expect you to be available at any given time, and in exchange, they are pretty good about letting you choose the hours that you work. Also, most groups (besides Software Group) allow employees to work from home."
bad,"1. Good work life balance"
bad,"Empresa que possibilita contato com time global, porém não tem perspecitva de carreira"
bad,I did internship and not interested to work in IBM. I didn't get to learn much as I was in documentation and it was more time consuming and less learning.
bad,Too slow to adapt to the new world. Too slow to the IT industry. Too slow compared with other IT companies. Too slow to find new direction. So it's just to slow.
bad,"IBM has gotten way too big for its own good. It is incredibly difficult to navigate around since they recently implemented a flexible work from home policy. Because of this, IBM has a plethora of unused office space (which is likely costing a fortune), making It very improbable that you'd ever work in the same room as your team -- completely inefficient."
bad,"there is no process and most of thing happen on verbally ,no email and no plan for any task ."
bad,"Work Culture is good but when it comes to salary and incentives IBM doesn't seems to be supportive and the management is not good in taking decisions."
bad,I worked from home and almost never heard from my manager. They never seemed to take any interest in advancement or any kind of job security. Overall just very inattentive. Was at the home office only once.
bad,After knowledge transfer they laid us off and outsourced it to call center in India. Then they transferred us to another msp company to support the clients and they started to lay off people
bad,"Good company depending on project/manager, not a very good experience with the person managing the project which was taken by the client eventually because of poor management."
bad,Very displeased after acquisition by IBM.  Client success and satisfaction became unimportant to IBM.  Clients had paid for and were receiving white glove service until the acquisition by IBM.
bad,"Difficult to change jobs and gain experience in other areas of the business.  Year over year declining revenue resulted in annual ""resource actions"" (layoffs) which contributed to poor morale."
bad,"The company does not really seem to know what it's doing right now. I support three products, none of which are really being sold by our sales team. Instead, the team is pushing a new product, which is fine, but for some reason, our manager is reluctant to help us train on the new product, which we are totally qualified to support."
bad,IBM shuffled our jobs after purchasing our company's IT department to India. They are all about revenue so if you dont mind working for someone purely revenue driven with no though of their employees this is the place for you
bad,No Appreciation and salary hike . Its always manager driven company and there is no importance for hard work and talent. IBM has to invest more on talent and need to pay industry standard compensation packages for its employees
bad,"I was employed by IBM but worked strictly at a client location (CenturyLink).  My corporate culture was that of the client, not IBM."
bad,"The best thing at IBM was working remote option. Long hours, no overtime / on salary increase. "
bad,"IBM is massive, and you feel that while working there. Even on a good team, it was easy to feel disposable or simply like an employee number on a spread sheet. Hard to get the tools required (software or access) without week-long or month-long delays."
bad,"There are very less SAP projects in IBM, No proper leaders or manager due to with there is impact on daily work. Pay is less, Payslip is not straight forward."
bad,My job was ok. I came from another background and it was totally different than what he job description stated. I think management needs an overhaul and more opportunities should be provided for everyone.
bad,"I've heard stories about how amazing a place IBM is, or rather was.  My original company was acquired by IBM in 2006.  For the next several years, we kept getting a new manager every few months.  Someone joked IBM meant (I)ve (B)een (M)oved.  IBM did not invest in the future of our product.  No new money was spent on features, technology or training.  Our Windows desktop application never implemented multi-core processing, a web-based UI, a mobile platform, or any cloud-based technologies.  At least once a year, our department (less than 10 people) was downsized by a full person.  I don't know what IBM gets out of acquiring technology that they don't support in any meaningful way.  We had thousands of customers and a great revenue stream, but laying people off, or trashing entire departments, seems to be the corporate mantra.  I don't get it."
bad,"Business units and organizations within IBM were structured in as competitors, not collaborative. Too much time spent in completion for clients and services with other IBM business units."
bad,"Average Work place. Compensation is not great, No Hikes, No promotions, not too much to explore when it comes to skills. I was not given a chance to pick up a skill which i desired even though there were some openings there"
bad,Very disappointed with this company they have showed me there true colors 23 years with TSS and they over night moved 300 folks all over to GTS with the assumption and promises of a job well the job offered with band cut to take it or leave it in Iowa or forced to resign
bad,"I came to IBM via an acquisition.  At first, far more fun.  The only way they make their numbers is on the back of the employees - layoffs happen continuously.  No job security."
bad,"Many contracts sold understaffed (such as 1 network resource to do install projects and 24&7 support at customer's multiple physical facilities)."
bad,"Trabajé allí 3 años a través de una ETT. Cuando finalizó mi contrato inicial me dijeron que no querían contratarme directamente (que es, obviamente, su derecho legítimo), pero tuve que denunciarles para que me pagaran la indemnización correspondiente, porque no era ""fin de servicio/ obra"" como ellos quisieron alegar. La ""obra"" era estable (de hecho, si no me equivoco todavía sigue 3 años después de que me despidieran), y por tanto, lo mío era un despido improcedente, y me correspondía una indemnización superior. "
bad,"Though the Company is a well reputed organization in the world, it doesn't have standard pays and the management is too worst. people doesn't care about the concerns of the employees. People mangers doesn't bother about the employees concerns. Career Conversation and other programs are only meant for show casing there is no use at all. It wont encourage the employees to learn new things. Management doesn't allow the employee to grow in career."
bad,"Once management changed, things got too stressful. My former shift lead was promoted to manager but he definitely was not fit to be a manager. He was put there because he had been there the longest when the other manager quit. A good 6, from a 15 person team, eventually found other jobs because the new manager liked to micromanage and was incompetent. That is ultimately the main reason I also found another job simply because I couldn't deal with the constant micromanaging even though I was there for 3 years and knew how to do my job well. If it wasn't for the new manager, I wouldv'e never left."
bad,Management skupiony na realizacji swoich celów. Brak angażowania w rozwój zespołów i poszczególnych pracowników.
bad,"I have very much enjoyed my time at IBM, but due to the current internal climate, we aren't performing well with client engagements.  Lack of quality resources is the real issue."
bad,Company procedures add complications to previously simple tasks. There was no opportunity to advance or move to other positions. Lines of reporting were unclear.
bad,"I don't feel it's worth talking about IBM anymore. The company is driven purely by quarterly goals. It seems they don't want to make anything anymore and rely on external contracts and free open source pre-existing solutions done by somebody else. Personnel is busy ""surviving"" until retirement. And seems that most are not that far from the goal."
bad,"Too much change, no security even you are performing. Good place to spend 2-3 years and learn but not a long term career. Huge portfolio to sell but they will change your customer list, your portfolio, and your manager every 6 months or so. Commissions difficult to calculate so you never really know how much you will make on a deal until you get the check."
bad,"They can lay you off anytime they want no matter if your doing a gret job or not. Never know when, happens all the time. no reason for lay offs one time its contractors the next its IBM employees. I know multi people that get hired laid off 1 year later than hired back three months later. I been laid off and hired back three times in 5 years. Not a way to keep people happy and worring everyday about losing your job, It show they (IBM) do not care about there employees at all."
bad,"Not a great place to be.  Employees don't help each other sell, only worried about selling their products. Management did understand what we were selling. To many people selling the same things"
bad,"management doesn't know who you are personally"
bad,"IBM did not provide quality training, as promised in the interview and orientation, and therefore left you to  perform functions with very little confidence."
bad,Poor acquisition integration experience
bad,"Going through major transformation, massive disruptions to organizations due to resource actions and people leaving. Struggling to be relevant and chasing major competitors: AWS, Microsoft, Google and SalesForce."
bad,was only consulting for a short time as an opportunity became available at DST in Kansas City where my wife was wattending dental school otherwise I would have stayed at IBM
bad,Watson Health offering strategy is lacking after multiple HCIT acquisitions.  In desperate need of a clearer vision of WH role in the healthcare industry.
bad,If your job can be done over the phone then watch out!  Somewhere within the company there is a bean counter that is looking at a cheaper country to move your job too.  Doesn't matter if your a design Engineer or Technical support or whatever. Its not the company it use to be!  Upper Management is more interested in the bottom line then they are with your career.
bad,It was okay to work there. Contract didn't last long. I don't have much more to say about this company. It's completely contract and they will let you know that they won't make you permanent.
bad,"Not satisfied with the promotion procedure. and the benefit is no good for Long term supplemental. Plus, the management is not effective.  but the work shift is flexible."
bad,And I won't write a review. Makes no sense. My star rating should suffice to evidence my opinion of the company and management for the region I was involved with.
bad,"IBM's sales model is broken, being a technical seller is an even rougher model as you are not directly paid per deal but instead as a whole compared to your teammates.  Sounds good in theory but with different territories come different expected revenues."
bad,Relacion fria con el area gerencial con resolucion de confilictos internos de la compañia ausente o por web de rrhh
bad,"Try as they might, the innovation there is lip service."
bad,The most stressful job I have ever had. The more I worked the more that was expected of me. However it did have room for growth. I was able to have a promotion while I was there.
bad,"I was at IBM for 14 years, coming straight out of college.  I believe that overall, my career was headed in the right direction and I was moving into higher level positions."
bad,"My career at IBM has spanned over two decades including,  3 CEO's, numerous technical advancements, start-ups, acquisitions, divestitures, strategy and management changes galore.  For the most part, IBM weathered these ""transformations"" and proved to the world it was still very relevant by delivering products and services clients needed and wanted.  I am grateful for the many opportunities I have had to learn, grow, and excel throughout my tenure.  The most recent of these ""transformations"" however, has been painful.  The IBM Company has been slow to adapt or did not know how to execute the vision / strategic long term plan.  Instead, business units continued to act in silos or compete with one another rather than work as ""One IBM.""  Finger pointing between management, sales, marketing, product development, and support have created a very unpleasant atmosphere.   Recently, employees have been forced into job roles they did not want or were not trained for while others have been completely displaced.  Though the recent Wall Street results finally indicate positive momentum, IBM is far from rising out of this tumultuous period,.  My patience and willingness to be a part of it have been challenged.  I am now seeking my next career chapter.  One where I can apply my experience and expertise to benefit both the client and my employer."
bad,Do not expect good hike in IBM. What you can bargain will be final for a long period. Too many managers without productive work and offshore/onsite model funnels all the project income to the offshore management. Not at all recommended.
bad,"the work environment was stressful and unprofessional "
bad,"IBM has really changed over the years and are no longer a great company to work for; with major lay-offs every year and more and more jobs shifting to India, etc.   Mid-upper level management as gotten much worse; mostly accountants only focused on short term  / reactive results.  - very sad to this has happened to a once great company."
bad,IBM doesn't listen to the customer any more.  They have lost totally the focus and drive to be good company.  Products always way late.  Lack of collaboration.
bad,It's musical chairs and if you lose your seat you are gone regardless of performance. The quarterly layoffs make it a really depressing place to work.
bad,"No enough job compensation for the type of work provided as a Certified Public Financial Account, and Mortgage Debt Collector as a Contractor. No job growth, plenty of daily job stress in a high volume call center working with the general public trying to collect debts owed for past due mortgage accounts, with not enough compensation or job career growth for the type of work that is being done on a constant basis."
bad,"Good experiences working on projects with a well versed and cohesive team. Every day was a shoulder shrug away from not knowing if your project or contact would be closed the next day. Even with top-tier performance and loyalty, IBM has no problem giving you only a days notice that you'll be laid off and next to no consideration of upward momentum."
bad,"- Really bad culture ( only in the US) "
bad,"I was in some great divisions that had unity and great work ethic, strong management and interesting product development goals.  Recently I was in a division that was ill conceived and poorly managed without any leadership other than imported overpaid, ego maniacs from other doomed tech companies."
bad,Work at IBM and your are subject to the stress involved with their restructuring as they struggle to redefine themselves in the marketplace.  High level of terminations will continue as they downsize and eliminate businesses that are not part of their new identity.
bad,"It is a culture rich company, all the processes are so refined because of the overall experience of company operations that these processes save you from unnecessary stress."
bad,Very stressful and not a lot of support; highly competitive and employees are very much like numbers with threats of the next RA hanging over their heads.
bad,"Work Life Balance is good. "
bad,I would continue employment with IBM however due to collocation and not having the option to move to one of the designated cities many employees like myself are required to find alternate organizations to work for.
bad,started of as an assembler . would have been a good place to retire from but I was laid off after 23 and a half years. Employees were treated fairly and was unbiased in job responsibilities
bad,"Shame they are not investing in the people and always looking at the earnings. Not a company that is client focused anymore, they have lost there focus."
bad,"As all expect for any ""big company"" I was looking for job security and career opportunities. "
bad,"Love the people but HR and the resource actions are not good. They seem to be cutting muscle instead of valuing long standing employees. Even when customers want to keep you, IBM will still lay you off."
bad,Management and employees does not have any say about business tactics. employees compete instead of teamwork. Buildings are old. cafeteria service and food ar
bad,"This is basically a sweatshop for first level support techs.   I would only recommend working here if you're just breaking into the field.  The calls are timed, the time you're off the phone is timed, and even your washroom breaks are timed."
bad,This organization has changed substantially from the days of old. Very disappointing organizational leadership and structure for how to move forward in this new Cloud era.
bad,"Job not secure. Lot of relocation required."
bad,IBM has work life balance but career growth choices are not great in Product development. Good and new products are not developed and traditional are not eveloved
bad,"The job here was interesting and teaches you a decent amount, however, the knowledge is not something used by everyone it's all internal. The issue I've had is upper management considers you just as a number."
bad,"management has their favorites, if you aren't one you will get the low end jobs. Long hours, but nice getting two one hour paid breaks. very cut throat in the fab, seems people like to step on you to make themselves look better"
bad,"Opportunities are limited, Suggestions not heard off, Not much of projects to work with 1 Political environment . No hikes if you are the top notch Rated employee."
bad,Decent quality of life however 20 quarters of declining revenue has caused continued quarterly personnel reductions. Most are looking over their shoulder and looking for another job.  Over 50 and you'll have a target on your back irrespective of performance.
bad,"Good work life balance but lots and lots of process which sometimes irritates you. For small mistakes they make big issue out of it. If you have worked in product based company then you should never come to any service based companies like IBM, it's not a good place for a professional who would like to learn new technology."
bad,The job in manufacturing involved final testing and adjustment of the new at the time Series 3 Copier. This was pushed out too early against engineering wishes. There were lots of problems with reliability. But most of the problems were with getting parts in from vendors to assemble the copiers. We were asked to come in on overtime almost all weekends and we sat around doing nothing because there were no parts.
bad,Company has changed from a company of employees to a company of burdened by dead weight management making IBM impossible to win Federal government contracts.  They are now a head shop for projects. The GBS public area has not been doing well and has promoted individuals that have not generated revenue.   Management is a closed country club.  Sadly CEO can not change IBM fast enough.   Not a company to grow old in.  Systematically removes employees at 50.
bad,IBM has turned their backs on what has kept them in the game for decades and that is the Mainframe.  They talk a good game but behind the scenes they are not investing.
bad,"IBM is not what it once was. The layoffs are massive and frequent, so job security is terrible. If you are a manager, you probably won't get fired; if you are trying to work as an engineer, tech sales, field sales, marketing, etc then be very afraid. 20 consecutive quarterly losses; the stock is volatile, which means the upper-crust at IBM will continue to scramble to save its valuables as it tries to escape the house fire."
bad,Not chances of Growth and the stagnation at one location with one job. No IJPs are being rolled out withing the office and Long working hours with the lot of work pressure and less salary. Bad transport system.
bad,Good Company to work but Less opportunity to learn new technologies and nice place to work if you want to lead a life with no learning and more relaxation.
bad,"Una empresa con mil procesos que te hace la vida laboral complicada. "
bad,You are forced all the time to join projects ignoring your personal aspirations to learn new technologies.There should be a medium where everybody gets equal chance to learn and grow.
bad,"transformation by happenstance"
bad,Broad and deep technology portfolio and WW presence allow significant reach and global presence.  Senior executives are not well equipped to navigate changing dynamics of SaaS and Cloud Computing.
bad,"Its retirement home company , for a young guy looking for opportunities  IBM is not a good place. There is a no or minor (2 %) hike in the salary once you are part of IBM. Bonus and GDP  are very low . The Manager holds the key and there is no evaluation process that is standardized and whatever rating your manager gaves you cannot argue . Hr is on the wind never available and its a Ghost . "
bad,"Salary hike is not good, Work life balance is good for some projects not all. "
bad,"1. Weak management."
bad,"there was always some new tech to get involved with and learn about, but sometimes it felt getting recognition was about who you had coffee with rather than how productive you were, resource actions impacted morale, IBM has lost 1000s of years experience, sad, many managers simply trying to survive."
bad,"Empresa cobra muito o funcionário com avaliações, porém não permite o funcionário chances de crescimento a partir do Service Desk. Gerentes com muitas promessas de crescimento, porém somente promessas."
bad,A place you can define your goals but cannot stick around because of compensation issues but its a place to enhance career prospectives
bad,"CTC wise not satisfied, but for having good flexible and work timing. This company is good. Managers are not really worth ful and no quality in managers."
bad,"Review solution done by Solution Architect"
bad,"Company seems to continually Re-Org., shift directions."
bad,"In IBM's current desperation to turn around revenue trends, it has become a very hard place to work. Everyone is measure against their ability to directly contribute to that revenue top line and that leaves IBM constantly trying to pivot to the next big thing and leaving other projects and people tossed aside."
bad,"Large organisation"
bad,"Very Bad Management and No Hike inspite of hard work."
bad,Work hours are long and there is no guarantee that your manager will be able to help you with questions. The job is quite difficult and their is no mentorship program. The work itself is not difficult to the software that IBM uses is outdated. Don't expect much loyalty from the company if the economy heads south.
bad,"The active plan to export work overseas is quite apparent here. It's fine I suppose, but despite the lack of actual other people in the office, the management is insisting that we all work from the office. We're a department of project managers, and nothing we do is improved by working in sparsely near each other cubicles, so I'm not sure what the logic is in staunchly discouraging telecommuting."
bad,"Work /life balance"
bad,"No work life balance, no vacations, no pay raise, bonuses are pathetic."
bad,Nao acredite em tudo que ira ouvir. Trata-se de uma multinacional querendo oferecer os servicos pelo menor preco aos clientes e com o maior lucro. Resultado: os funcionarios e terceirizados que acabam sofrendo. Nao recomendo para ninguem da area de TI.
bad,"extreme fast paced enviroment, was there just for a short term contract, good people, not much benefits, network monitoring, and other tasks and helping people on phone"
bad,It was a pleasant company at start with full support from the management. Good benefits at the beginning with some reservations. Fair work life balance
bad,"A empresa é ótima para desenvolver nossos conhecimentos. Aprendi muito no período que trabalhei, a desenvolver minhas capacidades e conhecimentos."
bad,"When new process are being introduced, co-workers are very helpful and friendly to teach others who are having problem with the new process or scope. Getting information from other department/countries were very hard and take a while to have a good rapport with them to have information given to us. Hard to get the managers to confirm and provide informations during office hours so they will only call you back after office hours. Some of the management do not think of the employee welfare. Some of the management will to call their staffs during holidays or after office hours or middle of the night to do some work."
bad,"Although the company is so diverse and giant in nature, it lacks a streamlined vision to motivate and cultivate a learning an inspiring work culture within. Over years the company has got process driven, but currently as a result the internal business processes of IBM are so complicated that even policy makers get confused often."
bad,"IBM is a great place to start your career but if you do not have a supportive manager, your career advancement options are very limited. With 13 consecutive quarters of declining revenue and dipping share prices, the only focus that upper management has is on shareholder value - not its employees."
bad,Great place to start your career but dont expect to stay long. You are nothing but a number. A small cog in the big clock. NO advancement. (This is from an IBM contractor)
bad,"A typical day at IBM consisted of about 30-60 phone calls dealing with companies that rented server space from IBM. We did troubleshooting for just about any PC/server or PointOfSale system that IBM provided. The Co-workers are great people and tend to be very diverse. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unbearable hours. The shift that was available was 6PM to 6AM which does not fit anybody else's shift in my home. The management was very friendly and very easy to integrate with. The pay was really good and the job itself wasn't difficult, it was just the hours that were unbearable."
bad,"Pros"
bad,IBM is not a very stable company to work for as they are farming out most of their jobs to secondary staffing agencies/firms. Not sure how much longer they will be around since their last layoffs just happened this year
bad,"My day starts with a cup of coffee. Of course before that we need to log-in into our systems (TVS) on time. Work starts at 11:30 AM and winds up at mostly 9:30 PM depending on the volume of work. At times there is training wherein the staff needs to come 9:30 AM. Co-workers are the most fun part of work. Being an isolated person  in the cabin means that you have no intentions of socializing and want to stick to yourself. The hardest part of the job is when you know that your manager is wrong in doing something but still have to agree  to what he says. As at the end of the day if anything goes wrong, the management may ask him for answers."
bad,"A typical day began with checking the emails of the executives I supported as well as mine, then confirm schedules on calendars."
bad,It's all about who knows you and who can mentor you for success. Without it you will be just another work horse in a big company.
bad,"IBM has been putting adherence to release schedule ahead of software quality for decades.  Not specifically quality as far as the customer is going to see, but internal quality in the way software is engineered.  They have built up decades worth of technical debt.  "
bad,"A lot of layoffs and they refuse to hire employees, server monitoring and created tickets and contact support groups"
bad,I wanted to learn more on release management but had no opportunity. Was forced to take up a leads role. The work is more or less monotonous. I dont enjoy the work.
bad,IBM ISL is having very bad work culture and very less benefits.
bad,"Only problem which i notice in my past three different contracts under different groups of IBM."
bad,Not a very good company to work for. The pay wasn`t good and some of the Management was horrible
bad,If you can survive the bureaucracy and find your place in the company you can have a great career.  too big and slow for those looking for more of small tech start up culture.
bad,"Learned Virtualization, Cloud Management."
bad,Business services seem to be dying off so not a good place to be for people looking to get into the business side of the tech world
bad,"working was in inbound process, giving resolution, information to  customer for their queries, complaints and also simultaneously maintaining data in system, learned about the giving customer service. management was good.coworkers was helpfull."
bad,"No salary hike is given, growth is slow. Good for women employees to keep home and office balance."
bad,"Days were very long, and stressful. No opportunites to get promoted or advance due to having upper management offshoring my career path due to internal costs."
bad,"Enjoy the day with changing hats in dealing clients, running meetings, managing cross functional teams, facing every day challenges in troubleshooting the production issues and delivering with quality."
bad,"Having IBM as my first employer opened up opportunities for me in the Call Center Industry. "
bad,"Good working environment"
bad,"Muitas pessoas de fora tem a visão de que a IBM realmente é aquilo que vende, uma empresa inovadora que visa criar um ""smarter planet"" (planeta mais inteligente). Porém, uma vez dentro da IBM, percebe-se que os valores visados pela IBM não saem do papel, visto que a burocracia interna dificulta imensamente a vida dos próprios funcionários (pra ser ter uma idéia, só para registrar as horas trabalhadas no mês são pelo menos 3 ferramentas diferentes)."
bad,"Celebrating each festival at office in a professional way is a great part of the job. Work , deadlines, target, meeting and appraisals are the words we hear very often on floor. but it brings little joy to everyone's mind when the term celebrate is uttered. It not only brings unity among workers , also everyone get to meet new people from different departments. It is also a stupendous platform for sharing professional as well as personal experiences."
bad,Advanced skillset by working with new peers. Hardest part of the job was at times was placed in a decision making position without any experience. Co workers were great. most enjoy part of the job was when I received a thank you note from customer or when I met a client from another part of the world. Did not accommodate disabled workers
bad,IBM was a great company to work for until management could not grow revenues without offshoring American jobs to BRIC countries.
bad,"I worked in purchasing which is the corporate division but our ""customer"" was the semiconductor fab. Essentially they wrote our check. Semiconductors are a tough business heavily competitive. So work was hard and layoffs plentiful. Always looking to cut expenses. They cut our budget while asking for more time and efforts."
bad,Way too much process and trying to implement a newer Agile type of environment and attaching all of the old processes has been disastrous.
bad,"Questionable work/life balance, reality is long hours. Pay is lower than competitors, particularly after a few years with business.. low or non-existent raises even for above average performers."
bad,"When I worked there IBMGS was trying to get a certain certification. IBM had no experts and so we newly acquired employees had to develop all the documentation, etc ourselves. We had two sets of managers so was continually having to try to figure out which one to report to for a given situation or had to work with both of them which just added extra effort on our part."
bad,Many talented people work here . There are opportunity to learn different ares of engineering disciplines.
bad,"IBM is a major IT company providing many benefits to their employees. Unfortunately, the management and compensation are lacking. Although they do offer varieties of courses that employees can take, the company's management do not allow or provide the time necessary to attend these seminars or educations. On paper they encourage employees to develop their skills and take educations, but at the end, managements' demand takes priority over it."
bad,"The place is very good to for work for if you like to work, but the has a contractor the money was not that good."
bad,My learning was my responsibility. The head of team did not supervise or assign much work. I was transferred to another team mid-term and had to travel for 2 hours to work with the new team.
bad,"The benefits are good, it's just that...the management sucks. You need to ne a ""sipsip"" before your leaves will egt approved and there's favoritism. Even though you are performing well, if you are not that close to the management... you're dead."
bad,"Routine work which includes few challenges"
bad,"Since the day joined, no salary hike and no job security too, management also not that good. "
bad,"Learning is minimal"
bad,"While the work was very fulfilling, the work environment was very stressful.  Advancement was only available to the younger team members.  I left because my account base would change every six months and I could not reap the benefits of the relationships that I developed."
bad,"Relaxed and quiet work environment, always room to learn new projects within the company. Great experience for those who want to learn more about IT and customer service."
bad,I used to be part of one of IBMs most profitable divisions and yet people still got laid off due to bad business decisions by upper management. What a joke.
bad,"Salary hike is zero...only work and work."
bad,Really a good Company but do not go for Chennai location because the Manager are real politician they are treating the peoples like animal apart from chennai IBM is wonderful place to work
bad,"IBM SG, has really draggy and multiple level approval processes, most of the middle management are easy going but no job security. Most of staffs are contractors."
bad,"Bon endroit pour édutiants, 2-3 ans maximum. après c'est une perte de temps."
bad,IBM is a huge company that might be great at more location. The Philadelphia office has an extremely high turnover rate that is a result of poor management. The salary is low with the ability to make a lot in commission and that is how they pull people in along with how well known they are.
bad,"IBM is a great company -- but it's in transition.  "
bad,A typically day at work is numerous calls from start of 6am all the way to 4pm Monday thru Friday. The ticketing systems is pretty flawed and redundant information. There are no ways to increase your software education
bad,"Competitive salary for designers. As a junior design consultant, I wasn't given much guidance. The hardest part of the job is keeping busy. If you're on a project, you're busy, but most of the time you're just searching for your next project. "
bad,"No way to grow in thew posicions offered."
bad,Leider wurde der Standort Düsseldorf nahezu aufgelöst.
bad,"IBM is not well organized, but there is a lot of freedom for independent thinking and decision making.  The real problem comes from too many decisions being made by the clients that are contracted with IBM, after the agreement has been written up."
bad,"This was my ideal job!  I got lots of opportunities to learn which I utilized to the max.  The team I worked with was wonderful and very collaborative and it was very enjoyable and fulfilling to work with them."
bad,"It is hard to know where you stand when the company struggles to make profits. Layoffs often happen without warning. You can learn many types of roles but your experience and expertise must be definable for you to have longevity. Jack of all trades sorts of people don't do as well because they don't know ""where to put you."""
bad,"I worked with some of the smartest people in the industry and made some great connections and friends while there. However, management was/is the worst. They try and keep up with other tech companies but they have a long way to go. They expect everyone to be experts in a role and then not even a year later management decides to either get rid of you or switch you to other roles without notice. Most of these roles don't even meet your interest/background so it's filled with people who don't know what they're doing."
bad,"It was a good work environment with great coworkers and management, but the company itself seemed a bit too itchy to lose employees to save money. I would not recommend working with IBM in general as a Canadian citizen since it is an American company."
bad,"Bad high level leadership, vision and execution. Lots of uncertainty with direction. Lack of communication from management. Business processes are way more complicated than they need to be. Work life balance was good. If leadership makes a business decision that doesn't work out and there's a loss of revenue, employee jobs are going to be affected so the company looks good for shareholders. No concern for employees. You are constantly working in an environment of uncertainty about your future. There is no value in loyalty."
bad,"This was a job I had multiple years ago, I cannot accurately characterize the current culture or management practices. AT the time, it wasn't a good role for me."
bad,"The innovation centered mindset at IBM is the most positive aspect of the workplace here.  The management, execution of mission and career progression are well below the industry standard and some of the worst that I have been exposed to in the technology sector"
bad,"The most bored I've ever been working at a corporation.No recognition from management, no room for real growth, lower than average salary and no accountability."
bad,"A huge company with a huge reputation and history and a lot of good things going for it, BUT, IBM is all about the numbers and no attention at all is paid to staff development and management other than to meet the bottom line."
bad,"I feel IBM is no more Employee friendly. As Delivery managers are least bothered about employee's. As I discussed with previously worked employee's at IBM, the current project which I am working is so worse no one has faced these type of problem. The project which I am working is Multinational Insurance company. And this project operates only at Manyata Tech park, Bangalore."
bad,"The first half of my employment with IBM was gratifying. While they focused on the needs of the business, they also focused on employee gratification and were geared toward supplementing a family oriented culture. Due to a shift in the competitive nature of the business, IBM shifted its focus to the needs of the business and transformed its workplace culture to a very cutthroat environment causing workplace turmoil that consisted of backstabbing, pay cuts, no overtime, and a reduction in benefits."
bad,"On the up side, I've consistently worked with (and for) some great people.The compensation and benefits are also good. Though hours can be quite long, as a remote employee that hasn't bothered me--I've been grateful for the privilege, and have enjoyed challenging, stimulating writing projects. "
bad,"I found management at the location I worked at to be really over concerned with administrivia and not concerned enough with meeting customer expectations. They showed little concern and made little effort to understand what was going on with our clients and focused too much on utilizing support teams to do analysis and produce reports to justify their existence. They were totally disconnected with the productivity of their people. Folks that did almost nothing for our clients got recognition and advancement because they spent all their time improving administrivia. The folks working hard to satisfy the client got no recognition and even were looked down upon if they weren't playing the administrivia game.They really stressed ""give back"". But the folks doing all the ""give back"" were doing nothing to support the client who were paying the tab. The rest of us had to work even harder to cover for them while they got the recognition."
bad,"Worked with IBM Onsite at TD Bank. Having previous work experience with TD I understood the nature of their business and culture."
bad,"IBM is a great company for some and not for others, depending on where you are assigned, especially in the Public Sector. Anywhere outside of the Washington Metro area, your prospects are limited unless you are lucky enough to get attached to a project with managers who are competent and are actually invested in making sure the team grows. And, unless you have a good mentor who makes sure you are aware of available resources, you'll get lost trying to figure out how to move and advance."
bad,"There really wasn't an activity that was related to meeting with people from the work environment. The people focused only on their jobs and did not bring others into their regular life style with them. If you wanted new, close friends, they needed to come from somewhere else."
bad,"IBM is a big company, they lack initiative to help individual's career growth. IBM changed my direct manager 3 times. I am not sure if this is how it is at other consulting companies, but IBM definitely facilitate a very you-are-on-your-own working environment."
bad,I have worked with great people. I have learned you need to compete with others for job hirings.  My latest manager was the only decent human being to work for.  Management for temporaries was not good in way of advancement.  I got along well with other administrative assistants. The hardest part of the job was leaving one job for another.  The most enjoyable was getting to know a lot of people along the way of my temporary assignments.
bad,IBM is not what it used to be .... on a contract assignment at IBM and their budget is so busted that no one can work even an hour of overtime.  Never worked in such a stringent environment with no option to work OT or even make up 40 hours when its a short work week. Poor management added to this and I would never want to work directly for IBM.
bad,empresa exelente para quem procura novos desafios de carreira e ana area de desenvolvimento proficional
bad,IBM do not have many financial processes and the ones they have do not have much critical accounting. However its a good place to work. However except the salary part all are good with IBM.
bad,"Worklife balance is good. Job security is good. However, old technologies. No hikes or promotion only internal designation changes without salary change. Like a government  job with constant salary. Good company to spend your retirement life only."
bad,"IBM is surely not a great place to work anymore. It used to be some years ago. "
bad,"Horrible. Like working under a giant axe held by a thread. You know it will fall, you just don't know when."
bad,"I was shuffled around a few times, and upper management changes caused major issues in determining company vision. There was a constant fear of layoffs and constant preventable outages lost several SLA windows due to poor engineering choices"
bad,"Data Center in Dubuque had a poor financial year for 2014 and because of that, they had a large layoff of employees in January 2015. I was included in that group."
bad,"On site support at Allianz Life supporting 3400 desktops laptops, and virtual systems.  "
bad,"- Poor Vision"
bad,"Ever increasing focus on cost has an impact on team coherance and depth of skills, often needing to be compensated by a core of individuals who end up working long hours.  Continual increase in off-shoring for service delivery and project resources and reliance on graduate intake. "
bad,"It is an ok company."
bad,Good organization and good environment. Not a paymaster. Working here is a challenge because off non flexible timings. Provides good growth only to campus recruits.
bad,"Typical day was coordinating team functions to meet customer's application packaging, application distribution or workstation image requests. Over the years working for IBM and through multiple reorganizations, the emphasis shifted from providing good customer support to the accounts who contracted with IBM for IT support, to a primary emphasis on account cost management. The best part of the job was working with teammates and customers on new and challenging projects and applications, and successfully completing projects or request after overcoming issues. The hardest part of the job was justifying FTEs needed to support an account multiple times each year, as well as recommending team members to be released when cost reductions had to be made, then trying to redistribute workloads and maintain service levels."
bad,Join IBM at your own peril. You better hope you are in a product group that is growing! Watson has no revenue. IBM tough place to work - lack of Opps!
bad,Maybe IBM is a good company for those who are willing to work 24/7 and for those that are very introverted. It seems that laughing is prohibited... If you are the candidate that matches all the above go ahead...
bad,"rewards people who makes lots of noise and can't really do anything, instead of rewarding the people who really knows how to do things. replace knowledgeable and experienced but expansive people with cheap but very green people. that was the real source of their downturn."
bad,"People at IBM especially in the outsourcing field, feel they are numbered and feel the burden of finding a new career. We feel we are at the bottom of the barrel."
bad,Not a good place for good Supply Chain Professionals.  The rolls here are purely back end work and there is no actual sourcing activity.  Clients bring in quotes and buyer does a due diligence.
bad,"Leading and participating in conference calls.  Performing project control book updates managing escalations, potential risks and issues.  The hardest part of the day is just getting all the work done in a normal work day that consists of 10-12 hours. The most enjoyable is meeting people from around the world and all of the challenges in managing a diverse team."
bad,"IBM is a vast organisation. So every project or assignment is as good as a company change. Some projects can turn out to be a very good learning experience, but some may not. Good thing is you can change your projects every 2 years."
bad,This workplace has no work life balance. Late night office stay is expected normally. Low salary and performance evaluaton not completely dependent on work.
bad,IBM used to have a great culture and was a fun place to work.  Somewhere in the early 2000s it forgot how to treat its employees.  Now there's no such thing as job security.
bad,great people but bad management style.  not good at a balanced environment .  need to be more helpful in guiding the employees. culture is not what they advertise
bad,"I learned communication skills from there ."
bad,They do not have work at all. Join IBM if you just want to seat home and get paid. No self development. Managers are trying their best to get the project but no progress.
bad,"The Culture of this Company is good.the issue that i had here was that, being in a service desk enviroment, it was hard to get noticed."
bad,"No good work provided , lots of unnecessary process management. Technical persons should have penitence as you won't get good work."
bad,"For the most part, it's an honor to work for IBM but the workplace can be a major hindrance based on work style.  For the most part, you are thrown at projects rather than having any direction of the projects you want to work on based on your set of skills.  Next, business travel is a common staple of work so those who prefer remote work are in for a very difficult time when a project demands it even if such travel parameters were not up front in the first place.  The training provided is useful in terms of education but normally courses prove to be pointless when the taught skills aren't used.  The most difficult part of the job is that things often change without what you agreed to when you first got there.  Considering how humongous of an entity IBM is, it's easy to get swept up without an idea of where you are going or if it's even worth getting there."
bad,"Una vez lo dijo su gerente general (G. Cascio): en IBM no te vas a hacer millonario, pero vas a vivir bien. "
bad,The company is going through some transitions where they are having trouble identifying who they are in the market.  More hiring is done based off who you know not based off previous success in other roles.
bad,"Big company, lot of resources for learning and good career growth, but poor benefits. Not employee friendly, purely manager driven with  lot of middle management, which ruins everything.."
bad,STG in IBM was a part which was sold since IBM was not interested to sell hardware anymore. Hence it was sold to Lenovo world wide and 6500 employees shifted from IBM to Lenovo .
bad,"In this workplace I found a lot of open minded people, great colleagues, but poor managment and a lot of promises. All in all maybe a good experience for half a year at most"
bad,"IBM gave me my start, I appreciate that, however over the past 5-6 years there has been a lack of interest from the upper management to create a healthy work culture and a sense of appreciation for thier employees."
bad,"Due to the high expectations and low compensation, most decent employees quickly find other employment. Extremely hectic, bureaucratic environment, with each department silo-ed and unwilling or incapable of assisting others."
bad,"Co - workers are good ."
bad,i have worked for 12-14 weeks for this project and it was learning experience for me. i have learnt different things like data algorithm and how we can calculate shortest distance from one place to another place without wasting too much time.
bad,"In terms of Job security this is Good Company, only issue is Compensation."
bad,"Great and incredibly intelligent people working hard together.  Management doesn't seem to know where they are headed though and often change course, causing many lost hours of hard work."
bad,"Every day I must troubleshoot all applications that I'm managing and I must be sure that all alert in case of issue are working properly.To support customers and to resolve urgently all issues that we'll faced."
bad,"Great people to work with long hours. Lot of Red Tape admin, slow moving changes company. Play the game and you may go far."
bad,I have learned to do team work in IBM. The co-workers are helping in nature. The hardest part of the job is that it was graveyard shift. The enjoyable part is the work environment is best in IBM.
bad,"This organization was not fun working with. "
bad,Mega-company that has changed from a people-centric organization to one which is completely focused on the bottom line.
bad,Release driven fast pace; multitasks;  Enjoy working with professional people; 
bad,"Péssimo ambiente de trabalho, com muita conversa paralela e pessoas querendo atacar as outras. "
bad,APT/SPARKS is the book and records for the cost basis information for the position of an account. The scope of the project includes maintenance/enhancements and production support of the system. Within SPARKS the data or the position info of a transaction is taken processed and fed into a third party system (Eagle)
bad,The managers were nice and had an open door policy and encouraged us to think outside the box
bad,In order to make a profit sold off division without concern for loyal employees.
bad,A typical day at work and enjoyable work environment
bad,I took the job because it gave me the opportunity to work for New Zealand. I really enjoyed the country. the people were very plsant and the scenery was spectacular.
bad,"I was so excited to come work for IBM when I first got here, I thought I had finally landed the job I was going to retire with. But it quickly became apparent that this was not the same company it use to be. It seems IBM is now more focused on quantity over quality. With that said I truly enjoyed working for my first line manager and my peers, all excellent technical people. But unfortunately my good experiences here have been overshadowed by empty promises and IBM's inability to allow for their employees have a life outside of work."
bad,"My employment with IBM was because of the TUPE process and I carried the Management from my former company with me and this Management was lacking. Regular 121’s were non existent."
bad,"Work culture is very slow-paced and bureaucratic. Development projects are far and between and the vast majority of work is support-related, with little scope of technical learning."
bad,"A typical refrain is, ""I love my coworkers and the work I do, but I don't like the company."" Employees genuinely embrace and champion the IBM Watson Health mission, ""To improve lives and give hope by delivering innovation to address the world's most pressing health challenges through data and cognitive insights."" "
bad,"Not many projects at present "
bad,"Working in the Service Delivery area for IBM, I've learned that management requires additional training in how to effectively communicate with associates. Often, our questions went unanswered and we ended up doing much more work for the customer than our contract allowed due to this."
bad,"I was part of the german language process. the shifts are flexible and rotational also the transport provide is horrible, too much wait time and also travel time is more"
bad,"It can be a ""young man's"" job where there seems to be a competition to put in the most ridiculous hours, always online, always working, always doing additional training and education.  I think it's important to continue learning and to work hard, but I also believe in work/life balance and I didn't get a feeling for that here."
bad,"Great colleagues. Not so great products. Awful management."
bad,IBM appears to be a great place to work in certain functions but the corporate finance function is one where nothing seems to get accomplished and everyone points the finger elsewhere for why the numbers aren't lining up. Budgets and company targets are nothing but spreadsheet exercises with little to no feel for the operational structure or industry feel necessary to build and maintain a growing company. Quarterly PTI targets are nothing but short term goals that will inevitably hurt long term results.
bad,"I was in the CbD program with IBM. It is a college graduate leadership program for people who just graduated from college. During my 2 years here, I had to find every project by myself. Never got any help from my staffing manager or my manager. The company is not transparent at all. It's very unclear to us how the decisions are made."
bad,"I had a long career with IBM, eventually working on large high risk international projects.  I completed a final project on legacy technology that was scheduled to be sunset.  Once this project was completed, rather than providing me with the opportunity to work on the new technology, they included me in the next layoff."
bad,"For all the new technology marketed, their base will always be the mainframe.  Yet, they treat their older and longest tenured employees as refuse to discard.  If you are young, come to IBM to learn both the good and the bad of corporate IT consulting, then leave."
bad,"When I started with IBM in the late 80's it was a great company to work for. But it didn't take too long for the bean counters to realize the money that could be made by firing US workers to hire ""equivalent"" people overseas. The internal culture became exceedingly caustic and political bickering drove once great divisions and teams into the ground.It simply became a waiting game as to when they would force you out when ""resource actions"" came around every year. When I joined IBM one of the cultural mandates was ""respect for the individual."" By the time I left 25 years later the only respect they had was for the stock holders. Sad"
bad,"Very poor management, really managers don't know what exactly they are doing. We lost almost 20 developers and qas last year and current year either laid off or they left by their own choices."
bad,"4 managers in 2 years."
bad,"IBM is clearly a company in transition. The morale of the client facing sales teams is extremely poor. Many longtime employees are being forced out through a variety of HR programs. Until a new CEO is in place, a changes to the business strategy are made, IBM is not a company I would recommend working for to a friend."
bad,"IBM has a storied history but today is a shadow of its former self. Profit has been declining for years so don't expect raises, bonuses, or significant benefits. The worst part is the management -- absolutely no focus on developing good managers or keeping people happy. All young and ambitious people try to leave within a year. Older people who still remember the good days of IBM and are loyal tend to stay. On the plus side, work-life balance is good unless you are a GBS consultant."
bad,Stressful place to work.  The management was very cut throat as well.  I would not recommend this place to work unless you don't mind working in a stressful environment.
bad,"I joined IBM as an intern and I did not had any much expectation about salary or any other benefits. But one thing I was hopeful for was I will get good quality of work. IBM is still stuck in old technologies such as their tools like DB2, IDAA. They plan for their tools without thinking of new technologies and work on it as if it's going to create any boom in the market. "
bad,"It may not be possible to rebuild the corp culture once it is destroyed"
bad,"It's an excellent place to start your career or begin a new one. Managers do their best to get you involved quickly and from the get go. Compensation is drastically below market value and working in the consulting branch, the technologies involved on are not up to date. Plenty of learning opportunities however EVERYTHING is individually driven. If you want a raise, you need to push for it, if you want to go into a new assignment, on you. Progress is very slow and consistent pushing for new or relevant work is taxing and stressful."
bad,"Our division was bought wholesale, and were told that things would not change. But then a couple months into the transition we were given unachievable deadlines for migration goals and our organization has now been split up and no longer exists."
bad,The last few years were very stressful and should have left early. Not much good to say about the experience .    The focus is on moving jobs to oversees.
bad,Manager driven company. It completely depends on the manager be it career progress or any other item. Pay benefits are very less. Variable pay is close to 0. Nothing new to learn
bad,"A challenging environment to work in, with a self-service approach to finding your way around the company.  You can seek out some very smart individuals, who are generally willing to help you find the correct avenues needed to get where you want to go. Tight budget constraints are a constant source of frustration. Continual downsizing is painful, as you are expected to do your job, and the jobs of others. No opportunities for hiring new talent or backfilling vacant positions. Employee morale is generally low. You can work with very bright and dedicated people at IBM. The company needs to realize that the employees are their most important asset."
bad,"The salary increment is not there."
bad,100% travel.  10% efficiency.  0% likelihood to be able to meet the challenges of tomorrow.  Highly recommended for people who want to slowly eke away at insignificant projects while slowly building their position at a company that may not be around in 10 years.
bad,"IBM US being renowned as world's leading tech companies and pioneer in cognitive and augmented data. IBM India whereas has a completely different work culture. Management is pathetic, policies are a mockery, employees are continously frustated by the nepotist actions of higher management. Overall its a giant mess."
bad,fue mi primer trabajo y en aprendi cosas nuevas y conoci personas que me enseñaron a trabajar
bad,"The Resiliency Services department is not receiving the support it should. However, the Management and staff are exemplary. The level of customer support remains steady. Their recent investment in an overseas company shows a willingness to resuscitate the disaster recovery business."
bad,This company is a great place to work. Communication between department needs some work and management needs to be retrained. The company as a whole needs to learn how to work together to achieve the same goal.
bad,"Definitely a good work place, so is the peer and work atmosphere. Buildings and work desks are well equipped. Diversity groups have an upper hand, inclusive of intra mural activities and cultural programs."
bad,I started in 1982 and I left in 2015 (with a couple of breaks in between to make my millions).  When I left the company it had continued to support work life balance far better than any other company I have been exposed to.  But the waves of work force reductions just kept coming...  at least 4 waves since I left in February 2015.
bad,IBM India US branch is a good company to work for. They are open to give you opportunities to learn and grow based on availability. They do not sponsor GC.
bad,"If you're a new hire at IBM, you're usually safe for two years. After two years, you're free game to be laid off to save costs by offshoring your job. Your manager won't even get any say to save you unless you're absolutely critical to the team - HR will deem you redundant at the drop of a hat."
bad,"A Empresa deixou muito a desejar, trabalhei lá durante 2 anos e quando sai nao me pagaram nada so recebe mesmo o meu fgts que demorou 3 meses para liberar pois a documentação da IBM sempre estava errada, no entanto a empresa não pagou os 40% alegando que eu estava sobre um contrato de trabalho. Ou seja seja uma verdadeira palhaçada com o trabalhador, não recomendo a ninguem."
bad,"No guidance"
bad,"IBM is only surviving on past good innovations."
bad,"You can learn many things here starting from excellent learning resources, IBM's tools etc. "
bad,". The experience of working at IBM cannot be generalized as it varies a lot for each employee"
bad,IBM is former shell of itself that has struggled to change its business model and its resource for foder. They fell employees because managers are so busy they cant speak with manages until performance time when its often to late.
bad,a nice and adjustable environment to process and lot of support for management team for learn new things..nice work...totally it is very nice job..
bad,IBM is a good place to work. People are nice and helpful. I would love to work in this company again in the future
bad,"Except work nothing I  liked in this company."
bad,"- A typical day of work would be me arriving at the start of my shift resolving all issues i get then going home"
bad,Constant Reorganization. Two rounds of lay offs and 4 reorganizations in last eighteen months.
bad,"Good Environment but Slow growth,"
bad,"Typical day work was fairly basic but fun."
bad,Typical day at work included logging in a US timings. Managing 15 employees. Easy going colleagues with helping nature. Seasonal inflows can make you restless. Fun loving team and understanding clients.
bad,place to learn manythings and it is the one of the challenging and enjoyable work station.
bad,"good place to improve skills, technical and management skills"
bad,"Extremely difficult place to work now, fear of cuts always looming without rhyme or reason. 3 levels of management spend 90% of their time trying to meet budget cuts. No funding to spearhead new ideas (and they wonder why they cant grow revenue). The people that work there are very talented and try their best to cover all the work. Hardest part of the job is worrying about the impossible, subjective rating / ranking system that is designed to constantly remove people from the company. (think of a bad game of musical chairs)."
bad,"Good opportunity to work with smart people.  Low pay, long hours, and little job security."
bad,I loved to work in ?Ibm as a technical support representative because every cal i took was fun.As we had to troubleshoot for different broadband scenarios and different customer issues.
bad,"Managmenet is Team is good to work in IBM."
bad,A sad time due to the fact we were told we would not be there long due to the fact this was a buy out.
bad,Focused only on Productivity.It is a dream mnc.Operations is a cool job focused on delivery.
bad,"Long hours, but worked from home so could do additional work late hours if needed."
bad,People from different cultures and background
bad,"• Handled the Accounts Payable process; Verified vendor invoices, employees claim and Coordinated with higher official to release payment"
bad,it was sound exeriance and learning. i enjoyed my job in IBM. i found very good collegues. who are very supportive. and i found very good work culture in the company.
bad,Good and new things to learn everyday. workplace culture is good. work is challenging sometimes and fun events to refresh yourselve. Good team to interact.
bad,"IBM is not a good place for an older workers. they are actively trying to get rid of people with lots of experience. At the time I left they were actively reducing their remote workforce, for me would have meant a move to San Jose."
bad,"- Client and projects may be good but it depends on luck"
bad,IBM Cloud is facing it's worst days. The Cloud Management has created  a stressful environment that only cares about numbers and not the people. I would advise against joining IBM Cloud Unit.
bad,"No hay muchas oportunidades de crecimiento. La cultura laboral es muy pobre y los filtros de RH para gente nueva, desde hace un tiempo, no son muy buenos."
bad,"Not much to be given but there is pros and cons in every company, i think just best to reserved on what i need to say. Just satisfactory of work thats all"
bad,A IBM.. é uma excelente industria..porém qto ao fator humano....deixa mto a desejar...as pessoas lá são consideradas números e mais nada...
bad,"The system is very old, its architecture very archaic, the design seems to be done by several people with not experience, so the end result was a working product not only expensive but also difficult to maintain"
bad,"Several policies seemed to be more Accounting/cost-cutting focused...forcing employees to relocate to retain their jobs.  Resources that are typically made available to employees at other companies were ""self-help"" at IBM."
bad,"I enjoyed working there but IBM does not hire and when they do its usually from outside the company.  Out of the 50 or 60 coworkers that worked with me in my department only 2 got hired in the 5 yrs that I worked there.  Also, they dont give raises unless you get promoted."
bad,Was challenging. Long hours and team support. The site was created in a old department store. The first floor fortunes was very nice sad the building owner removed them. The option to work from home was very good during bad weather.
bad,"IBM continues to drive innovation within the technology industry. There are numerous division with unique cultures and operating models.  The sales culture is focused on delivering monthly, quarterly and annual results to stockholders."
bad,these workers are treated less equal and never get a raise but work as hard if not harder than permanent employees. Most of the workers have to take days off at there own expense.
bad,"Gerentes e diretores Dinossauros, por mais que tente ser uma empresa nova, não consegue"
bad,"Not qualified to write a review on this company.  it has been too long and things have changed significantly."
bad,Good environment for new learning. and provided many types of sales and Marketing through a comprehensive curriculum.  IBM ensures that all of the employees undergo learning.
bad,"The culture and rewards are not what they used to be."
bad,"procesna orientacia"
bad,Limited feedback and assistance with technical issues.  I was a contractor.  Not an employee.  Employees are over worked and do not have time to assist a contractor and contractors are left with trying to figure out their roles without being given enough information.
bad,"The company specialized in sub-prime loans which there is less business for these days. Years ago this was a fun place to work. But it is constantly being ""restructured"" and layoffs result. Fewer employees every year."
bad,IBM is a ok place to work if u can stand the stressful work load. The company is not a bad company but the work load can be very very stressful.. I would not want to work back at IBM because of the layoffs
bad,"Amazing work environment."
bad,"If you want excessive levels of management coupled with archaic, disjointed internal systems/processes, then IBM is for you.  Also, if you like watching Vice Presidents getting hired into esoteric positions, climb aboard.  Finally, if you enjoy being on call 24x7x365 - have I got an offer for you."
bad,"Most of my time at IBM was good. But as the company continues to transform, IBM has lost focus on its employees leading to an increasingly competitive and political environment. For established (read mature) employees that means tens of thousands have been left by the wayside. IBM keeps losing instiutional wisdom."
bad,"Good place for learning, exposure to all the latest technology. Goof work environment, feasible office timings, Work from Home facility available. Opportunity in different area are always open."
bad,"You want to get things done at IBM? Expect to work through many different layers of leadership and many different organizations that do not care about your objectives. There is no innovation left at IBM, only top down decision making."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a great group of people that I worked with.  However, management became increasing difficult to work with."
bad,"IBM is a dream for many people especially for freshers, definitely will pride working for IBM , apart from the proud feeling you will feel very w.r.to tomanagement, here everything is dependent  on manager."
bad,"however it is not good for job security, and job culture is just so so. management so far so good however it might not keep up to trend on the market place."
bad,Was part of an acquisition and everything seemed fine at first but then we had major lay offs and lost a lot of good talent with no back fill. My manager quit then I was expected to back fill his work. You're just a number at IBM and they don't care about you.
bad,"I see IBM good for a start of the career. Or for someone who is ready to accept politics to go up to the Partner. "
bad,"Good place to work to learn. "
bad,"During my 5 years in IBM I found it to be an ok experience. "
bad,Ik heb er geruime tijd met heel veel plezier gewerkt. Het heeft me deels gemaakt tot wie ik ben. Maar dat neemt niet weg dat 'buiten de deur' en in een geheel andere branche mij ook een bijzondere uitdaging lijkt.
bad,"My product has gone into maintenance mode.  More than half of the group is being laid off and morale is low. "
bad,"For a beginner it is a nice place if you are looking to improve your communication etiquette."
bad,"IBM are a great company to work for, with fantastic opportunities across the board, as well as a really capable and fantastic team providing support and encouragement throughout"
bad,I don't think there is much to say about IBM. They have become a company of snake oil salesmen. Taking advantage of technically unsavvy customers. Not sure how long this will go on.
bad,"IBM is a good company for retirement, but for growing along with your skill is difficult, you have to work on a particular thing for long, you cannot move easly"
bad,"Opportunity to develop my SQL skills on large scale projects.  Until the last few years I worked there, was a pretty good place to work. Towards the end, IBM leadership, focused on building stock value through cutting cost over building revenue.  And as a consequence, was continually losing market share and causing customer service problems with existing clients."
bad,"Lot of learning opportunities are lot of projects are there. Both short and long term onsite but need to fight with manager for that"
bad,"IBM has decided to focus on co-location for all employees, rather than the work/life balance that the mobile employee model offered.  Today, it is more a matter of where you physically sit than it is your skills and ability to contribute to the company.  The company would rather find *somebody* in the *right* location than they would look for the best person to do the job.  It'll be interesting to see how this new culture plays out over the next couple of years."
bad,"IBM claims to be innovative and forward thinking, and I was surprised to find it is not. It's nothing special. No one on my team actually enjoyed their job. Everyone just doing it to get by, as salaries are competitive and moving up in the company is near impossible."
bad,"didn't have a very good experience with these people, they were standoffish and fake, the job was nice but hard to get used too.i was asked to do others work at the same rate of which was lower than thoes i was asked to do the work for.no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Stay away from IBM, it is not the company it once was. Pay increases are small and infrequent. Environment is high stress. Bureaucracy is ridiculous. No job security."
bad,"When I first started at IBM 10 years ago it was a pleasant place to work however over the years it has changed culturally and now there is a lot of uncertainty of job retention with Australian jobs going off shore to save costs for the ""Big Blue""."
bad,"IBM is a great company to work for. I worked for them in 3 different locations. Tampa, Atlanta and Poughkeepsie, NY.They provide a challenging work environment which I enjoyed working in."
bad,"So, the company used to be good. Had a good long term (5-10 years) outlook. but Now everything is short term, make next quarter's numbers, or else type of outlook."
bad,"•	Maintain files of program developmental records and operating instructions"
bad,unstructured management; Not a collaborative environment per se. You have to constantly find things to do otherwise would be marked as insignificant on the team.
bad,IBM no longer pays employees what they are worth.  They work you twice as hard and the work don't match the pay. The money is not great at all and they will not promote and no raise.
bad,"My day consists of providing tech support for a federal health insurance company. I provide password unlocks and resets for active directories and other programs including Lotus Notes. I have learned how to think about and troubleshoot problems related to software and login credentials. Management is overall competent, though there seems to be a lot of changing of procedures such as offering of overtime. My co-workers and I always are there to help each other out and there always seems to be someone with a solution to a problem. I am a senior agent on the account and therefore have access to more tools for resets and unlocks than the newer people, so I assist in our group chat. The hardest part of the job is working with people who are difficult and do not want to follow my troubleshooting steps, while the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I helped people who wanted my help and listened to me."
bad,"They hired a ton of people as an advertising/tax benefit ploy. Then they fired all of us to send the jobs to India. While I liked my direct managers and fellow employees, the people in charge of IBM are the worst."
bad,"Ambiente agradável, sem plano de aproveitamento de estagiários. Muita burocracia."
bad,People worked with were good. The company benefits were not. Reduced severance pay this year. Stopped paying monthly contributions to 401K plan and would only pay the company portion in December if your were not laid off.
bad,"Pros: Good work life balance"
bad,"Middle management is treated horribly.  Expected to work crazy hours and then convince staff to voluntarily (while getting paid) come in during those hours as well.  Upper management treats middle managers like their puppets, then don't help anyone advance."
bad,"Good place if you need a job and are not sure what you want to do, or don't mind doing any kind of work (testing, QA, or otherwise).  If you want to do something specific, like Java development, this is not the place to work.  You are required to work at whatever assignments are available.  This makes it difficult to build up experience in any technical area."
bad,Walmart is a pretty good job for those without any experience or college. The pay is decent but the benefits are poor. Some of the shifts are good and they pretty much have a shift for any life challenge. Management is friendly for the most part.
bad,"I am working for IBM from long time, work is ok, Many are maintenance or support projects. You can't change the project frequently. Not much sal hikes, all other things are ok"
bad,"When ever the issue come in production at seviour level  at that time i fell typical day at work."
bad,"A typical day starts with multiple phone messages and email questions from employees nationwide requiring immediate answers to questions relating to Travel expense reports. Many questions require researching expense reports. Employees' American Express statements have to be looked at and reconciled with there Concur account."
bad,El trabajo remoto full time compensa por los bajos sueldos.
bad,"I enjoyed learning new things and having the opportunity to work on different projects with different systems. I met and worked with a bunch of different people both face to face and via instant chat.  I moved into more and more positions of responsibility but the way IBM has it structured is that the only bump in pay you get is if you are actually hired into a different pay band.  You start out as contract labor and have to stay there for a period of time (mine was 3 years) until they HAVE to hire you on as what is called ""IBM Long Term Supplemental"" for 3 years.  During that time your rate of pay is locked unless they promote or hire you into a different band AND if you reach the end of your 3 year term they will either decide to hire you on as an IBM employee or you have to go back to contract labor."
bad,Released while working critical server hardening. Little care of employees. Reviews based on preparation for release.
bad,"Environment is in constant churn. Job insecurity is prevalent. Co-workers are excellent, but upper management sees people purely as resources, not as individuals."
bad,IBM Software Labs is a nice place to learner. there are a lot of resources. Process are well defined. I recommend IBM as work place to work
bad,The pay is very good but the work culture and management of the company isn't like a consulting company and I think that may have to do with the company hardware.sales past.
bad,I felt like a disposable piece of equipment that was waiting to be decommissioned. Constantly worried about job stability.
bad,Big company. Very hard to get things done. The company is very big and much political. The company is Management centric rather than employee friendly.
bad,"IBM is a manager driven company. In other words, managers are the most powerful people here. HR are just for namesake."
bad,Too much work and not enough people to do it. Management can be either wonderful or awful - no in-between. Pay is no longer competitive in Silicon Valley.
bad,"Typical work day was resolving issues for customer with pc's, desktops and warehouse equipment."
bad,The high turn over of the staff makes it a very good job if you are able to learn on your own but makes it hard to resolve the long term issues.
bad,"•	Providing First Level of  IT support for customer via Telephone,email and chat ."
bad,"Administrating EMC Symmetrix DMX, VMAX & CLARiiON Arrays. "
bad,"	Provide Technical support to UK for Broad band connection.   "
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to assist and help customers to the best of my ability in avoiding foreclosure and giving the options that are available to avoid foreclosure on their property.
bad,The work is really great and I work with amazing people but we all have a hard time being able to keep up with the workload given the amount of resource actions and budget cuts that occur.
bad,"It was okay to work there, but I honestly did not like the people that were there."
bad,"Ibm is good for work from Home facility, though it depends on Project"
bad,"Good Place to earn and learn"
bad,"The plan behind the collaboration appeared to be ideal however gainshare arrangements drove inappropriate behaviours,"
bad,"The industry is very exciting, but the plant I worked for was under financial strain and the strain on the business reflected on the moral of the employees."
bad,"• Provide leadership in terms of complex business and technology solutions to IBM clients."
bad,"My time at IBM was one of the most rewarding times of my life. The people I worked with were the best. They exhibited passion, commitment and energy to make IBM service the best in the industry."
bad,"Travail ennuyant et trop passif, excellent pour personnes a la pre-retraite"
bad,"	Customer services"
bad,"Working with IBM is a good experience."
bad,The system is only driven by stringent policies and procedure and to bring about any innovation and breath-taking approach is almost impossible. It demands very long hours which disturbs the work life balance and puts the safety and security of a female employee at stake.
bad,"IBM Daksh being the first job in my Career has Encouraged  and Motivated me in Making My Career  So Learning and Meomrable."
bad,"It was a place of to much drama :( Enjoyed my work, but.....not enough communication between higher ups and employees with new procedures."
bad,"This was a contract position through Kelly's Services. "
bad,"A good company to work with with a lot of learning since this was my first job."
bad,AT one time it was a good place to work.   The local managers don't know what their people do nor do they feel they have to.
bad,worked with Microsoft ISV ecosystem to develop new PC architecture based upon the PowerPC. Ported 100's of partners to platform
bad,"Its all about the chat process. we used to solve the queries of the customer through chat. I learned how to take care of the customers when they were in a bad situation, tried to resolve their queries. The hardest part of the job was to be online most of the time and had to handle 2 chats at a time. So we have to be vigilant enough while we were on a chat, cause a single mistake would have shattered us as we were being monitored by representives of Ibm. The enjoyable part was we had lots of incentives apart from our salary and the overtime bonus. Co workers are excellent in their approach and helped the new entrants in a very casual manner, just to make them know the job was quiet easy and to be relax."
bad,A typical day when they say they gonna sale the company.
bad,Good work life balance. Relaxed work env. Not a place to grow big.
bad,"good exposure to mnc environment,. better understanding towards IT norms."
bad,IBM values are these:
bad,"Due to personal needs, not really worked for long"
bad,Different kind of management I have ever seen with consulting firm and inevitably they are good in terms of performing the process & controls at workplace and there are compliances & procedures introduced to when i joined the company.Looking for opportunities to grow and develop my career and in the midst of finding better career path within the company.
bad,"Always many projects and tasks in the air. I had to be very structured and had to be very selective. I worked pretty much on my own, that my manager was located in UK and I in Denmark, but I liked it this way, because I'm very selfgoing and like to do projects and work end to end."
bad,Big company with disparate culture. Difficult to find footing
bad,This supplier became less favourate reseller for IBM terminals. They don't treat their staff well. No benefit package. No bonuses with high sales volume; on the contrary they dropped my commission rate when signing National Corporate Accounts.
bad,HR is not very strong in IBM. Your queries remain unanswered. There is lot of stress over the place. Hike is quite less. There are very few promotions in the company.
bad,"Takes innovative small companies and tries to mould them into the IBM corporate environment.  Great local work environment, as long as you can be isolated from the corporate politics."
bad,"Most day's I can't complain about but The upper management decisions that were made were very arrogant and seemed like were made by a narcissist. It was perform the way I want you to perform or you are out of here. Happened to many quality people I knew and admired. Micromanaged by upper management that had no Idea what was going on in the lower ranks. A sales manager managing service I thought is was very cut throat It was very stressful at times. It was not like that in other areas of the company. Just Customer Service and some other areas. A great company going down the tubes in a hurry because of this. It may be the culture of all computer companies these days, I can see how everything is moving to the cloud. I would work for them in another capacity like product support."
bad,"A typical day on the bench... Find a project that either is out of time range, already has a candidate, or is on hold. Managers still make us apply to them for the numbers. A typical day on a project....Majority of the time it is hard work but with people on the project it is not that stressful all the time. Then there are those that everything goes wrong and banging your head on the wall does not help. "
bad,not what it use to be. morale is low. Have also had great first line manager. Teams used to be great. Every one is just wanting to be let go. Most enjoyable part of the job was the teams I worked with over the years.
bad,"A lot of possibilities, good people, but it looks like the company is not doing financially so well overall. "
bad,"Flexible work culture is the good point, but that again depends on the client. Appraisal and people management could have been better."
bad,"the most difficult part of job is that shifts are rotational."
bad,If you are looking for job stability and brand name then IBM is the place. Everything else is a negative here. Salary is below market standards unless you join the company at  Band 8 and above. Employee benefits are not great and its highly beurocratic with lots of policies in place which can be annoying. 
bad,"During Migration we spend around 10 hours in office."
bad,"Good security related processes , Pure technical company . lot of learning opportunity . We should be willing to put extra effort for your learning"
bad,IBM inside people not getting Equity salary as Lateral or at least near to to the Lateral payment scale Border........................................
bad,"Quiet a learning experience for the duration that i spent at IBM secure in job place was good i enjoyed my position, I Started out as warhouse Associte,, I worked my way up as test Analize and repair.            Yes i would work for IBM again i would reccomend my next generation to work at IBM, if giving the Opp."
bad,"About what you would expect from a corporation. Work hard to gain as much experience. Cannot complain of the flexibility in terms of work location and hours. Sadly, compensation is lacking."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"pass up on IBM.  They have a bad history of Pay cuts, Furloughs, layoffs that break contracts. I was layed off in a position that per the customer contract required a us citizen and left indian resources in place."
bad,"Workers and line management are great. But upper management doesn't know how to manage and is totally reactionary and doesn't appear to see the big picture. Layoffs occur quarterly based on earnings results and revenue loses even ignoring cyclical trends. Many jobs continue to move offshore and aren't recorded  to the government as such, ie, they report a consolidation but the work does not actually go away it is just moved to China or india."
bad,"Overall rating*- ***"
bad,"I think this is not required."
bad,"Best company is work with,maximum job security. Salary and hike is very less."
bad,They provide a quality service but the service they have provided in the past seems to have a shrinking market.  They have been working to adjust the focus of the services they provide which seems to be working but time will tell.
bad,"Seterus, a unit of IBM, is in loan servicing. Seterus follows most of IBM's policies on IBM campuses; however Seterus' main HQ is in Oregon and some different policies apply."
bad,"IBM paid well and offered a professional work environment.  However, the skill of code-merging was limited to a very particular environment and, as such, did not greatly advance my technical abilities.  My team leader gave very vague specifications for developing new code and constantly changed his mind about those specifications.  Since the applications were time sensitive and the changes were frequent, modifications to the code were always being rushed into production and it was difficult to apply best practices.  Under these circumstances, however, I learned to write extremely atomized code that could be modified and extended as quickly and effectively as possible.  I learned how to code in anticipation of specification changes, which is a skill I applied to great advantage at my next job."
bad,It was a very educational experience I enjoyed the time I worked there very much and I am disappointed that I no longer work there due to down sizing
bad,"Management was good"
bad,"I was an intern after my Sophmore summer of college. I did not have a lot of skills going into this summer and I didn't coming out. Unfortunately, the program was new at the time and was unstructured so I did not have much to do."
bad,the most enjoyable part of the the job i learned so many things
bad,"good experience to work with IBM. It's nice company. I learned so many work like how to assess  laptops and desktops, and installation.IBM have excellent management. I has really good team to work with them."
good,My initial thought was that IBM was a great company. Things have changed over the past year. You have to find a project in order to actually do some work which is absurd. The management forces you to get on a project that doesn’t fit your skill set or that you don’t have interested in. You are expected to work 50 to 60 hours a week if you’re on a project and you don’t get compensated for working over 40 hours a week. It’s just way more negatives than positives. I wouldn’t recommend IBM to anyone.
good,"Company is on its way down, it will be a very long (prolonged) fall but they are falling. In the 15 years I was with IBM I had 12 managers, none of them had any real vested interest in me.  IBM what a mess, what a shame, it could be so good but internal politics and layers of management have laden this golden goose to a lead balloon."
good,"Lots of smart people working hard to transform the company, but constant cutbacks take its toll on morale. Always seems to be a take-away from employees, on my observation"
good,"I would rather not comment on the culture at IBM, or the work place. I think IBM was horrible place. They did not or do not take care of their employees. I was a contractor, new more about their computer systems. I was asked to train a new college grad on the equipment, then was told not to answer her questions after her training was completed. IBM only wanted their employees to train the IBM employees. not contractors. Yet the IBM employees would come to me to get answers. I never strayed away from giving IBM the utmost professionalism, and confidence to the IBM employees. Never misleading on any answer to their questions."
good,Big blue from the 1970's through to 1989 was as good an employer as you could find on all fronts. But financial realities and a titanic shift in attitude towards employees made it a poor poor employer
good,Pay is limited and when the call center is on vacation in India all the call are transfered to Boulder. We did not have the staff to handle the mess. It is a good learning experience for IBM.
good,It wasn't a bad job just not secure. I troubleshooted problems on computers for turbotax. training wasn't so good there but that was because this is the first time they had an account there. nothing is safe they will let you go at any time there.
good,"IBM invested to earn money, The jobs in BPOs in India are very monotonous, the employees are expected to follow very strict protocols, which makes the executives only the followers."
good,"Since I have been through the process of a re-structure my workload has doubled, going forward I don`t feel the account is stable as there is a possibility of the business to be re-located."
good,"Very large company leading to very little recognition.  Expected to work very long hours to meet deadlines and budgets, and all decisions made with financial gain as the primary goal."
good,"Stressful and low paying job"
good,Good workplace nice team work but salary and benefit wise not good.Can learn more and the leader of the team is very nice person. Who can lead the team with good leadership quality
good,"* Not liked that much, since feels like a schooling.  Managers are arrogant.  They are like PT masters."
good,"There was very little return on investment for time put in, and little to no recognition for a job well done and accomplishments achieved. There was no employee morale and no team spirit, no one felt appreciated and everyone felt as though they were being taken advantage of."
good,"Dificil evolucion profesional, demasiada burocracia excesivos gestores, subida de salarios nula"
good,Held a contract position. Was not impressed with management
good,This was an ok temporary position. I just did not enjoy shift work and working weekends
good,"Nesta empresa aprendi a lidar com todos os tipos de pessoas, e a principalmente me desenvolver o meu lado profissional, por ser uma empresa multi nacional. mas o seu maior defeito é serem irresponsáveis a ponto de não terem horários a serem cumpridos corretamente, tendo dias onde entrei uma hora da tarde de uma sexta feira e sair somente as sete horas da manha do sábado, sem receber nada como extra, esse foi o meu único motivo de sair da empresa."
good,"Working for IBM was a dream of mine but my engagement with them was very disappointing. There were payment irregularities and deliverable demands that didn't account for proper follow through - inflexible management, insufficient information and unclear communications"
good,"Work work work, no life, clueless managers."
good,Unfair paid because i didint get increment but i have to work until late night but still manager not recognised our contribution towards company. I feel really disappointed with management.
good,"No vacation for last 8 years of employment, “Needs of the business “.  I worked there many years ago when medical Bennys were very good.  They still expect blood from a stone!!!"
good,"So it might not be super relevant, but management was a problem, as was company direction. And really, IBM rarely cared about what we did so long as they got their money."
good,Expect you to be married to the company 24 hrs a day. Often tell you of advancement only to take it away again. They seem to enjoy creating a competitive regime with poor administration
good,No room to advance.  Colocation requirements ridiculous.  Lost a lot of great people due to the ugly practice of requiring colocation to specific cities that targeted the older population.
good,"Company is a very good place to work if you are with the right crowd."
good,"My time at IBM was a means to an end. I was there for a paycheck. There was no chance of advancement. Come in, sit down, answer the phone, and repeat until your 8 hours were done."
good,"It took some time to actually see just how screwed UP the company was.  Lots of in fighting, culture clashes and mismanagement.  Assignments were given on a best friend basis.  Performance reviews were a joke and the lack of detailed project management plans made for a real FUBAR of a time in developing customer plans The customer plans were also almost impossible with the creation and direction of work groups."
good,"They do not compensate their employees. Always just a pat on the back . good job. I worked from Home. Worked directly with Customers and Sales Reps. Processed Computer Contracts, Assisted Billing at times with collections. Too many conference calls. Too many layers of managers to go through to get approval for things to get done. Most of IBM work has gone over seas. They lack good management."
good,"Not much job security. This company is always changing and you are often very expendable. Constant lay off and downsizing. Although I felt I if I was making a difference, it's a very ""what did you do for me TODAY"" kind of environment"
good,"Typical days including travel begin at 5 AM and end at 10 PM. Management is weak in many areas including executives. There really is no enjoyable part of the job. Very stressful demands put on sales executives like me."
good,"The smartest people working as hard as possible. The employees at IBM are simply the best you will find in any corporate company. Creating a work/life balance is possible if the employee takes ownership of creating the balance and maintaining it. World-class training in all aspects of the technology business, sales, technical/lab opportunities, and worldwide roles available."
good,"More hectic work with less resources and less pay. Less Growth."
good,"IBMer for the most part are good folks who are over worked and under compensated. Management is constantly running to the next big thing without finishing tasks at hand. "
good,It was a good company but one experience jeopardizes its image where rights dues were not given to employee and he was denied giving the legitimate support o him
good,"I can't recommend this as a good place to work. Even with very low SLA's the directors only see the number of tickets closed. They're not reviewing the complexity of the issues resolved or if the tickets are parent/child tickets. I'm not sure if they get paid by the ticket but in my book, no tickets means we're all doing our jobs. No need to always threaten to place our jobs overseas..."
good,"IBM has always been a company to be proud to work for.  That is no longer the case.  Although there are many, many tools and things out there for learning and growing your skills, it's because there are SO MANY things, there is no clear direction sometimes.  The job culture has changed significantly because of the continual outsourcing of US jobs.  Sometimes, 90% of your team that you may work with is in another country.  Sad part is the lay offs happen constantly to the US teams.  Which typically are the main support. "
good,"Working at IBM you have the chance to meet really great people and learn from thought leaders.  I am proud to have been amongst the cast. "
good,"There was never a budget for education and therefore one grows stagnant and there is limited room for growth."
good,"It is a remote position but there is no job growth.  I have been here for 3 years at the same salary, no benefits and always have the ever forsaking furloughs."
good,"I love to work in the environment where I am currently working."
good,"Raises are minimal, short staffed, tends to over work the employees and management does not seem to know what they are doing.  No room to advance.  The benefits are good but is a very stressful environment.  Layoffs occur often."
good,"No Advancement, No Recognition, stapled to your desk and not many people enjoy the department, supervision is lacking and training is none existent."
good,"That maxim, it seems, also applies to IBM’s annual performance review—a 10-year-old system called Personal Business Commitments. The program will be replaced with a brand new approach this week, one that gives more opportunity to shift employee goals throughout the year and includes more frequent feedback."
good,"- Good working hours (Follow Australia time)"
good,"It not as what i am expected. Processes are very slow. I am looking for some thing relay technical, but i found there is less amount of technicality."
good,"When I first started off with IBM it was the best place to work, I enjoyed coming into work, even enjoyed the weekends.  "
good,"IBM m'a permis d'acquérir une grande expérience dans le domaine de la logistique. Le travail en lui meme était intéressant, mais les horaires 2x2x2 (2jours 6h/15h, 2j 14h30/23h30, 2j 23h/6h) n'étaient plus compatibles avec ma vie de famille."
good,Nice company to work for. We are mostly all temps however. Not many opportunities for advancement. Very easy work.  Nice friendly people.
good,Empresa que não da valor aos funcionários porém boa de se trabalhar.
good,Siento que muy buena para aprender ha realizar las cosas lo cual siento que soy responsable e intento de superme cada dia
good,"Atividades rotineiras: "
good,"Boring. "
good,"1) A typical day at work is to meet tight SLA's with 99.9% of accuracy."
good,"When I was hired, job for life unless sexual harasement or stealing, now just another number"
good,"Had many leading consulting projects, met many very intelligent co workers. In the past years became a position which had to meet goals that were impossible to meet, and had very little contact with management. Simply stated I became a resource to be used, not a person with skills that could be used. "
good,"Was handling reconciliations of different entites and posting the Journal entries for the month end period."
good,"A good job to have but expections were too high for someone who had no knowledge at all about mortgages."
good,under utilized my skills. Contracted with Apex Systems. I learned not to take my time for granted.
good,"The typical day was okay but it was just not a permanent position, it was tempt position and also the company lost the contract. I would provide assistant on travels and expense report along with visa for international travel ."
good,The first thing i would do is log in and check my queue to see what was due today contact the client and set a time to resolve there issues as quickly as possible. Next check the following days tickets and do as many as i could so i would not fall behind for the following day. Everyday there is a new challenge and multiple ways to resolve computer issues what might work one time might not the next time must be quick on my feet or i will trip on them. The management team was there to help if there was an issue that needed managements involvement very reliable and easy to get in contact with although i did not get along with the manager of the whole team. My co-workers were fantastic we all got along and were always willing to help each other at a moments notice. The hardest part of the job was voice mail i would leave voice mail for the client to call me back so that i could address there issue and they would not call me back i have had to track the client down at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is when i have made the client happy and there computer is working problem free and if they need my assistance i am more then happy to help.
good,Deal with network problems referred from IT coordinators/advisors
good,high turn over rate i didnt like it will never return to this employer
good,IBM is a not a place for knowledge seeker.They will assign a project where you cant grow and make you sit in the same project for years.Everything is dependent on the managers.
good,"High stress environment, managers are stressed. No benefits,  no paid leave. Non flexible schedule and no room for advancement. Managers play favorites."
good,"I do not wish to make any comments about my employment at IBM, other than excellent products and excellent development labs. "
good,Typical day at work remained same as it did prior to takeover from the Company that was now my account.  The out of state (no face to face contact) was new & different but worked to an extent
good,"No Proper training, over worked 8 support techs for 10,000 end users, no benefits, supplemental employee, 5 year contracted ended 2 years early due to IBM management not working properly with client, we got let go with very little warning, IBM blocked being hired from client. One person from team got moved to another account because he new the manager for the past. but he quit not to long after that. In other countries IBM seems great for them, but not in USA."
good,"Es un buen trabajo para aprender"
good,I would say good for beginners and very senior level roles not at all good for dedicated middle level people. No path is defined neither the measurement for performance
good,"Muitas oportunidades de fazer cursos, colegas de trabalho excelentes e pessoas que querem fazer a diferença. A flexibilidade já foi algo bem melhor, mas ainda há um pouco. A compensação está bastante abaixo do que se pratica no mercado e há muito trabalho, geralmente a flexibilidade e plano de saúde compensam essa parte. O que mais desanima é a liderança antiga e que não age de acordo com o que a empresa prega e precisa, que é inovação e ter foco no cliente. As amenidades precisam passar por uma renovação urgente há anos e não se vê planos para isso."
good,"IBM is very good place to work., we have more options to learn like certifications and other events,Management is not good , if they can change management behavior  this company will leads to top place list in world."
good,"Between layoffs and contractor furloughs, all work is dumped on those remaining, and you better not tell your accounts about the furloughs and layoffs"
good,"It totally depends on your manager, how your journey would be in a huge company as IBM. If you get a good manager who understands and consider your aspirations too then it would be a good to survive else there lot of such manager in IBM who think it otherwise."
good,Work pressure at its peak and management is not concerned about the basic needs of employee(especially in case of working mothers who just came from maternity leave).
good,"IBM is very much all about the metrics. Lots of emphasis on reporting and data collection. Management did not show much interest in their employees' day to day experience or what customers thought of their service. All efforts to improve were focused on the reporting side. Customer service improvements and training needs were rarely addressed."
good,IBM seems to be short on cash and trying to play catch up in the marketplace. This means that they try to hire engineers for less and then use grueilla management tactics to produce lots of output. I think this is more out of necessity rather than culture. As IBM tries to undergo a transformation to a more forward thinking company there are a lot of growing pains and most of these things are side effects. I think ultimately IBM will get through this and it could be a good place to work in the long term. One great thing about IBM is that they have some interesting stuff to work on and it can be fun at times.
good,"The annual global revenue has been in decline for years, from over $100B in 2011 to $70B in 2017. As you can imagine, culture, innovation, loyalty, and moral are also in free fall."
good,"The buildings are old and the culture is sad and dismal.  A lot of work is expected in a very short amount of time.  As a Contractor you are relegated to a 40 hour week, but given 60 hours of work.  Most people work off the clock just to complete their work load.  No matter what you do, to go from Contractor to Regular Employee is almost impossible."
good,"My days were long at IBM"
good,"not a happy place to work, everyone seems stressed and confused about their future in the organisation, I guess it's a general feeling in the industry, anyway, with all the jobs being offshored, like mine, as I transferred my expertise overseas and didn't get the contract renewed after.."
good,"It was a good position for a job right out of college. I worked here full time while I was still in college, I learned a lot but the location was away from my home."
good,The pay was really poor. You can't expect an employee to work 16 hours a day knowing that they won't be paid for overtime. The management makes you feel insignificant.
good,El área de A/R es una de las mas importantes y mas retribuida
good,"As a contractor there is a clear divide between ""True Blue"" and Engaged Contracted Consultants "
good,"A empresa está passando por transformações, tentando se adaptar aos novos tempos e ao novo mercado. Infelizmente em suas ações atuais de re-estruturação está focando na demissão de pessoas antigas (ainda muito produtivas).  Exige muito dos funcionários em suas cotas (por vezes inatingiveis) de vendas em mercados decrescentes, e mesmo que voce tenha um resultado (Melhor do Mundo ) na sua função isto não representa e nem tão pouco garante a estabilidade no emprego. Ja no ponto de progressão de carreiras, a empresa não apresenta critérios justos para alocação de candidatos nas posições e na maioria das nomeações somente os que mantem relacionamento pessoal e proximo aos executivos tem a oportunidade de crescimento. Poderia ser um lugar excelente para se trabalhar mas atualmente deixa a desejar."
good,Continued strong-arming expecting a different result from very talented people.  Senior leadership needs to be re-evaluated.  Mid-level leadership has very little ability to impact culture and organization currently.
good,This is required.  Workforce is more about competition and collaboration.  Focused on self-promotion and and getting credit. Lack of true teamwork found.
good,"This place is for the birds , the training was not that great  but you have to have the skills before you get there but even thought you do it may not help that much"
good,"There is no leadership in IBM, only CEOs that want their bonus and will layoff people to get it. They talk about cloud as if it is something new. IBM has been doing it for the last 15 years and are only using it as a way to get rid of people."
good,"IBM has gone to being a stable job to one of waiting for the pink slip.  The pink slip is coming it is jus a matter of time. IBM is not doing well in business and is also not growing so they have to reduce costs and to do that employees are terminated now on a regular basis.  When I was at IBM it was mostly a US company.  Out of the 400,000 employees, over 150,000 were in the US.  Now less than 70,00 of the 600,000 employees are in the US.  IBM can't offshore their work fast enough."
good,"Worked with IBM for about 4 years. No Career Advancements. Same routine work. "
good,Management is unable to look at the overall big picture. Client complaints are looked at as an agents fault instead of the overall support system which does not and can not work. Management is more likely to change the entire way things are done to appease a few clients then to help work all clients into the system as set up. Leading to large scale confusion on how processes or due to the lack of processes things are to be handled. No support by management for employees.
good,"A IBM e um bom lugar para trabalhar, tem um bom clima de trabalho e bastante suporte para o que necessita , com bons cursos para a area que queria trabalhar ou para conhecimento proprio."
good,"Global services is cut throat, Management is clueless and incompitient. They try to offshore as many jobs as possible and replace with overseas employees. Run"
good,"As a HR professional i am having around 7 Years of experience into IT recruitment with the ability to deliver time bound solutions under pressure, carrying exposure in Indian as well as Global markets with experience in End to End recruitment."
good,"IBM is not doing well so while this scrappy start up is making good products for the marketplace, they are unable to guarantee employment because of the poor results of the company globally"
good,It might be a great place to work but not at Lansing. You feel like the pay is terrible and they don't have health insurance. Well they do but it's more expensive than it's worth and on the wages they pay it's not affordable enough for a family. Just overall an unhealthy work environment.
good,"Too many changes to keep track of.  You compete against product sellers, domain sellers and have sales targets that vary widely depending on fiscal year financial requirements"
good,"IBM ISL is a name to reckon with and the team members are friendly. The technology is advanced and interesting to work on. However, the R&D group has a very relaxed and chilled environment with very less challenging jobs"
good,"No real future in a career as a Hardware IT tech."
good,"No work life balance. A lot of work."
good,"IBM is one the best company in INDIAN market, which provides the opportunities to fresh graduates. IBM is a real Engineer making machine. It picks the people from any background in terms of education and make them very import in IT market."
good,"manejo de montacargas hombre parado ,hombre sentado, recivo ,enbarques ,surtido de material , conteos ciclicos inventarios.."
good,"The company management's focus is on continued increase in profits and less directed towards customer satisfaction than should be expected from a company of this stature.  However, I always found the account team to be dedicated and highly committed to the client they support.  With the transfer of many jobs to offshore locations the technical skills of the support teams are not always of the caliber expected and so provide a challenge in day to day operations."
good,"IBM has been referred to as a ""Pillar of American Society"" and I've been honored to work for them for as long as I have.  The challenge they face now is a heavy handed old school management trying to be ""hip"" but do so by still holding to the longstanding bureaucracy and ignoring the culture that made them great."
good,"I liked the people I worked with here just fine, but their benefits were sub par for a Fortune 100 company, and they cut back on the benefits anytime it helped their bottom line.  They are more than willing to sacrifice their employees to enhance the bottom line.  Their management was the good ole boy network, with many inept people getting promoted because of connections rather than hard work or performance."
good,"a typical day would include 9 hours of hard work."
good,Anybody who follows IBM knows it is a shell of it's former self. It is a company that treats employees as liabilities instead of assets. It is now run by executives who want to squeeze every dollar out of the employees to improve the value of their stock options.
good,People are non co-operative. Management are not so good. Company don't have any Image about employee orientation and satisfaction.
good,"1-Worked from kolkata location of cheaters."
good,"Good Work Life Balance, No benefits for the people. No Salary hike."
good,Typical Day would include numerous meetings with Team and Managment.
good,"Management concerned with number of hours worked, not with individual success or career growth."
good,"Good work/life balance, wide variety of technologies to work on and job opportunities, but very volatile, difficult to work in the culture"
good,"I have had a very successful career at IBM."
good,take out going and incoming calls from customers for current and past due mortgages.
good,"No good opportunities, lot of politics at work, very stressful life"
good,"Every Day is learning"
good,"Rotational Shift"
good,The emphasis now is in the reduction of the work force with the emphasis on the US.  This strategy appears to be without regard for customer satisfaction and quality.  Employees are required to work harder/longer with less
good,"Supported active directory domain at somers, ny. Intel system administrator. Low pay, close to home, 0 benefits."
good,"Depends on your client and team. If you are on a great project with a collaborative team, sky is the limit. On the flip side, it is very easy to become stuck, and there is really nothing you can do about it."
good,"Salário é suficiente para comer."
good,"Nice place to work but Management poor."
good,"The company seems to chase fads and downsizing, while leaving their employees to pick up the pieces and guess what skills might be required in the future."
good,"It wast a good work environment,  They put way to much work on people who knew what they were doing and did nothing to people who lied on their resume.  The management is less that capable.  They choose favorites.  If you're not on that list they give you all the work their friends don't want."
good,I found that I had to use management time 24/7 to compensate for different time zone to work co-workers.  Had many teleconference calls to review budget for multiple on-going projects. My family life had to be adjusted to allow for job commitment and to see projects through the end.  There is no such thing as job security.
good,"Large complex political environment.   Upward progression happens, but often depends on who you know and your visibility vs. what you know or have accomplished."
good,"30 years ago this was the company be with."
good,"team politics turned me off, they protected old employees over justice. Old employees had bad attitude and talked badly about new employees and won't help them learn IBM Cloud technology."
good,"IBM is all about closing sales, mostly cloud.  They are not committed to technical skills, they are committed to writing orders only."
good,Great place to work if you have the right manager that supports you.Employees are friendly.Most enjoyable part is meeting new people and new assignments.Hardest part is getting people to let your opinions count and not look at it as only their opinions matter.
good,Empresa com muitos processos engessados e gerência retrógada.
good,"Good to start in the IT field specially in Networking, Data Center environment, but if you do not have any friend or family that help you out or defended  you from the poor management, you will not last on this company. HR I believed is so busy that, do not even care what happened with the employee and do not get involve. Notice from other employee that If you make a report, they will put you in the spot with all the management and employee will know what have happened. I personally did not make any because I saw the situation and seen to be a waits and the situation will worsening for sure.  You are in your own if you do not have Patronage. You can be better than there friends but it doesn't matter. You have been target and they will not stop until you are out."
good,"This is good company for fresher as a learning center. But need to change many things for experienced. Job security poor, salary structure and bonus very very poor"
good,"I have learned Maniframe,QC tool and other basic tool related to testingOfficetime is flexible.Pick up and drop facility are provided."
good,"Honestly, Productive yes, but all depends on who is taking responsibility for whom. Zero Co-ordination between Management, and HR team. I worked for only 8 months in this company, during 8 months I had salary issues, the pay which was promised to me and offered after joining had a difference of 1500 rs. however I wanted a job, because I was jobless, for which i had to accept which was offered to me later. So HR team took an advantage of my honesty. Later apart comes during PF info, after leaving the company, and till date, no one helped in claiming the PF. Nowadays its Online, but during that period, without a stamp from company's headoffice you can forward your PF Details."
good,"Contractor so cannot write detailed review, but was able to work remotely some days."
good,"Trabajé varios años en la empresa, la.posibilidad de aprender y trabajar globalmente es enorme. Trabajé para managers de muchas nacionales y es enriquecedor a nivel cultura de trabajo. El work-life balance es muy malo. El lobby para las promociones no es algo que vaya a extrañar. La burocracia tampoco..."
good,Kept trying to squeeze more and more work out of everyone when we were already short handed.  Constantly changing their minds on how things should be done.
good,Hard work and caring were not appreciated.  Raises were rare and minimal.  Bullying by contractor management was stressful.  There was constant threat of outsourcing for years.  Our team was slowly eliminated until all were gone.
good,Laatste jaren veel strategisch werk gedaan voor IBM zonder betere beloning
good,"very good for a fresher and good work culture there."
good,"IBM paid well, but in the field as a sub contractor I did not know who really was part of what I was doing.  And, the IBM'ers did not associate with sub contractors...."
good,"Good times are long gone for IBM and it is trying hard to find new ways how to make money, i.e. jump on outsourced service model bandwagon. Although humble IT engineers work hard to deliver aggressive SLAs often between way too many clients, products and projects, middle management provides no support or recognition. Morale was very low that time."
good,"Hardest part was - IBM is a huge company - easy to get lost  in all of the product lines."
good,"there was a point in time where I was very happy here. but the layoffs have really hurt people and have made It difficult to come in, and not know if I will be next."
good,The environment at IBM is quite conducive for learning.  One can learn the art of surviving and thriving under conditions of ambiguity. Also the global presence of the organization provides wonderful opportunities for learning and growth.
good,"Mucho curso online para realizar"
good,Lots of layoffs.  Beware.  They continue to layoff (resource action) employees every year.  Layoffs are not based on performance.  It is not a positive culture place to work.
good,IBM has lost the confidence and started laying off people without knowing what they are doing. Guys working in the project and making money gets laid off because they are going to digital era. This company 's senior most management has no clue and especially the chairman - didn't do anything for the company to build it up for the past 4 years . They need to replace the chairman. This is my honest opinion.
good,"Tier-11 Onsite Local Support for over 13,000 local and remote ATT employees.  All issues not handled by level 1 support, were resolved at our level to customer's satisfaction. Documented support analysis, cause and resolution using online ticketing system. Enjoyed the work culture, clients I supported and team I worked with were exceptional.  I liked working together as a team and transferred of knowledge as needed to assist others in challenging tasks and Incidents. Hardest part was trying to maintain all Escalations and the back log of tickets with limited staff members."
good,"No dia a dia deparo com demandas de solução de problemas, por conhecer bem o segmento e a necessidade consigo tomar decisões estratégicas que auxiliam no resultado final. A parte mais difícil é algumas vezes demonstrar para gerencias formas modernas de tecnológicas de resolver problemas. Mas o agradável é que na maioria das vezes o resultado é positivo para a empresa."
good,Worked hard and many long hours for very little appreciation.  No culture to speak of.  People were treated as replaceable commodities.  No real positives to this experience.
good,It is very sad to see IBM continually lay off excellent and hard working IBMers.  IBM has lost its way in the marketplace with both customers and employees.
good,management changed frequently. They do not hire within the company they hire outside. Management changes polices . pay rate decreased but the benefits were amazing.
good,Started off with lot of expectations career wise but eventually died off due to management politics and biased decision making based on pleasing higher management
good,"Manager dependent company,No career growth,No salary hike,No job satisfaction future will be spoil better try to placed in other company.Thanks to all"
good,"In IBM you are just a number.  No one can tell you how a process works from start to finish.  They only know their part and have no idea how to direct you to the 'next' link in the ongoing chain.  I have not had a vacation in over 5 years without having to take my computer along with me and work...therefore, not a vacation."
good,"Not much to say other than the pay structure is misleading, the benefits package is also the same it is very expensive, management is lacking as far as help and incourgement, typical call center, controlled eniviorment."
good,"If you are hired as a Contractor for IBM, count on zero benefits. Also, there is no opportunity to be hired as Full-Time. No matter how hard you work or try to prove yourself in this company, you are nothing as a contractor. Lastly, forget about job security as a contractor or employee. IBM =""I've Been Moved."" Once you learn new software, you will be moved the next day to another team or department and the cycle restarts."
good,"Low quality employees especially the management. Very bad planning skills. No benefits, bonuses or salary increment."
good,"I learned a lot about whole company, dept. management system. I enjoyed communication in English and working with foreigners. Unfortunately management behavior was not appropriate and disrespectful, sometimes offensive and rude."
good,"As a contract worker, you have no benefits and are a consultant in name only.  Your role is as an employee, but without the expenses.  I wasn't even a person working for IBM, I was a contract worker, working for a Consulting company and was an Incorporated Company indirectly paid by the Consulting Company."
good,"De 0 a 10 ...nota 3 "
good,"IBM has not made a profit in 23 QTRS, I am worried for the company."
good,"Not a bad place to work for a year to learn as much as you want... don't plan to stay long though. Much better opportunities out there for techie people, especially in Austin."
good,"was a very toxic work environment before sold off to Lenovo Global Technologies in 2014. never sure of when or how your time may end, good opportunity to move"
good,This is a good company but they rely on a staffing agent to provide Administrative Assistants. It is not easy to be hired directly or to move up and the staffing agency they use absolutely does not take care of it's employees. The pay is very low for this position.
good,"1) Work Life Balance is not good."
good,"You really don;t know what to expect, so you're bound learn something no matter how many years of experience you have. Generally, a great working environment and colleagues are like a family"
good,Each Quarter results in more Resource Actions. Layoffs are a routine part of the culture. Promotions or salary increases do not exist. Lack of respect for the individual.
good,"If anyone is taking time to read this review, please note, IBM has resource actions at least twice a year.  There is NO stability.  Management does not care about the employees and the lives they disrupt when they resource someone."
good,IBM doesn't seem to review management's competency at local sites. They don't seem to invest in the local sites once the clients are locked into their contracts.
good,I started at IBM in Chicago and the office culture was great there. A great team of engineers and management. Compensation was good. IBM was continually coming out with new leading edge products. But they really lost control of the market with the introduction of the personal computer. This was the beginning of a long string of cut backs and layoffs. It was more like the Bataan death march at the end of my tenure. Management was looking for any reason to fire an employee while not appearing to violate their full employment policy.
good,I have been an employee of IBM's for almost three years and it is an experience I will never forget.  I do not want to say much more than that currently since I feel as though I made a mistake when I took this position.
good,The work environment is one of constant fluctuation and at times contention due to merger occurrences. Management was not fully skilled at times. Initial work environment was chaotic and rebadged employees were very hesitant to engage with new employees.
good,I learned SAP as a new Accounting Package by Joining to IBM and easily we can manage both work life and personal life. A good place to work.Work culture s very acceptable to all .
good,"The culture needs serious improvement, the hours are 8 to 5, you don't really gain job related skills, the management is not great, the hardest part of my job is dealing with other people who work for IBM, there are no enjoyable parts of my job"
good,"IBM is a good learning place for anyone to start their career with. I learnt multiple technologies like JAVA, BigData in IBM. Timings are flexible to work with."
good,It was never easy to survive long in a calling environment and there is no learning at all..you always have to act as robots because of very stringent work schedule.
good,"Recomendable temporalmente, para aprender y despues tomar retos diferentes"
good,No recognition for hard work; no career advancement; constant layoffs. Resource action occurs every 3 months along with furlough days for contractors. This company does not care about it's employees.
good,"It has strong core values and process ethics. It has its own culture for conducting business. "
good,"Home office é uma vantagem, porém o baixo salario e a má gestão de pessoas impedem crescimento profissional."
good,"Transferred to IBM during IT Consolidation. "
good,"Not a good place for contractors, permanent may be okay. Contractors are not respected for their efforts and once IBM permanent resource is on the bench, the contractor will be replaced regardless of his or her technical expertise."
good,"Lay offs, Layoffs, and more Layoffs. This happens every quarter year after year. Most also make sure you have an account to charge your time to. Forced overtime. If you didn't make 45 hours a week average then you don't have enough work. Time to review your workload and see if you're eligible for work force re-balancing(laid off)."
good,"The option to work from home is always a plus. And I have worked with some amazing team members. I have really learned from ""being in the trenches"" with my colleagues. Again, I've had awesome fellow team members."
good,IBM has a stratagem of moving their work offshore and systematically reducing their workforce every year. By reducing their headcount for onshore accounts a great deal of workload is placed on each employee making customer satisfaction difficult.
good,Work life balance is given. Work from home is a very good option specially for women employees. Diversity & lot of opportunities are provided
good,"The services division is waiting to be sold to another company.  In the meantime, layoffs are occurring on at least a quarterly basis."
good,"The best part of my day is when I visit my customers who were all local and use my awesome technical resources to support me in my sales process.  However, executive management just moved to an industry model and took away all of my accounts where I had significant pipeline and opportunities and now only have 3 local accounts with virtually no pipeline and will have to travel to the majority of my accounts in OH and NE.  IBM doesn't value relationships that reps have built with customers and forcing reps to give up all of their opportunities they have identified and worked."
good,"I worked in a division that performed data conversions.  We worked long hours, and were expected to check our emails even on Saturdays and Sundays.  Even though we were the most profitable division, they made our bonus plan harder to attain by including other divisions, therefore we never got expected bonuses.  Also, managers who promised help when there were problems ended up blaming the employee who asked for the help when no help was given, then threatened you with your job if you didn't agree with their assessment.  My time at IBM was not a very enjoyable experience."
good,There are a lot of changes going on in IBM right now. Not all of them are good. IBM is trying to change who they are and are sacrificing what once made them great.
good,"Project 1 : KPMG"
good,"Trabalho por projeto com datas de entregas agressivas e muito trabalho e horas extras."
good,The training and the job itself was very educational. I learned a lot during my time with IBM. I will say that corporate level management should play a bigger role in seeing to it that the companies they acquire live up to the IBM name and culture. It is also extremely hard to get converted from contractor to permanent employee status. Management has a lot to do with that.
good,"The company gives the possibility to gain the international working experience and doesn't require a lot of experience."
good,"Management doesn't care about employees, all they want is as much as you are willing to give and pay as little as possible."
good,"A IBM é uma multinacional muito bem vista no mundo todo, mas para trabalhar nela, existe uma necessidade muito grande de abdicação da sua vida como um todo para manter seu emprego."
good,"Muchos jefes, poco salario. Demasiado cambio de proyecto. El sector no es bueno. Se vende mucho humo"
good,i have learned how to work under aggressive time line with huge demand from client.
good,"This company works only on brand image. They don't give money to employees, onsite opportunities are poor. Company sucks life out of you"
good,"Exposure is significant, but it's at a cost of everything else you do in life."
good,"When i joined IBM i wasn't aware that you only get job security with pf, gratuity etc but as IBM says it believes in values; it lies about it on the Employee respect part of it. "
good,"Service Desk positions at IBM Canada (Markham) are a great opportunity to upgrade your resume and obtain on the job experience learning from senior agents, team leads, managers and the rest of your peers. Opportunity to support multiple accounts. Unfortunately, the majority of the hiring for these positions (contract) are through third party recruiters who take a big stake from your pay."
good,"I Have learnt how to handle the job responsibilities and how to manage the daily work with quality and quantity."
good,Learned many different skills through the years.  Advancement with compensation was not available through the last couple of years.  Raises were cost of living barely.
good,"A Call Center Company with interesting and fun co-workers. Everyday, we received international calls of an airline company. The hardest part of the job are from irate customers, but fulfilling when we address the complaints."
good,"Before Kenexa became IBM, it was a great place to work.  I learned a lot.  After the acquisition, I become the point person for a lot, doing more than my role required and was noticed for it but have not been given a raise, promotion, bonus, or matched on my 401k."
good,I have no substantial opinion of this company.  I really do not have much to say positively or negatively.
good,A parte mais difícil do trabalho é a cobrança por atividades extras e network. Aprendi a me relacionar com pessoas de diferentes culturas. Falta treinamento e capacitação aos gerentes. A parte mais agradável é a flexibilidade de homeoffice
good,"Good work/life balance."
good,IBM was a great 1st company.  High turnover and lack of stability.
good,Would require more strong management to lead this company.
good,"an ok place to work for. the working conditions did change over the years ... lately there were no raises and bonuses. The jobs were less and less challenging . Remote Management did not participate."
good,"Used to be a good place to work.  They took away every perk and benefit, but didn't bring up the salaries to match market averages."
good,"Place is like a jail for children, its just bad news"
good,"I was honored, and proud to be on the IBM team.  I believed in the stated core values and mission.  Over time, the actions taken from executive levels down to first line stopped supporting the ""Power Point Visions""  It was disappointing during the last few years, seeing obvious waste, poorly managed business transitions, etc., and having little opportunity to take action to improve the situation. Years of heartbreaking layoffs, which became personal, as managers would not merely layoff, they would professionally and personally insult top contributors in effort to justify the HR decision."
good,"A day satart around 8 oclok with lot of new challenge and fun..daily new things can be learned from the management perspective and from our work by over coming the challenge. Mangement is not so friendly herr in IBM. workers are very co-operative at work."
good,"As an Integration Architect, I was involved with writing and implementing policies and processes covering everything from day-to-day support to Security.  I worked with some really skilled people from around the world.  "
good,"If you want to gain some real-world project management skills, then IBM is the place for you.  The business is run on projects and contracts.  There is also a somewhat clearly defined career path for you."
good,"Los supervisores, gerentes y recursos humanos no piensan en los empleados, la mayoria de los días piden horas extras( Laborar de 7:00 am a 11:00 pm ) y si en algún momento mencionas que no puedes te presionan y amenazan con el despido."
good,"This particular project had a lot of political issues. Despite generating revenue for IBM and producing high quality results, it seemed that there were some major issues."
good,I learned many things in WIPRO .
good,"Typical day at IBM running tools is running multiple tools, keeping track of priorities, count, inspecting lots before moving them to next operations. Need to keep tools running on priority lots so if others come in while working with lower priority, you need to make a change over on tools as soon as the lot is finished running. I've been multi certified on many different tools and many different Departments. Trained and certified many co-workers."
good,"Dia bastante corrido, sempre com muito afazeres, aprendi varios processos, a direção e gerência deixam muito a desejar, a parte mais dificil é não ter apoio e reconhecimento dos coordenadores, a gente se sente apens um numero..Parte agradavel é que fiz varios amigos."
good,Was here only for a short period of time and It was only part time.
good,"nice place to work,very clean,But not my kind of work,not fulfilling for me.not very interesting work"
good,Learned a lot from this company like the type of loans ( Mortgage or personal )
good,"The company is a good place to gain experience across a wide variety on industries. The company is very focused on cost reduction, Cost is reduction one of the primary driving factors,"
good,overall i can say training really helped me to grow my skills but the work given was not according to the training provided. they should give work according to the skills provided.
good,"Getting in the right team and manager can be challenging, but it makes all the difference. Otherwise you can be let out to pasture. and You don't want that."
good,"We have to find out the project, sitting in bench for more than 1 month is a risk. They will ask you to relocate if there are no projects at your location. The hike is not that great. Work from home option is based on your project. Unfortunately the projects are mostly at client location where we have to travel everyday"
good,Es un buen trabajo para alguien que no tiene la obligación de trabajar y no tiene ninguna meta en la vida
good,"It is ok company, if a less experienced person is working here then it is fine but do not expect any growth here, hence incase of no other option it is fine to work here"
good,Its matrix basis company. I keep learning everyday by working on business problem which keep me motivated. In this process some time i feel I am leaning some thing or researching on every new management initiatives.
good,"Si le caes bien al gerente que te toque, ya la hiciste, de lo contrario será un pequeño infierno."
good,I have had some of the best managers in my career and also the worst at IBM.  It really impacts my morale and motivation.  Make sure you get a good alignment and clear expectations.  If you can talk with work colleagues under the same manager all the better.
good,"Stressful work environment under staff and very little help learning how to do things at IBM for someone who has never worked there."
good,"IBM presented me with opportunities to learn and grow technically.  I got to work in multiple areas as my career progressed, and to work with some great people."
good,IBM can be a tough environment where results take precedent above all   Be prepared to work off hours and to live with questionable job security (nobody is safe when the orders to cut staffing comes down).
good,Must be willing to work evenings and weekends as needed in order to accommodate global co-workers.  There is too much top down management.  Departments work independently rather than as one company.  But all team members are highly dedicated and willing to help.
good,"Productive"
good,"The hours were very harsh, I worked Wednesday and Thursday 6pm to 6am then Saturday and Sunday 6am to 6pm. The management wasn't very helpful and would come down hard on people for seemingly no reason, although, some contractors had better management. The work, however, was actually pretty cool and fun. The people we worked and collaborated with were nice. The wages were not very good for the work we did."
good,"Manage a set of accounts, be managed globally. Line managers are not that experienced, thus a high staff turnover. Nonetheless they don’t do coffee for free but it’s a good company to work for"
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, dediquei 16 anos de minha vida a empresa."
good,Highly innovative culture but poor management and organization creates a lopsided productivity curve with extreme stress.  IBM was and could be again America's greatest business but not with the current CEO and senior leadership.
good,IBM provided the opportunity to develop negotiation skills as well as exposure to a steady stream of high value transactions.  My career focus was on identifying IP assets and monetizing.
good,"Ridiculous amount of UNNEEDED training that has nothing to do with your job"
good,Change from a people-oriented company to a policy and procedure company. Too big to control. Many layoffs but none were detected because they weren't in a company atmosphere they were people working from remote sites or from there home. Health insurance had a $4000.00 family deductible. Before you were covered.
good,"It was OK being at IBM.  Not really connected to the home office at all.  It was a panicked, high stress environment in technical support and eventually everyone's jobs at IBM were eliminated.  Good benefits and they were honest about it all."
good,"Very process driven lots of internal meetings and over estimated CRM priority"
good,I never expected to be micro-managed as I have at IBM. Since coming to the company in a buy out we have been slashed by 2/3's and expected to keep the same SLA's. It was difficult with the staff we had much less with what we work with now. I have strived to be the best but it seems like they are doing everything to make this an impossibility. I am very discouraged and disheartened by IBM.
good,Finance is really not that great of a place to work since management gets frustrated with results that you have absolutely no control over. I have no way to go out and sell products to make more revenue yet i get yelled at in meetings for results. It's a horrible environment to have to deal with.
good,"IBM's workplace culture was not very modern when I worked there.  Almost as if they were stuck in the late 80's.  Everything came down to 'running lean', even if it meant pushing so hard it drove good employees out the door."
good,IBM has high workload and low amount of employees that sums up my opinion. If you wish to get your foot in the door and then switch this is the company for you.
good,"Management doesn't reward excellence, or loyalty. Company as a whole is mismanaged, and over reacts to any action.  The company views its employees as financial liabilities."
good,"I was part of a group that had been outsourced to IBM from a customer as part of a contract.  From the very beginning it was clear that we would be giving a lot up.  Our benefits weren't as good. Our ability to bill for overtime changed from time-and a-half to straight time, and then it was removed altogether.  We would work overtime hours and BILL these hours to the customer (our former employer), but we would not be paid for this very same overtime.  This does not make for a happy work environment.  "
good,We have good learning based on the project we are getting. We will be getting shift allowances for all three shifts in IBM. based on out interest we will be getting good activities
good,Some brilliant people and many dull ones.   Good attitudes by most people.  Stifling bureaucracy.   Very “honorable” company in accounting of sales and of product descriptions and presentations.   Good benefits.  Very political
good,Se trabaja muy mal. Presionan a la gente hasta enfermarla. No hay apoyo de ninguna clase en toda la cadena de liderazgo. No fomentan el trabajo en equipo ni el respeto a las personas.
good,"Unless you are in the current 'darling' BU, every day will be a struggle to survive with constant concern of job loss. As a people manager you will struggle to find parity with the review process policy and the actual implementation."
good,"I worked with IBM Malaysia under Manpower Solution Agency, meaning I'm not an IBMer , but i do handle high rank executive of IBM which are located in Singapore."
good,It will not help in your career growth.And doesn't consider about your personal life and only money motive.Happy to leave this company. May be good for old people.
good,Totally focused on results. Very talented team members. Drive is total performance which can reduce the humunaistic side of the relationship with Clients.
good,Setup and configure new computers as required by employees. Maintain computer network for the company which we were supporting. Learned how to support different computer software configurations.
good,"Rotina muito agitada, muita burocracia, favoritismo, falta de desenvolvimento profissional, etc."
good,"Work only for CORE IBM, not a services center.  HIGH turnover rate of employees, super low pay straight out of college.  Great customers, good exposure to major industry."
good,The workplace culture is very stressful and fast paced. It is an ever-changing role that requires you to pay attention to detail. The company offers competitive medical and time off.
good,IBM really need to improve their internal support towards their employees. Need to reduce work pressure on their employees. Provide good hike and salary according to the market standards
good,"A very stressful place to work at. No encouragement or support for stressful job situations. "
good,"Labour outsourcing and rebalancing is the name of the game with IBM. If you are a College hire, sure you have opportunities, but cost is long hours. After a couple of years they move on, through the revolving door."
good,I was impacted by a work force reduction after 7+ years.  IBM has aggressively moved to an off shore model.  Many jobs moving off shore and the client accounts are suffering.
good,Multinacional com processos robustos mas com pouca possibilidade de crescimento profissional.
good,"It is a great company to build your knowledge and leadership capabilities.  Once you have built those capabilities, then you should take those skills to a new company."
good,"IBM is a very good place to work at. Location of the office is in Cyberjaya, and since my job was in the night shift, the place is quiet peaceful to be around at."
good,"IBM has been an ethical company which always keeps the client first approach. On a day to day basis we make constant efforts to meet business requirements by adhering to the customer needs in the following ways"
good,"I was a strong employee with IBM and found myself summarily dismissed when I'd only had 1 negative review (and had already shown improvement).  Also, although I got regular raises, I never got a promotion or title change."
good,Summary should be enough to say it all...primary driver of all decisions and excuse for poor management.  Lots of great opportunities but people management has taken a severe downturn in response to corporate financial pressures...rewarding those focused on near-term gains vice the long-game.
good,There is no job security and the management team does a terrible job at managing staff. Hired thousands of new hires and within a year began laying them off. Poor management.
good,"keep balance on card less 10% more than 0"
good,"Three huge corporate strategic initiatives that completely redefined the entire workforce within a 3 year period. Customers constantly complain about the turn over of reps in accounts and reps never stay on one account long enough to create any sort of real change. Employee moral is at an all time low, with people constantly looking over their shoulder for the next big layoff (or RAs) as they are called. They are losing good talent who are jumping ship and finding new jobs before they are casualty of the RA."
good,Good place if you are just starting. Make sure to spend a lot of time networking. That's the only thing that works at IBM. I got the feeling that you have to go with the flow regardless where the flow is heading.
good,"Need to have experienced personnel in management rolls, the management team had schooling, but no practical experience and or were setting on hands waiting to retire."
good,"It felt like a really hostile environment. Our daily SCRUM calls included getting yelled at over small things. I was new to Agile as was stated in my interview and the people who were supposed to train me wouldn't take time to do it. I learned as I went, but management was impatient."
good,IBM's constant pursuit of the good bottom line by making redundant loyal local employees in favour of low skilled off shore workers destroyed the culture and made the firm a hard place to work.
good,Ótima empresa para carreira e formação de personalidade empresarial.
good,Workplace culture is not good enough. Management is not good enough and not encouraging. Not enough salary. Not enough reward for employee working hard.
good,Manage IBM-IT development cost schedule and quality. Interface with AT&T program Mnagers and business units . I like there to interact with people and learn the culture
good,thus in single line we dont have the job security and need more concern which employee satisfaction also comute to raise the improve solution from the mgmt.
good,"Able to interact and work with some of the most intelligent and hard-working individuals, which provides an excellent teaming and collaborative working environment!"
good,they have little regard as to who can really do the job.  A team loaded with people that can't think outside the box and one or two people that can go beyond the instructions to debug and make work.   So the load keep falling to that person but it is expected not rewarded.
good,"IBM is great to work at, if you actually work for IBM, contractors are not treated well by those who actually work for IBM, they will complain directly to management for absolutely ridiculous reasons and try to get you fired at every turn."
good,"As it stands, if you are not working in one of the IBM Key locations (HQ, Boulder, New York) you are forgotten about and paid well below the normal of your peers. Most managers are remote to their employees and have little idea what their employees are doing."
good,It is an MNC with many branches across different locations worldwide. Overall a good company which offers you scope to learn new technologies as  per your interest.
good,"good company."
good,IBM was not prepared on taking care of there client with employees when they took over Anthem.  They don't' have the necessary Knowledge on how to fix problems or where to direct them. They haven't improved and its been over 3 months.
good,The company is general wasn't a horrible company to work for but the only way to make a decent salary was to work overnight which did not leave you with a good work/life balance. The managers were okay but definitely need to have more training in order to efficiently relay a better understanding of tasks and duties that are expected to be done.
good,"IBM can be a great place to work if the right account is hiring. Many accounts on the IBM campus are poorly managed and unnecessarily stressful. Otherwise, it is a great job for students as the hours are generally very flexible and the pay is alright."
good,"Management not serious about the careers of lower level employees."
good,"Both the company and most employees are facing tremendous pressure to meet very challenging targets and goals. Can be a good place if you find a good team, good manager, and don't care about receiving bonuses or getting a raise (for years... even as a top performer). Company seems stuck with executive leadership that can't seem to make significant, meaningful change."
good,Very bad in salary perspective and if you expect better compensation for your hard work this is not the place to work. Only good thing is you will be having flexibility as there is work from home option.
good,"I was re-badged by my company after 18 years and made an IBM consultant.  The re-badged associates have already been notified our positions will be moving offshore, so we should look to enhance our skills for other assignments, or look for other jobs outside of IBM. There is no clear manager for personnel questions, we are just a body to fill a role and can easily be offshored.  When hired, rebadged associates were told we had the same vacation that we had at our company, but the contract that was signed was for a 45 hour work week. If we take vacation(I had 4 weeks) we need to make that time up with the client and work overtime.  To me, it is compensation time, not vacation time."
good,My schedule changed about 6 times in the 10 months I was working there. They put me on a new account that I had no interest in and stressed I was not comfortable on. When I addressed my concerns they did nothing to make sure I was confident in the work I was doing. They barely trained on the new account and expected my training group to know exactly what we were doing with very little time spent on the subject.
good,"Though salary is not that competitive, I have a learned a lot from this company. Their pieces of training are of high value and they are an equal opportunity company. Career progression is possible, depending on the account."
good,"My initial 16 years working at IBM were very rewarding and I assumed I would be an employee for life.  However, I was let go in 1994 due to massive company restructuring.  I returned to IBM in 2000 but it was not the same company any longer.  My second time with IBM was not rewarding at all."
good,The office is a good place to work in as it is professional and friendly. The management is caring and experienced. Cost cutting is at its best which sometimes take a toll.
good,"Team building"
good,"Typical day is busy"
good,"I have been working at IBM full-time"
good,Please give opportunities to fixed term hired employees also..because compared to regular employees FTH are working good. Some managers are not following the IBM policies regarding FTE growth.
good,"Actualmente he podido ver que gracias a este trabajo he podido ver que soy capaz de adaptarme y aprender rapidamente a nuevas situaciones. Antes de entrar en IBM, no sabía mucho de informática y a día de hoy doy soporte a otros ingenieros, incluso en japonés."
good,"Experis has only contacted me at contract renewal and contract end..  nothing in between.   The worst part of that is that despite having more than 3 months advance notice to contract end, no contact until the day before the contract ended.. little to no effort to foster continuity.  Even worse.. reps appear to be on different databases. As a result, a contract extension of 3 years was actually a contract termination in 3 months. "
good,"As a vendor contracted to IBM, management did not view my team as equals, but as less than equal to IBM regulars. The culture within the Boulder Delivery Center was not one that fostered loyalty or happiness."
good,"Once you are in IBM you will be asked to be oncall 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Make sure to get as high a salary as possible.  Come review time, they will claim poor mouth or not address a raise at all."
good,"I worked days and nights for IBM and there can be days with steady down time and with actual work being balanced into the mix. Management was not on site everyday, but when they are, it doesn't feel like they wanted to truly bond with their employees. As if, when they let you go, they won't feel any sort of remorse. Working nights was a difficult transition and did not come with any bonus of pay for me being forced into that role. I was not happy about it, but I continued to do my job until my contract was up. "
good,"Been here the better part of 20 years and it has been a roller coaster. There have been times when the business and world seemed aligned and IBM performed well and provided great value. Now all they care about are investor profits in the short term and have a very shortsighted business plan outside of services. IBM is no longer a technology company, all their new tech are toys used to wow investors who aren't technology savvy."
good,"Excellent solutions, much it's such a large company with so many management layers making it tough to solve your customers issues with all the different levels of management."
good,I've been with the company over 30 years.  Poor management decisions and terrible business moves and acquisitions have ruined its market competitiveness.  Too much red tape to get proposals complete.
good,The engineers at IBM are great and they have some good young talent coming in. The unfortunate part of IBM is that job security is always a worry. They have multiple layoffs every year.
good,"I respect the fact that IBM is a huge and successful company but my work experience was not very pleasant. I worked as a Technical Specialist and my client was NAB (National Australian Bank). I worked in a graveyard shift starting from 2.00 AM to 11.00 AM for about 9 months and i was losing on my health. I requested manager's for a change of my shift repeatedly for about 5-6 months but that never happened. So, sadly i had to quit as i didn't want to risk my health. Besides everything, I enjoyed my work at IBM. The work pressure was a little high but manageable."
good,You need to fight very hard to grow inside the company. The political environment for those looking to advance will make your life very stressful. The work environment is fun and you would be able to find nice people with a lot of knowledge to share.
good,"La posición de contabilidad en IBM me permitió iniciar mi carrera profesional en un proceso de migración del equipo de Facturación en CEMEX España a IBM Hungría. Fue un proceso complejo, difícil, y supuso un gran reto organizativo para todos los miembros del equipo. Requirió un aprendizaje rápido, bajo condiciones de estrés, para poder migrar todos los procesos y mantener el nivel de calidad en el servicio. Una vez finalizado el proceso de migración con éxito el trabajo estuvo centrado en simplificar los procesos y estabilizar la ejecución. "
good,"Nice work life balance"
good,IBM India is nowhere compared to IBM Global. With the kind of resources available with IBM India it should have given a really tough fight for no 1 spot but they messed up.
good,IBM is take over by Concentrix in the following year I joined and I am here rating Concentrix not IBM. IBM was a great company in regards to salary perspective and other things but when concentrix take over it lowers the standards of the IBM what they have achieved.
good,"Declining sales producing difficult corporate culture, mass layoffs of employees, poor moral. Replacing resourced employees with new hires with little to no experience as a cost cutting measure."
good,The positions have been continually moving offshore to drive down costs. The skill of the resources that we brought on were much lower than the skills of those that were replaced.
good,This is not a place to learn and grow. You as can individual contributor can't grow management. I don't like to work again with such narrow-minded group of managers and People Managers.
good,"IBM is a great company to work but there should be active HR participation and discussions with employees on regular basis to know their issues and hurdles they face with their uplines."
good,"fragmented culture, difficult to manage career, leadership continually changing along with client coverage, compensation is not aligned to effort and talent"
good,"Great for development, but significant lack of work life balance. Management tries to push every last ounce out of you and the roles are draining/boring. Typical hours are 10 hours a day with the odd weekend of work required. Month end/quarter ends require weekend work and typically ~12 hours a day. Many reviews for data consumers with not enough actions coming out of reviews."
good,"A typical day at work is always challenging. As time has passed, I've become knowledgeable with different platforms. "
good,Reviewed all the Open account receivable for companies assigned to me. Resolve any issues that may come up like no po's on invoices reconciling inventory and or payment issues.
good,"Average team. Few great people rest below average."
good,"One can join IBM if they want to be a dead animal, No future at all."
good,"Learning company, Not paymaster."
good,IBM is going through massive restructuring and investing in AI technology.  Co-workers were very supportive and helpful.  Infact I have had many mentors while at IBM which have shaped my career development for the better.
good,"There should be some transparency in recognition. Also, the appraisal process should be based on the individual's work and not based on other stuffs."
good,"É uma otima empresa, porem no departamento em que trabalhei não tive muita oportunidade para crescer, era muito instavel.. Tudo muito controlado e sem muita liberdade.. Porem os beneficios como vale refeição, alimentação, convenio medico e transporte valem a pena."
good,"IBM India is indeed a very good organization to build one's career; I joined in as a lateral and was allocated to a challenging project, wherein I got to learn a lot and was able to balance between work and personal life."
good,"A typical work."
good,"Empresa competitiva, tanto externamente (mercado) quanto internamente. Por se tratar de pólitica americana existe resultado mas em paralelo muitos controles e processos que levam a morizade das respostas que em determinados momentos precisam ser imediatas ou mais rápidas."
good,"IBM company was nice company who can give you i direct training for serious subjects like Windows , UNix ...."
good,"A IBM oferece salários baixos, principalmente aqueles que começaram na empresa como estagiários."
good,"Smart, hard-working people, but the organization is too large to move and keep up with competitors in the industry. Unable to reward and keep good talent due to shareholder quarterly priorities"
good,Poor management communications. I only had one competent manager in a span of sixteen years with the company. The majority of my co-workers were very skilled and easy to work with.
good,"I was supervised virtually.  No on-site management.  The job was fairly simple,  people would call in with problems, we had a script and data base to help resolve the problems."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the work itself and the people that you work with. Work days and weeks can be very long but it can still be very rewarding to team with people on projects and deliver a good price and solid project,"
good,"Totally project dependent, work life balance, but again depends on the adhocs and the projects you are in, work from home option available , looks good, but no increments"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,I assisted with the legal work related to the acquisition of Explorys and the transition of the company to an IBM company.
good,"If you want to work in technology, IBM is a great place to learn. There is absolutely no shortage of technical expertise. You can learn anything that you might want to learn, and there is almost limitless possibility for mentoring. That said, the workload is crazy and there is a constant threat of layoffs (IBM calls them resource actions). It's difficult to get into new roles because most many other people are scrambling for safe harbor as accounts fail to renew and work moves offshore."
good,"Company utilizing contractors for all departments, no room for growth as an FTE. Typical call center atmosphere, must have right personality to deal with call center politics."
good,Job was an average call desk. Management pressured you to be off calls and on another in less than 5 min some issues would take 30 min or longer. If that was the case they would push you to end the issue and get back on another call.
good,Big Blue is a huge company and you feel like another cog in the machine.  You end up working on a tiny piece of a project and there are limited opportunities to move up.
good,Older employee culture was often challenging to work within. Many uncaring and lazy employees engaging in way too much socializing. This company would be MUCH more productive if management were more attentive to general company goals and spent less time forming committees and team meetings to endlessly discuss what needs to be accomplished and dragging out department duties needlessly. Startling waste of time and money for such a seemingly successful corporation. Astounding!
good,"it was an inbound process, with no proper management, though i learned to manage my KRAs in a given time. No scope of taking up responsibilities due to the hectic work schedule."
good,"Utilization is most important, 93% or greater, emphasis is on the individual to find project to work on, must give back to the company its expected, long work hours, minimal rewards and no raises, employees are nickeled and dimed on benefits, taxes and services, too many layers of management,  great place for a college grade to get 2-3 experience than move on, not a long term  place to work."
good,Very structured and up to 2012 - 2015 orientated around quality and value add.  The outsourcing to India destroyed the culture and maturity of Service.
good,Management issues - too much focus on costs vs getting the job done properly for clients.  Overall flexibility is good relative to working from home - very positive there.  People are generally very good to work with.
good,"Great company, but our department could have been better in terms of compensation, work timings. Your career progression depends on the projects that you get."
good,"One day day i got one request that i have need to add one disk to one sevrer, when i checked it was empty, but when i tried to add on sevrer it was showing there is some data is there on disk, but it was fresh disk .  Later i checked on disk few LV's were there and those were from other VG,,, It was mistake from SAN/VIOS end that when they allocate the LUN to server it should be clean."
good,IBM is truly a behemoth and working there is an education into what goes into the making and running of a giant.
good,"IBM India is a huge organisation and to be considered for promotion, one has to be really proactive in terms of not only delivering quality work but also nurturing meaningful associations within the company."
good,"stay away from STG. Go for software group."
good,If you want to settle in one place this is the place to be. This is a huge company and you will be invisible.
good,"Though it is an MNC but run like govt. office."
good,New challenges and new roles and good experience in work locality
good,"Bad:"
good,IBM looks to the bottom line. They have great processes and procedures to drive revenue.  They create utilization targets and are fully invested in global resourcing.
good,Not happy at all there is no opportunity for advancement all they worry about is reducing cost by giving pay cuts and asking employees to do more which is a bunch of BS
good,"Looking for career growth, but here no scope hence trying for some other opportunities."
good,"I worked very hard with very little reward financially or verbally."
good,"IBM is a huge company and is involved with many segments of IT and technology.  Much can be learned from moving around an organization like this."
good,Decent benefits but there are caps on salary increases that can't be circumvented.  Difficult to navigate internal systems.
good,"- learned to be more efficient, new technologies"
good,"A typical day is a usual help desk one. You log in, check the queues you are responsible for, check email and get started. In this area, staff is so thin that most folks work through lunch to ensure SLA's are met and just to keep your numbers on par with most others. Learning is done piece-meal and often, due to zero dollar budget, informal and self-driven at best. Coworkers are all dedicated and for the most part, work as a team. First line management can be inconsistent at best. Most are doing what they can but are just as micro-managed by second line and exec's to the point that any changes and improvements are marginalized. The hardest part of the job is knowing that no matter how hard you work, you are still on the line to lose your job the next day. Best part of the day is when you leave. Bottom line is that if you join IBM, do not join IBM in the support arena. Get into sales, distribution, development, etc and have at least a bachelors degree."
good,You can learn lot of things but pay hike in 5 years was not up to mark but work was huge say 20hrs in a day
good,Nice place to work nothing much happening here to share with
good,Great company to work for I really enjoyed working there and the experience I have accumulated
good,I am a customer service representative being a customer representative my job is to call the banks to follow up for the individual saving account of our clients. I learned that i should have a lot of patience especially dealing to the other customer representative because sometimes some of the customer representative cannot communicate well. most of my duty hours are evening shift i enjoy working in a call center especially the environment are good the people are enthusiastic.
good,Tipico ambiente de empresa multinacional. El horario full time no me permitió en el ultimo tiempo dedicarme al cuidado de mi madre enferma por eso me fui.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   .
good,"It was good working with IBM. "
good,"It was wonderfull felling to work with IBM.The atmosphere is very good.its a funloving place to work.I have learn lots of thing in that company like how to behave with user,how to talk etc"
good,Its good working in IBM if u have a rotational shift. Fixed night shift is not survivable.
good,"If someone choose to work for German Process in IBM, he can earn good amount of salary. But one must give up all his routine life to work only. Very less chances of growth."
good,"Ingresé a la empresa en el 2006 durante los primeros años dí mucho y me dió mucho. mucho aprendizaje, desafíos, situaciones nuevas, contacto con nuevas tecnologías, educación y sueldo y premios acordes a los logros."
good,IBM very good company but more paper work for payroll department. Long hours of work.
good,IBM is a good company to work for. I like the team work with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job is job security.  Most enjoyable is learning new technologies.
good,"O estágio fugia um pouco das características propostas dado a necessidade de executar processos rotineiros. "
good,"Working with IBM has been a great opportunity. Got to work on lot of new technologies viz jsp, servlets, oracle, websphere server, JNDI, Web Services, JMS, VXML. "
good,The only upside was being able to work from home. they extended my contract 3 times though.
good,"IBM over all was a goof employer, the branch of IBM Seterus of which i worked for was very productive phone based company."
good,The work is very good to learn I had learn many things. Here we need HR team.
good,Set up and run production in multiple departments. The company was always in flux.....buy out fears and layoffs were constant.
good,"typicaly it is work work and more work for very little appreciation or compensation, the only reason I have stayed so long was i thought I woul get more money , but good luck there"
good,fix machines in the morning which had problems from previous night and do maintenance on machine when that was done. Co-workers were very good to work with. Very little management involvement.
good,"Embora seja uma empresa que ensina muito com o dia a dia, e tem uma cultura exemplar tive pouca oportunidade de crescimento pois minha gerencia me contratou para desempenhar um específico trabalho, qual eu não tive tempo de vê-lo desenvolver."
good,You are under contract and raises are minimal and the benefits are null
good,"I worked for IMB and comprise for a short period of time, there is not really much to tell within the short time frame, except for IMB there is no job security."
good,"Not a good environment. Hostile, uncooperative and is not team orientated"
good,"I work for a local account whre IBM is a 'Preferred partner' The culture is hectic, totally ignoring work/life balance. Personal workspace is barely existent, resembling a 'Call center' setup for highly skilled Technical IT experts and PM's. Reporting and processes are messy and inherently conflicting. The management style is bossy, pushy and meeting setting, including before and after hours and during the lunch time."
good,They strip more and more benefits that distinguished them from the competition.
good,"Was a great company of innovation.  However, during recent times, it's lost its way in and fell behind in cloud computing and personal laptops, serves.  This has reflected in the way the company treats and compensates it's employees."
good,"Un día normal es muy relajado, solo las dos ultimas semanas de cada mes son las complicadas, es un buen lugar para obtener experiencia laboral."
good,"Read email, crossed over wth previous shift. Every day was different. New challenges/situations every day. Worked with people from all over the world. Management varied from very good to very poor.  Was hard to deal with large company bureaucracy. Can't say enough about the hard working, good group of people I worked with."
good,"Don't Expect Hikes !"
good,IBM is has moved away from being concerned about employee satisfaction and morale. Poor benefits and no bonuses are given unless you are on the sales side or an Executive. There is a lack of leadership in many of the management roles.
good,Proceesing of payments and their Investigation. Directly connect to branch for and discrepancies. Further investigation required if payment doesn't go through.
good,It is okay to workl in this company management are good for nothing. Means they expect alot from you but at the time of promotion and appraisal they back out.
good,Good place to learn new skills and explore accordingly. Relaxed workplace and Work/life balance can be maintained. Multiple growth options are available within IBM.
good,"I possess 24+ years of experience in providing Information Technology solutions across various industries with expertise in process automation, data analytics, data migration and custom software development."
good,"IBM in my role allows me to work mostly on my own with some direction. I usually handle emails first thing and get many requests for various reports. I monitor systems and look for areas of improvement and enhancement. I like being able to work on several projects at one time over various disciplines and capacities. I have worked on both Mainframe and open systems. I administer 4 open systems servers as well as help maintain 80+ LPARs on 13+ Mainframe machines. The management seem to be open to discussion and lead the way at a higher level and allow team leads to push their teams. The hardest part of the job is staying ahead of the game. It can be easy to find ourselves in a fire fight with various issues, while still having to meet deliverable dates and handle to incoming requests."
good,"Hire low level talent and gets rid of older workers. They constantly where have what is called ""Resource Action"" these workers are let go. Job Security was always questioned."
good,"I would rather keep my experience to myself. I had a good when first starting there,but in the end the company has gone downhill. They wanted you to learn all areas but weren't willing to pay for each area you were certified in."
good,Es una buena empresa pero los jefes intermedios ten hunden y no te dejan promocionar. Por lo demas buena empresa
good,"very demanding hours, little concern of family time, it's all about the money not customer needs or concerns, company will out source the service division in the near future."
good,"It was a good place to practice my tech skills and learn some new ones."
good,"Overall :"
good,Great place years ago but has lost its way in recent times....the work life balance mentality that is something they were so supportive of has been replaced with 'micro-management' approach and job insecurity.
good,"On a typical day, an assistant would be required to ensure the diary for their respective client is up to date and that meetings have been confirmed with room bookings or even catering if required."
good,"IBM has taken leadership in Cloud, Cognitive Applications, Cybersecurity and almost any other hot technology and failed to secure their leadership role which has been the fundamental cause of the declining revenue and the waves of workforce reductions and off-shoring."
good,"Perpetual downsizing, dismal senior management and pervasive group think that borders on brainwashing; inculcated through early career entrants turned life timers. I would definitely not recommend to anyone"
good,No job security. Management got no idea what to do. Every year new re-org. IBM down fall started. Try to avoid work for IBM if you can otherwise you...
good,"En IBM Argentina, estuve en un proyecto con la petrolera ""YPF"" y fué de los peores trabajos en los que estuve. Tanto con el salario, el ambiente y metodologías de IBM hacia los empleados. Un desastre."
good,Not a place to work if you are serious about your career. Routine layoffs will affect morale. Pay is not bad but definitely not the best in the industry.
good,"The company lays off older workers, so get out before 40 and you'll be fine. Also the remote worker is no longer, so the low pay just got lower with you commute."
good,"If you can get hired by IBM then you could likely get hired by Amazon or some other big tech company. Why bother with IBM at that point?"
good,"I was on the Help Desk, giving 24/7 technical support in German and English. "
good,"Cultura laboral "
good,"While IBM is a global brand with a great deal of opportunity inside the company, much of the organization is plagued by layers and layers of administration and rigidity. I'm happy to have worked there, but I was ready to leave when I did."
good,"I was an IBM BA in the late 90's. The culture was great and the people were great. The only downside was the travel requirement for that role. Once we had kids, it was no longer viable."
good,"I was contracted to IBM from original company. Half of IT were hired full time and other half as contractors. The push is on money not quality. Estimates for projects are generally below what is needed to keep costs down. This results in unpaid overtime to meet estimates. No matter how good you are, well-liked by clients (who even send emails to managers) and co-workers, if budgets are cut contractors are let go first (furloughed). As a contractor you are not given any opportunities to learn newer tech/processes. What you're hired to do is it - nothing more."
good,"IBM has been through a lot over the decades.  I was there at a very exciting time, but they managed to make it uninspiring and unprofitable."
good,"As the company works to reduce costs by laying off older employees, additional undocumented pressures are being put on remaining employees to do the tasks of the missing workers.  New employees are not properly trained as the experience did not get passed on and tools/applications that are broken are not fixed or upgraded to be more efficient due to cost constraints."
good,"I originally worked for Kenexa, which was acquired by IBM."
good,"no communication with service desk agents and associates"
good,"En pocas palabras, IBM Peru no ofrece una oportunidad para crecer profesionalmente, a pesar de un considerable esfuerzo para destacar."
good,"IBM sucks. More like service company of IT. Their pay sucks, no work/life balance, well I guess it depends on your department. Management sucks, they need to pay attention to workers."
good,A good company to have on your resume but be prepared to be outsourced.  The job security is definitely not there as management is always looking to outsource your job.
good,"No care or concern for its own employees well being,all customer focused."
good,"Unsupported Managers- They expect to wish them like a slave and ratings will be given based on that but not on the work/service that you deliver."
good,"A day at work depends on quantity production required. Learning the builds of product assembly, according to blueprints and making initiatives in certain measures, with minimal damages occurrences. Working among knowledgeable colleagues and Team Lead made the job slightly interesting as for team work. Completion of orders at the end of the day, surely made a calm feeling in one self."
good,"IBM has some wonderful people but it's policies get in the way.  Working here can be a beat down and a challenge no matter your tenure.  It's very difficult to come in to this company, most have been here 20+ years so don't see the challenges."
good,"Look elsewhere, better options are to be found, you're just a number to them, a piece of material to be used up and discarded."
good,"Near the end of my career at IBM, most of my work was independent as customers needed assistance with various DB2 issues.  Health checks, security, DR testing, performance monitoring and performance management.  I was also involved with upgrades of DB2 versions for customers.  I was involved at 100% travel usually leaving my home on Sunday afternoons and returning home on Thursday evenings working remotely on Fridays.  Although I had above average employee evaluations, I did not have a consistent contract I was working on, therefore I was involved in the July 2013 resource action."
good,"Overall, the other employees were the best part of working at IBM. They made it quite tolerable. Management didn't follow through with promises, we were paid very low because we start out as contractors."
good,The job is very stress. Not enough workers to handle the work load. Management does not care about it employees. To much work to handle every day and week. No raises. Too much overtime
good,"Things were OK with IBM before the idea of col-location was introduced, which required all remote staff to now report to an office, which in many cases that meant relocation after years of working remotely."
good,"IBM used to be a great company to work for.  Now there"
good,No work life balance - suitable only for younger people. Good pension and benefits. Could be required to work anywhere in the country and even abroad.
good,"It's a nice temporary position but the hours/shifts are not easy to get used to, and once your get comfortable with the client (account), they have a tendency to move people to other support desks."
good,"It can be a dbl edged sword when working here. One they expect so much from a person, without giving them any help or coaching. There is a drive to be better and plans in place to do so, but again, no coaching or mgmt support when in need of help."
good,The management structure is terrible. Who knows where you will end up when you get placed regardless of your skill set. Some projects are well managed while others are anarchy.
good,"Favoritism is strong here. A lot of brown-nosing. Management is just looking to advance themselves so there's not much room for advancement especially for entry-level. The benefits are great, though."
good,"Except IBM Research Lab, other parts of IBM are ok they are not just as the name of IBM. No Equal opportunity and you have to fight for it even though you are deserving candidate"
good,Changes made when the BPO department was sold to Concentrix and many changes has been made which was not favorable to the employees. I decided to leave as it was no longer a healthy environmen
good,You were only a number of hours billed to a client at IBM. You had to find your own projects to work on even though there was supposed to be a career counselor to aid in this process.
good,"La empresa podría ser mejor pero en mi experiencia es muy difícil subir de banda, llevar una vida personal saludable a la par con el trabajo, no hay home office al menos en mi proyecto y un constante micromanagement por parte de la gerente."
good,"Good workplace the time I was there.  I liked what I was doing, inspecting rack and testing the Hard Drives.  Everyone work well with each other and also the managers."
good,Had plenty of opportunities at IBM but they went through a massive restructuring and I was let go. The company has a lot to figure out before they can excel in services.
good,"Many great people, products and services but other than Watson and Cloud so slow to evolve is why they have been overshadowed by the Amazons, Googles and Microsoft's of the ERA.  Internal processes and old guard people are a huge deterrent to accomplishing and changing anything.  They are milking the legacy systems to gain traction elsewhere but need a fresh set of eyes and leadership rather than look within all of the time."
good,This is where I started my career. It was a good company until it was bought by IBM. We had a great time learning as I was posted in a non-IT company. Good experience overall
good,"the idea behind the company and the over 100 years of operation make this an exciting place to potentially work for. with that being said, not receiving adequate pay increase, bonus, or recognition, and the lack of lateral or vertical movement within the company makes it for lack of a better term a ""Dead End""."
good,Very fragmented and unstable management  structure.  Continuous  attempts to re-organize and restructure.  Easy to get either overworked or marginalized.
good,IBM was an interesting job to have as a new college graduate hire.  Every qtr we underwent layoffs. It was very intimidating to see but also allowed me to understand the nature of corporate america.
good,The constant cost pressures are driving morale down and create an environment where a lot of jobs are being offshored to lower payed workers that are not able to keep up the quality of work.  The remaining senior employees are left picking up the pieces so that the customers do not notice.   This was in Global Services division.
good,management is the most dysfunctional I've come across in years. They pay $18 an hour for JD holders and workload is immense especially during H1-B deadlines. Parking is free but that's it!
good,Work was interesting but felt as if I was just lost in the sear number of employees.  Never had much in job satisfaction as it seemed you were just over-shadowed by 1000's of other employees.
good,"IBM is experiencing a major shift in it's business as the CEO moves the company from a product focus to ""aaS"" in all things it offers."
good,"Only work, there will be no enjoyment , 24/7 shift ."
good,Lots of politics. Find a good boss and follow him/her. Compensation is fair for consulting. Projects are hit or miss. Great young people. Management needs reorganizing.
good,IBM is typical of all large corporations.  Bottom line is king. Employees are viewed as replaceable parts. Management was detached from employees. In my division I was supervised remotely. Local Management was insane.
good,"IBM is a very large and silo-ed organization. This makes it difficult to learn all the players. This is made more challenging if you are working with Sales, as the sales leaders change every 9 - 12 months."
good,"Very underpaid the for role"
good,"Empresa deixa muito a desejar muitos gerentes não merecem o cargo ali dentro."
good,If you are in the GBS organization you must be prepared to travel weekly. If you are assigned to a project & am not willing to travel then IBM will release you. Over 95% of all projects require weekly travel. At IBM you are basically on your own.
good,Was a really easy place to work. Management was not that great. Pay is also not that great. Never received an offer beyond my contract or else would have worked there for more years.
good,"Working as a regular employee, its all about the unskilled managers position and standing. They take all the ideas and improvement i have suggested and use it to advance their carries and take all the credit as their own. No recognition for my knowledge and process improvements."
good,"Performance is not a measure of success at IBM.  Top performers are routinely ""resourced"".  Constantly wondering when you will be in the wrong cell of the wrong spreadsheet at the wrong time."
good,There was a lot of unfortunate history between many of the teams at IBM leading a deep distrust.  This made the work environment hostile and difficult to navigate on a daily basis
good,"Difficult to get ahead due to favoritism by managers. Everyone looking to ensure they fall in managements good graces. Building your reputation is difficult, but achievable. Sad truth is that once you get older they look to replace you with younger people or stop giving you raises even though they are earned. Almost a resentment that you received prior raises for good work."
good,"Good exposure if the get a chance to work with international bpo its a good place to work."
good,Very quiet. Little interaction with other people. Slow paced. Great lunch in the campus cafeteria. Ability to take breaks and take nice walks to keep your blood circulating and decrease fatigue.
good,Poor management. The atmosphere was stressful. Did not promote a lot of employees. Long hours with mandatory overtime. Would not go back to this company.
good,"OK for a short time, no salary rises though and no reviews either. Fun colleagues but disinterested management.  hardest part of job was weekend work."
good,"Good place to learn and implement the technology single handle."
good,"IBM has a habit of devouring successful agile companies and then drag them down to the pace of a giant conglomerate.  They also don't increase pay over time.  Once you're in, your locked."
good,"Company runs on manager's politics. This should say it all, over the years IBM has gone downwards on graph as the skilled employees leave the company due too all levels of politics."
good,"Good in support for learning phase."
good,"It is complete dependent on Managers only, there is no opportunities to share our ideas. very frequently management changing and there is no scope to innovation"
good,"Rooted in history and glory, the current IBM is looking to find its way back to the good old days. The company overall is outstanding - great compensation, learning available and encouraged, and everyone is focused. Big negative (as with any company) is that one bad manager can spoil a career. I will just leave it at that. Another negative is if you haven't been there for 20 years, moving the needle is almost impossible. You're a number. That's it. Contribute to the bottom line or die. Takes some time to navigate the vast resources and size of the company. The name IBM gets you places no other company can, but it doesn't keep you in the door if your offering isn't competitive."
good,"The atmosphere at IBM is very tentative. You basically never know where you stand and whether the company is committed to your role. You meet some very nice folks, and do some very good things for customers, but, in the end, there is no commitment to making sure you are able to support your customers well and that you have a clear path to advancement. Very political."
good,"IBM is a fast paced work environment for oil and gas closings"
good,IBM is undergoing a transformation in the way they do business. They are investing big in new technologies to stay competitive in the marketplace. Work is fast paced and competitive.
good,If you do not care of the work culture and just need a job and if you are so lucky that they select you in the interview please never join the organization.
good,"Was a great company to work for in the past.  Amazing colleagues.  However it is in decline and employee morale is brutally low.  They have finally figured out where the industry is going, but have been slow to adapt."
good,"Good work/life balance, Learned to deal with clients. Workplace culture is fun and satisfying colleagues help to a great extent at initial level for GH."
good,Fast paced. Management not focused on employee development. Smart peer employees.  Lotsa travel. great exposure to ibm technology.  large company.  bnefits ok.
good,Not a bad place to work but not a good place for fresher. As fresher they do not put you in challenging environment and you will get proper work for your career growth in project.
good,"Uma empresa onde tive um grande crescimento tanto pessoal quanto profissional. Uma multinacional, onde temos contato direto com pessoas de outras culturas."
good,IBM has been an excellent company in terms of flexibility and benefits its offers to its employees.It's a vast ocean of ooportunities where people can explore multiple skills within the organization.
good,"IBM used to be a great place to work; however, it's clear that senior management is more focused on lining their own pockets than in keeping top notch talent. When we miss our revenue targets, the solution is always to cut at the bottom; never at the top."
good,"Lot of Clerical Work, Odd Hours no Work Life Balance. Agile used for branding purpose, only showcase, no recognition for performers, a Manager Driven Company with no Employee Friendly Policies."
good,"Total experience is average. The work culture is very good but management is very slow. I am not happy with my current role."
good,"IBM was a great place to work in the 80s and 90s.  However as competition in the industry grew, the management at IBM floundered.  The result was massive layoffs creating an atmosphere of asking too much of the remaining employees."
good,"A IBM é uma empresa grande que ajuda muito, mas vive sérios problemas de financiamento do seus times."
good,"IBM has lost it's direction.   They are attempting to transform the company at a cost to it's existing customers and employees.  As the company moves in the direction of the cloud, many more senior employees are let go instead of being retrained."
good,"•	Analyze and adjust financial statement accounts for company reporting requirements "
good,"IBM was a good company in the '80-'90s but has fallen on hard times and is trying to transform itself "
good,"A great and talented team with a good work culture.  There's a facade of cool features, like ping pong and a bar, but no real time to enjoy them.  And there is no clear management plan for growth and success.  Continued expectations for greater success, but cutting resources.  Requiring remaining staff to work longer, and faster."
good,"IBM always shuffled management around;  SVL and ARC IP law departments merged and a woman supervisor brought disturbance to the department, while the IP Law Counsel relaxed and let the woman run the show with her favorites. 2009 there came the layoff and they cut half the department."
good,The summary says it all. Its cut throat and you worry constantly worry if you will be indiscriminately caught up in the next round of layoffs. That was stressful enough to make me leave.
good,"My role at IBM was that of an IT infrastructure Analyst and Architect. My management experience and technical skills made this a very satisfying role. "
good,"Can be great in the right position/department, but that wasn't my experience."
good,"work hard is the rule for this company."
good,"It's a great place to start out if you don't have other options. Mid-career, it can be extremely challenging to advance, or even to get your job done. Layoffs happen more than once a year. When they do and the layoffs find their way into the press, the company says they're hiring, but they're not - at least for your position. "
good,Company is better it good that they will send us for training it spends more on training it help people to enhances there skill and improve there knowledge
good,Its been a very frustrated experience. Management are non-cooperative in all respect. They treat employee as an school kid. They don't provide such environment were employee can work hapily.
good,The company over the past decade has been trying to reinvent itself but has not been able to turn a profit in 5 years plus.  Lack of progress in turning company around has made it a stressful place to work.
good,Negative work culture and difficultly communicating with upper management. They are constantly doing lay-offs which creates a bad work environment. Almost all employees are now remote.
good,"The strange company strategy to keep stakeholder benefit but ignore the customer/business real requirements/benefit is the explanation that has put the giant company sinking like a ship."
good,IBM has changed its focus and this has impacted every aspect of it's business.  The IBM I worked for 35 years ago was a much better company to work for than the IBM we have today.
good,"Pros"
good,"Workplace envelopment is ok. High percentage of contract workers."
good,"Innovative and value driven organization where new ideas are always welcome, along with employee benefits are important for salary remuneration is very low, that leads to employee unhappiness."
good,"I have had good experience at IBM.  worked there for 15 years, during the good times"
good,"IBM is a very great place to work , here we can learn whatever we want because of its diversity of technology used. The tools which we are using at IBM its very productive and informative"
good,"Monitoração e Configuração de roteadores e switches CISCO;"
good,"The name is what attracts and the experience that counts."
good,"Joined IBM to sell their analytics portfolio - selling a solution with a 3 to 6 month sales cycle.  In under a year and a half, I was assigned 4 different sales territories and had 3 different sales managers. "
good,The company should consider the customer's first in the decision they make during their transformation. They should have their own due diligence and not trust the middle managers decision.
good,"I worked remote for over a decade, working long hours and strange hours, managing world wide teams.   I loved it.   Times are changing.    Most US employees are being asked to move to centralized locations in 6 cities in the US.   Location is more important than skill set or experience.  Great talent is being lost.. but it is an opportunity for others.   I see both sides.. it is just a different company than it was."
good,"Excellent opportunity to learn leading edge technology, however, management direction is unclear, while independent work is promoted, usually left alone to figure corporate issues."
good,"More work - Less pay"
good,Some management did not care about employees personal growth while others did.  It could take up to 5 years to be able to apply within the company no matter how well of an employee someone is.
good,"Big company, long days and unrealistic deadlines.  Some of the most intelligent and creative people I have ever met.  Good luck!"
good,"i have good experience in a client location work, grate fun working the new friends, friendly team members and stick team leader and company environment is good"
good,"IBM has been sending workers jobs offshore for decades.  Who in the C-suite has had their jobs sent overseas?  There are plenty of smart double PHD's in India who would be willing to run the company for a fraction of what management in the US command.  So when will the outsourcing run its course?  Don't hold your breath because the current crop of corporate pirates haven't finished selling off everything it can.  Reducing pay and driving performance with fear has helped upper management keep their bonuses at the expense of selling off their core remanufacturing business, as morale craters. It's a world of Cloud Computing and Big Data after all, so how many years will it take before all the PHD power of India can do anything IBM can do - better? For less."
good,Company has had 18 declining quarters and is laying off people especially in z under the radar screen.  Employees are stressed out not knowing if they will be part of the next round of layoffs.
good,"Real simple, no loyalty but expect employ to have some.....Would not recommend to anybody to work there.  Still have lots of friends working there but all looking for move on before the company breaks them.  Co-workers are great to work with but upper management have no more control or minimum control on business direction.  Everything moved globally which local business is suffering.  And when they say work life balance, just take a look at what they say first... 'work'."
good,"Overall experience of the company is Good ,work environment is good ."
good,"- Work starts at 9am till 2am the following day. "
good,"Its good to work here, but lagging of management. "
good,"IBM has changed over the years.  Use to be a pro-employee place to work, but now they seek ways to reduce benefits while putting the cost of operations (work from home without compensation for internet access) on the employees.  Over 17 years experienced lay of after lay off as IBM chased cheaper markets from which they could develop product."
good,Everyday is a busy day with new situation to deal with. A good manager that always motivates us to be better. Co-workers are of different type of people. The biggest challenge was dealing with the extra long working hours and seniors who are not helpful. The best experience will be learning in how the real work world is.
good,"Learning new concepts in Financial Planning, Forecasting, Roadmap, Signings & Backlog, SOX Compliance Audits"
good,"Not sure what to rate since IBM is in it's ""reorganization"" phase from 2015 Roadkill. Company still trying to be like Amazon or Google with Software as a Service. My only recommendation is to look for positions in their emerging models and direction."
good,"IBM was a great organization to work for as I have learned a great deal over the 19 years I've worked there.  It provided me with both job challenges and rewards until changes within upper management and their strategic goals and direction.  Their strategic goals/direction resulted in organizational restructuring; hence layoffs spanning over a few years."
good,"My work experience is not bad either not good."
good,"Is a big company where We can learn and learn. All the experts inspire me."
good,"Professionally I am competitive, aggressive, decisive and results orientated. After reviewing all possible angles, I move fast, take risks and get things done now. I love change and challenges. "
good,"There are so many products and divisions, you have a fair bit of opportunity to try out different things. There are a lot of wonderful and talented people, but they're overworked and, frankly, exploited."
good,"It used to be a great place to work before moving work overseas."
good,"IBM is a  high stress, fast moving company concerned about, generating revenue, taking care of their customers and leading the industry in innovation. The average work week in my department is 50 to 60 hours, at all times of the night, day and through the weekend we strive to ensure that we deliver for our customers. Product support has primarily been off shored to less expensive markets producing skills gabs, communication problems and a service/support break downs. I enjoy the day to day interactions with customers, always being on the move, learning something new and always doing something new/different."
good,"My particular work location at IBM is a ""new"" style of center. By ""new"", I mean, we don't get paid anywhere near as much as standard consultants within our same company, but are required to complete a comparable amount of work with the same quality. Co-workers are great, we learn a lot from each other. Management is fairly out of touch, since they are mostly concerned with numbers(utilization/billing rates)."
good,"After the Graduation this is my first job. Work as associate at processing level. here i learn Corporate culture, mail response and tracking. my Co-worker's are amazing. Understanding the Job responsibilities. Fun activities."
good,"Nos hay buenas relaciones interpersonal, es muy dificil la comunicación con los jefes y recursos humanos"
good,"Buen ambiente con los compañeros, con muchas facilidades para crecer como profesional"
good,"Uma empresa boa para trabalhar, porém difícil acesso à plano de carreira."
good,It is a domestic call center which is good for the tele-callers and marketing executives. It has been learning center for the freshers.
good,"IBM was a fun work place with great co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with my co-workers.  When I first started there were many opportunities to advance and learn thru onsite or online classes. Now sadly this is not the case. Upper management is not concerned with employee growth, well being or happiness anymore."
good,"I was a senior tech for one of the many support groups that IBM had and was one of the most Senior and highest ranked employees on the team. My numbers and quality of work was high and rising, in fact."
good,"No room for any advancement, to many reducing in pay over the years, extreme layoffs/outsourcing.  Management bearly agrees to employee needs or concerns."
good,"i spend 48 hours continuously in the office ."
good,The company is so big it is not fair to rate it as a whole. Your experience will depend on who your manager is and what division you work in.
good,"The company is attempting to reinvent itself. Secure job but a lot of bureaucracy to deal with and outdated management styles. Overall smart people, and like anything it is what you make of it."
good,"The people I worked with were exceptional, it will be very difficult to find a place with so much friendly talent. "
good,"Very complex company, as a Telecom Engineer they did get the overall picture of telephony programming for the customer. Very disappointed in the way they let our group of 3 go. Handling 160 locations for Citibank in North America. Hope the customer is getting there service levels met."
good,"Liaise with Customer and Service Manger: Work closely with Service Managers and customers to ensure effective prioritization of Problem Records"
good,"It was my first BPO company wherein I was selected for Bell canada project tech support."
good,I had worked in this company for almost 5 years. The work pressure is way too much and their PC rating is the worst thing.Lots of favouritism happens during promotion and annual rating.
good,typical work place to work. There are much better things to do but organization management need to be more focused and invest in skill development of the work force. In technical world workers are the tools and if they are not properly utilized company can not thrive just squeezing them.  A good company perform just because the management did not take right decision at right time.
good,"Hoge druk, weinig empathisch. ..........................................................................................................................................."
good,"Great immediate work group.  Everyone worked very well together and shared information.  Unfortunately, we all lost our jobs to offshore resources."
good,I had met some wonderful technical people at IBM during my early days but the quality is not the same as it was years ago. Management should focus more on long term and less on different way of cost cutting.
good,Everyday was different with a variety of issues to troubleshoot. Learned to always stay patient & do your best because there is always a new challenge to complete a work project. Management is very supportive most of the time. I worked with really intelligent people and felt it was a privilege. I have gained many good relationships. The hardest part of the job was completing a project with issues out of your control for example the wrong part was shipped when ordered. The best part of the job is always learning. If your willing to learn and have the right peers there is always an opportunity for growth.
good,i ready hard work my   in my previous company good environment to work and learn i learn lots of new things in my previous companies .
good,"IBM made sure to give us the hours needed to put food on my families table and take care of needs like bills and such. I had an easy time getting back and forth to my job, being within walking distance."
good,The pay is very very low for the hours some are required to work. There are many different types of financial analysts. Some have about 12 busy days of work per month and others are required to work 60 hours per week with the same pay. More vacation days than the average company but you will not be able to use most of them due to workload and of course they are not paid back to you at the end of the year.
good,Na IBM eu aprendi a trabalhar com profissionalismo e comprometimento.
good,"A typical day at work is managing my team, approving their reconciliation reports before paying taxes, responding to client requests, attend management meeting, and deal with difficult client inquiries."
good,Good people to work with. Repetitive but something new was learnt. Most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with.  Made the environment more pleasurable to work in.
good,"I loved the job atmosphere but found it difficult to balance home and work life.Co-workers were friendly and helpful,but the job was too much stress for the amount of pay."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day comes from interaction with the customer and getting a laugh while performing the job well.  I had excellent coworkers as far as skills and personality that made for a pleasant work environment.  Management were rarely around and did not talk to my area unless there was an error that needed discussion.  The hardest part of the job was to perform the job to the best of my ability when IBM cut pay, cut bonuses, and  said that employee motivation comes from having a job."
good,"Working at IBM I got to meet with a lot of very intelligent people from across the globe and I loved how they thought and solved problems and saw how customer focused they were. I got to use, test, configure, manage and defect all sorts of equipment. Some were over 10 years old, others were still development stages. It was a great experience and it was everything anyone that studied IT ever dreamed about. It a really steep learning curve and you have to pick up every bit of knowledge fast or you will left behind. There was always so much to do."
good,"Good job work/life balance, good compensation, poor job security/advancement. Management is not in touch with employees. As a result of telecommuting, lack of job culture."
good,"Came to Dubuque at my expense to finish out my career. I felt I had reached the pinnacle being at IBM. The massive layoff that happened was quite a shock, as the CEO had just visited and stated everything was on course."
good,A Typical day at work was sitting in front of a pc answer calls my entire shift. I learned nothing new from this company from my call center experience I came in with. I enjoyed my co workers everyone was a team player.
good,"Lo que aprendí en IBM fue:"
good,"Aprendi muito sobre área de RH, pois fazia o pagamento dos funcionários, tirava nota, fazia pedidos, atendia o telefone e os clientes que iam até a empresa."
good,IBM is not the company it was and is not what I expected. There are issues with the IT management in their clietn relations.
good,"We learn a lot in this company. The growth is very slow, but learning and sharing expertise is always encouraged. The company is big and has wide spread of clients with different verticals and different industries supported as clients."
good,I remember only night shift in this organization and work was also good experience. i really believe that the place for freshers to get trained on the
good,"Interesting place with lots of career possibilities, but zero loyalty to you as a ""resource"".  Management quality has greatly declined in recent years as anyone with a heart has left or been forced out, replaced by cut at all costs to serve the stockholders interests only."
good,"fazendo avaliação de mudança fica dificil falar pois cada dia era uma coisa nova , em ireção a direção e gerencia tinhamos mais contato com a diretoria a mais dificil era convencer a diretoria que a mudança proposta muitas vezes iria atrapalhar na rotina de trabalho era ser parabenizado quando conseguiamos contonar um problema"
good,IBM has changed so much from flexible employee company to very complex . There is no hikes and bonus.No promotions.Co-workers are just OK. they do not help in any matters.
good,"This job was done on a freelance base and worked with different persons and fulfilled the requirement of the customers and get paid for the work done. "
good,"I started with IBM in 1996, with the intent of staying only five years. Now, it's 2015, and I've been with them close to 20 years. In that time, I've learned how to work in multiple industries, and can research, design, develop, and deliver blended learning to a variety of audiences. I have experience with classroom, online, self-paced, virtual, and mobile delivery of content."
good,"A typical day starts at 9am in the morning at hinjewadi location."
good,"entry level network analyst, low income. highlight will be the working experience."
good,Its a good company to work.Life can be balanced for a long time.
good,One of the major reasons for me to leave IBM was not getting promotions and no appreciations even after working overtime and late hours.
good,"5+ yrs in IBM India Pvt ltd working on multiple roles,. Started as DB2 DBA, and now currently as Cloud migration build specialist"
good,"1.  The work life balance is very good"
good,"El proceso para conseguir una promoción es complejo y cada año se cambia , quizá no sea con esa intención pero pareciera hacerlo complicado para que nadie pueda obtenerlo."
good,IBM is a great place to work.  Has very good working culture and working conditions.
good,Good place to work with good working conditions.  Working culture is very good.
good,Even though the work was very much monotonous and unproductive but it gave me first exposure to the corporate world.
good,"Very busy work place with 2000 employees located in littleton ma.  Alone. I cover for the receptionist when she is away from her area and give access to I b m ers who forget their badges or various visitors pass badgers who have meetings or job interviews.Making badges,giving access to vendors and watching the monitors all at the same time is the hardest part of the job.  It can be hectic at times if I b m has an all hands meeting trying to allow access to hundreds of I b m ers at the same time."
good,A empresa estimulava a produtividade dos funcionários e continha avaliações semestrais de desempenho e programas de coaching. Sem dúvidas a empresa é estruturada e estimula o team work entre as áreas e funcionários.
good,"As a field technician for a large corporation, there really wasn't a typical work day. "
good,"Attaining daily meeting"
good,"IBM has very strict policies about disclosing internal policies and procedures. Therefore at this time I am not at liberty to discuss much of what is being asked."
good,Big Blue has lost it's leading edge and innovation.  Leaders have unispired vision for the direction for the business.
good,Its a good organization for those who are inn learning stage
good,"Todo meu traba;ho é agradável, estou somente muito insatisfeita com o nível salarial...as promoções na empresa demoram demais para acontecerem."
good,"Company with a big logo. However the salary part is not very appreciable. Provides job security, but its not a place with very good growth unless you want to stick to the exact same salary for 2 years and then start all over again with a different domain."
good,"Had the opportunity to interact and learn from a vast and diverse races and background and cultures while providing security, safety and loss prevention in an international inviroment with one of the top fortune 500 companies."
good,Learnt about corporate environment and got chance improve communication skills
good,fun workplace co workers supported good at the work in our mangement
good,IBM is good to work but somewhere it's need some improvement. specially employee work life balance
good,"Everything is about the bottom line"
good,"Typical work day 10-12 hours.  Skelton team, most positions moving off shore. Culture/morale not what is used to be.  Most difficult part of my job was the Global aspect of it.  Conference calls at 6AM and 9 PM due to geographic layout.  Co-workers are the most enjoyable aspect of the job, however, there is no time to socialize with them."
good,"Poor transport"
good,"IBM's not what it used to be. Territories are changed quarterly, raises non-existent even when rated a top performer. Comp plans are confusing and all of the perks keep getting worse."
good,"IMHO,  The company has mismanaged its resources, by knee jerk reactions and poor foresight. "
good,"Inundated with emails throughout the day. I have learned to priorities certain aspects of my job role. I believe in teamwork therefore liaise with my colleagues throughout the day. Eg. Drafting of priorities on a draw board and executing those 1st. The hardest part of the job is reporting to 2 mangers. One in country and your direct up line, out of country. The most enjoyable part of my job role and client satisfaction, whereby you have assisted an employee and manager to the best of your ability and both parties walk out satisfied"
good,"Manual & Automation testing for OSS/BSS service flow, and Retail domain"
good,"IBM is a great company. Great benefits, some very good managers, good management style culture however somewhat bureaucratic and too much internal political propaganda. The technical work is very rewarding. Not too much training, self training is the best training however to support very expensive products some formal training will be helpful. Overall a decent place to get your career started in technology. Stay learning and be prepared to be laid off at any time. They could care less."
good,Looking for something new and challenging. Learned lots in my 15 years. I enjoy working with clients and events.
good,"Very manual accounting environment.  No intergrated accounting systems."
good,"As far as lifestyle and relative freedom to deal with life outside the company, IBM and CCI are very understanding, and in fact has been one of the best work environments I have ever had the pleasure of working at."
good,"Too much bureaucracy stifling any progress."
good,"Its okay. Not much scope for growth since its a huge MNC. "
good,"Despite being 102 years old, IBM challenges its staff to find new ways to stay on top of innovation.  With 40% of its staff working from home, my best teammates have often been those that I have never met.  To keep staff retention high, employees rotate into new positions requiring new skills keeping things as interesting as possible."
good,"IBM is in the midst of a downswing.  With IBM performing so poorly last year, pipeline inspections are becoming a daily occurrence."
good,"manager needs to be impressed else no good work!"
good,"not many co-workers, mostly just handling hardware under a company hired by IBM as a customer."
good,well i learn lots of things in IBM . I upgrade my skills and abilities in IBM . Now i want to enhance those skills and abilities which i learn in IBM .
good,"but i rather suggest it improves the work culture ."
good,"As I have been working with domestic account since i joined, i found the job too much demanding."
good,"After many years of traveling to and from work I was able to work from home, which was a great asset."
good,"IBM is a solid company that provides its people with tons of training and experience. Advancement and management structure, though, are sub-par. There is no path to success at IBM - you have to navigate through the constant corporate BS to get ahead, and, quite frankly, it's exhausting!"
good,As a practitoner in IBM as i enjoyed alot with colleuges and during work we used make fun with sincere in work but having fun but never make my work to go in loss.
good,"Old School thinkers, attempting to solve future problems with last century's management techniques."
good,"100 years old company with 1000s of tools.  Vast knowledge can be gained every minute but lack of time as the wings for learning is limited due to project work constraints."
good,"IBM is notorious for overmanaging and underpaying their workforce.  You will gain some decent experience if you demonstrate talent here, but nothing more."
good,"My job was involved looking at test results to support technology qualifications and reporting those results to the whole qualification team.  I used SAS to put together scripts to summarize test results.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the test data during multiple qualifications on multiple products. The best part of the job were the great people who work at IBM.  All are very professional."
good,"Best things were salary, ability to work from home.  Employees had constant fear of being laid off and the communication from managers was poor."
good,"The company has worked hard at remodeling itself to the new Global world but i felt that the Section i was working, not being part of their Core business, was having limited potential for growth in my area of expertise which was the Commercial section in the African continent"
good,"The role was cool, I learned a great deal.  Unfortunately, the team was dispersed and a lab was started in Ireland.  "
good,"Every day good, "
good,It is hard to see the business and individual growth in this company. The management seems out of touch about the employee's needs.
good,"There is proper balanced work, each one is tagged and assigned to a small group amongst the team. The fresher/new joinee gets to explore with each team and then left to choose his team, after some time when he is familier with the job, he can be reassigned to other to explore others job."
good,Not great if you are a middle aged woman and it was hard to get ahead.
good,Work/life balance isn't good. Lots of overtime and weekend work.
good,"Firma is niet bereid om loon naar werken te betalen. Verantwoordelijke, stressvolle baan, maar geen enkel uitzicht op doorgroeien of zelfontplooiing, ondanks dat dat wel de bedrijfspolicy zou zijn."
good,Learned a lot; co-workers are dedicated; global perspective
good,Work life balance and management is not up to the marks in service management.
good,i didn't face any typical day.
good,"Pude relacioname con personas valiosas, con las cuales comparti un ambiente agradable y una solidad plena."
good,monday is typical day to work
good,IBM is a good company despite the fact that when they acquire a company they don't keep it's employees.
good,"Excellent work environment, a good tech team but no benefit and salary cuts."
good,"Manager based company, Maximum manager are not good at all mainly in Chennai Location .  Employees are good, gives respect to contract employees.  Managers are not bother to provide better service to the clients"
good,En horario esta muy bien pero no me gusto el sueldo
good,Corporate strategy is incomprehensible. Employees don’t feel empowered or appreciated. Political maneuvering at the middle management level trumps innovation. First level management try hard and have good intentions but aren’t given what they need to motivate and reward employees.
good,"Beloning wat aan de lage kant, maar je kan je wel in veel richtingen ontwikkelen binnen IT of management. Project werk met veel projecten in Randstad of verder. Helaas daarom wel vaak van huis."
good,Managing Work life balance becomes easier in IBM comparatively depending on the area you are working on as IBM give work from home facility which employees can avail according to their Business unit rules.
good,"Good company with mean Managers"
good,"Progression and Growth is not well managed"
good,IBM bought the Data Backup cloud environment from Verizon where I already had a position as Tier 2 Data Backup Support Engineer. IBM assured we former Verizon employees we would be assimilated into IBM right up to the day everyone in my team was laid off.
good,Great compensation. If IBM fired 80% of the employees who have 20 years or more I believe immense growth will occur. Company is one huge Fraternity...
good,"IBM is a good company for Female Employees. Hike is less, WFH availability is there.If you have good understandings with your manager you are on the top else nothing happens on carrier."
good,I've learned that you must wotk in pairs and co-work with others regarding their believes. The management is very deficitary and no one supports you after a negative feedback..
good,IBM is technology leader and an intellectual storehouse that values Nobel prize more than business. Probably that is the reason behind them pioneering every technological advancement and yet getting beaten black & blue when it comes to market dominance.
good,The work culture is quite pathetic and harder. I used to even work on weekends on my managers tantrums. He used to butter me a lot for working on weekends while overtime compensation was quite good. I used to take 70 to 100 calls a day. It was one or two odd days when We got just 5 to 10 calls. Once in a bluemoon the management may appear very friendly to you..but it's only to get syou wo
good,Ambiente de trabajo bueno donde puedes aprender todos los días algo nuevo.
good,"Overall, I've really enjoyed my time with IBM, even though contractors aren't treated nearly as well as full-time and fully compensated IBMers. The people are smart, grounded and trust each other to do their best work. Great workplace culture, though it does come with some insecurity as things tend to go through a shake-up at least once a year. Working from home remotely has also been a great opportunity. Unfortunately, remote opportunities have been dwindling as more and more of the marketing teams are forced to relocate and work from offices in key cities."
good,"Constant reorganization and uncertainty about roles and responsibilities. Focused mostly on revenue, unfortunately management forgot about our customers. Very little opportunity for growth or promotion within the company, especially because of the constantly shrinking company."
good,"Managing various IT Infrastructure project related activities involving project planning, execution and management in tune with the core business objectives. Monitoring project progress as per scheduled deadlines for various tasks and taking necessary steps to ensure project completion within time. Managing risks and planning for contingencies to ensure minimal effect on deliverables. Maintaining close coordination between Onsite and Offsite team for ensuring seamless delivery of the project as per scheduled timelines."
good,"Good company for freshers,as they pay good lot to learn"
good,"Experienced a broad range of jobs at IBM, many went nowhere.   Job security lacking.  Apparent age discrimination.  Pretty good work-life balance.  Most managers are very nice and well trained."
good,"Company is Good , very basic applications , not good working culture good for the freshers so they can learn new things and salary scale is very poor."
good,"Plus- lots of new tech to learn, good client mix"
good,"IBM es en gral. una buena empresa para trabajar de 5 a 7 años, adquirir buena experiencia y movilizar tu carrera, es muy exigente el día a día por contratos con clientes de altos tiempos de respuesta. La gerencia es muy ausente y exigente cuando el servicio no marcha bien, trabajo bajo presión y 24x7."
good,"IBM is a large company with many talented employees. However, the culture of consulting, where sales rules, has tainted the experience. Management constantly sells projects with farfetched milestones, that ends up putting the suffering on the delivery team. Could really use a large-scaled replan of company direction and values."
good,No direction or place for advancement. Managers really don't give direction or opportunities to apply newly learned skills. Leadership not interested in workers they don't know.
good,"Wonderful opportunity to work with a lot of talented colleagues / friends.  Need teams to be co-located, which decreases their chances of getting or keeping talented individuals."
good,Lots of internal fighting over sales credit and an overall lack of collaboration. Some clients expressed disappointment with their previous  client engagements with IBM which is difficult to overcome when trying to develop new relationships.
good,It's ok to start a career in this company but there will not be clear agenda from management what exactly they are doing on any kind of work. Management mindset has to be updated to survive in competitive world
good,"I worked in two GTS and Cognitive Applications - both were wildly different.  In GTS, things were fairly chaotic and busy.  I learned a lot initially, but over time there wasn't much new to learn.  People tended to get silo-ed and do what they previously did to make deadlines.  Work/life balance was an issue when I started.  There were a lot of long hours and weekends worked, since it was a new product and trying to respond to new customers.  Some politics between managers in US offices and offshore offices regarding hiring and bug tickets"
good,"Your manager can easily screw your life and none can do anything about it. "
good,"IBM has been a good foundation in my early years, but I think changes in management didn't bring good feedback for the company. They focus more on their gain rather than employees welfare."
good,Uses an agile work environment.   People are willing to help each other out.  Management does have a technical background.  Company is trying to keep up with the latest technologies so there is quite a bit of movement on learning new stuff.
good,pas assez d'accompagnement mais très enrichissant.
good,"We were the darling acquisition - for awhile anyway.  We brought new energy and integrated well.  However, the ""IBM overhead"" killed our internal financial profile, ability to maintain innovation and ultimately culture."
good,"I was a subcontractor desktop tech at one of IBM's Global Services clients.  While my immediate management was good to us, the bean counters & salespeople were ludicrously incompetent."
good,Muito bom para trabalhar e aprender. Recomendo a todos que desejam um salário bem baixo e poucas chances de promoção.
good,Ability to work remotely is important.  Hardest part of the job was excessive travel at times up to 80%.  I have learned a tremendous about at IBM during my tenure
good,This is a place to work if you are conditioned for working in an environment where your job can be out-sourced without notice; where your boss is hired due to having more degrees than experience and where you are just there to make money for a mega-corp.
good,"Burocracia exagerada para processos internos ( salarios, promocoes ) e externos ( clientes )"
good,"Little to none opportunities for career advancement, slow in decision making. Monolithic and too traditional. No regard for employees with many years of service"
good,"Just a number.    They are just looking to move jobs offshore and run accounts by process.   They lack local understanding.  "
good,"IBM was a wonderful company to work for the first 5 years of my career there. Soon after we were told of the 2015 plan to reduce US workforce by 80%. This caused major moral issues and uncertainty day to day. Workers were constantly waiting for the ax to fall. Even though I made it through numerous layoffs and made it past the 2015 date they continued their cleansing of experienced workers and I was let go in 2016. Having obtained multiple patents, awards, certifications and excellent reviews did not matter. Myself and many of my very skillful, talented cohorts were simply let go. The majority of us were over 40.  I learned a lot at this company and we worked at the highest level of quality for years. Once they decided to lower quality and become ""like Microsoft"", letting the client find issues, it started going downhill. I could no longer recommend anyone expecting to retire from here to work at IBM after experiencing this firsthand."
good,Empresa muito grande com plano de carreira com baixa remuneração
good,"The Managed Application Services division has a very high potential for making a large impact in the industry.  They are well placed and regarded highly in the industry.   What is holding them back is the lack of a clear vision by upper management as to where they want to go and the proper steps to get there.   A solid vision and a firm management hand is what is needed and unfortunately is lacking in both areas.  The lack of vision is causing a lot of churn, employee uncertainty, and is forcing all but continuous reorgs."
good,"Management is too quick to micro-manage day to day work."
good,"Fun place to work , good work life, lots of extra curricular activities, balance but very slow career development and salary hikes. Very slow career progression."
good,"I had a good team and generally good executive oversight... Regional leaders where limited in their ability to make their own decisions.."
good,Good company if your young.  Once you turn 50 you become a layoff target. They are being sued because of this practice. Very stressful. I am a third generation IBMer. Company is not what it used to be. Shipped most mfg jobs over seas. Very high health care payments. Crazy money what executives make.
good,"They no longer value experienced employees.  If you are a new hire, this company is for you, otherwise, stay away.  You are only as safe as the next round of layoffs"
good,"Great ideas and complex/innovative business"
good,"Enjoyable place to work, however IBM did not prepare managers for their role. However I was trained very well at IBM due to the fact that IBM offers continuous training."
good,"Estuve por agencia Kelly, y no conté con muchas prestaciones, en si el trabajo que realizaba era agradable, muchas veces gratificante para uno mismo. Pero el ambiente era pésimo ya que la gente de planta de IBM te ve como si no valieras y eso viene desde los jefes superiores. Demasiadas horas extras que te dejaban exhausto."
good,"While my experience working at IBM was poor overall, it was also many years ago.  IBM offers excellent opportunities for advancement and wide and varied technical work."
good,Management lacks focus and long term vision. Not a good place to work. There is no one including your immediate manager doesn't take care of the needs since he/she also on the same boat as you.
good,"The management reeks of ""Old Boys/Old Gals"" Club. Good work/life balance compared to similar services firms. Good opportunity to learn if you are connected to the right people."
good,IBM has taken many steps that alienate their employees and clients. The cost take out initiatives have focused on taking US based employees out of the business regardless of contribution to client and company success
good,"It's a better work culture and work Environment, But there is small scope of professional Growth. ...................................................."
good,"Working with IBM is good but technical training is very less"
good,"Typical large corporation, often difficult to make changes but has the weight and resources to do so when they want. Compensation and benefits are kept in line with what other large corporation are offering."
good,"The company seems to be top-heavy with the number of managers. Doing actual field work, we were severely understaffed to provide timely service to our customers. They also have a very old and inefficient system to dispatch tickets to techs. Benefits are pretty standard and decent."
good,"Job is secure , good learning platforms , less opportunities , less money , not so great work culture."
good,"build technician, building of machinery according to orders, learn lots of basic tools handling. management not really active in taking care of their employee."
good,"Compensation was quite competitive."
good,this is the best place in terms of advanced and innovative technologies with the best experts. The problem could be old school management and few considerations for technical people
good,Ibm is not a good long term employer. Pure business mneed company if it has Margins it will keep the business if not..Ibm is a very bureaucratic company worse than any government department I India. Lots of             approvals needed at various levels
good,"Significant time spent working directly with clients to understand their technology requirements.  Also, involved with problem support for client.  Had autonomy over work being done on behalf of clients."
good,"My time there was as a client-based PMA.  I had little to no oversight or guidance from IBM and no assistance or direction when times got rough.  Loved the pay, but felt ignored and unvalued."
good,"When I was hired by IBM in 1979 you were guaranteed a job for life, as long as you didn't screw-up.  IBM has a Code-of-Conduct with the first rule being 'Respect for the individual.""  Employees were considered its most valuable asset.  Outsourcing jobs was unheard of."
good,buen ambiente de trabajo aprendi administrar lotus note
good,"Overall, the company has been supportive of career development and advancement. However, the changes that have occurred over the last few years have been far too many which has led to a culturally negative working environment."
good,"If you are in sales, you have a tough road.  Quota's are astronomical.  Capped earnings.  Many young hires with little business acumen.   Although direction is to focus on white space companies, the firm still gets the bulk of its revenues as well as management focus on large industry firms."
good,A good place to work at but the management culture has more scope to improve. Too many managers to report to which creates a lot of confusion to work.
good,I left IBM because I saw no room for further personal growth. Management was not focused in any way on putting me into opportunities that could foster my growth. I felt I was simply a number.
good,"La empresa en un buen lugar para iniciar tu carrera laboral, aprendes a trabajar ya sea en equipo o de forma individual, ya que ocuparas habilidades para poder desarrollarte de ambas maneras."
good,"I enjoyed oil and gas accounting.  IBM allows flexibility but depends on your manager.  Inconsistent in applying the flexible work location guidelines.  Salaries were benchmarked against industry in general and not specific to actual work.  Grossly underpaid.  Main issue with IBM was the fact they had a contract to do oil and gas accounting as an outsourcing contract but they did not pay consistent with other oil and gas accounting professionals thus there was constant turnover which made it difficult on those left to perform the work.  Otherwise, IBM is a reputable company and there were many things I did like about it."
good,"The biggest mistake managers are changed every six month, which it makes difficult to get a fair evaluation and salary increase are impossible to get."
good,"IBM is great at squeezing as much work as they can out of their dedicated employees. Long hours often include not just nights but also weekends to meet aggressive deadlines because some higher up manager makes unreasonable promises to clients. "
good,"IT firm that deals on Hardware and Software. The company is service delivery driving, no place for lackadaisical attitude at work,leaning is encourage."
good,"IBM is nice place to work and I have learned many things towards process and career growth, I have travelled through IBM for first transition to Kenya for 30 days to download the knowledge towards process and success fully we have stabilized process. In this travel with IBM I have grown process wise a lot. Now I am looking forward for my better career by professional and financially, hence I need a change."
good,"Good work culture."
good,"Transportation provided only one time, hectic work schedule, only night shifts or odd shifts, rotational week off, growth in the company is very slow."
good,"IBM started a place in Dubuque, Ia getting huge tax breaks to settle there.  They paid about 1/2 of the going salary, and hired mostly untrained workers to take care of their offsite customers."
good,Management is very poor as the local manager does not have good management skills and always keep favoritism. No way for new leadership to grow as the current manager does not allow new leadership to grow.
good,The job was not a fit for me when it came to collections.  It was great as long as I was involved in customer service and problem solving.   Attempted to assign you to the position you were suited for.  The company discontinued the customer service department.
good,"I have had both positive and negative experiences within IBM, depending on management. The company is constantly going through a lot of changes, and for the worse. IBM does a lot of shady stuff to lay people off without really having to lay them off (i.e. collocation, targeting those on disability leave)"
good,A typical day included several phone calls and heavy administrative tasks.  The workplace was multicultural.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining and completing the heavy load of administrative duties.
good,"Good place to work by worst management, recognition is not there, Managers and above have to thought how to deal with there subordinates. very poor management."
good,"The culture is to rotate staff in and out. Incentive to keep staff turnover with a five year pattern - in with the young out with the old. "
good,"IBM is a very competitive environment. There are many changes going on all the time. Managers seem to come and go before they even have a chance to know you. "
good,It's nearly impossible to focus on work when you constantly wonder if your manager will call about reduction of staff.  It has nothing to do with job performance but simply the bottomline.  IBM was a great place to work but now there are many other companies just as strong with a great workplace environment.
good,"Team member is often locked into a job and unable to post to other jobs to expand their learning and skills.  Additionally, employees have to find time after hours to take education so the utilization is not impacted. If your utilization is not met at year end it impacts your raise and other compensation provided.  Many employees avoided taking vacation or sick time as that decreased your utilization and possibly put you on the next employee layoff list.  "
good,"Management was very lazy and wouldn't offer basic things to improve the work experience, such as no broken chairs or newer computers."
good,The Cloud division is currently evolving.  Unfortunately they are running behind other cloud providers which is causing a focus on quick growth and not on the necessary business aspects.  Very young management team which provides a fresh outlook but fails to understand sound business practices.  When focus is equally distributed among growth and a business foundation the cloud business division will be successful.
good,"Standard fare call center work, it's not great but it's not the worst out there either. They could stand to improve conditions but it's unlikely to happen with current management."
good,"Good Work place"
good,"Even after doing hard work there is no recognition, in spite receive escalations. "
good,"Good place to start a career, Typical day at work are fun and exciting. everyday has a new learning, working at IBM taught me a lot of lesson like focusing on my work yet having a good work life balance."
good,"Many things have changed in Big Blue, not for the better."
good,"Having worked at IBM for over 6 years, the culture and company has changed. What started as a very entrepreneurial experience, ended in a somewhat negative work environment. On the positive side, IBM has great people working for them and a multitude of resources."
good,"There are two sides at IBM. Client facing consultants have a short life-span due to many reason. I was there for six years. I was recruited and even won the Imminence Award of Excellence. The internal non-client facing employees average 15-20 years there many having the same positions."
good,The work load you must carry is huge and the number of hours you need to put in to get the job done does not make for a good work / life balance. It is very stressful.
good,"No windows in the office; like a bunker."
good,"I worked as on-site hardware support (customer engineer) for 6 years. In that time frame, they narrowed our responsibilities (making the job very dull), reduced our pay, and the culture in my business unit declined significantly from when I started.  My job changed from a qualified, desirable, IT hardware professional to an assembly line entry-level position. I didn't see a single new hire in the entire 6 years and I quit only month before they announced the sale of my BU(high-volume systems) to Toshiba. "
good,"I have been with IBM for 20 years, and over that time, there have been many rewarding experiences and opportunities. However, it is clear that it is time to go. This is true for any IBMer that is older or that has been with them for many years.  It makes me sad, really, as there are so so many helpful, professional, kind, courteous, and smart employees. Due to any one of the many policies that are forcing people out (co-location being one), key employees are forced to leave - usually without any suitable replacement trained or targeted to replace them."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the people and interaction with different cultures. Strong Diversity. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the work load.
good,"Not much scope for growth, no respect for talent. No scope to negotiate for package, HR just randomly sent offer letter after 4 months of job confirmation"
good,Upper management is constantly looking to make financial cuts that typically result in staffing reductions. Reductions are decided at a high level without consideration to client impact.
good,"Unfortunately everyone seems to be looking out for themselves in upper management, which leads to no attention for growth in other employees.  Communication is also poor with not much transparency or clear strategy guiding directives."
good,"IBM has been a Brand respected by people within and outside of the company , An institution by itself , it  has  everything that one would look for in a company, Consistently maintaining market leadership  for over a century. "
good,Management should be strong and decisive. Currently a lot of powers are vested in the managers which sometimes bring monopoly and harassment of resources.
good,"It's was to long ago for me to give an accurate overview of the working conditions.  I , at that time, had issues with my supervisor due to his lack of communications."
good,"Decide before joining and have clarity on what position they are hiring you."
good,"Good work but no progression or freedom, just do your 9-5 for good pay and never stray from the same routine."
good,"Dying company with nothing but the dregs of humanity left working there. If you want to be miserable and hate your life, please apply. Not sure if it will remain in business much longer."
good,"long work hours, demanding, stress, no job loyalty. benifits where okay, time off was great. knowing that at that time our jbs were being out sourced was a lot of stress."
good,"Productive and focused place to work. Other employees made it enjoyable, and fun. Each day had different requirements, and challenges. Appreciated company helped in the community."
good,"To begin with, if you have never worked from your home, it has challenges. The team that I have been working with has expectations that you maintain availability from 8:00AM - 5:00PM. Sounds good right? No it's not because supporting global business requires a schedule that includes conference call meetings late at night or very early in the morning with no opportunity to use flex time. Additionally, IBM is continually conducting ""Resource Actions"" AKA lay-offs due to an increasing practice of moving work to less expensive markets outside of the U.S. Unless you are a highly sought after technical professional in information technology (programming, DBA, Cloud ) you will find that you are in a role that can easily moved overseas."
good,"Fast paced cold calling environment selling top of the line Mobile device management solutions to C level executives. Worked with upper management to create the initial presentation, then taught future hires on how the product works, how to present it, and how to close the sale."
good,"No career advancements, old book type culture, lot of political managers. Salary package is much lower compared to market. Apart from Work from home flexibility, not thing is encouraging"
good,"Very different culture to work in. Many layers to different processes. Nice to have the benefits of a big name company behind you, but as an individual, you easily get lost."
good,"Year over year I leaded as one of the top contributors in my group and wanted so much more. After years of small bonuses (most years nothing at all), I wanted to move into a more challenging role in which I really am good at (Technical training instructor). The training department Director actually tried recruiting me several times and every time my current manager would decline the transfer due to him not wanting to lose me. Very little pay increases if any at all. Wasn't a bad job as it had great work/life balance for the most part and you could always get off for a Dr appointment or something...but I wanted more in my career so I decided to leave. Now in just a little over two years at a new company, I've been promoted twice and now manage almost 20 people and earning more than double my salary at IBM. In 9 years working at IBM, my base salary only increased about $5k a year...really sad."
good,"Good place to work, good professional people. Good opportunites in certain departments, however little job security and little benefits to be obtained. work ethic/culture is strong. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with colleagues on projects."
good,Go for a 1-year contract to get it on your resume and look for advancement in another company. Very rare to be hired directly by IBM. Most are contractors.
good,Working at IMB/Seterus was ok. The company was new to mortgages when I first went there and it was a lot of hard work putting together all of the policies and procedures. Having to interview and hire all of your staff as well as get them trained and up to par once they were hired on.
good,IBM offers out internships that can be fun and rewarding but doesn't provide tools for advancement. Interns do not become graduates they then outsource and provide false hope to those hoping to secure roles.
good,"Learn skills such as basic hardware, network troubleshooting via Linux/KVM, how a ticketing system works."
good,"I worked with some very intelligent people and we delivered strong solutions. First line manager was very supportive and communicated well. The workload was generally manageable, but could be overwhelming at times. Solution was to prioritize and keep moving forward."
good,"The biggest problem is that management doesn't know what to do and stopped creating, they only listen to the greedy investors.  Management's major focus is revenue and nothing else.  They make shortsighted decisions and there were never any raises or career paths only excuses."
good,"Good name as a big company;  workplace culture changing rapidly; except at the highest level personnel are constantly changing;  be ready to adapt constantly. Makes work-life balance a  challenging."
good,"No thank you I retired,that covers it.  I think current leadership of the corporation has no clue as to how to run a world class technical powerhouse and will end up killing what was once a great company."
good,"I enjoyed working for the brand 'IBM', but after 911 and the loss of over 50% of the consulting business, it became very competitive and cut-throat place to work. In 2010, it became a numbers game. If you were billing on an account, good. If not billing for 2-3 months, you're laid off. No corporate loyalty to employees, only to the stock market."
good,"Many wonderful opportunites. Great place to learn new technology."
good,Start at 8:00 am. take inbound and make outbound calls to collect mortgage payments and assist customers with their accounts. The hardest part of the job is that the manangers are not on the same page. One manager will tell you one thing and one will tell you something completely different. There is no uniformity.The employee are fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we do get to help people stasy in their home. That is a fullfilling fealing
good,Work was great at IBM. I worked with the best engineers and scientists in the world. My responsibilities took me to many places around the globe and I was in the forefront of technologies.
good,The most enjoyable part is easily the quality people you work with. Management is not selected based on leadership skills and it reflects in the morale and culture.
good,"Uma empresa com uma cultura muito boa, estabilidade, aprendizado e flexibilidade para os funcionários. "
good,"Excited about when IBM was interested in acquisitioning Internet Security Systems, until a few years of hard labor and around the clock locking in of financial data and asset information before/after their time of trade, where I found that through all of my great ideas being put to use, and applied, my manager gets to keep his job while I was given a few weeks to find new employment within IBM or take severance pay and part ways from what could have been a wonderful opportunity!"
good,"Worked for IBM Global Services for 30+ years.. IBM was a great company for most of my career. The basic values it practiced related to its employees had been positive influence on myself and others to want to come to work and make a difference for IBM and our customers. I still know that there are many who continue to practice these values, but they are now the exception."
good,"As i was fresher i had more opportunities to  learn new things in the company. some times fun at work ,cross training for other process,"
good,Contract and agency employees are not respected and treated equally as preference and recognition given to full time employees by the management. Full-time employees does not interact with contract employees.
good,Upper management's only  concern is short term stock prices and their only tool is cost cutting.  IBM has been trying to cut  costs since the early 90s.  Initially there was plenty of fat to cut but for the last decade they have been cutting deep into the muscle.  Finding someone with experience to get work done is difficult.  There are still a few workers with experience trying to hold the whole company together.
good,"No security for contract employees"
good,"IBM is in a highly evolving business.  The organization is constantly changing it's strategy, and I don't always agree with the direction it taking.  The people are great!"
good,"People were great, many career advancement options."
good,Las oportunidades de desarrollo de carrera y la comunicación entre los lideres era nula.
good,"I would love to have a job typically which would make me busy all day with a great work culture and lively workplace."
good,"Get good training to work for IBM"
good,"IBM as a company has become not a very desirable place to work.  The lack of regard for employees worsened over the last few years.  No longer was there any value placed on the work of the employees nor any concerns to keep the employees happy.  They would remind the employees again and again how lucky they should feel to have a job. This made the work environment rather depressing at times, leaving the co-workers to band together for being able to get thru a very long day.  Management did not back their employees at times when support would have been appropriate."
good,limited ability to progress up throughout the company unless you are a 3rd or 4th generation IBMer. IF your parents have clout in another major company you can also move easily.
good,Management dont take care of the employees.Only benefit working in IBM is to have WFH option.No Career growth and no increment in the annual performance appraisal.
good,"Productive day at work"
good,"Lot of good exposure, working with MNCs worldwide, excellent learnings from IT stand-point. However there is no career growth path and Management support is not to the level expected in building practitioners career."
good,"As SME(Architect) my role is to make sure all the system and related eco system are performing as per expectation."
good,"Management was opportunistic and played favorites,  could not rely on there word from one day to the next, they took no responsibility.  Work environment was conducive and comfortable.  Working with peers help to keep ones sanity."
good,"No time in /time out."
good,IBM is maybe the best organization to learn along with your day to day work. Great place to learn new technology and to learn about market trend though you will need to spare time from your regular work assignments.
good,"Very Leading edge, outsourcing to other countries is frequent. No Job security in my position, Project Management arena.  Wealth of knowledge, always someone who knows.  High expectations, work a lot of hours.  Always short on resources for projects."
good,Many people subject to termination. Much work being off shored and making U.S. staff nervous.  Middle managers have no flexibility.  Controlled by upper management who do not have technical orientation.  Totally sales and marketing message oriented.
good,back in 2001 Very poor and unfair management no Job Work/Life Balance forget about Job Security/Advancement Compensation/Benefits ist ok Job Security/Advancement can be better in many ways
good,"While competitors were building new technologies and solutions for IBM's clients, the company was cutting cost and artificially increasing ""Goodwill"" in a quest to $20 EPS.  The company is attempting to erase 10 years of lost opportunity, which is a very difficult feat in a rapidly changing environment. I hope they succeed and for the sake of the great employees working there, I wish them Good luck."
good,"Work as per the Clients standards as usual in any IT job."
good,"Hard line corporate culture that in it;s raw form hasn't changed very much from the IBM Blue history. Good pay/benefits, but with Global Services you are at the mercy of the contract."
good,"IBM India Pvt Ltd is a OK place to work because of the Leave entitlement Policy and work from home option providing more flexibility to employees. However, salary is minimal and you will be stuck with the same salary structure even after 5 years of service."
good,Career kind of stopped with regards to advancement. Environment was not the best as there was constant talk of layoff each day. Not a healthy environment.
good,"layed off, after XX years came back as a vendor and now they are removing ex ibmers from the workforce, dont have anything else to write about this!!!"
good,"Salários na média do mercado."
good,"IBM's culture is very political and relationship-driven.  Work-life balance is good, and job security can be if you're any good at your job at all.  Low marks for advancement unless you're in with the ""cool kids"".  Management changes continually, as do compensation plans, and it's hard to execute to plans that change at least once a year.  Culture is fearful if you're over 45, and executive management seems to have a confidence from the board room that isn't visible from below.  Great place to ""retire in place"" if you're good at your job."
good,I worked at IBM in manufacturing for several years. Its a solid place to work with advancement potential. If you are not educated and looking for a decent job with okay benefits its not bad.
good,I worked in a Mainframe enviorment. I ran jobs via MVS from different accounts. Fixed some failed jobs via using JCL. Reran jobs using CA7-11. Did Mainframe shutdowns and startups with various partitions weekly utilizing the HMC console
good,"Nice place to work ,"
good,"IBM was a great company to work for for several years, but has since taken a turn in terms of employee compensation, work hours, and employee loyalty."
good,"IBM is in the throes of re-inventing itself yet again. While the CEO and many top executives exude confidence they know where the company is heading, very few individuals in its massive workforce do. This huge company is so tied down with bureaucracy, that it is a full time job just to get anything done from an operations point of view. "
good,Expect high performance and expected to do more with less resources. Changing business requirements tend to lead to state of flux at time. Direct management is great.
good,"IBM is huge Blue Ocean. Its great company to work with. IBM has great work culture."
good,"Laid off in less than a year, non performance based. "
good,we received a calls from a clients from United Airlines inquiring regarding their status of their mileages and flights. What I've learned form this work is to deal with an irate customer and resolved it.
good,IBM is a great place to get your hands on career development tools and technologies and learn about many technical advancements that IBM has a consistent and significant contribution.
good,"The worst thing ever is the egyptian management. "
good,"It really helps in developing your knowledge and experience working in IBM and can gain enough knowledge of SAP and other applications. "
good,"I have worked at IBM for a total of 15 years, first as a contractor, then Regular employee, then laid off and returned as a contractor in 2009.  Since that time my hours have been repeatedly cut depending on quarterly earnings.  Now I also have had my pay rate cut (for the second time), so my earnings are now only 78% of what it would have been if I was working 40 hours per week at my original rate.  There is little to no notice of furloughs.  As an example, I received notice today that I might have to take 2 weeks furlough starting on Monday.  I asked my IBM manager about it and was told that no decision will be made until Monday.  So it's possible that I will log in on Monday morning and be told to log off for 2 weeks.  Combined with my planned vacation in July, that will be 3 weeks unpaid time, two of which will be unexpected and will be a significant hardship to me and my family financially.  It's time to cut loose and find a job with a company that cares about it's employees."
good,IBM is a giant with a great pedigree that needs to find its way forward. The internal framework is good with many excellent inventors and technologists.
good,"Many smart people working there. Made great relationships and I was given opportunity to try new things. However, organizationally, the company is dysfunctional. Would not likely work there again if given the opportunity."
good,I think IBM is not good in terms of payment and promotion. You will give 100% effort but at the end of year you will be getting nothing which will automatically demotivate you.
good,I enjoyed working in IBM .but due to shifts.I could not continue working with this company..But it was a good place to work and learn soft skills as well as communication skills..
good,Big company suffering with non competent middle management. Middle management do not care about their reporting employee and always not willing to take any decisions. No growth from last 5 years
good,"I worked for IBM from 2010-2015, and I loved my first three-and-a-half years.  After that, the company completely changed--my manager changed twice, once without my even knowing about it.  My new manager didn't really care about what my career path had been until I was switched over to him, and told me that if I wanted to stay with the company, I had to ""grow how the company wanted me to grow,"" rather than to do what I had actually been hired to do or what my prior two managers (and past decade of my professional life) had been guiding me toward.  In short: IBM kind of stopped caring about its employees and started seeing us as ""revenue centers."""
good,"Very unorganized with junior managers running diviions they know nothing about. Poor communications, too much travel, especialyy needles travel, no rel solutions for the client that mad e sense."
good,"Offices in Buenos Aires are well located, if you work in Martinez it's a beautiful plant with gardens. Every day it's a challenge, thus is not compensated well and be prepared to work really long hours. Managers have to develop you, but they'll use any free course on site not to pay you additional courses to develop you. Your colleagues are going to support you, and that it's the best you're going to get from the company."
good,"You never know if your job really is going to be waiting for you the next day. Changes are made to your salary/wage on a dime, without any advanced notice."
good,"IBM will do anything to please the shareholders - they constantly shoot themselves in the foot."
good,"Worked there for 18 years, but during that time I continually had to find a new position to continue to work for IBM, as they were cutting jobs. It worked out as a good stepping stone to the right company. IBM - Stands for ""I've been moved"" and there is a lot of truth to that!"
good,"waste company we not able to get proper hike and always depend for the manger, Manger not fallowing rules how to lift the people, they should always tell the reason."
good,"Company is good."
good,"The people were generally good but management seemed to be slightly clueless about what our goals. "
good,"IBM is an excellent place to work,  aspiration to grow with organization is respected and groomed to develop in your career.  Highly recommend for starters."
good,"A Big Name in the Market."
good,"I worked almost 2 years for IBM as third party, as opportunity for me, it was great, however, I moved from there because I didn't like people management culture."
good,No time bounding but need more employee benefits either  monitory or non monitory except fixed salary.Employee needs to be get encouraged and motivated by these.
good,"IBM has a ton of customers, and selling updates to existing solutions is a strong point.  However, creating and successfully selling new ideas is difficult both internally and externally"
good,I have learned how to engage in a multi cultural setting. I loved the traveling where I was able to view different parts of the country. traveling abroad was a great experience.
good,The company provides good work-life balance but limited growth options. The job stability is ok. Workplace culture is friendly and management is easily approachable for any concerns.
good,"Typically in my area we are self guided and don't have a huge amount of management interference.  Work with end customers, make arrangements with end customers, do the job w/ end customers.  Easy enough."
good,Big company with lot of activities processes going on. Very difficult to co-ordinate with people. Career advancement difficult to achieve.Lot of learning opportunities
good,Everyone work hard to support the clients. Competition with other company is getting harder as work is off-shored. The company policy are very good for security.
good,"-Good company, lot of technologies/skills/varied areas of project/business."
good,"Offers work flexibility especially for working mothers."
good,"It's a good company to work, nice people, but no job security. Benefits are regular, there's no job culture and salary is not bad, but not great."
good,"Uma empresa boa para trabalhar, porém a área que trabalhei não havia possibilidades de ser efetivado ou de crescer profissionalmente. Mesmo assim, as pessoas foram muito agradáveis e me ensinaram a trabalhar com notas fiscais."
good,IBM has its strength being one of the few companies successfully operating for the last 100 years. Its a big achievement to work for this company.
good,"Overall average. "
good,"A typical day: Go to work at the contracts work place. Continue with my projects (COBOL programming, SQL data Repairs) and worked on any beak/fixes as they arose. When there was a lull between projects take IT courses online to fulfill my Think 40 training requirement.  The workplace culture was that of contract holder. I was always co-located with the rest of the outsourced IT people. The hardest part of the job was the nightly call outs after putting in a full days work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people you got to work with and the work."
good,"Learnt Many things from the Company for example: "
good,"I was able to work with multiple clients daily.  I learned RACF, zSECURE and Vanguard.  Management was fair but there really was not much chance for advancement.  The hardest part of the job was probably audits.  The most enjoyable part was getting to know people from all over the world."
good,"as all large companies do, this one laid off many of the more senior employees with no regard for qualifications, etc."
good,Empresa muito burocrática sem possibilidade de crescimento e desenvolvimento
good,"Lack of mentoring to the employees, no training, not many projects, too many hours of work while on projects, too much bureaucracy, work life balance is not achievable"
good,"ambiente tranquilo,"
good,Nice place to work in less salary                                                                                                                                                  -
good,"a good place to start one's career. as a supervisor in the regional office I found management near the top to be more than a little bullying, in a 1950's style of management. I knew of a management employee who was placed on job probation and was only told of it when his performance had improved and regional management called him in to tell him that his probationary period was going to be extended."
good,Good team overall. Enjoyed working in the team. Had a couple of team lunches in good restaurants. Overall a good experience.
good,was a great place to work but in recent years they have been moving IT jobs overseas and laying off long time employees. Still some great people there
good,"Big Blue has great brand recognition, great technology, and seems like a very exciting place to be! Unfortunately, there is not a culture of helpfulness or friendliness here, so it makes getting things done very difficult. Also, most employees are remote and hard to get a hold of when you need them. Internal tools are from the dark ages, as are the legal processes to accomplish anything. Everything moves very slowly, and most people try to find ways around the processes in order to get things done."
good,"IBM siempre ofrecerá una buena experiencia a la hoja de vida, pero lamentablemente no hay buen ambiente de trabajo ni estabilidad laboral."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide recommendation to homeowners for multiple mortgage programs available to prevent foreclosures.
good,"Team gathering aftar task complition . "
good,IBM used to be a good company to work for.  In the last few years things have gone down hill.  Always looking over your shoulder wondering when the axe is going to drop.  Seems like the new plan is to get rid of experienced remote employees and hire interns/new grads as replacement.  Morale seems to be really low.  A lot of people in my group are looking
good,"Great team of people to work with from all over the country.  Very"
good,Great company with a huge brand recognition but not as polished from the inside. Management was usually good but some were horrible. Complete lack of interest from management. Good training
good,"Salary is high compared to the outside market, and for 15 years working from home was a great benefit, but the demands were overboard. Maybe didn't spend time driving to an office, but worked long hours to make up for it. Last couple of years were spent watching work go offshore. The issue was wondering when, not if, your turn for layoff would come."
good,IBM was a great learning bed for how to run projects properly. Unfortunately a great many projects would start and stop for unexpected reasons.
good,This is a rough place to work.  Highly stressful and management is pushed too far with working load.  Co-workers are friendly.  No job security no matter the amount of years you put in.
good,Manque de structure niveau management. Salaire à revoir. Manque de suivi.
good,IBM is not what it used to be and I am not sure that is a good thing.  The push to globalize and market and inflate stock prices seems to have come at the cost of quality.
good,The day is much loaded with work. Less of technical and more of process work is done which has no sense. Partiality is done mostly and work is not appreciated. Co-workers are sort of better.
good,"IBM is a place to work, where you will always learn and be apart of  a great working atmosphere. they have alot of perks for working for them"
good,"•	Providing L1 server support"
good,"Great place to learn "
good,"the work in Huawei is like a school. you can learn a lot from the colleagues. "
good,"Poor Trainings and Poor Management."
good,PepsiCo outsourced their finance to IBM in 2013 since we had a salary reduction and a major layoff.  Being that this is a satellite site for IBM we don't get to interact with other IBM employees or network. The work atmosphere is stressful as full time employees are being replaced by contractors and there is no room for growth and advancement.
good,A poor grinding work place where every resource is directed at sending work overseas. Senior management extracts maximum effort out of front line employees and gives little in return. Bonuses are minimal at best and raises are virtually nonexistent. A once tremendous company had been reduced to a meat grinder through the greed of company executives.
good,An ok company to work for. Work ethic is poor. The hardest part of the job is you don't have tools to get the job done but expectation is very high
good,Empresa onde valoriza bastante a qualidade de vida dos funcionários.
good,"Not for the people who want to work or archive something. "
good,"I'm working for 3,5 years in IBM. I've provided my overall comments by giving stars already. I'm not willing to explain any further."
good,I have enjoy working at IBM. My experienced in IBM is a beneficial one i had learnt a lot of stuff there and my co-worker are friendly and nice they offer me help when needed and one of them had given me adviced from his own past experience in his jobs.The hardest part is during troubleshooting of the machine there has been too many error and the exact problem is unknown.
good,The place to work is good but they don't give you any appreciation or nor they ever increase the salary after working there for many years.
good,"I Improved my Technical Knowledge"
good,I loved working for IBM however in the last several years there was always a fear of being laid off without notice.   IBM was constantly reducing benefits for employes due to failing quarterly numbers.  There was no loyalty to long term employees.
good,the company does not give great salary hikes and sometimes do not give any hike at all. Job seems to be more or less secured. its good for people who work for a pension and not for a salary.
good,"Your job is always hanging in the balance, never know from one day to the next if you are going to be let go.  Many people have been let go and all the responsibilities left behind go on the employees left which makes things even worst."
good,Structured environment with experienced individuals.  Difficult to get results for customers.  Many management layers to get decision-making approval.
good,"Equipe jeune et dynamique"
good,"It is a good place for starter, It is always hard working with non-technical management when it comes to critical team as oracle dbas."
good,"O dia de trabalho era bastante intenso, porém como sempre gostei muito de atender, no final do dia sempre saí com sentimento de dever cumprido, pois sempre dei meu melhor através dos feedback´s tinha a informação da excelência do meu trabalho."
good,"IBM is a good company to work for in general.  Benefits are above average, and there are opportunities for advancement.  However, the company is significantly cutting its US-based workforce and restricting benefits, salary increases, etc."
good,"Fun place to work but limited advancement opportunities. Campus atmosphere was gloomy with gray hallways and energy saving lights in the hallways, creating a dark and empty atmosphere."
good,"My typical day includes working with diverse technical and business teams discussing application issues/scope/development, managing various activities, such as, production issues, development, testing, deployment, managing offshore team and vendors, customer satisfaction, etc."
good,"Working for IBM was great for the benefits, but working for a giant corporation you are only a number to them.  No matter the job you do for the company, if your job is up for elimination you are out the door.  I worked for them for 11.5 years in 3 different states, 4 different cities (I had to pay for moving myself) and when the reorganization happened in March I was permanently laid off."
good,"Negatividad por lado de la jefatura inmediata, aprendí mucho, es una empresa que cuenta con todas las herramientas de capacitación."
good,My experience was not bad but neither was satisfying. The management of project that I worked in (IBM Pune- a local telecome project) was not up to par. The requirements were never fixed and work culture was like sabji-mandai.
good,"An einem typischen Tag liest man min. 3-5 Stunden nur Emails. Die Kunst liegt darin zu verstehen welche Emails wichtig und beantwortet werden müssen und welche man einfach ablegen kann. Man kann sehr viel lernen und hat Freiheiten in der Gestaltung von Business Development Aktivitäten."
good,"I work in Onsite\Offshore Model leading a Team of 10 People. MY work include gathering requirements, writing BRD, Functional Specification, Designing and Coding a few modules and providing SIT, and UAT support."
good,"In IBM people should be lucky to go into a good project. Choice won't be given to select from a list even if available."
good,"least support"
good,"I am reviewing this company based on my position in the company. Long hours and night shifts not recommend as it takes a toll on health, The salary is not at all good for the amount of work you do,night shift allowances are not given.However company ensures safety for women and provide cab facilities after 7p.m night."
good,"I get to work on time and leave after 9 hours of work, but more often than not, I work overtime without pay. There will only be compensation for travel and food if you work for over 3 hours overtime. Co-workers are fun and are easy to work and will help you with almost everything. However, working with other departments is quite a handful because of late responses which cause delays."
good,"Morale has been going down for years. Constant risk of being laid off. Errors not allowed. Rating's based on extra work done, NOT your job performance, except if you made a mistake.  Way to much favoritism shown by managers."
good,"Really no way to advance here, and the pay is pitiful. Love the coworkers, but thats about it. You're going to work at least 44 hrs a week, no way around it. Otherwise your utilization will be too low. Just not what anyone was expecting"
good,IBM is indeed an old company and I can see why its fallen behind the new leaders in IT services. It does not put to much attention or focus on its employees and I am not sure there is any growth guaranted within company. Its good place only if you seek to work from home more often and need to balance personal life. Its good for old folks who aren't looking for much change and growth - I wouldn't recommend for anyone with any experience seeking a dynamic work culture.
good,"The company is outstanding at laying out well-structured business models: however, they tend to prefer farming their existing businesses than tackling emerging business opportunities aggressively.  Advancement in the organization is less about numbers or content and more about who you know and how you pose."
good,"Decent workplace,have learnt a lot over the past year. All about hard work and efforts."
good,Good place for freshers to start a career. The exposure you get will enhance you to further adjust with other places and environment. Loads of pressure.
good,"standard DB2 systems programmer routine, reviewed problem change queue, fixes any batch job are fail with DB2 related issue."
good,"Worked from home the last 2 years supporting servers in England, the east and west coast, things went from very slow to busy and back.  I liked busy.   The 11 years before that I worked at a customer site starting with 26 co-workers in the office,  at the end I was the only one on site every day.  I had some very good mangers and some very bad ones too,  I had about 8 in 13 years.  The co-workers were good at what they did.  The hardest part of the just was on call work, a few years I work 24 weekends a year.  Best part of the job, they gave me odd jobs and they were hard but fun to do.  Good co-workers."
good,"uring my employment here I obtained skills that I can utilize and use to grow with the company as well as that I will be able to use in future employment. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people that I was working along side with were very fun and outgoing people. I think the hardest part of the job was just getting the initial hang of all of it but other than that the job itself was alright. I learned several things while employed here, customer service skills over the phone, how to work in a call center environment, enhanced my skills on how to operate a apple computer, and just overall experience of the call center was great.."
good,"Pros: Work from home options, good health benefits, some smart people and good initiatives (like Smarter Cities, Watson)"
good,"I enjoyed my 12+ years at IBM and was sad to leave. My co-workers were top-notch, the work challenging and rewarding... a great combination!"
good,Very bright colleagues committed to providing value and high quality services to clients.  Limited support from senior management.  Individuals working at IBM must be driven by their own personal integrity to provide value without the expectation of receiving kudos or recognition.
good,"You learn a lot simply by sharing information with others and working across diverse accounts. I worked with many talented individuals and the account did a lot to socialise and work as a cohesive team. That was great. Sadly, senior management are simply concerned with selling services, that is the bottom line. Lost vision of deliverables and an employee is just an asset now and not an individual."
good,"A typical day at IBM consists of paperwork. Loads of it. And lots of meetings. Often times about nothing a quick 5-minute call couldn't have sorted out. Co-workers are a blast, but they're also steeped in paperwork and don't like it. A lot of continuous and on-going complaining, which injures the culture. The hardest part of the job: Knowing what your job consists of; is it paperwork or what you were 'sold' on during interview? The most enjoyable part of the day is completing the paperwork. Then the next day arrives with its own mountain of paperwork to get through."
good,"IBM is struggling currently and working to identify new direction.  Layoffs are rampant and the moral is low.  While the company is extremely resilient and has weathered other transformations in the past, senior employees are becoming increasingly disenchanted and impatient.  As always, IBMers stay for the people, integrity and the flexible work culture."
good,"Awesome corporate direction delivered by senior management fully embraced by ground level talent, resisted by middle level management."
good,"IBM India is different from what IBM global is. It is good place to work if you are not very ambitious :)."
good,"After 2.5 years at IBM my career has stalled, managers make promises of promotion or raises and can never follow through. I stick around for the team I work with."
good,A empresa parece entregar valor e qualidade a seus clientes (de renome) e possui boa infra-estrutura. Os salários costumam ser maiores que os pagos pelos concorrentes diretos (embora inferiores a outras empresas) mas não é das melhores empresas para estabelecer um plano de carreira.
good,IBM was my first job when i was more in my learning phase. We used to work in 24*7 shifts when life twisted all of the sudden. It was good to interact with customers over phone
good,I worked with IBM for a short period and not enjoyed a lot. Working environment was not good . Actually I worked their off roll and they have changed my vendor very frequently . We can simply say Job was not stable there.
good,"Management consulting at IBM is focused on bottom-line results, with less emphasis put on people issues.  The team atmosphere was largely missing - the people on your team were the members of the project you are currently working on."
good,"IBM is a good place to grow as it has different paths."
good,"This is the old Manufacturing Line where the Domain Shopping Mall is now. There were things I loved about the place, however it was short lived. We all made good money, you could work all you wanted. It doesn't matter because it's all gone now."
good,"Salary is not up to the mark and management is horrible."
good,"My first job was at IBM."
good,"Dealing with customer complaints from the U.S, escalations and technical issues regarding printers and computing systems."
good,"I was a contractor so my review is biased. Our project changed hands between managers. Our work load was growing so the new manager brought in some of her people who were awful. Despite being the most productive, least paid and the senior engineer on the project I was selected for lay offs because I was the only contractor on the team."
good,"Una empresa muy interesante y con buenas oportunidades solo para ellos que acaban de salir de la universidad, para lo demas hay que hacer todo por contrato,"
good,Slogging between the shifts and very hectic work pressure. Low staffing and very poor management. lack of proper discipline in co workers.
good,"IBM was an excellent company to work for in the first 5 years of employment. IBM cared for it's employees at this time with benefits recognition. Since then, they have removed the pension benefits, removed variable pay benefits, increased the medical, dental & vision benefits & removed all employee recognition benefits. IBM Finance Management has repeatedly communicated that your skills, experience, education & job performance carry no benefit when considered for advancement. IBM Finance Management also has communicated that US employees are paid too much as the Finance team's roles have been redefined with outsourcing same work overseas at lower wage rates. In addition, the US Finance employees are being managed as an overall ""average rate per employee"" instead of their progressive experience, education, improved skills & efficiencies when advancement opportunities arise."
good,"Worked for IBM in the 80s. Took a Buyout and returned to IBM in 2006. A very different company, not as employee caring as I remember from the old days"
good,"Monitoring multiple Mainframe LPAR's  for many clients in a busy high paced data center."
good,"A typical day working for IBM is to drive new license/SaaS revenue. Building pipeline and developing relationships is central to any salespersons success at IBM.  Over the last year in this territory and brand, I have learned a great deal.  Understanding the value of our products and why our customers should consider using to cut cost, drive revenue, or build better relationships with their suppliers and vendors is key to building credibility.   I have also learned a great deal in the industry I cover, Life Sciences. "
good,Executive management has poorly managed the business so now frantically trying to catch up with the world requirements.  Resource actions should start at the executive levels.
good,"Working with the customer (City of Chicago) Sla's, verification, over 1 billion in revenue for city of Chicago. Also Budget and third party performance."
good,"no hikes, no satisfaction for the work we did.not best place for long term"
good,"O principal benefício era a flexibilidade de horário e possibilidade de se trabalhar de casa, Home Office."
good,"Good place to work as a fresher."
good,"Learned how to stock take IT assets. Most of the time working alone. But always with the end goal in mind."
good,"1	Handled calls related to Broadband support."
good,I have increase lots of my productivity while working in  in IBM Daksh
good,"Work on designing various Risk related dashboards for all the reporting activities"
good,"Salary package is too low."
good,"IBM has a very good work culture, but growth is kind of stagnant."
good,Work life balance is good in IBM and  we will have the facility to work from any where and that motivate employees to more proactive and productive.
good,"High Pressure Job.."
good,"IBM India has now grown to an extent where it poses a stiff challenge to homegrown Software companies of India in IT global delivery and manpower attraction/retention. It now operates the following business lines from India which contributes to worldwide IBM in a global delivery framework: India Software Labs (ISL), India Research Lab (IRL), Linux Technology Center, Global Business Services(GBS), Global Technology Services (GTS) formerly known as ITD-GD (Information Technology Delivery - Global Delivery), Global Business Solutions Center (GBSC), Sales & Distribution (S&D), Integrated Technology Services (ITS)."
good,"very good work environment, flexi work options, Lot of learning opportunity"
good,"Career growth is slow."
good,"good place to work for freshers, scope for learning. good flexibility"
good,"Less work-life ballance"
good,"Work involves more process and procedures for a simple tasks."
good,"Le management est trop distants des employés, aucune culture d'entreprise"
good,Busy through out the day.  Got to know people from around the campus.
good,"Great Products with some good mgmt."
good,"Having  excel in a Challenging Managerial Position with a company where my abilities and work experience can be challenged and utilized for making effective decisions leading to efficiency, growth and profitability of the organization"
good,People nice.  Unorganized and too much red tape.  Work long hours during projects.  Work not steady.
good,This company challenges your skills and sets high expectations for its employees.  You get to work with great people and build skills that are applicable in a variety of environments.
good,Hardware doesn't seem to be a good field to be in anymore. IBM management doesn't know where the heck they are going.
good,"IBM is more than 100 year old company. Very good place to work, good place to grow and earn good money to have a good life. "
good,"Assisted Auto Dealers with their Dealer License Renewals."
good,"Each day at work is a challenging and learning experience. Learning how to patiently investigate and provide resolution to each of our assignee's concern. Acknowledging the chance to work with a productive team and working under a manager you look up to. There is no easy job or profession. In this industry it is all about working smart and time management. Hardest part of the job is multi-tasking working on the assignment pre-requisite of the assignees and working on reports as well. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with my team, learning from them, learning from our experience and being able to deliver what our assignee's need and making sure that they are fully satisfied."
good,"Yes, its a Good Company but depends on the people and management completely."
good,"- Code Development"
good,"Review  incoming problems, fix or reassign where applicable"
good,Company has changed throughout the years.... where the benefits saturated and employees are less cared for.  The goal has become profit driven only... no longer technology driven.
good,"- Tiring load all day. Most of my time is at office due to service operations. "
good,The model for this IBM division seems to be drive local labor costs to the absolute minimum and then move everything off-shore.
good,Great company when they trust their employees. Management has no clue on how to shift with market changes or personalities of the employees. The company produces great innovation.
good,"Managers are quick to stop you from advancing."
good,"management was worst.."
good,"Consultant work is unstable and it is based on if they have available projects.  If you are not assigned to a project in a considerable amount of time, be prepared to be laid-off. Some high-manager attitudes are very snobbish"
good,"My daily and monthly work was:"
good,"Good Working Environment"
good,"Work is good, but the management is not good. The managers appointed will be irrelavent to your working field."
good,"Good organisation."
good,"Not a lot of work, and no organic growth. Seems like a struggling company. Most of the employees look depressed because of fear of lay-off. It is a sinking ship."
good,"Working as a PLM Consultant in the Engineering and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) practice of Supply Chain Management Competency. The practice is responsible for providing Consulting and System integration solutions in Supply Chain, CAD/CAE and PLM domains."
good,"Great chance to learn and grow as an individual.  however, these days there is very little job security especially in hardware."
good,"I know managements defers in each project, so its not correct to say it for the whole IBM. But in my account it is the case."
good,"Mi trabajo en IBM es mas para atender la parte contable de las acquisitions de Brasil."
good,Being part of IBM I have learned that one will end up learning a lot. Good company to work with.
good,"Lugar bom de trabalhar, porém com alto grau de exigência  em relação ao tempo a ser dedicado para o trabalho, sobrando pouco tempo para a vida pessoal"
good,Good Place to learn about the industry. No opportunity for advancement though.
good,"I would not recommend IBM as a place for employment unless you get into a part of the company that is expanding and extremely profitable, are incompetent and want to have a sit around and email all day or attend meetings and collect a check, or are desperately seeking employment and have been out of a job for months."
good,"A typical day at work is always different things happening.  I've learnt a lot from my career with IBM, especially the leadership and people management skills.  I will reserve my comments of my management team.  I enjoy working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job are the daily challenges that I meet everyday, which is also the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,"Cette compagnie se distingue par une forte image de marque et une culture d'entreprise forte. On ressent positivement les forces et les moyens mis en jeu lors de la gestion de grosses crises. Mais la gestion du personnel et des carrières ne suit pas le discours officiel car les lignes intermédiaires de management sont trop écartées des réalités et des préoccupations des clients."
good,"Não há um ambiente saudável de trabalho devido a intrigas entre funcionários, falta de ferramentas modernas e práticas para o exercício das funções tornava a rotina massante e estressante."
good,"monotonous job"
good,Oferecia equipamentos modernos que permitia desenvolver as tarefas com qualidade
good,"	Tier 1 & 2 Tech Support • Application Mgmt. • User Training/Support"
good,Culture of IBM is not good.There is very difficult to balance work and life
good,"I had the chance to work from home.  This type of job needs to be self sufficient."
good,"I am working for IBM Info Services Company ,and I am working  technical support engineer in Income Tax office .I have learned many things form this office ."
good,It is such a great company but it is drivin by and only by income which is there right.
good,"Needs new management,"
good,"A empresa possui diversas a´reas de atuação, porém a carg horária é muito alta."
good,I recruited Federal and Commercial IBM opportunities. I worked remote primarily on IBM CSA
good,first day i nervous for work but two and three days will comfort this job
good,"It does get hectically busy, team is fun to work with, learn alot from senior people. Hardest part of the job is when jobs fail and enjoyable is when things gel and service management and customer is happy with my work."
good,"No employee loyalty, overworked and under appreciated; Mgmt seemed to not always be on the same page with Senior Mgmt."
good,"Learned Management Skills, Training."
good,"IBM is for to-be retired employees who don't want to work hard but have a casual life. Its also for those who are more keen to work from home, rather than work hard, learn fast, out perform kinds."
good,enjoyable and learnt lot at work but it was shortest experience.  Most enjoyable part was team.
good,"Learning is there but oppurtunities are less."
good,"works starts at 8:30 am and ends at 5:00 pm, mostly work on value added service systems to ensure they r up and running, record error logs. make sure other aspect in the region ie other countries are in place, we do have weekly conference calls."
good,"hired 18 employees for 3 year contract.  within 5 months, 16 employees were laid off."
good,"CDD de remplacement maladie."
good,IBM is a great place with amazing work life balance. Only if could improve the better distribution and quality of work.
good,I liked everything about this job.  The reason I want to leave is to find a position where I can make a greater contribution.  I found that I was encouraged to develop specialized skills and I would like to find a position that would allow me to contribute far more in different areas.  
good,"Entro das 07:00 á 19:00 um dia sim e outro não com 1 hora de almoço e 15 mim de café.um salário muito baixo e muito desconto,eles trabalham com banco de horas e não pagam hora extras,fazendo com que nos ficamos muito desmotivados."
good,"Gostei de trabalhar na IBM, contudo apesar de ser uma multinacional a filial de Porto Alegre terceiriza a mão-de-obra. Isto não oferece estabilidade ao funcionário e dificulta um plano de carreira. "
good,"The company's goal is money."
good,"No appreciation of hard work, Lower salary compared to Market with no raises."
good,"I really liked certain things about my IBM Global Services days. However, it was not possible to advance in the company, unless I just wanted to wait a decade or two. I literally doubled my salary by quitting."
good,"IBM has a great reputation, not sure if it actually lives up to it."
good,"great benefits, nice area to work but currently they offer very little for advancement throught the company."
good,Good for freshers and can learn lots of thing thru training. Giving lot of flexibility in working hours. 
good,"Today being a very demanding world., there is no start time or end time  for the work in a typical day. One has to do his/her own time management at work. Also do a work/life balance in his/her profession. Peers are mostly self driven in their work and work performance is rated by the manager based on the work accomplishments by an individual. Highly process driven organisation which is required to manage a large workforce. One has to be very careful and clear in his/her communication to internal and external stakeholders of the organisation"
good,Procedure oriented company. Some time need to work long time. May be need to come to office late night
good,"I have been in three different projects and all my Co-workers were very good,knowledgeable and helpful.The work distribution was a bit in tatters at times.Management is pretty co-operative,except for my case,i haven't at all been helped by the management in getting the hike that i deserved."
good,"You meet and discuss the way forward with the fellows, the start the technical."
good,My overall experience with IBM has been positive in nature. Job security is high. Pay is a little low. Advancement is not a management priority.
good,"Work was fulfilling in the sense that my last role was managerial/supervisory, however, the workload in general was very heavy (not at par with the compensation and benefits I was getting)."
good,In general I don't feel like IBM takes care of their existing employees as much as they should.
good,Will get Frustrated soon
good,"Boa empresa entretanto, trabalho diário chega algumas vezes a 14 horas por dia, impossível ser feliz assim, o funcionário não tem hora para lazer e nem vida com a família, além disso o salário é baixíssimo."
good,"No geral é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, dinamica e estável. Os procedimentos como documentações, são seguidos por meio de um padrão, para homogenização das informações. As dificuldades são a falta de estímulo para realizar cursos técnicos e certificações que ficam por conta do empregado; salário abaixo do mercado, benefícios oferecidos na média."
good,Bad project management and direction
good,Great students and easy to get involved with the student.
good,.learned many more ibm servers devices
good,Conference or meetings during most of the day in which prioritizing daily work was essential.
good,"If your company was a small acquisition with niche, leading edge technology you’re okay for now job-wise I would say: IBM is buying you as resource intellectual capital that IBM wants. Don't expect much help or much training in the transition, your likely going to have to figure out how ""big blue"" does business and what will be expected of you. Also don't expect IBM to give you your old benefits in your former company if they were better than what IBM offers or give you the seniority as an IBMer."
good,"Overall, IBM offers mediocre health benefits. For LTS employees, there are few additional benefits. The company culture promotes creative thought and the ability to work from home is a big plus. For LTS, there is little job mobility."
good,"* The best part of this role was that there was no typical day. Every day there was a new surprise and this was what made the role fun, exciting and challenging to do."
good,Foi meu primeiro emprego e fiquei durante 4 anos na IBM. Passei por três promoções e aprendi muito durante o tempo que estive lá. As pessoas com que trabalhei sempre foram muito legais. Porém havia muitas situações que desanimavam a todos os funcionários e isso prejudicou minha vontade de querer continuar lá.
good,"made your own schedule, worked directly with the clients. Was fun to help people"
good,Very demanding position. Month end were very telling. Often worked 12 hour days . job was out sourced
good,"Tecnicamente a experiência foi excepcional, porém o projeto é muito mal gerido, gerentes ausentes que desconhecem as insatisfações da equipe, gerando um descontentamento geral."
good,Working in AS400 servers with various clients is a good experience.
good,- Good starting salary with minimal to no raises
good,IBM is a good workplace with benefits only commensurate with industry. Employees are intelligent and committed. Matrix management and business focus changes frequently. Constant changes in management and organizations so be adaptable.
good,"IBM can be very hands off, letting the employee do their work. However, the company is set up to handle business in one way. If your job duties to not lineup to this methodology, you are on your own trying to figure out how to get anything done. Small projects have almost no place here as the focus remains on Watson, AI, and re-organizing the management hierarchy every few years."
good,very challenging environment depending of the level you enter and the area.  I am sure for junior level resources it is good but there is a lot of cut throat partners who really do not want you around if they thinking you are encroaching on their territory even if you add value.
good,"Twice a year layoffs; frequent re-organizations; constant changes in direction and leadership."
good,"a learned a good at work."
good,"Hectic job , no proper breaks , or leaves were given when required , . Partiality was there for the favourable , not recommended for calling process , however good for software devs"
good,"People don't leave the company by choice, they leave managers. IBM too easily let's go of people but not the work which means others already overwhelmed are left to catch the slack. Also, the company is moving away from remote employees into loud open offices with no privacy and too few phone rooms. For example, we listened to a manager give an evaluation to one of his employees this afternoon. He speaks in a normal tone of voice, mentions the person's name, then gives the an assessment and feedback while we were trying to work. Meetings start at 6 am and can go well into the night, on top of commutes to and from work."
good,me gusto trabajaría otra vez si las condiciones son aceptables
good,The only place I ever felt like I was just an expendable cog in a large system. A typical day was 7 am to 4 pm with a 30 minutes lunch break and two 15 minutes bathroom breaks.
good,"Trabalhei em um projeto bem ruim, não estava de acordo com a cultura da empresa"
good,"Very siloed management structure. Unimaginative top executives run the corporation like a mutual fund with strategy limited to M&A, divestiture & layoff decisions."
good,I learned some very helpful information over years of employment with IBM. Ways to better serve the Clients and other vendors when processing any claim.
good,Good work if you can stand the turnover and the insecurity of the new culture of this company. New jobs are not permanent. Layoffs are quickly replaced with new hires at a much cheaper employment rate with less experience to handle critical customer incidents. Planning and execution of projects tend to be well off track of customer expectations and often run late and well behind schedules service dates.
good,"If you were in the upper management at IBM you were one of the ""good old boys"" and was taken well care of."
good,"existe mucho el compañerismo, ya que puedes contar con todos en cualquier duda que surja."
good,"IBM is okay for people who are starting their careers. Generally, people are put in projects related to Mainframes - and no latest technologies. If you see IBM Global, it is a good place to work - good perks, benefits etc., But in India, it is not that much comfortable place to work. There are no salary hikes for the laterals - On what salary you came in, you will be in that salary for another 10 years.  "
good,"exciting environment."
good,"Even though working environment in IBM is hectic, it will be a good beginning for a fresh graduate. Things can be learned such as basic IT troubleshooting, Server access, network issue, installation and also perform multitask."
good,"IBM is a good place to work but not a  guaranteed permanent position. "
good,"Compared with my previous place of employment, the people here are interested in having relationships and hold interests beyond the office place. However, like many mega-IT companies today, the culture is one of exclusivity and tyrannical management that hold a ""what can you do for me"" mindset."
good,"Travailler pendant que les autres parlent, pris a tout faire seul."
good,"I started with the company, learned a lot being in the organization. With time started feeling that the what I serve is not getting paid off. There is also very less scope to grow and less visibillity of work."
good,"Not a good pay master but wok culture is collaborative."
good,"Would not recommend working there if you ever want a raise. I only received 1 raise in 7 years and I did the jobs of 3 people. Benefits are great, but there is too much risk of being RA'd (laid off)."
good,"Both the work and the technical team are great. Never worked with a better group of technical people.  Work was both challenging and rewarding. Almost all technical personnel encountered were A Team level, by far. "
good,"Real fun w.r.t learning. ood opportunities. "
good,"IBM may do some interesting work, but you likely wont see it.  You will find yourself in a vertical pillar and unable to interact with other pillars.  You will find endless layers of management and almost no technologists or engineers.  Be prepared for a toxic management environment."
good,"While I got selected for IBM India, I thought that this was one of the best companies but after my onboarding, I realized that while most of the employees are having a relaxed attitude to work, the project wasn't so and I ended up with a relaxed team while with daunting deadlines."
good,"IBM has a problem and its not the workforce, it is the leaders. Leadership held on to legacy franchises too long and were unwilling to cannibalize old businesses to move to new Cloud and SaaS based models. Sales culture is horrible, still operates around big deal, ELA and Mainframe when the market has moved to smaller, bite size purchases available in Cloud and SaaS solutions."
good,They can improve the workplace but they don't. You are lucky if you get an awesome manager. Career advancement is not  really the main focus. Benefits should be reviewed because they really lack in many ways. Good thing for me is that my peers are great.
good,"While One IBM is talked about, it is rarely followed.  There are too many teams from different groups fighting for the same business and/or over architecting solutions."
good,"This is a good place to work but we will never reach our expectation."
good,"Flexible working hours but do not expect salary hike."
good,"All depends on the area you will work and whom you will work for.  Your job can be very rewarding if you land on the right team.  If you are customer facing, the more challenging will be, but more rewarding."
good,"if you're a contractor, don't expect a job offer.  I have worked for IBM for several years as a contractor and they keep telling me next year I may get hired as a permanent employee.  Tired of getting strung along...looking for a new opportunity."
good,IBM is a place of constant change and growth.   You need to manage your career there and it is a bit like running for an office at the same time you are doing your job... It is very important to network.
good,"Leaders at IBM need to grow their technical skills like anyone in this fast moving domain."
good,"Need more mature people in senior management level, was surprised to see senior management level bring so self centric be it HR or operations, I think they need a session of training to teach ibm values."
good,"A company with some great people, but the Global Services division, especially GBS, can be a tough place to be.  Management does not show the concern for their people that you would want and numerous employees with significant service time (15+ years) get let go by saying, you're no longer qualified for your job."
good,It is a good company to work but management is not supportive. The trainers are good but too many calls and less agents results in high attrition rate.
good,"Work life balance is great, pay not so much.  Layoffs are common and come at a moments notice.  No opportunities for career advancement, if you apply internally be prepared to be layed off."
good,IBM is a fine organization and I would recommend it for anyone coming out of school- but entering the structure later in your career can be very challenging.
good,"No proper work life, No employee friendly but Manager friendly company. Pay hike standard is worst. No Hikes, No growth. Job safety depends if you are close to Management else worst."
good,"Process oriented company and good place to work for starters as you can work from any where,  the only issue is the stability of the job as there is no direct leadership contact who can be accounted for personal growth.  Many parallel leadership teams and no one assist in personal growth."
good,IBM is great for Software and Services as this is the direction the Corporation has elected to take. I see a bright future in these areas for the long term.
good,It is a nice place to improve yourself if you want. You will be surrounded by talents. You will feel busy and have many meetings to attend. You have to be careful about interpersonal relationships.
good,"Big company , good to work as they provide work from home and no hike. no career growth and you cannot get out of the project easily to relocate to another project."
good,"Hardest part of the job reporting to managers in other geos. The most enjoyable part of the job was SME co-workers. The issue IBM had with me was after 13 years of wokring remotely, they forced a relocation or separation."
good,"Though they do provide the basic entertainment amenities, it was very hard to keep yourself at work. You would think a company with this history would have been able to find a way to keep their employees satisfied, but from the way they tackle hiring interns, it's very hard to see how that would be true. They don't match you with any projects and just select one that THEY think best suits you. That means you are basically playing Russian Roulette with 3 months of your life. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't. I would take those odds if I get a second chance."
good,"IBM's myriad customers and essential projects mean that you can quickly experience the most exciting phases of many customers' IT projects and programs. If you like to travel and to be customer-facing, you can make countless friends here. You'll learn to apply your personal social skills to the latest technology, often helping transform enterprises that by themselves could not adopt emerging IT technology."
good,"Processes completely stabilized, Good Fun at work activities, Good training Plans. Good Growth and Movements between processes."
good,"I was young when I've started working for IBM."
good,"Constant cost reductions/retrenchment"
good,"Anyone can see the IBM share value going down every year effectively from 2012 , it's revenue share and profits have declined."
good,ibm has gotten so concerned about being PC and screaming forward with whatever next idea pooped into someone's head ( and no there was not a typo) that they forget the people working for them are human and they make business decisions that do not benefit the humans that work for them.
good,"My previous company was acquired by IBM in 2017, even thou we were told that we will be integrated into IBM that was not the case. Management did not work with us on that respect, we were working alone with no clear direction."
good,"I didn't have a real choice as we were reassigned to IBM from AT&T, as such we were kept apart for the rest of IBM.  I had access to office space in Rochester MN but little else"
good,Expert resources worked tirelessly and got things done! that's it.
good,"Was very excited and proud to work for IBM my first 10 years.  Company has drastically changed.  Very little focus on the employee and very stressful work environment. Constant cost pressures with resulting resource actions.  Always worried when ""your number"" will be picked. Company too large, constant changing strategies with no clear direction or communication to employees, too many process that get in the way of productivity and providing outstanding support for our customers. Everything is broken (tools, processes, communication) and no support by management to fix issues - even when you bring solutions forward.  "
good,"Too big to move quickly, too many layers at the top.  Bureaucracy hinders the ability to grow quickly and meet client needs.  Poor customer experience, mostly due to horrible communication within IBM."
good,"Very short staffed so every member of staff including management are over worked and underpaid which makes for a poor atmosphere."
good,"Taken Interview in JAVA/J2EE and started working on shell scripting ."
good,"Tons of resources available and clearly a commitment to IT Systems, even if you have to stomach Lotus Notes. Remote workforce, quick onboarding and off boarding."
good,"Advancing in the company,educationally and professionally is difficult ."
good,"Stable Organization"
good,IBM is going through a lot of changes.  in a few years i think this will be an awesome place to work when the dust settles.  until that time there are good challenges but also a good deal of uncertainty
good,"La empresa ofrece entrenamientos gratuitos en diferentes temáticas a través de su portal propio de aprendizaje. Cuenta con capacitaciones internas que ayudan a mejorar skills."
good,Being a reservation officer isn't that easy. It's a toxic and a tough job. You come to meet irate customers most of the time due to their delayed flights and lost baggages
good,"The company provides enough training for the job. A typical day involves logging into PC and taking calls for technical support. The calls are relatively easy, you tend to stick to the same client as you are trained specifically for them. There isn't much innovation there."
good,"good work life balance, bad management pretty much sums it up.  The engineers are decent, the management is pushed to consider only their department's narrow concerns, not the good of the company."
good,"Empresa grande e morosa, que demora nas decisões estratégicas"
good,"Salaries aren't great"
good,"There are many opinions on IBM. It really depends where you work. Short termers and lifers. "
good,"For someone new to the residential and mortgage industry. This is a great place to get your footage; and, growth potential. "
good,"IBM GBS (consulting) is huge.  That gives one an advantage when it comes to having access to things and people.  But their size and profit-driven mentality really causes them to lose sight of people.  You LITERALLY are assigned a Serial Number which is used as part of an analytical process to make determination as to  what you work on.  (Read the book Numerinati).  Again, you literally are a number to them."
good,"Lot's of technical challenges, but interesting work, a lot of remote access and collaboration. a variety of situations and environments to learn about on a daily basis"
good,When I was looking for a mentor and the first few people I asked said no.... then I knew this was not a team based culture. Too many meaningless meetings. Very political as it relates to recognition and sales compensation. Not built to be efficient or scale. Driven too much by the accountants and lawyers.
good,Executive management has no idea what they are doing. Tons of red tape when anything needs to be done. Pay was good though. Everything feels over engineered and impractical.
good,I would not recommend IBM to anyone who works in IT as I had a bad management team.  They did not understand the client's needs so we were always in a critical situation.
good,I have learned a lot working at IBM and one of the appeals of the company is the ability to move around to different opportunities across the business.  It is a big company with a proud history and it is subject to many of the pitfalls that come along with such a large bureaucracy.
good,"working at client location .. "
good,It's a great place to expose yourself to other technologies and processes.  IBM has a specific way of doing things and its a disservice not to learn them.
good,Experience depends on the client and immediate manager. Both client and IBM wants to keep the cost down nowadays which risks many senior resources lately. Career growth might be limited with long term clients and depends on manager. Keep upto date in technology all the time.
good,"Great learning environment"
good,big company with a lot of internal politics and red flags which prevent you as a developer fully release your potential and be much more efficient... the wages are ok
good,"IBM was going through massive layoffs while I began my career with them, which resulted in a lack of job security for many people. Other than that, I enjoyed working with all of my coworkers and learned a good deal."
good,IBM is a great traditional company trying to find itself. Revenue is not growing which is difficult for any company. They have some cool projects to work on but you have to be aware and prepared that it could end at any minute.
good,"I spent 23 years at IBM but due to creating hiring practices and myriad employee types I was left with nothing but a pension equivalent to 1 years pay.  The only way to succeed it seems was to work on credentials and advancement with no apparent contribution.  I learned that it doesn't pay to keep fixing the product you are assigned to, leave it and move on.  There was a great deal of wonderful work being done, and always opportunities for improvement.  Some people can excel."
good,"Th employee has freedom to work on any project."
good,US based hardware is service at a cost.  There is nothing more to report do your homework about the new software directions. IE RedHat acquired by IBM.
good,"Bad management,  don't give pay raise. Managers favor ppl. Work hard but don't get recognized. Some mangers micromanage. Pto allowable was good. Pretty good at getting request time off."
good,"Tightly bound by process. There is a high value placed on metrics rather than end-to-end customer care. Strict imposition of time restraints placed on service desk agents invoke a culture where agents do the absolute minimum, or in some cases lead the customer into a path of least resistance to end the contact with the customer."
good,"Supporting multiple state agencies on multiple unix platforms. A majority of the work was repetitive tasks, but there were some interesting research related projects that I loved being involved in."
good,"Worldwide Company, Lots of training available, no job advancement opportunities in this position, indecisiveness in management. Manager only contacted me twice in 2 years."
good,"Successful companies look after their people, happy people want to and deliver excellence to their customers, happy customers results in happy stakeholders."
good,"Unfortunately with the ongoing and extensive lay-offs and the inability to promote within, IBM is a challenging company to work for the majority of the employees.  It is extremely disappointing on how this company executed this transition in North America."
good,"not much technical advancement, takes plenty of patience and bootlicking to grow. Technical growth is highly restricted. Too much dependency on internal products - outdated"
good,Luego de obtener una beca continue trabajando y fue una gran experiencia en mis inicios
good,"Been with the company for 5 years .... Always lots of layoffs and compensation isn't that great, which means morale is very low."
good,"There are some good managers at IBM, I've been lucky and had a couple of them. Co-workers are great. IBM has no loyalty to employee's. Staff is more often then not spread to thin. One employee responsible for one off tasks that causes a problem when he/she leaves the company."
good,"I had little interaction with IBM.  Worked directly with client.  At the time Diageo was great, but I hear from friends it's not so great anymore.  4 more characters"
good,The work shift i was assigned to was good. I had a fun experience learning new things during work with the help of my colleagues. The environment is nice and comfortable to work with. I learned more about being a manufacturing technician. My colleagues are fun people to be with that makes the job more enjoyable.
good,IBM Egypt provides many resources to learn and it has many portals and access for external websites but this can be done only if you have not loaded by your daily tasks in your project and this really is a big challenge in IBM. This is because there is some entity in IBM is a time utilization oriented.
good,"Self-service everything, zero support, limited resources, bogged down by layers of administration.  Difficult to compete with other nimble players who have figured out how to execute despite bureaucracy."
good,"Started off as a great place to work, inclusive culture, team events and many performance related benefits. Recently the whole atmosphere has changed, too much off-shoring, de-skilling of long serving staff, no real incentive to perform"
good,"I learned a lot working for IBM and really enjoyed my time there.The benefits and pay are great. They gave me the opportunity to travel, work with the largest companies in the world, and meet a lot of great people."
good,Not a great place to start your career. Lots of old fashioned thinking and little opportunity for constructive criticism of management and strategy. Don't expect to be listened to.
good,"Work hours are flexible and hence helps keep balance between work and personal life. I cannot speak for entire IBM, but in my team we have to multitask as there is lot of work but few team members. Campus is nice and so is the cafeteria."
good,"A great Name IBM, a really competitivo environment, where it was real difficult to show your competences, talents, it was always necessary to have a great Indication of someone well known inside the institution to be ale to achieve something"
good,The superlab was a great place to start but many QA engineers were replaced by Contractors. Difficult to find a place and remain relevant. Department was later sold to Lenovo.
good,"Good benefits, always in fear of lay offs following the down quarters of revenue.  Time off for work/life balance is fantastic, plenty of good people to enjoy working with."
good,"Horrible working under those conditions"
good,"Mucha jefatura innecesaria, no se puede trabajar tranquilo, siempre es bajo presion."
good,"Process oriented company. Everywhere we need to follow process. For applying leaves, attendance, every hour has to be minutely planned and give the actual end of every week. Justify a minute extra work."
good,"Opportunity to learn and use new technologies. Gained experience in developing enhancements to Tivoli Provisioning Manager, IBM Cloud Automation Manager, and Webspherre."
good,To be discussed during an interview process. I'd rather discuss this in person.Unfortunately this data is delivered with more enthusiasm in person. I thank you in advance.
good,Most support positions are moving away from IBM as it is becoming a service company.  The culture is moving to young and fresh out of college.  This is great if you are building a career.  Not so much if you want to make a difference.  The best thing about the job is the flexibility to work from home if need be.
good,"IBM is a very good organization to work with.It helps one to maintain the Work and Life Balance.The Project manager and other team members are very helpful and the environment is very healthy."
good,"30+ years of sales experience selling to Fortune 100 companies.  Proven track record of identifying, developing and closing significant revenue in major accounts.  Positioned my self as a problem solver to meet client business objectives and establish enduring client relationships.  "
good,temp job with no benefits and poor pay. They allow a lot of overtime. Management is great but there is no room for growth. You receive a raise after training.
good,Massive bureaucracy and conflicting objectives between separate lines of business.  Intense focus on closing deals versus delivery quality and customer success.
good,Malgrado il passaggio dal gruppo WPP/GroupM (cessione ramo d'azienda) ho potuto mantenere le mie mansioni già in essere.
good,"Company has horrible HR practices."
good,"Execute and continue...essentially do your job and with a low enough profile, you fly under the radar for as long as you need."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is coming into work and interacting with a fun bunch of people in the team, and the fact that you get to learn something new everyday."
good,Career advancement is very slow. They only care about your utilization. They don't mind the value of an employee nor their contribution to the company.
good,The environment is such that there are different programming language and hence you need to be flexible to be able to adapt to  different language. you must also be able to work with colleagues from different countries.
good,Company is sending jobs oversea. Some jobs are secure others are not. Doing a good job does not always keep you safe from resource adjustments or outsourcing.
good,"100 % travel Monday to Thursday"
good,"Great first line people at IBM."
good,"IBM (Kolkata, India offices) was great place to work during 2008-2011. But gradually management change around 2012 and it impacted us. It was really fun work place and I personally feel proud to be part of IBM earlier. However new management started taking poor decision and mostly these are against employees benefit. In IBM used to pay very very less salary comparing other companies. "
good,"Nice place to work, Scope for learning, Hands on experience on new technologies . Learnt How to manage team as i was in Floor support role. Don't have any comments on Management."
good,"IBM is a good place to build your career. However, there didn't seem to be long term growth. I was impacted by a layoff and not offered any positions within the company. You could apply, but we're special in the system."
good,"the work environment is very Laid back , and flexible hours are good for working parents , it hard to move up in the company ,, the company does provide some skill training , however on the job training could be better for new employees"
good,"Recently there have been notifications of targeted redundancy programs across the business.  We still have the same amount of work but now there are fewer people to do it."
good,"Lot's of talented people here, but direction of projects and work are often changed or done without taking customer's needs in mind. Management doesn't have a pulse on what the day to day workers do."
good,"Overall rating  3* "
good,"Its a Call Center, not a lot to say. Very clean and it was awesome to be able to work with Apple products on the job. However it was very disorganized and a lot of training classes and campaign changes were very rushed."
good,"-	Major role is to responsible for DBS bank IT operation"
good,Its my first entry into banking sector as the team is serving DBS and i have learn alot. It was tough and every man for himself. A typical work week is minimum 60 hours and above and weekends are not exempted.
good,IBM is a good company to work for but you can expect to travel 100% of the time.  Much of their workforce is outsourced and can be a quite difficult to get team meetings scheduled but overall it's a good company to work for.
good,"There is always something to do, the work day goes by fast.  Management is constantly changing, however the competitive landscape and products are changing as well.  Great place to learn new process and products."
good,Ett bra företag att börja sitt yrkesliv i. Öppnar framtida dörrar.
good,"My experiences is limited to the job description, division, department, and city I was located before my layoff.  IBM is a huge corporation with many divisions in all different areas of business technology."
good,IBM is a good place to work as long as your team and reporting manager is fine. co-ordination and collaboration is much followed here. Employee recognition is focused.
good,"IBM believes too much in keeping the management team at the cost of losing the brilliant minds in the technical team. I did enjoy working at IBM as I learnt quite a lot, but during my short time there, there were about 4 different periods of downsizing where several top talents were let go."
good,There was always a new project I had to do once I finished my work. I enjoyed the work I did and most of the people I met. I met some of my good friends there.
good,"Lo Bueno: "
good,"was good to start but the salary and bonus were not great , good work life balance. good working environment. job advancement is slow , good job culture"
good,"I like working here. However, due to remote working position, there is not a lot of face-to-face interactions with peers and managers. Resource Action is enforced every quarter, thus, overall working environment is very stressful due to heavy workloads."
good,La empresa no cuenta con mecanismos que afiancen y mejoren la cultura organizacional
good,"Absolutely not for smart people. Working from home is the best benefit, otherwise it has no benefits. Low pay, no job security. My job was cut and transferred to India after I have developed very intelligent ways to automate/monitor etc."
good,"Learned a lot of how technology is helping shape the different industries. "
good,"It's all about hitting the numbers. Hiring freezes, no raises or bonuses, etc. if the numbers are not what is desired. It is not a people centric culture."
good,"Over worked to meet unrealistic commitments, fired if there is a gap. No ongoing training provided, all employees responsibility. Will drop if rather than finding new position even thought there are other needs across the company. Not a people oriented company."
good,"A empresa tem muitos pontos positivos, porém a área de recrutamento estava bastante conflituosa naquele momento."
good,Job itself was fine. Good work environment. There was a pay cut and furlough for contractors and that rubbed me the wrong way but that's the business.
good,Nice place to work on developing your career. Did not like that my bonus was based on NON-Revenue performance but solely on my Manager's judgement of my individual contribution to the team.
good,"I had an opportunity to on-board with IBM in 2014 coming from an IBM Business Partner in the Enterprise Content Management space. I did come in at what I thought was a competitive salary as a Lead Development Sales Representative. The first year we absolutely killed our numbers and the Management was hands off and more supportive and coached the entire team on new lead generation and relationship development skills. "
good,"Generally, working at IBM was productive. There was room to learn and develop professionally. The work environment, quite conducive. "
good,"Lack of responsibilities, no training, not a lot of leading/inspiring by management (which is good in a way because it forced me to solve problems on my own and dig deeper into the company/position/tools in order to understand, zero culture, pay was good, health insurance, easy 9am-6pm, not much room as a PMA to advance in the company, but you can take on new projects/responsibilities within the position. I had to leave because I was relocating. I would have stayed in order to learn more within the position. Could have taken more advantage of management's knowledge if I knew the right questions to ask!"
good,"The work environment in my sector of IBM is dismal. It doesn't seem IBM is selling this function anymore. IBM is focused on other services. Once work is gone,, then this site will be closed."
good,IBM is an excellent company to work with. IBM is known for its stringent governance controls and processes eveolving around every Business function. I gained lot of knowledge working in IBM.
good,IBM é uma empresa para se iniciar a carreira. Não valorizam experiências que veem de fora ou que não vão de encontro a cultura da empresa.
good,"Sneaky co-location strategy was essentially layouts without having to pay full severance. "
good,Staff in IBM are quite helpful and friendly to help each other out. Other department also quite helpful as we work as a team when we faced issues/problems for users.
good,"As a level two analyst, I would assist customers with special deployments at best buy stores. The job was cut throat and no one works as a team. Everyone is out for themselves."
good,"IBM was getting rid of the long-term salaried employees and hiring either contractors or Long Term Supplemental employees.  As a LTS employee, there was just base benefits offered.  There was no career development plans, no employee evaluations, etc."
good,Overall it was a good experience if you are looking for a large company to work for. There was limited direction from management with a lack of account territory definition and support.
good,"Nothing is consistent, and too much micro managing. Hardly ever had one on ones with manager. Not good at communicating changes to employees. No work/life balance."
good,IBM is a company you can enhance your skills. It is a knowledge hub. It is the company which defines methods and processes for any new technology which come to market.
good,"Good work environment & Flexible."
good,"Nice place to work."
good,"After years of great career advancement and lateral moves, IBM held a recent push to have a third of the sales team be to new-to-IBM people. Long-standing employee-management relationships were severed, and management-directed external hires prevented those relationships from continuing. The last two years were nothing like the first 15."
good,"My Dept was sold to Lenovo, this created a stagnancy within the department. We were underfunded and undervalued as employees. This coupled with a division of workforce between contractors doing the same job as ""full blue"" employees led to a poor working environment. I would not recommend IBM as a worthwhile employer."
good,I would not recommend IBM.  Their Federal practice (where I worked) was not well organized and not well managed.  There were constant down size activities (called resource actions) where folks were targeted (myself included) not by performance (I was 131% of my quota) but by some sort of matrix based upon band level.
good,"la giornata lavorativa inizia alle 8 della mattina per concludersi il più delle volte alle 18 senza particolari soddisfazioni in ambito lavorativo. Incremento di venditori ma, di contro, una notevole riduzione di operativi con sovraccarico di lavoro arrivando ad operare le richieste sempre in urgenza"
good,More on first point of contact receiving calls to provide basic support to our clients. Everyday same issue and task. always have free food and activities
good,"If you follow others then this company is good."
good,"I was hired while IBM was taking over IT support for AECOM."
good,Not enough US based resources.  Far too offshore.   Also depends greatly on your client and their contract with IBM.  Zero bonus to speak of for my side of IBM.
good,"Professional environment with appreciation for talented and skilled employees. Training offered supported, and provided to interested employees. "
good,"Worked with some great, smart people.  Traveled all over world doing a variety of work, was given very large projects with the expectation and trust it would get done on time.   But as the saying goes, what have you done TODAY for IBM?   "
good,"IBM has a good work culture it is very good for Freshers to start."
good,"I really enjoyed working with IBMers. We would parachute into a client site, identify the pain points, analyze the problem, and form a solution that meets all the business, functional and organizational requirements. It was satisfying, plus I got to travel and work with deeply intelligent and focused people."
good,Management and in terms of work security require attention as they keep changing the business process and affecting the career progression of inside sales. The good part being IBMers you have lots of training provided and the hardest being in this position to get enough support from management to excel in you job activities and the long sales cycle process Workplace culture nice people around.
good,too many new people that don't know how the company works; too many people with longevity that have forgotten how to work hard and effectively on the right things.
good,"Wouldn't work for the ""cognitive process services"" at the site in Tulsa as they only have one client left after summer of 2018. Outlook not good for business processing outsourcing with IBM."
good,"Executive and management staff weren't adequate.  The executives were over paid and under qualified.  Tons of strategic blunders.  However, the people and developers were talented and good people."
good,"Executive and management staff weren't adequate.  The executives were over paid and under qualified.  Tons of strategic blunders.  However, the people and developers were talented and good people."
good,"In Egypt, it is not the best place to work, low salaries compared to other companies in the same job role, almost no benefits except good medical insurance."
good,Respect for the individual went out the window years ago in the Fishkill plant you were  just a number they were trying to get rid of. After giving the business away to Global Foundries things just got worse and I decided get out.
good,Management was unable to find or win projects like they use to so they laid many of us off before they would have to pay the 401K company match with little compensation for the years we were there.
good,Busy on meetings.  Tools don't work.  Can not get the support needed from the account to perform job.  No salary increases.  Benefits are expensive.  I work at home that is the best part.
good,"The typical day is 8 am to 8 pm and usually consists of one urgent matter being overturned for the next urgent matter.  Urgent matters would always take precedence over the normal workload you were aassigned, but normal workload would still be expected on time."
good,IBM has a long solid contract relationship with GOC. Most employees are under paid and over assigned. Intimidating management style. Employees are expected to provide their own equipment.
good,"IBM is definitely trying to transform their business which is causing a lot of pain.  Many of the decisions are strategically sound, but unrealistic execution deadlines has hurt the business and people's careers. "
good,Entreprise permettant le développement personnel pour le bien de tous.
good,"A great place to work. A really large organization with stringent processess in place. While decision making was extremely slow, it gave me an opportunity to work in a highly process oriented org."
good,"IBM has great benefits and the work itself is engaging and challenging, from a design and innovation perspective.  All projects are enterprise level and complex and everyone is very smart and top of their class.  However, the company culture is the most discouraging part of working at IBM, and leadership opportunities are far and few between. Because of the size of the company, the systems and infrastructure are a big part of the job, and slow down the work environment tremendously."
good,"I enjoyed my time at IBM and there are a lot of talented and friendly IBMers that I've worked with over the years.  While innovative, IBM is too big and disjointed to keep pace with the fast pace of today's technology trends."
good,"Aprendi bastante coisa, cultura da empresa boa, bom local de trabalho, porém com pouca oportunidade de crescimento"
good,Good place to work while they need you.   The only issue is they are constantly looking to change and do not include current employees.  Very often purging entire departments and reducing benefits
good,The company invest on the training and learning development on their workforce.The are not a good pay master however they do have job security and less politics.
good,"Eine Reorganisation folgt auf die nächste, Mitarbeiter werden weniger als Menschen sondern teilweise als reine Kostenfaktoren gesehen."
good,"IBM is good place to work for,with lots of self learning opportunities.I feel its most flexible company in current market."
good,"Excellent work environment which provides an equal opportunity towards job advancement. However, the job/work starts with off with a contract and rarely offers full-time/permanent job/position."
good,IBM does not value it's employees. Frequent lay-offs several times per year. First level manager's have no say in what their departments needs for resources. Most work sent overseas
good,IBM Global services took over Daksh eServices and is into BPO. Culture and brand value is good however you may need to allure your boss at times for being considered for appraisals and promotions.
good,"I left workplace because my contract came to an end. It would be good if IBM Canada hired outside of contracts."
good,Se voce trabalha com paises de latin america vai precisar fazer muita hora extra e trabalhar na virada do ano.
good,"IBM has changed drastically over the years. It changed from a place you wanted to be, to a place you would rather not be."
good,"My experience with IBM was mixed. As an employee, I worked remotely 100% of the time. As a result, it is difficult to build relationships, gain insight into corporate direction, and perhaps set yourself apart from the pack. So depending where you are in your career it can be good or bad. If you are not looking for rapid advancement, then I see it as a good fit. Company is very supportive and provides sufficient flexibility for a reasonable work/life balance."
good,Conocimientos sobre ordenadores y trato con el cliente.
good,"Field personnel and techs that were contracted to specific sites for support were not treated as everyone else was.  There were many times that techs were passed by for raises, advancements, or any positive recognition even when deserved."
good,"Enjoyed the team I worked with, but there is no job security (annual rounds of layoffs, when profit numbers aren't met) and workplace morale is quite poor.  Not much motivation to go above and beyond when you aren't rewarded for it (bonuses and raises seemed very few and far between), and when it feels like you're just as likely to get the axe as the guy down the hall who is doing the bare minimum."
good,"It is good to work at IBM, who want to easy life and tendency to lead or manage the team."
good,"I started as a part time employee here. And the transition  to being a full time one is not that certain because it depends on the number of work load. During my tenure, I rendered the normal working hours which is 8 hours per day but then as time passes by it suddenly decreases, so I have opted to look for a full time job. Our day to day responsibilities revolve around  the internal audit of reimbursement claims of IBM UK employees, we are assigned to audit a heavy work load each day. Having this, it helped me develop a good working plan/schedule each day in order to accomplish a lot of tasks in a short period of time."
good,You could be RAd at any time without warning. IBM is not what it used to be. The new CEO wants the share holders to see profit by manipulating the number of employees but the revenue keeps declining every year.
good,IBM Research has the deepest bench of latent technologies and solutions waiting to see the light of day; Let IBM Research lead and not the poor execution and marketing of the sales team
good,IBM is behind in the times in this area.  They could leverage Watson and other technology to compete - but instead go the cheapest route.  Many layoffs in the USA with no logic except to cut costs - those remaining have to try to pick up the workload.
good,"Work From Home and flexible work environment makes IBM good company to work "
good,"IBM is known for its job security for the permanent employees. However  the internal growth is excruciatingly slow and biased. Though it depends on the clients / accounts your supporting, in general the work stress is less compared to few other companies."
good,during a typical day I would carry a hot phone that would ring when ever there was an electrical problem that needed my help. If there were no emergencies I would do preventative maintenance on the generators or on the switch gear units. I was responsible for any electrical repairs onsite.
good,"I have learn so much from this company that how we have to balance the personal and professional life because there was lot of pressure in job, so i learn to balance both of them."
good,"Big Blue - huge. Monolithic. Lumbering. All great descriptors of what it's like to work with and inside of the firm."
good,Earlier years in IBM was an opportunity to learn and grow as well as evolve with the corporation.  Later years were more hectic with ever changing direction.
good,"Since I worked for this company for so long I had the opportunity to learn a lot but was seldom recognized by management for my contributions to the business. Culturally, when I hired on there was a  company policy that stated ""respect for the individual"" which they later discarded. Toughest part; politics, most enjoyable part would be some of the really great people that I met and got to work with."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"I had a great time, learned a lot and was happy there. Worked 60 hour work weeks, was given good projects to work on, was happy overall. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Ironically the entity lacked cutting edge and innovation despite its heritage, lagging behind competition for quite a while.  This resulted in its eventual acquisition by Hitachi in 2002."
good,"Responsibilities under Fixed Asset Domain, Branch accounting (Relating to Company contracts) & Payroll Reporting"
good,"desperate working place, it been more than five years, the company got into rigorous cost cutting, All Employees facilities are taken out, day by day its going to be pathetic"
good,"Empresa muito boa para currículo e crescimento de carreira.Porém a cultura de trabalho prega horas absurdas de 10-16 horas de trabalhos diárias, principalmente em entregas de projetos.Dependendo do perfil do profissional, pode ser uma boa escolha, principalmente para o ganho de dinheiro extra com as horas extras trabalhadas."
good,"I have learn a lot about work ethics here, which improved my self confidence and allowed me to work in this kind of environment. IBM is like training period of ""ARMY"". It tells you how to work."
good,Great lower level management.  Senior management has created a culture of employees at every level waiting to be fired no matter what their job performance is.
good,Co-operative staff. Good work culture. Variable target on each day. Daily interaction with Manager. Daily reporting to Team Leader. Escalating issue directly to Client.
good,"A typical day at work other than lunch includes scrum meeting, writing pseudo code, work towards the task assigned, uploading the pseudo code to Box repository, push the code to Git repository EOD"
good,"The management assembled a good diverse team of programmers and engineers globally located. Management allowed time to ramp up the knowledge and skills to work and develop this new protect of cloud engineering. This project is to transition DevOps on call to the Cloud Engineers to handle most of the alerts and general problems as discovered, becoming more pro active and management could see this was having a positive impact on resolving problems more quickly."
good,"Good company to work and learn all the time , great to work and maintain relationship .Good learning scope exposed.Flexible and good place for development."
good,"The Good:"
good,IBM is a complex organization.  There's a policy or procedure for everything which makes it difficult to get things done in an efficient manner.  Client service is lacking because of this.
good,Work is manageable and trainings are accessible. Technical challenges depends mostly with the kind of projects. People in my team are easy to work with and we can still manage to have time for team buildings and trainings. There are lots of opportunities in IBM.
good,"I currently work for Seterus, Inc. an IBM company.  Handling inbound and outbound calls the first four hrs per day.  Last four hours of the day I assist agents with questions in regards to their calls that they are handling.  I assist my Team Lead with daily reports and coaching agents."
good,"IBM is a great place to learn and get certified and looks good on the resume.  You get your hands wet with lots of technology and gain a wide range of technical experience.  However, the company places NO value in their most experienced employees as witnessed by the number of layoffs of upper level techs.  This I believe has been a cost saving measure for the company.  They bring in youth to pay less and cut you after years of experience.  My advice, stay for 3 years, touch as much as you can, get certified and leave before they layoff."
good,"For a fresher ,its a good place to begin your career and lay a foundation. IBM does provide special amenities for female employees . So that's a plus."
good,They have a total lack of respect for technical workers as evidenced by them scouring the earth for the cheapest labor that ends up being substandard.  They do not want any US Labor force at all
good,Upper management has absolutely NO concern for employees.  They are only concerned with meeting their targets and getting their bonuses.  Constant cost cutting and doing more with less.
good,"Management changes too often.  Always moving the bouncing ball.  Managers come and go.  Benefits were only ok.  Not good at advancement.  Money is the bottom line, not service to customers."
good,"I worked from home the last 3.5 years at IBM, and it was a enjoyable job.  The management did not always work together.  The upper management was about numbers and often put it's people last.  Each day was different at IBM, I managed hiring for 5-7 projects often and each one had different requirements.  The hardest part of my job was managing personnel in different parts of the country."
good,"Not good for professional growth as the increment structure is very bad. I could not put myself in Manager is always right culture, if you are good at it then you can climb the ladder in IBM."
good,"Fué un proyecto corto, alianza IMB-Gobierno, para la capacitación de personas de distintos niveles educativos en el área del desarrollo de software. Duró muy poco, ignoro los detalles."
good,Possibilità di lavorare con i maggiori clienti nazionali ed internazionali
good,Way to much middle management.  Ciaos is ensuing when it seems communication is not very clear on where they really are going.  They will eventually land on their feet--but the 3 years of this transition is going to take another 3 years at least.
good,"If you're willing to sacrifice personal life, there is a tremendous push in billing billing and 44 is the minimum number of hours per week required to take vacation without affecting your performance. Oh you need to consider the 10 to 12 hours traveling per week."
good,"Unfortunately, there seems to be much disconnection above your immediate manager on what is really important."
good,"It's a great place to start one's career to learn business skills.  However, it's process oriented, which makes it cumbersome to complete activities and get the job done."
good,I've given the chance to know more about my abilities and talents when I was working in IBM. They teach me and trained me well in information technology aspects.
good,"Offered initial 4-month contract to perform same duties for AECOM, while IBM transitions to their IT support system. "
good,"Incredible software developers and talented people work in software development.  The opportunity for continuous learning is always present and part of the work."
good,"Is not bad nor great.  The culture is of a company without identity, they are pretending to be a startup and is not working. There's a lack of vision and that's reflected on the constant layoff and quarter results."
good,Once an employee centric company now a profit margin based company. High profile company laser focused on profitability and reduction of expense. It does provide exceptional employee education.
good,"My rating is average, good for non serious people and who are really serious with respect to their career then it would be difficult for them to be in this company for long time ."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the individual teams and clients, both onshore and offshore teams were very helpful and supportive on projects.  If you like fast pace, increasing responsibilities and opportunities you will find it here"
good,"Work life balance is good. We have timing flexibility."
good,"IBM is a good job for anyone that is trying  to get their foot in the door. As for long term, the company lacks the ability to take care of their employee's. Year after year more is expected from you but never rewarded for what you have done in the past."
good,"good work life balance, low compensate,"
good,In my career I have had a lot of opportunity for career progression in many different areas of IBM.  IBM has high expectations of their employees and there is a high expectation that you work until the job is done.  As a services company this helps with customer satisfaction and has built a culture where everyone helps everyone else and no problem in insurmountable.  IBM is a good place to work and it's exciting to be on the leading edge of technology.
good,"Your job very much dependent on project or process you are in, very hung organization spread across multiple countries so exposure to diversity across the world make IBM great."
good,I was working for a great company but we were then outsourced to IBM and the culture changed quickly. IBM's goal was to employ 80% contractors which resulted with the company losing several of their key strong employees.
good,"Es una empresa en la que se valora muy poco el trabajo de cada uno de los empleados, ya que hay muy poca comunicacion de los jefes inmediatos hacia el personal y la oportunidad de crecimiento es  muy poca."
good,"The company is under a great direction to reduce it size, and offshore most jobs. From the CEO and the board are trying to sell off divisions that were profitable to boost the bottom line along with bi-yearly layoff including staff from cloud."
good,"IBM is a great company trying to transform to the cloud and shed legacy culture, people, and software applications.  Very good people, but too much legacy getting in the way fo progress"
good,Since the process where I was working was a newly transitioned process so it had a lot of challenges as there was a high pressure of meeting client's expectations. Though the Organization is very structured and good firm to work with.
good,"IBM provides a flexible work environment, but in my experience it lacks local growth opportunities. It has become clear to me that I need to seek opportunities within IBM, but outside of my current center if I want to growth my career."
good,"Typical big company.  Will do what's best for them.  Compensation is mediocre.  It was okay career, but stressful.  Yearly layoffs.  Never knowing when you will be selected."
good,"When I came to IBM there was respect for the individual.  The work was challenging and there was an upward career path.  Over the years that deteriorated drastically, until my job was finally sent to India one year ago."
good,"Good Company to Start you Career - lots of learning and trainings. "
good,"If you are looking for a breadth of education and experiences, IBM offers a lot of both.  However, you do need to be a self-starter and self-promoter in order to take best advantage of IBM's opportunities."
good,Good place to work but sometimes policies dont get followed rigorously leading to employee dissatisfaction. Nice ambience.............................................
good,"6-year Senior Level IBM Veteran"
good,"If you support and work with a great team, which I am fortunate to do so, a career at IBM is manageable."
good,"Work place is very good here, here i have learned a lot about wireless and WDS technology. Team work and support is very good.Though i am working here but i want to change my carrier from education sector any industry sector."
good,Nice company to work with when it comes to settlement in life and career. Lots opportunities available based on one's interest and management support.
good,"Working remotely with IBM UK and Customers located throughout   the EU was a great learning experience."
good,"Good learning opportunity, flexible, pay could be more. For women it is a great place to work. "
good,"In my present role, I mostly perform in-depth analysis on Utilization Data for a very large number of population across Geographies. I am the team lead who helps to standardize and optimize reports for faster and timely delivery."
good,"Work life balance -excellent"
good,"Worked with some good account managers and clients, Had an opportunity working at multiple sites. Need some focus on people development and Job rotation."
good,"Opportunity to work on different project and client"
good,It has been a very good experience with IBM. Good place to work with since they provide working from home. But it depends upon project to project.
good,"The workplace culture is challenging with lots of work, there was a lot of learning and leadership responsibility given. There was long hours of work involved too."
good,An usual day at office was quite dull and boring. The setup was typical of a multi-national IT company. The kind of project that I was engaged in was also quite archaic and not much innovation was in scope.
good,"work is fine, management is supportive."
good,"IBM has survived for over a 100 years in the tech space which is quite an accomplishment.  Many companies would have faltered many times along the way.   Sure they had their challenges, but they do want to stay a relevant brand."
good,"No diversity in teams and management too much work with lack of scope and budget, Delay in Releases s=due to uncertainity on team members list and Commitment from management."
good,"IBM is my first IT company where I learned complete the process flow of an IT company . Learned how to deal with clients and manage the business .  IBM is a place having a flexible work culture ."
good,For contractor the crucial management that IBM has I must say. Because working after 2yrs your manager didn't recommned you to upper management even when you'll give your 100% in your job.
good,Always a lot of work and constant change. Lot's of reorganization and can be difficult to navigate.  Good opportunity for professional development but not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"executives are directed to move jobs to off shore countries.  Some areas are hit harder than other, but all in all the presence in the U. S. is decreasing."
good,"Complex and often chaotic! "
good,Good company to work with we can explode our career in many ways with multiple opportunities. It's a good company for freshers as well. Enjoyed a lot working in this company from the past one and half year looking forward to work with multiple business units
good,"1.We are like prioritization time management."
good,A typical day at work involved fixing of change requests as per priority as it was a maintenance project. Worked majorly in java and jsp technologies with oracle at back end.
good,"No hikes, Higher managers are very lazy"
good,"IBM has gone through several changes and everytime it does, your job is always at risk. I would consider going to another firm especially if you are planning to do consulting with them."
good,"I have learned the management skills, as I handle a team in India and Philippines. Handling a cluster of accounts, remembering each process and multi-tasking. Following up with different people from other region, is hard due to the timing. Work for each day is planned and accomplished apart from the adhoc request received."
good,"Colleagues were amazing individuals."
good,"You learn a lot, not the best chance of advancing. Money is ok, managers are very friendly good place to start out. When they move you to nights it is very unfortunate."
good,"IBM is a good Company- average..but not a great company."
good,"Brand name does matter but very low pay masters and turned to be a government company,cannot go in details ,co workers are great, management is also good"
good,"Average company today Once was outstanding American company"
good,Growing pains with technology shifts (cloud) have created a frantic management style with regards to software licensing and hardware sales.  The rapid growth of new service providers have caused significant issue in Global Services.  I do think they will go through some more significant restructuring(s) and will emerge as a much smaller company.
good,"Good place to work for fresh graduates to gain experience. Good chance to move within the company but progress is slow."
good,"Learnt lot of things in technical and functional too. "
good,"Even though IBM appears to be a front runner with technology, the internal processes will get in the way. They are consistently trying to find ways to save the company money to improve the bottom line - including sending work to locations that are less expensive to operate.  Employee satisfaction was low.  The culture may have changed over the years, but as a large organization with thousands of employees, it is hard to change quickly."
good,"Productive work"
good,"Working during weekends, we have a unity among the team and hence i love the job i am doing. Environment is good. Learnt new things, how to manage during difficult times."
good,The only constant is change and unfortunately it is currently so disruptive it is counter productive and demotivating. Employees are in flux with perpetual job insecurity.
good,Have worked in IBM  for 5 year period. Lucky to be working on a very cohesive team and  have the luxury of flexibility  to attend appointments.
good,"Trained me well, but advancements and opportunities are few. I enjoyed much of my early career when IBM was working hard to grow the services division.  But with the globalization of the workforce, opportunities have diminished."
good,The very first and I am sure.. Last pathetic place I had ever worked for..It wouldn't be tough to work there if they would paid good.. But salaries and overtime.. Were paid like labours
good,"IBM has provided me with many opportunities. I have no complaints. The environment is very fast paced and highly matrixed. Absolute focus is demanded on the job 24x7x365. Finding a balance for a productive personal life is very challenging."
good,I worked in IBM 1 year before I setup my own company. I can say that they are very old fashioned. It is really very difficult to do what you are promised in the job interview.
good,I have learned that internal hierarchy is highly graded and very difficult to navigate into such complex organization
good,IBM is branded company with good infrastructure and lot of tools and technologies but only this need to put improve in terms of client deliverables which is more critical in day to day business world.
good,"i have learnt a lot on Client sites, technically as well as personally."
good,"IBM is a known technical giant with different branches. "
good,IBM is a large company that presents both challenges and opportunities.  Challenges are getting recognized properly for ones accomplishments whereas the opportunities are related to the large amount of resources at the company's disposal.
good,"With IBM there was always an opportunity to take on more responsibilities and learn new things."
good,Employ benefits are very less in IBM .More over lower management team are not capable of reviewing and managing the resources .The salary structure was not based on employee experience and market standards .It was very less when compared to market .
good,"I learned a lot at IBM, and most of the people were fantastic. Unfortunately, the company evolved into making technical and resource decisions based on quarterly financial results. As a result, many competent individuals were shed over time."
good,"I enjoyed working with many talented people at IBM. Unfortunately, the strategy to move work offshore left most of those people with out jobs. No matter how dedicated the service given, and how many times a person saved the company money."
good,Nothing new to say excepting that I may have structured my CV incorrectly so that this application is not able to discriminate between the various headings correctly.
good,"Becomes very monotonous after a certain period of time. Difficult to change the projects and this makes it difficult to acquire knowledge about new projects and technology."
good,It all depends on your project. It depends on the rules of your client and who is the project manager. it varies from project to project. I had really fun projects and then I had really boring ones.
good,Good company but work culture is not that great. Good projects and large clients . But per employee care and value of employees at ground level is not that great .
good,"I love my co-worker and manager, they are good people to work with in IBM.  The only cons I believe is that, work and life balance is hard to manage especially when we all work from home, the demand is high to be online at all time."
good,IBM is going through significant transition.  Two issues:   1) software offerings are undefined and misunderstood by the market.  2) significant job instability.   Significant employee turn.
good,"IBM is a big corporation and you may find a lot of career opportunities there. "
good,Good work life balance being able to work for home.  But company culture is challenging with the company changing to a cloud company.  This has caused constant change for employees which is hard to be a productive employee.
good,"IBM Canada was generally a good company to work for.  Project fit in well with my military background"
good,"There was numerous opportunities to gain different experiences."
good,"You can't trust Management, they can turn there back on there written commitments."
good,My last 4 years with IBM I worded from home. It was a bit odd because I worked with a group of people that I had never met which was a first for me. I found it required a bit more effort to ensure that we were communication effectively and correctly.
good,"What was once a great company has deteriorated to a company that no longer values its employees.  It's unfortunate that employees are not as appreciated.  If the company took care of their employees, they would take care of the clients."
good,"IBM was a great place to start out as a coop and grow but now the company has lost its way and no longer values employees, investment, paying competitively, and advancement."
good,"Even though, I work from home, working hour is long, I need to work with people worldwhile."
good,Great place for work life balance.  Good teams to nature you develop your skill.  Things seem to be changing i don't know if for the good or bad.
good,my first job after my degree i will good and well good job culture and good co-workers i got. i learned about the token system in that job
good,"Very less onsite opportunity, very very less hike only good thing about IBM is flexibility."
good,Needs to revisit company values and employee values. Make the commitment to be better themselves as a business partner with all lines of business instead of just big business.
good,"After years of layoffs and cutbacks we're down to staffing levels that cannot suffer more than one sick day. Stress levels are incredibly high. The expectation is always that your name is next on the layoff list, and has been so since well before the recent economic problems."
good,"Good place to work, a lot of good people.  One issue is the multiple layers of management needed to get things done.  A lot of red tape and processes."
good,"I ended up on an over-staffed development team, and eventually was laid off during the great culling of March 2016."
good,"Good technologies."
good,"Where it lack in compensation it makes up for in work life balance. Really good benefits and very flexible work schedule, but you could lose your job at any moment."
good,"I was contracted to IBM, therefore I can't really speak on working for IBM or the job culture for its employees, except through observation."
good,"I've been with the company and haven't furthered my career or salary at all. Despite working 60+ hour weeks and meeting strenuous deliverables the revenue continues to decline and IBM continues to lay off employees. It's stressful putting so much time/effort into your work and never knowing if today is your last day."
good,"Horaire très flexibles, par contre les conditions sont moyennes."
good,good launch pad for freshers. slow growth and development. good place to start your career. good managers and team. overall good
good,"IBM is well known for it's work-life balance and flexibility and many enjoy these benefits, but for members of a few projects it is a luxury. No leaves, sick leaves or otherwise. To connect remotely, you have to get a series of approvals."
good,"IBM was once a great place to work, even in recent years. However, the senior leadership, especially in the HQ Talent function has created a culture of 'churn and burn."""
good,"Arbeiten im Home Office oder im Büro, wenn nicht beim Kunden"
good,"In my local part of the business, I spend many good years working with great, brilliant people. However, IBM has a bad habit of only valuing the parts that are ""new"" and ""future growth"", not the parts that are currently making the money, which tend to get undervalued and ignored. Also, there is a mismatch between the corporate culture the Senior Leaders (CEO, Veeps) espouse and the culture that the companies rather rigid policy structures drive everybody towards."
good,"Manque de dynamisme de l'entreprise en France"
good,Can be more stressful than it needs to be. vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvggggggggggggggggddddddddd hhhhhh ererrrr
good,"The exposure to hardcore tech is great. Unfortunately the company is going through challenging times, trying to find its way forward."
good,I took the opportunity to retire from IBM but I knew I would get another position with another firm. The new advances in Cloud technology may turn IBM's fortunes around.
good,"Work life is easy given the employee is not forced to work at managers condition. "
good,"It was a good learning experience to me, Fast paced, challenging...."
good,"The shifts are not arranged properly!"
good,"Very nice to work in IBM as the Team is very cooperative, good management and flexible timings."
good,I learn how to run a process and manage both personal as well as professional life. learn how to work in difficult situation
good,IBM is organization related to computers and machines. It provides better career options to work. it Helps to employee for better working options and other aspects.
good,"IBM, has always been a place to challenge me and make me look at things in a less linear way. I have learned a lot about how to serve the client outside of the box. However as time has increased it has become increasingly harder to stay loyal as they continue to cut funding for projects, people and ability to perform."
good,A good learning environment for newcomers. Though it can get stressful at times. The brand is the main reason to join the company. Other projects of IBM are very good.
good,I enjoyed my coworkers and management. I learned about what system administrator work is and how it differs from software development.
good,"A IBM é uma empresa que te da uma oportunidade de aprendizado incrível, onde você pode atuar em várias aréas e ter oportunidades de crescimento e mudança de carreira. "
good,"Very busy days"
good,ibm was not a horrible place to work at but the supervisors can be very petty at times especially when it comes to looking out for theirselves
good,We are not allowed to talk about anything with the company I worked for.  I can say it wasn't a stable job and I want to make a difference in peoples' lives.
good,"As a focal point for Mobility Services, my week is a buzz of activity, never quiet, fast paced and no 2 days are the same.  Typically a week would include face to face client interactions to discuss services, global or country calls and online discussions from commodity enhancements to RFP data, a lunch time service management meeting with vendors to iron out any issues or developments or negotiating budgets and costs. All this while attending to reports, emails, on-line chats and ensuring that my learning for the week is completed."
good,"Como toda empresa, há seus momentos bons e ruins, vantagens e desvantagens. Eu gostei de ter trabalhado na IBM durante 6 anos."
good,"You will learn many new software, technologies and applications"
good,"Good to work, flexible and better than other IT companies. Good Onsite opportunities. Good Friends and colleagues. Salary and Advancement should be changed."
good,Going through a very painful transition phase at the moment with focus on Cloud and Cognitive. Has done it before and will do it again :)
good,its quit good work place.the co workers are very helpful. management was good with the employee.there was lots of technical embarrassment.they allow me to do my studies with my work.they are very much supportive towards higher education there was many opportunity to grow.
good,"wonderful. I will remember all my folks till the day I die. I liked what I did, I liked the place, I liked it all, but my salary."
good,the account itself is really nice as if you are an airport agent that book their flight. fun to be work with. decent people around you.
good,"Teamwork and independent work skills are vital to performing well. The fast-paced and 'dive right in' training methods are challenging, but encourage you to learn on your own with what resources you have available to you. Departments are losing funding and rotation rates are high. There are plenty of pot lucks and events available for holidays and birthdays. The most enjoyable part of the job by far is how many applications, devices and systems you have to become familiar with because that knowledge proves to be very useful in higher level IT fields."
good,"company will not provide the salary hike"
good,Worked in a very productive manner to ensure the best possible support for our clients - this included weekends and was always available when needed to perform my system administrative functions...my bitterness stems from the lack of job security at IBM in the Global Technology Services organization....have no regrets with my overall job experience knowing that i gave 100% effort on daily basis to provide the required support in meeting client expectations...
good,"For most of my tenure at IBM I had a good experience and was treated fairly by IBM.  Some of the smartest people you will ever know work at IBM.  It was a pleasure learning from them and using much of what they taught me."
good,"Good technologies. no hikes. no motivation. Otherwise it is fine."
good,Management is efficient & provides a lot of scope for skill building & career growth. Being a global company gave lot of opportunities for client interactions & experience.
good,"IBM expects you to put work first and life second. It is like working for a startup, but without the opportunity for a large pay-out in the end."
good,My prior company outsourced IT jobs to IBM.  IBM then proceeded to outsource/ offshore these jobs and laid off the original employees.  Difficult to support the client under these circumstances.
good,IBM heeft een goede reputatie. Je kunt als werknemer je al snel begeven in een internationale omgeving.
good,I have no intention of writing a review on any previous employer for your benefit or anyone else's.  This is just a forum for complaints in my opinion.
good,"It is a good company. "
good,"With the constant changes and Resource Allocation (RA) almost on a quarterly basis gives many a unsettled feeling that no matter how hard they work, their positions may be outsourced or eliminated"
good,"Its a good company however since last three years, the company is not paying attention to the employees. No bonus, no hike. Rating system is very old, and company don't want to revise or revisit it."
good,"nada a declarar. Há uma clausula de sigilo que assinamos ao entrar na empresa, portanto não me sinto a vontade para comentar sobre a IBM."
good,Company have employee friendly policies. WFH and other flexible policies help in having work life balance. The company has the rotating shifts which is the hardest part. Exposure to the new technology such as cloud .
good,"Multiple Work places"
good,"Prós: Tem várias áreas para trabalhar, sendo que é possível ser transferido para outro andar, prédio ou cidade, caso a convivência com os colegas ou satisfação com a atividade não seja boa. Salários pagos sem atraso. Cursos online (para fazer fora do horário de trabalho)."
good,"Os dias de trabalho são corridos e para quem quer ter uma experiência da dinâmica de trabalho sobre pressão vale a pena, a empresa é bem flexível quanto as necessidades e compromissos da sua vida pessoal para ida ao médico e bancos. O clima entre os colegas é bem competitivo mas não há bonificação salarial para aqueles que saem da zona de conforto e fazem o ""a mais"". A promoção é realmente muito baixa e acaba sendo desmotivante."
good,Great culture for learning. Its an ocean where self learning is the order of the day. Quite challenging and motivating at the same time.
good,". Readjust the claims. "
good,"IBM is a good company to work with, it provide support to women employee to balance work and home on a very convenient manner. There is lot of learning option in IBM as online and out source trainings. It is very good to work with IBM."
good,IBM is a great company but I worked for seterus contracted through IBM I based my reviews on IBM/ Seterus. IBM is great to work for but Seterus is a very hostile work environment that causes great stress upper management views employees as robots and are replicable. Very bad workplace culture.
good,flexible work schedule and allowed to work at home. poor management and lack of communication. Enjoyed work with team.
good,"IBM is a company that pushes there employees to the max.  I was outsourced to IBM and then my position was outsourced to Brazil."
good,A good organization to work where you have better work life balance. You come to know about a lot of advanced technology and achievements from with in the organization. But to get into the field is altogether a separate matter.
good,Portfolio Management.  • Technical analysis on listed companies and Index to understand the volatility in market. • Trading on live market as per the market fluctuations. • Generating reports on the portfolio difference as per the current scenario. • Interacting with Customers and understanding their requirements. • Organizing training programs for new customers.
good,"Pleasure working  with IBM, had a good time here. Gained knowledge in SAP, General Ledger and it was nice working here. Good company to work"
good,"Azienda che vuole innovarsi e stare sempre al top del mercato"
good,"Job was very flexible.  Was able to work from home quite often, because the five directors I worked for were in other cities.  It was a 6 month temp job that lasted 2 years.  Three times a week, I went into the IBM office closest to my home and would help put events together to keep morale up among the group of approximately 250 employees.  Enjoyed the different cultures I worked with. "
good,"I had many co-workers at IBM and they were consummate professionals.  My role was often to gain concurrence across groups with varying backgrounds.  I pride myself on getting a tough audience to participate and stay on point to meet objectives.  I learned to recognize passion from being difficult and not to waste time on speculation, let the data speak for itself and keep the points simple.  I also learned to keep my eye on the big picture and not get caught in analysis paralysis."
good,Overall a great company to work for. But the hardware side of the business is slipping into obscurity. Becoming more of a software and services company.
good,"I loved working from home remotely 100% of the time, but found the CEO and upper management didn't understand the business very well for the division I worked for.  The CEO was raking in millions in bonuses while laying of thousands of others."
good,I worked for IBM for 16 years.  Was a great company for most of those years.  Toward the end we the employees became numbers.  No longer a great company to work for as a consultant.
good,Performed analysis of data obtained form servers to ensure they are set to meet the agreed to settings from the clients.  Co workers are willing to help you learn if there was anything that you may not have a lot of familiarity with.  The company is big on following process and  ensuring you document everything.
good,"Place started out OK, but declined swiftly.  Upper management making decision for the present without thinking about the future."
good,"Great company to work for, however the GDC in Columbia needs improvement.  The managers need training, and the skilled workers needs better incentives.  Low moral and constant fear of losing one's job is the current culture."
good,"Good place to learn and earn. The management at the top is seasoned within the company. "
good,"The IBM company, which was once the pinnacle of american-based companies to work for is now a shambles and a ghost of what it once was. I would advise any young person not to go anywhere near this sinking ship because all it will bring is heartache and frustration."
good,I learned the advantages to be able to work with a national team covering all time zones for the United States.  The company allowed me to increase my project management abilities by allowing me to manage a number of projects.
good,"I enjoyed working there, but I had a difficult time not having benefits, which makes it difficult for me to afford my medical needs."
good,"IBM has expectations of all employees that are required for IBM's growth as a company to succeed. These are met thru continual education, which IBM advocates."
good,Good company to start. Nice international people but difficulties to grow in the professional path. Low salary. Overall I would say average.
good,"Job Work Life Balance is good, Compensation Benefits is poor,"
good,"Working Place will colour full and Learned overall P2P Process and Management are Helpful with cross Training, Co-workers are good and Friendly"
good,A very process oriented company where you can expect to learn and advance in your career path.  The job security is very high.

good,"The pay is average, a little lower than rest of country in IT industry. The rents and home purchase costs of Dubuque, IA much lower than other states. Food costs the same. Small river town 90 miles from anywhere in each direction so do not expect a metro area culture. My manager was excellent so 5 stars on that. Good job at first but transferring to other departments or other facilities almost impossible. They will pigeon hole you. The bldg. has many unhappy workers. If labotomy victim robots staring at the floor or others backs, not speaking to anyone while standing in the elevator does not affect you, this place is for you. IA is cold 7 mos. of the year. It gets old fast! There are some good things about IBM Dubuque but be warned, they might not further your career at all. Salaries really aren't too bad compared to the city I just moved too. Hardly no raises at IBM Dbq. unless you're promoted Rhythm to Blues to Jazz. Constant turn over. IBM Dubuque has never achieved goal of 1300 staff. Probably at only 1000 now. Make sure you ask for a salary your comfortable making 2 years into it because you will not get a raise unless you're promoted i.e. Blues to Jazz, etc."

good,"A typical day at work begins around mid day and goes on till late in the night since I work with teams based out of other countries. The work responsibilities require me to be able to collaborate well with my team mates as well as be able to be an individual contributor. There is a lot of emphasis on learning and developing new skills as they are key to being relevant. The most enjoyable part of my job is to freedom to design the program I am working on and see the results of my efforts. The hardest part of this job is being part of a remote team, while at the same time having a local team that I am equally answerable to."
good,@IBM your salary is not really high but you should find opportunities to learn a lot.
good,"doing hard work , but salary not good. For learning perpose is good."
good,In IBM Work and Family life balance can be achieved. Overall It's good company to stay but in the management area company needs to restructure the hierarchy.

good,"The company gives good opportunity to learn new things and gives much freedom in work matters."
good,This company is not good for freshers but it is elating for experienced employers.
good,"Boa empresa para quem quer aprender, desenvolver novos conhecimentos. Mas, apesar de ser uma empresa de grande porte, bastante inovadora, ainda falta preparar e avaliar melhor os gerentes de pessoas. A empresa ate oferece cursos para os gerentes de pessoas, mas poucos gerentes cumprem/desenvolvem o devido papel, e, com a falha na avaliacao e eleicao de gerentes, traz muitos funcionarios desmotivados."

good,"IBM was once the ""top of the heap"" IT company to work for, largely because of high employee quality/morale and the company's ""respect for the individual.""  Now it seems most all management decisions are based solely on making the current quarter's executive financial goals, supporting the march to a lofty earnings per share goal in 2015.  Respect for the individual is a thing of the past; that saying disappeared years ago."
good,"A IBM tem uma estrutura imensa o que a torna extremamente forte e  estável, isso em muitos casos dificulta a transição do profissional internamente."

good,Un dia tipico es asistir con el cliente a resolver el reporte levantado se aprende día con día ya q los problemas q se presentan con cliente son diferentes
good,"Over the years, IBM has improved it's yearly results by slashing benefits and compensation rather than invest in it's workforce. The latest example is when they reduced their already thin sales force due to poor sales results in a growing market. Our competitors, on the other hand, owe their success to better sales coverage and a higher ratio of customer to customer facing employees."
good,"IBM is an extremely fast paced, structured environment to work in. This can be good for business reasons, but sometimes is not good for morle. There needs to be more of a balance."

good,"Start ok."
good,"In general IBM is extremely and consistently serious about it's reputation and in protecting it's clients.  The measures IBM takes have become very impressive.  In the World Market it surely stands at the top of the Managed Services industry.  But with that said it needs to do much more to retain and properly compensate it's most important assets, it's very professional and skilled US based team members."

good,IBM gives opportunity to learn new technology and to get involved with innovative projects. It all depends on how you really use your precious time productively.
good,"Everyday was different.  I supported the United States, so in the morning I could be on a conference call in Boston and later that evening on a call to LA.  I traveled about 80% of the work week visiting accounts interested in SaaS, Cloud Computing, or overall infrastructure. I have a few great managers that helped me understand more about team work than self reliance.  The hardest part of my day was the travel.  Some days I would make two sales calls in different cities and then travel to a third city for the next mornings sales call.  It did not bother me that much because my greatest skill is in front of the customer.  I have learned how to read body language very well and can move a conversation in a different direction if needed."

The job was not very stressful except for during the release period."

good,"Mucha presión, poco equilibrio entre el trabajo y la vida personal. Estabilidad laboral, pero a qué precio? Fechas de vacaciones restringidas."
good,Most consulting projects allow you to work a 4x10 work week.  I end up doing a few hours from home on Fridays as well which is very nice.  Most people I work with are very enjoyable to be around as well.  The hardest part of the job is managing priorities.  Management will often state that something is higher on the priority list while pushing another task.

The management  team is great.and supervisors are usually available when you needed them. Some of my co-workers eventually became close friends since we worked so closely together on a day to day basis. The most enjoyable part of my job,because of the  fast-paced environment,which usually makes the day go by faster,and that  we were able to meet individual and team performance goals defined by management."

How to route the calls to the proper teams for technical support. I have enjoyed working at IBM thru Manpower. I have had no problems with management and I get treated with respect. We have quite a few people in a close working environment. I generally do not have a problem with the people that I work with and have made some wonderful friendships here. The job is not hard as long as you keep in mind that people are frustrated with their computer systems and having problems and not to take it personally. The best part of the job by far is having a customer say thank you for the help in getting their problem solved"
good,"prefiro não tecer comentários., por questões éticas. Mas minha avaliação média da empresa é boa, porém o clima organizacional vem degradando muito nos últimos anos."

good,"What happened to ""Respect for the individual"" under Watson Sr.?"
good,"Typical day would be checking Clients calanders and adding any new or upcoming meetings. Booking any type of travel. As well as doing exense reports. I learned how to use Lotus Notes at IBM. I had no prior knoweledge of Lotus. My co-workers were great! I enjoyed working with such wonderful men and women! Hardest part of my job was knowing that I would never see a pay raise, benefits or any type of advancement. You are stuck in that position until you leave to seek employment else where. The most enjoyable part of my job were my Clients. They were always wonderful to me and great to work for!"
good,I am in a maintenance project for a European Telecom client.
good,IBM is a great place to work if you are in a business unit that is doing good. Other wise.... layoffs.
good,I worked for IBM for several years as a Major Incident Manager and had many great Managers and Team Leads.

good,If you enjoy layoffs... Plant closed in Kingston ..... good luck finding a job
good,Many salaried employees have the option to work from home but are expected to work 10 to 20 hours of OT per week.
good,"Work/family balance is certainly not a concern to IBM. If you can keep your job and do not mind spending most of your life at work, it gives a very good salary."
good,I do not rate this company high at all. The original company values have been comprised.
good,This job started out a great experience. Unfortunately near the end they had gone through multiple work force reductions. This ended up causing a over worked very stressful work environment so I left.
good,Working for IBM like working for any other company with the exception of never knowing when your job will be Resouce Actioned (RAed) to overseas workers. These workers can not give the same level of customer service and support that American workers can do.
good,"hello ,"
good,I worked in a very high stress group. The culture was very competitive and unfriendly.
good,Very competitive and challlenging work place.
good,Tipical day of work is very busy and processes oriented.
good,When I joined IBM there was a sense of company value and history. That is no longer the case with off shoring and new company directions. The worker or employee has no value just a directive.
good,a person becoms lazy after 100 hrs shift
good,The co-workers were very knowledgeable and great to work with.
good,"The fact is, the place is very busy and managers don't have time for team members. It is very much a top down management style where often the managers are not working together. The contract rates are good and if you have a good manager your work schedule is flexible."
good,"Today I logged in to Avaya and was set to take calls to trouble shoot client related software issues, by then other team member who was already logged in wanted to go home as he was not keeping well. but when he called the manager to inform the same he didnt get the response, my colleague felt really bad. so I made him to sit on aux till i get call and made him take rest on the floor itself."
good,Basic manufacturing type work day.
good,"Al no ser empleado de IBM, solo puedo valorarlo como un sitio sin muchas oportunidades."
good,"They stick to their standard operating procedures,"
good,"IBM offers employees good choices to choose insurance based upon their needs. The benefits packages is where the perks end. Opportunities for education are non-existent with cost cutting measures in place. However, new employees will learn much from current IBM employees as they will readily share knowledge. The IBM culture is one of an ""IBM family."" Most employees work remotely. Unfortunately, regardless of any and all benefits, there is no sense of job security. Since there are equally important pros and cons, this got a mediocre rating."
good,In my early years with IBM I felt there was great opportunity for advancement and that IBM treated its people with utmost respect. Later in my career I felt there was a lessening of these values and that IBM downgraded its treatment of employees in order to maximize already excellent profits.
good,"I use to work in a very small office situated at Noida sector 135. It was a very outlandish location. "
good,"Good for Better work life balance."
good,"* Stressful environment"
good,"Its good to be an IBMer for some time. Company is more into research and innovations. Come up with various products. Work culture is good. However, the company is big ocean."
good,"Was recruited for a new department but it neve took off."
good,"- Started working here as a graduate hire"
good,Management is ok except for the quality control department. They seem to be in charge of coaching you when they have no It experience at all. The knowledge base for certain situations is uselesson many situations .
good,"a typical day at work was to hectic. Management within the client location was not helpful as I was constantly victimized for no reason by my direct boss. Generally, the staff are sound (technically and otherwise) and very friendly. and that is what made the work really enjoyable"
good,IBM was an excellent company to work for. CEO and direction changed dramatically. IBM big company you don't get hands on full job. For instant one group admins server other groups set rules and networking so going elsewhere your experience wont be complete.
good,"IBM is one of the great company to work but there is no salary criteria, A persona having experience of 14 years and a person having 4 years experience can get same package."
good,"Dobre miejsce, stabilizacja, duza firma.Mozliwosci rozwoju."
good,"Helps to be located in a major office, but the opportunity is there if you grab it.  Change is a constant, so you have to be flexible and open. Hardest part is getting used to a million systems and acronyms - make friends and ask lots of questions!"
good,"IBM is a huge company that can provide a wide array of opportunities to its employees. That said, like many consultancies, they treat their consultants like commodities. This leads to high attrition rates and poor morale. Your milage may vary."
good,"Muito boa para aprender, porem, muito burocratica sobre questões de mudança de local de trabalho"
good,This is not the IBM if the old times. I worked for IBM microelectronics foundry operations...the whole division collapsed due to wrong decisions by management. High level managers completely out of touch....lots of politics ..ultimately the while division just collapsed
good,While working with IBM I couldn't manage work life cycle. I lost complete balance because we used to work 10 hrs a day with only 1 hour break. IBM is a very productive place to work and if you are complete career focused person you can go with IBM.
good,"The working environment is great, outstanding company culture! Team Leads and Operation Leads are compassionate with the well-being of their team members. Offers competitive salary and bonuses!"
good,"Organization is good,gives exposure to different domains and industry.but i feel continue in an organisation more than 7years will build monotony in you."
good,I worked for IBM through a temp agency. It was a typical call center environment. Your hours were based on bidding so it was hard to get the hours that you wanted.
good,"Good company for freshers."
good,"IBM goes through constant change and reinvention.  You never know if you'll be positively or negatively affected.  They can do anything, but the hierarchical control of executive leadership causes lag down at the customer touch point.  Customers must often adjust to IBM and not the other way around."
good,I loved the people that I met while working at IBM.  I had the opportunity to work with people from all over the United States and other countries not only from IBM but from other companies that we supported.
good,Si te contrataría directamente sería mucho mejor ..
good,"I was harassed by my older boss from the time I started working there. Escalated the issue and even filed a police report. They just kept him away from me but did not penalize him because they didn’t want to deal with him and his family who owned a prominent law firm. He is why I went into HR 20 yrs ago, to stop it from happening to someone else."
good,"This was a contract role, it had a very consulting feel to it.  My contract got terminated early due to budgetary constraints and permanent staff sitting on the bench and they need to look after there own staff first.  I don't have any understanding of the salary and benefits.  What was very clear that IBM like a lot fo the consultancies or companies who have a large offshore presence and they bring people onshore, there is very little support for the staff members."
good,Employee need to get better compensation and hike when they work hard and achieve the target. They need get exposures in new skill so that organization can benefit.
good,"IBM one of the Blue chip organisation have open work culture and Global opportunities."
good,"Good place to work and work culture is fabulous. But, growth possibilities are pretty less."
good,Quarter to quarter financial management has damaged employee and customer stakeholders. Irrational an tactical management decisions have eroded the business over the last several years.  Commitments to employees and customers are not honored.
good,"I would say working with IBM, it was a good start for my career. I was hired on a contractual basis so there were no benefits apart from the salary."
good,"Initially eight - 10 years was fulfilling and challenging. Unfortunately, thereafter, with change in manager and management the wok culture was much to be desired."
good,"In afternoon have some issue with network."
good,"In IBM we will get many  opportunity to learn and work on many new technologies but very less personal growth in role and salary. Everything just depend on relation with your manager, who will never  measure you with your skills and hard work."
good,Learned a lot and met a lot of people who taught me a lot of things as well. It was good while it lasted. Hope to learn more to other companies in the future!
good,IBM knows where it wants to go -- but it makes it extremely hard on people post sales to execute on the contractual promise. Finance stops the Delivery teams from doing the right thing -- culture is stuck in the 1980s thinking clients have nowhere to go but IBM
good,IBM is a great company to work for. It is an old IT company and will give you a great set of skills to work for any IT company out there. Main drawback is the bureaucratic nature of the company.
good,"Salary wise its not good, but work wise we get lot opportunities to improve ourselves."
good,"Joined ship with IBM right after graduating from University, following the promise of a career. Was sung the tune of ""IBM offers less pay compared to the competition, but a higher chance of promotions, also because of a high turnover rate"". Thus, a career with IBM was highly incentivized."
good,"Wasn't the best job I ever had. Worked many hours at night running manufacturing equipment, often running shorthanded. Management was awful, got the impression they were being squeezed by upper management. However, most of the time I worked there it was global foundries."
good,"The Technical team member are alway friendly, but the Management team   "
good,"Was a great place when I started but they lost all respect for the employee in the last 8 -10 years.They laid off a lot of the older people in the company to try to be quote ""hip and cool like amazon""They no longer give the customer the service they are paying because of  cutting down the work force to a bare minimum .They appear to only be interested in serving Lenovo laptops , pc's and other multi vendor products and not the large system equipment that made them great."
good,"Great variety of jobs to be exposed to. Perhaps processes could be simplified."
good,A learned a lot of new things and communications with IT department. got to know team building and team coordination. improved level of interaction with all kind of employees in IBM Info.
good,"Depending on the group you are in, you may have good management or not.  Also, there is no stability with the clients.  Therefore, job security is non-existent."
good,"IBM has good people, but bad leadership, and there is a culture of short-termism there. "
good,"Good place to start a career, but seemed little chance for advancement. Solid foundation in cloud computing and analytics. Cross functional selling is very limited."
good,"I had several roles at IBM.  Some management is great and others are a pain to work with.  In 5 years, I had 6 managers. Be ready to work with a lot of Indians and Brazilians."
good,"You learn a great deal, but many outside tend to think their industry is unique. So you will hear you are losing your industry experience. So plan where you really want to be in life."
good,"The training was good, the colleagues where nice people"
good,"Quieren reducir costos constantemente, por lo que reducen el personal y los que quedan están desbordados. Los aumentos son una falta de respeto. No valoran el esfuerzo de los empleados. Una minoría está afiliada al sindicato de comercio y el resto no tenemos sindicato por lo que nadie vela por nuestro salario y cada mes perdemos valor adquisitivo."
good,It was a contract job to work. They gave two weeks of training and then placed you on the foloor for the other week with a partner. The following week you were on your own and you would ask for the help needed.
good,"Good company to start your carrier. You will learn new things in terms of technical."
good,Client experience is key to advancement at company. Hard to take personal days and is counted against utilization when taken. Hardly and training given. Job security is only a thing when you're on a client project.
good,I was very excited to work for IBM as my father had worked there before. It was a VERY different experience once I was in the door. My training experience and managerial experience were both sorely lacking.
good,"Very good place for those how want to balance work and family life and for very good place for learning"
good,"1. IBM is an IT service company that provides multiple IT services to global clients."
good,"Worked there 21 years as a service technician, company seems to be going in a different direction as far as service is concerned. Many layoffs in our division. I did receive many hours of company training and am grateful to have worked there as long as I did."
good,"Unclear direction after acquired.  Constant state of fear of being cut."
good,"I worked in Service Management team and looking after incident, Problem and Change Management. I leaned a lot in service management though Management is a bit tough. The hardest and enjoyable part in IBM is that they do a lot of reporting analysis and this is also the most enjoyable part as we learn a lot."
good,Nice place to work with up skills available but you never know when they will have a work place alignment and you will be let go.  I gave them my all for the last decade and out of the blue they said they have a workforce alignment after they higher 3 new college grads.
good,there was not a lot of training or information provided to new hires. Their severance package is laughable. I was disappointed in hour employees were handled through the RIFF.
good,"I would not recommend working here. IBM bought the company I worked for, and then three years later laid me off. During the three years, we worked many many long hours, and were never rewarded for the extra work."
good,"Empresa mundialmente conhecida, porém existe uma forte atuação política internamente. Na conta onde atuava existe muitas cobranças muito além do considerado normal. Profissionais de gerência extremamente mal educados e desrespeitosos com funcionários."
good,While the work is interesting too much instability to give hope. Continuous departure of employees meant increased workload for remaining staff and the long hiring freezes ensured this would be the case for a long time. Expect your schedule to be full of unnecessary meetings. Salary raises are minimal and are not guaranteed every year.
good,"There really needs to be an emphasis executing the right the strategy instead of just creating it.  There are many fantastic people at IBM, but senior leadership needs to help ensure their strategy actually implemented and break up the logjams when they arise."
good,"A IBM é um ótimo local de trabalho, até nos depararmos com a terceirização. E daí, de ótimo cai para péssimo."
good,"When I joined IBM in 1978, the order of importance at work was: IBM first, my department second, and myself last."
good,"Don't be fooled by the size of the company!! As a technician, you start at 40K/yr. No raises for 5 years, not even cost of living. Workload increased, but no compensation. Consists of shift work, which interferes with home life. "
good,"Fairly typical software development environment in an "
good,Was great to work for them during a contract for one of their clients.  The mission was explained thoroughly and expectations were known up-front.  Management was amazing!
good,Not much room for advancement. Lots of revolving door in terms of workforce and personnel. Benefits and holidays are virtually non-existent. One of the good benefits are the learning tools that are available online.
good,"I've worked with different teams and modules and i am very happy that I got an opportunities to work like that, and Workplace culture is good too, however when monitory things comes in place and in terms of role structure, I feel this is where IBM should improve on."
good,"The good things about working at IBM are the people, a talented, intelligent bunch.  This company is so big and the product portfolio widespread that you can work on any emerging industry project because somewhere in the company, someone is working on it."
good,"IBM is good company for women employees but growth is very slow.Work environment is very good, people can easily do work life balance. IBM is good company to work."
good,"dobra praca na początek, łatwo uzyskać certyfikaty"
good,Check email.  work your requirements needed for supporting your customers.  Training was minimum.  Culture was always wondering when the next layoffs were.
good,"Good company for those under 40 years of age, you will get training, and potentially get rewarded for hard work. You should leave after age 40 from this company. At first they have decent benefits, more than decent pay with commission  if in a sales role. In exchange there is  high stress and there is no work/life balance . After working long hours especially around end of quarter which can after midnight, there is no loyalty to seasoned employees as they have proven to be a very ageist company."
good,Working in IBM has allowed me to hone my technical and management skills more than any companies I worked for. Leadership is flexible and allowed me to do the project strategies and gave me the green light to implement them. It gave me the confidence that I need to be more competitive in my field. IBM has been flexible as well with the core hours as needed by the client and allowed us to work from home which is very critical during support hours.
good,"Depending upon your role days can be long and stressful, but a great place to learn many new skills and gain advanced experience within many areas of innovative businesses."
good,"I started my career in ibm . I have learned many things in Ibm."
good,"Concerned more with making money from existing products thaninnovation, but lays off its experienced folks regularly.  CEO is chasing the buzzword technologies and hoping one of them lands, but not training their employees rigorously."
good,"I feel they lie in regards the job security as I was promised and they did otherwise. If you ever get a job with IBM, see if there's a way for you to get a written letter in regards to your tenure with them."
good,"IBM is probably the most classic example of people quitting over management rather than the actual work being done. From the Cloud, to blockchain, AI, QCs and more, there are lots of areas to work on an grow. But most of the excitement from these fields can be quickly killed off by the date driven nature of IBM. Promised dates, and negotiating feature functionality to a minimally working product that is hard to keep up and maintain, rule over all aspects of working for IBM. And the culture can quickly switch to one of blame rather than working to fix issues going forward."
good,"IBM used to be a highly respected company.  They are desperately trying to remain relevant in today's world of Amazon/Apple/Google.  Management is mostly concerned with appeasing shareholders mostly by ""offshoring"" US based employees to India/Brazil (some of the work I performed here). How Ginni Rometti is still CEO blows my mind."
good,"I learned a lot about business when working for IBM. But they are very focused on keeping you in your box. Over use of the phrase, ""Be a rock star"" gets old at times, especially when you are working 80 hour weeks and someone else takes the credit for your work. However, they pay well and they do give you a pretty long leash with regard to travel."
good,"Empresa com horários flexíveis, dinâmica, tem oportunidades diversas para trabalhar em muitas áreas."
good,IBM started off as a fun and exciting place to work but the company changes their business very quickly and it leaves a lot of people without jobs. In 3 years they opened a brand new operations center and staffed several hundred people only to turn around and lay off most of them.
good,"Working hitting the ground hard from the first moment I sat down at my desk."
good,"Typical day:"
good,There are a lot of work from home opportunities at this company ranging from finance to technical fields.  There are also positions that require you to be on-site at specific locations.
good,"No question that IBM is a great company."
good,"Work place and job security is good."
good,"I have contracted for IBM numerous times, with the last being the longest (5/2014 to 10/2018) I've never been offer a position with them, so I guess I don't know what their expectations are, but the experience of working with them has been invaluable."
good,"While IBM mostly provided a great work life balance, I felt like there were way too many downsides."
good,The daily job experience left much to be desired. Innovative solutions were not encouraged. 1st level management was ok but not allowed to be effective or reflect positive change. Just a job
good,"1. Maximum 45+ aged persons"
good,"You can enjoy your work life, if your survival skills exceeds your hard work. "
good,"Can't pin point when things started going south, but it went south really quickly.  It's not a company that I would recommend to any of my friends, especially from a delivery perspective.  Maybe in other fields, but definitely not delivery."
good,Pay scale is very down considering the work undertaken. no flexibility and end up working with Micro management team and an unsupported team which carries struggles to daily life style
good,A great place to learn different technologies. Unfortunately managers tend to worry about themselves rather than the employee. The hardest part are the long working shifts.
good,"Not much to say."
good,"Professional large scale environment of what you'd expect from IBM. Heavy investment in six sigma approaches. The large size makes things not quite adapt as well to small problems, but able to handle large scale things well. It does make it feel like a more clinical assembly line approach. Became mostly contractor work with continually smaller staff to cover jobs."
good,"Two years with the company, they closed the local office to another town could not commute. This had a huge impact on the site with a majority of the work force having to leave."
good,Empresa com uma cultura empresarial muito forte e um bom ambiente de trabalho.
good,"No work life balance and managers changing constantly. Some of my managers were great, but you were always trying to keep all of my many managers happy."
good,Focused on just revenue and profit and not employees. The company focuses on financials rather than employee engagement eventhough it tries to implement engagement initiatives.
good,Not a strong connection between consultants and direct management. Must be willing to put in extra effort to complete client work in addition to internal work. Very hard to move around once sector has been selected for you.
good,"IBM was an unstable organization with below average leadership at Executive levels.  I learned a lot about how to navigate a large, complex sales organization such as IBM including how to promote my product brand to account client executives and software client leaders."
good,"No two days or two projects are the same at IBM.  You can direct your career in many different ways and there are plenty of opportunities to learn and grow.  Experience is very manager and organization dependent, however, and depending on your organization there is little to no job security."
good,"Es un buen lugar para aprender los requerimientos básicos de cualquier empleo, a largo plazo no es lo que busco."
good,Working with global customers and teams across many companies was very challenging but very rewarding.  Being able to lead teams and watch them grow and perform at 100% to deliver the best quality of work was very exciting for me.  Learning customer cultures across the globe and discovering their needs and creating and delivering an integrated solution was my motivation.  My sweet spot is motivating cross cultural teams to work as one and deliver the best solution for each client.
good,"You lose the balance between work life and personal life. It depends on the projects mainly "
good,IBM is a great company to work for.  I have learned a great many skills and have learned a lot.  Management and culture are great.  The hardest part of the job is a lot of time is needed to succeed in any role at IBM and working very far from the workplace is a great challenge.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the wonderful and intelligent people you have the privilege of working with and alongside.
good,IBM is a great company to start your career with. As a fresh gradutae from college I was given opportunities to prove my mettle and improve daily. The helping hand and advice provided by the mangement helped me a lot in learning about the technology market in India. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was given opportunity to handle commercial patch for generating revenue for IBM services portfolio. It was a great experience where I lerned a lot and moulded my career for future growth.
good,Good company but job security across the board is sub par and there is an incredible amount of employee churn.  Many employees work remotely (from home office).  This increases productivity and aids a sense of work/life balance
good,"IBM people are great people to work with.  IBM overall has a culture of cutting headcount, so people are usually worried each quarter if they will be on the chopping block."
good,IBM was a great company that treated its people well and valued its employees'. The company has lost its way. Outsourcing too many task for cheap labor and promoting bad people to higher level positions instead of vetting them prior to promotion. This caused a disfunction and at time hostile work environment for me.
good,The company I worked for had great people and management. I enjoyed my job but ultimately left the company due to pay. The review policy for a raise or bonus and any opportunities for advancement is a rigged system. They have lost a lot of really good people due to lack of compensation/cost of living increases.
good,IBM is a very different company today than when I started. It became a very stressful environment. I would not start working for IBM if I were in the market today.
good,I've been mismanaged. I've been misled. I've been miserable. There are many promises however they are never fulfilled.  The vat and swap on their ideals and principles.
good,Good place to work for tech consulting. However because IBM is a huge organization - sometimes the value gets lost. Need to find your own niche and excel in the area
good,"Not enough innovation happening at a company that should be on the edge of innovation. Management culture not very good. Lack of cohesive vision. "
good,"it's very nice and good place for work,very enjoyable and flexible work culture.Learning scope is huge and team spirit also very nice.so overall it is nice place."
good,IBM is great company but it lost its innovation and employee caring culture  . The care advancement is not great. The management does not treat they employee well and does not support skills improvements.
good,"I love the work that I do, but the business environment has been eroding for several years now. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The most difficult thing to deal with is a feeling of a disconnect in leadership."
good,"Day start with Full of work pressure but every day i learn something new which id helpful in future also. "
good,"The Markham campus was a pleasure to work at. The atriums, food court and other amenities (covered parking) were nice little perks. Fast paced, dress code seriously enforced."
good,Was employed via another company on contract for the state. The contract was lost but overall I think the atmosphere was ok. The pay was not so great but you get to choose if you want to work overtime and how many hours of overtime you wanted. Towards the end of the contract the overtime hours were cut short though.
good,"As in most companies they are only as good to work at as the quality of your direct manager. At IBM, I worked for some of the best. The problem was the culture of biannual RIFs made working there stressful and at times non productive."
good,"So much to learn but need to balance the work and personal life."
good,Great workplace culture with emphasis on productive work. Great benefits but fully occupied work days. Pretty flexible work schedule and no limit to get additional help whenever needed. Support learning opportunities.
good,Some IBM contracts are good.  They allow you a chance to really utilize your talents.   Others are not so good as managers are distant and don't provide any assistance.
good,"As an employee, it was expected that IBMers work to meet deadlines and to support the client.  Work / life balance was a challenge.  Very talented and dedicated team of people who were a pleasure to work with.  Client always came first.  As a Project Manager I worked independently and only involved Management if issues required escalation.  Managed various teams of people globally.  Had different assignments and was always learning a new part of the business from the client's perspective and by working with and across various IBM departments."
good,A huge number of learning resources. Internal and External certifications are available in plenty. All certifications are reimbursed after successful completion
good,"Helpful managers"
good,"have many e-learning on portal for employee to learn."
good,"IBM is a working friendly environment with strong individuals who are committed to strive and climb up to the top . The main objectives is to fulfill all orders loaded in without any exception. All individuals are cooperative with one another to meet the company's target and expectations. The hardest part of the job is challenging yourself where you need to constantly prove your value in the company and to ensure that youre a team player and able to work well with others. Company dont adapt to you , you adapt to the environment and the culture of the company ."
good,"Typical support was reviewing previous nights work, checking for errors and correcting where needed."
good,"After successful software company was acquired by IBM:"
good,"Mi actividad en la empresa fue ser gerente de Proyecto, Fui un consultor asignado a un Banco, La empresa es responsable, organizada, le criticaria la falta de mas compromiso con los empleados, ya que asignan al consultor y no estan pendiente del mismo, solo que cunpla la funcion, pero la parte personal no senti su preocupacion."
good,"It appears the Bentonville location was missed when corporate remodeled their other offices. The work environment needs updating - crowded, dark and a 4 chair brake room. Our desks are small and we have old furnishings. If you overlook the surroundings, the people I work with are very good at what they do and willing to assist or teach you new things. Also, the international client we support keeps us busy and challenged. Management is flexible when you have family matters to tend to. "
good,"I'd say this is the place you go to gain a minimum of confidence in your craft. It's software development at the highest scale, for sure -- but Google it ain't -- heck, it's not even Microsoft. "
good,"excelente prepaga bajo sueldo aumentos pobres"
good,"IBM is a competitive and unforgiving work environment.  In the past several years, the company has experienced quarterly staff reductions that have increased the stress levels and competition and move the company to a forced ""up or out"" culture that was not present 5 or more years ago."
good,"Az utobbi evekben borzaszto fejetlenseg uralkodik, embereket rugnak ki, majd visszaveszik par honap utan, megint kirugnak 50-100 embert, aztan felvesznek 200-at.(palyakezdok ->allami tamogatas)"
good,"Job culture is fie, lot internal politics , and internal choice to move to different available good profiles restricted for IBMers. Increment is also poor."
good,"-Lot of projects"
good,Good culture and good work life balance. Always there is good communication between workers and managers. Always have good team bonding and team building.
good,Leadership is confused about where to take IBM next. IBM is struggling to find place in the market. Never ending management changes and lay off's. Its loosing money for more than 21+ quarters and missing analysts targets
good,"Gerência sem experiência e necessidade de melhorias em como trabalhar com pessoas, diversidades, adaptabilidade à pessoas e culturas diferentes."
good,"Typical Manager driven company. "
good,IBM gives you great flexibility and provides good work life balance.  But one of the main drawbacks of IBM is that the salary and increments are not up to the mark. Onsite opportunities used to be attractive in Europe earlier but with recent changes these have now become less attractive.
good,"Would not recommend. Employees are treated as expendable resources, not highly valued. No job security or stability. Quarterly layoffs.  Focused low cost resources, layoffs target 40+ workers"
good,"-bloated headcount and bureaucracy overwhelming and burdensome to business results -- too many layers of management"
good,"Call center environment, task based production per call and task- work in cubicles- answering phones and provide services to customers- high demand in production environment"
good,"I learned to be self sufficient, and to manage your career and network, because no one will help you do that. The hardest part of the job is getting staffed on external facing opportunities when the company is not selling any business. Choose partners that are constantly selling and bringing in value, and you will grow."
good,"Good company to start with. Frequent reorganizations and turnover impact morale and notion of job security. Lots of silos, the business functions more as a conglomerate of independent companies under a single brand than one firm with a unified vision and structure. Opportunity to learn project work and platforms well."
good,"Excelentes benefícios;"
good,"IBM is struggling to roll-out an Agile and new way of working across the company.  Senior leadership is the biggest bottleneck.  I could go on and on about the problems within IBM- but ultimately, they need to do a better job of adopting the new way of working if they are going to stay competitive."
good,"hectic and sometimes unfocused direction from management.  Trying to move from hardware focus to application, business process, and software line of business.  Rocky transitions ..."
good,"Flexible work/live balance, encourages input, fosters training options, good access to latest technology, promotes knowledge sharing across departments."
good,"A typical day at work would be the management of multiple calendars of top level executives in IBM. Scheduling meetings, expense reports, helping acquire Visa's for new foreign employees and general office duties and various projects with executives as well as their project managers and teams. Also working with major corporations in the marketing of new technology to these companies."
good,Culture was from the 60's! Management training was also old and not up to date. They were also demanding employees start work from IBM offices instead of working from home about 2 years ago.
good,"Good company, great benefits. no bonus structure. A lot of education and skill opportunities. Demanding, 50 hours a week minimum, flexible schedule though."
good,AT&T sold our group to IBM to be contracted back to AT&T.  The jobs are temporary as IBM is aggressively looking to off-shore the AT&T contracted positions.  The jobs that are available within IBM to migrate to generally require relocation and pay cuts.
good,"Overall, IBM is a pro-client and utilization of people is not commendable but the company allowed, depending on the project, work from home and flexi time."
good,"Was once proud to be employed by IBM, but company lost its vision and leadership. It use to be about people (employees and customers), but now its about the bottom line, earnings per share and shareholders."
good,"IBM is a great place to stay a few years but eventually org. changes and internal politics will drive you nuts. Once you find your passion, leave IBM and pursue it."
good,"I have had the opportunity to work at IBM for the past 10 years. IBM has afforded me the ability to travel the globe in a number of Worldwide roles, relocated my family and myself to Asia Pacific for an very productive assignment and have a number of interesting and fulfilling job roles. Unfortunately, the company and the brand I'm associated with have not been on the right path for the past couple of years and it's time to look for other career opportunities."
good,Ibm maybe good or may be bad for some. Its completely manager driven company . So your hike and over increment is completely under his hand. There are very few projects related to my technology.
good,"IBM is an amazing company to work for full of brilliant people and wonderful products and technologies. With the right Manager you can have excellent work / life balance. "
good,"Allowed Flexibility in working hours"
good,"While the employees are incredibly intelligent and hard-working, I think the organizational structure is incredibly similar to an ""assembly-line"" work from a sales pipeline work. Many people have been doing the same thing for decades in order to sell to their core customer group of 20 something accounts in Canada."
good,"Digital sales organisation, in the midst of transitioning into Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services provider, leveraging extensive portfolio of existing complimentary software & services as unique selling point to gain market share. Reasonably flexible in terms of Work/Life balance. Overly complex matrix organization."
good,"To be frank,if you are very close to your manager, you will get better options. Even though I got selected for a regular role at IBM, because of my team leader, they kept the offer on hold."
good,"Too much higher management hierarchy. "
good,Management needs to learn how to speak to people.No room for advancement. Bring you in to work as a contractor with a promise to hire you with in 1 year. And makes up reasons that they cannot when time to hire you.
good,"the salary for an IBM sbt is way lower than any company in the market, theres alot of work and not enough pay. Work hours are good , vacation and benefits are good but management is pretty poor."
good,"te contrata una empresa reclutadora, tiene buenas prestaciones pero desgasta mucho tiempo los recorridos por la lejania de la empresa en relacion a la ciudad, buen comedor y ambiente laboral"
good,Only fun no work. very less career advancement and more repetitive kind of work. Management make to stick to same place where you are working and hard to switch project.
good,Hay jefes que totalmente coartan la oportunidad de crecimiento.
good,"Work is fun but sometimes the work load is too high."
good,This company is in a constant state of outsourcing.If you have not been outsourced yet... you will be. India and Argentina are just waiting for your job so IBM can raise its suffering stock price.
good,it was a fun job to go into but stressful at time. Working security vulnerabilities was stressful for the government. but over all you can get work done.
good,constantly restructuring and no focused on the clients.  To many internal processes block progress.  Good at leveraging their spend in procurement and globally.
good,Laid off due to budget before my contract term ended.
good,"The small company I worked for was acquired by IBM in 2015.  Before coming to IBM I always knew that my job was secure and had no worries of downsizing or being let go.  Unfortunately, since becoming an IBMer, I have almost zero job security.  They are making so many changes on a daily basis, you never know if your position may be eliminated.  I have not received any type of raise or bonus in 3 years and that is companywide.  My manager explained all 3 years that the budget is tight and only given to the top 3% of employees who are already making more than they should.  I would not recommend joining this company if job security is important to you."
good,Enjoyed working from home in worldwide marketing role. My teammates around the world made my job interesting. Hardest part was trying to break new ground and having to gain the support of multiple divisions.
good,"Let me be clear of why I gave a subpar rating: I worked as an intern in the Southbury, CT Tax Department. Also known as the ""forgotten"" branch of IBM. The building itself was a ghost town. Over 600 offices and only 80 of them were being used by IT department or Tax department employees. "
good,"Nice working hour no work pressure."
good,typical day at work was quite hectic.
good,"IBM thrives on delivering new technology within and for its customers, however the need for rapid speed of change coupled with numerous organisational processes, (expected within every business of IBMs size) can often reduce employee ability to adapt and operate efficiently and successfully day to day."
good,"In some ways my experience was positive in terms of access to terrific clients. However, the matrix management approach is flawed and there are too many people calling on the same clients  - all the time. IBM has yet to commit to a business strategy that is effective in market. Many senior executives with 20+ yrs remain embedded in the organization and resist change at every level. Very hard to on-board - they expect instant results in an environment where non-IBMers will be challenged to assimilate to the massive bureaucracy and process controls. Check it out but be very wary."
good,"Floundering in the new technology world. the only profitable technology was the old stuff like mainframes, yet couldn't move faster to get ahead, More concern with saving money than making new revenue."
good,Felt like Joe Vs The Volcano. Not much of a culture and very robotic. Just wasn't a fun or interesting place to work. Training is top notch though. I like the small company atmosphere and culture much better
good,Great for work life balance but too much power is put in the hands of your direct manager and constant cuts being made in the business. A great learning environment .
good,My typical workday involves way too much time spent on long calls where very little is ever accomplished. Just not a dynamic place to work at all. The current environment is one where probably 60% of the employees wonder if they will have a job the next year.
good,"I was spending my days waking up at 6am and working until 9pm  most the time not getting lunch. get yelled at for stupid little things.  Get escalated when management is telling you to focus on one thing and emails are flowing in wanting you to do something else, then get yelled at for that."
good,"In spite of a clear mission statement, my experience at IBM has been that the infrastructure is overwhelming, making it difficult to find your way around the organization, or harness your work to the overarching company goals."
good,"IBM was a great place to work with fantastic and passionate people.  The work-life balance had been fantastic.   There is a drive to co-locate people back in the office which is causing tremendous disruption; people are being forced to leave homes/families they've established and move hundreds of miles to return to an office setting. In the long term this may be a sound strategy, but the immediate disruption this is causing is strong."
good,"The biggest fallback for IBM is its huge employee base, so the growth pattern and financial reciprocation is quite low especially since there are huge number of employees to cater to."
good,"The upside of IBM is the same as the downside - it's a huge company. You're well compensated and get the name recognition but it's easy to get lost in the shuffle. The company is very good at recruiting good people, and I've worked with some fantastic and brilliant people. However, those people often become frustrated at the lack of advancement and support and move on within a few years. Or they get laid off for not having good utilization despite chaotic staffing procedures. I would describe most coworkers as either lifers or disillusioned."
good,Started out working in PPQA which was a quality assurance organization.. Worked here for almost 10 years tesing printers to assure they met our published specs.   After that I went and worked in a analysis role where we used finite element analysis to predict stress levels in parts and worked with the engineers to optimize their designs to assure they would last the lfie of the product..  After that I spent 10 years in a fuser technology role where I developed fusing engines that melted toner and adhered it to the page.   This job required life testing of component parts along with extended testing at the extreme environmental conditions to assure toner adhesion was adequate..  My last 10 years I spent in scanner developement working on the optics and image quality.
good,"I was a lead tech, for the company answering and troubleshooting personal to major projects. I took about 30 to 60 tickets a day and helped fellow co workers. Workplace culture was pretty ok beside the micro management at times. Benefits were not as good and had to work most holidays."
good,"Aunque fue una experiencia muy corta, me enseñó el trabajo a nivel de oficina, ya que fue mi primer trabajo luego de haberme graduado."
good,Nowhere will you find a better pool of talented people all driven for the one goal of providing the highest level of IT service delivery. Great place to work.
good,"It is a steady, employee conscious, work environment but since most IBM positions are typically more of a consultant type role, you need to continuously search for new job opportunities when an assignment is nearing an end. Most of their positions are now located overseas which makes it somewhat difficult to acquire new roles."
good,Over many years at IBM as a contractor I had the pleasure of mostly working with excellent people. Even most of my direct managers were great and I'm still in touch with. Unfortunately some of the company policies are a disappointment. Also I heard from some employees about not getting a raise in many years or just a 1% raise in the last 10 years.
good,"This was a desktop support position that I took, hoping to get my foot in the door to proof myself so that I could advance. "
good,"IBM isn't what it used to be 20-30 years ago.  It is struggling to find its place in fast-changing new high-tech world.  There are still a lot of good, smart, hard-working people and low-level managers.  However, the CEO and senior leadership are sub-par.  Job experience at IBM still carries some weight, and may look good on resume.  It is definitely not a place for a long career any more.  Sad."
good,"The company is a good company, and managers are very political and cut throat.  You need to have meetings to about having a meeting it was very difficult to get a quick decision."
good,"A IBM é uma empresa bem estavel que acaba de completar 100 anos no Brasil."
good,"CIO business org is slow paced and no opportunity to grow. Initially they promised that they would sponsor H1B, but last minute they said they cannot. HR system is very bad"
good,"Uma empresa que me ensinou a ser a profissional que sou hoje, porém com algumas cargas horarias um pouco pesada, nada que não dê pra dar conta, ambiente dinamico e tranquilo, a gestão deixa um pouco a desejar quanto a metodologias e auxilio ao funcionario."
good,"Good Exposure to the New Technologies."
good,Opportunity to learn as much as you can but not a lot of downtime to do it. Work life balance is amazing. Must self manage and multitask. Company direction is not clear and is in a constant flux from year to year.
good,Long hours and stressful environment as per work assignment. Worked on multiple assignments for multi national clients and had a very stressful assignment due to poor requirements and not good management with the client.
good,"I enjoyed working at IBM because I was hired on with a smaller company called Kenexa and we were still able to maintain the Kenexa culture. Once we were fully integrated with IBM, it took a lot longer to complete things. Also, IBM no longer invested into the software product I did consulting for so most of us were laid off."
good,"17 years with company. Great first 10 years with management, direction, focus, innovation. pride.  Lost focus on employees and sales and 1st & 2nd line quality management and became too metrics oriented. Spreadsheet driven and lack of consistancy and focus on customers and employees.  New leadership top down could chanage all of this and once again make it a place to be proud to work."
good,"There’s a group of ‘cool-kids’ that have inside jokes, whisper in the corner and take frequent breaks together. Sadly, you’ve not been invited to be part of their group and are left as somewhat of an outsider. This, in turn, will make you feel sad and lonely and will ruin your working experience. It’s important to be accepted into an office and have good relationships with most (if not all) of your colleagues."
good,"Good working environment. & Job security is there. "
good,A typical tester day starts slow and will gets busy as the time goes on. Evening will be extremely busy everyone gets hooked on calls for their respective projects. Overall nice.
good,"IBM has remade itself significantly over the 23 yrs I was employed there.  Some of changes made sense (shedding of unprofitable divisions), some didn't.  Not sure the company knows yet what it wants to be during it's second 100 yrs."
good,"When I joined IBM It was through Kelly Services Agency, The team I was under where very fun yet reclusive. They took the time to train me and teach me about the inner workings of IBM."
good,"I liked my job at IBM. Unfortunately, the pay was poor, benefits were non existent, and layoffs occurred regularly. I had no possibility of advancement and management often had their hands tied."
good,"Extremely political, you got to be watchful about being watched all the time..."
good,"IBM as a whole wants to satisfy its shareholders. There aren't many decisions made focussing on employees first. Free coffee isn't even a thing unless you're in design(Yes, I've asked for free coffee, no it has never happened). "
good,"IBM is a great place to work if you want to make a lot of $ and have a flexible type of work/life balance.  However, the antiquated systems and infrastructure of the company, and the legacy nature of the business and the people, make it a very difficult place to work."
good,"Self-Improvement"
good,There was very little work/life balance in the role I had in IBM.  The work environment was global so multiple world time zones had to be considered for every communications.  Almost all communications were via conference call or email making it difficult to get things accomplished.
good,"members of the immediate management team seemed to be more geared toward production totals than accuracy and customer satisfaction. having to handle dissatisfied customers from other teammates, cut into dealing with new customers issues."
good,"The work life balance was very good in IBM as it provided work from home facility."
good,working in a warehouse environment loading and unloading trucks on the bays distribution of computers around the world and delivering components to various location around the plant
good,"IBM does everything, which is great, but you have to work extremely hard and take a lot of risk to take advantage of that diversity of experience. It's difficult to move up, around or outside your department within IBM. Maybe this is just in my part of the company (GBS), but in a company this large, the amount of red tape required to grow your career is far too much."
good,"People here are very helpful"
good,"IBM Yorktown is generally a nice place to work with many very skilled and experienced individuals to learn from. One potential downside of working here is that meetings occur so frequently that entire days consist of only meetings, which leaves less time to be productive individually on work."
good,"There are benefits to working for IBM - plenty of opportunities for training for starters.  Unfortunately the work-life balance just wasn't right for me - you have to be willing to start projects anywhere in the country with only a few days notice.  Those projects can mean months of working away from home on average 4 days a week.  That wasn't for me in the long term."
good,"if you are in public sector, you will have good work/life balance with projects however if you are with commercial sector, you will likely deal with mon-thur traveling and long hrs"
good,"Not much growth in this field as the movement takes too long."
good,"IBM is an okay employer however I have found it frustrating due to the lack of innovation taking place."
good,"Being a part of Network operations."
good,"projects are good ,but for fresher if you are lucky then you will get development work else support or testing."
good,"It is good to work for freshers and well experienced. Fun place to work"
good,"I am proud to work with IBM, encouraging to learn new technology if you have some spare time to learn for those and everyday/every year  expenses are increasing but no salary increasing."
good,"I loved working for Quality Distribution Inc. It was diversified and I was able to preform 3 different job roles in the several years that I worked for Quality Distribution Inc. "
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company (the teams I worked with).  The work/life balance was as good as could be expected for an Incident Response team for a large company (typical ebb and flows of work).  Could have a 40 hour week, or an 80 hour week with evenings/weekends depending."
good,"Work Life is balance (which was excatly as I desried), Only salary is less and no increament. If get good project then company is good otherwise it can ruin your career"
good,"For Global Technology service (GTS) at IBM, you are expected to work as much as it takes to get the job done. No work life balance for my position. No comp time if you work on weekends. You need to be able to figure things out and make decisions without help from a manger since your functional manager really does not know what you do when you are assigned to an account. Most of engineering jobs are out of India and if they are not aligned to work in US time zone , you lose a lot of time going back and forth via email. A lot of material is available to learn and study on your own. When you go vacation, you  need to find someone to cover for you, otherwise you will get calls and be expected to support the account. You can put yourself into the marketplace and look for other opportunities that come up anywhere in the world. Usual Health, dental, vision and 401K benefits."
good,IBM is a good company to work for.  A typical day at work can be long hours and very stressful depending on the client you are working for.  Salary and advancement could be a lot better. Overall it is a great company.
good,"Growth is very poor, salary not par with industry standards, Good place to learn new technology, but not guarenteed that one will get projects according to learning.."
good,"The company has changed, with respect to how they treat their greatest asset: their employees. I have decided it is time for a change. I am looking for new and exciting opportunities with smaller companies."
good,"Solo me desallolle como Operador de producción, no hubo la oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,"Constant staff cuts make the environment at IBM very uncertain. Morale is low. Managers make the best of the situation but it is never surprising to hear of redundancies. "
good,"Pros"
good,"As IBM continued to reinvent the business many difficult decisions were made that impacted some very talented employees. Management changes created chaotic situations as too many initiatives were being implemented and the concern of the individual did not seem to matter."
good,IBM is not the IBM from 10 years ago.  Its profits first then employees. MANY of the positions are overseas and are leaning that way-   I was in a very sucessful and productive deparatment.. i was laid off and the dpeartment was sent to Costa Rica
good,"Would only recommend working for this company if your field specialty is IT or some type of computer specialty.  Various company events only for upper level management, not for standard employees"
good,"When I started with IBM, I was given a Supplemental position, with option to hire at the end of 3 years.  The company then changed hands 3 or 4 more times, and I was taken along as a Supplemental and strung along for another 3 years at a time.  After 9 years, when Ricoh finally owned the IBM / Infoprint holdings, I was hired on."
good,Enjoyed working here. Great environment to work. People are very friendly and respectful. No room for advancement. Will advance only if you know someone in the upper level.
good,"On a typical day in the office, it's hectic and very busy. Workload is usually high with few FTEs available. Management is refusing to add people as their way of ""cost saving"". What makes the environment fun tho is the people. My teammates are competitive, responsible and crazy. No matter how our role becomes physically demanding and mentally draining, they never fail illuminate the production room and set the mood positively."
good,"desayuno con tu equipo, mucho trabajo, comida en tu despacho y mucho trabajo.Ambiente muy buena, internacional . Lo bueno: la flexibilidad, poder trabajar desde casa y coger dias, vacanciones cuando quieras."
good,This is a typical day of work based on what I learned from management in a company workplace culture where the hardest part of the job is the most enjoyable part of the job
good,IBM was good to work for but the company has employees filling out too much paper work all the time probably because of their contractual obligations.
good,"Good place to learn and everyday is challenging especially when you were handling business critical clients. "
good,"a lot has changed over the years, but its still a good place to get some experience."
good,"Nice work place , good work environment,collegues are supporting nature,difficult tasks, but less pressure,good management, supportive members in team"
good,"I happened to start during a transition phase in which many seniors left the company, therefore at the moment we are struggling in acquiring the knowledge we need to comply to our internal process. "
good,"Less Salary hikes"
good,No work life balance . Too much pressure during project delivery.Good company to get trained on process and management skills. working from home is very common .
good,Its a good company to work with apart from management politics. Workplace is nice but they never trust employees in any manner. Well i enjoyed alot there.
good,"Very glad this was a temporary position, the atmosphere was very stuffy to me -not allowed to directly approach senior managers, it takes multiple and lengthily approvals for even the simpler process and they are very resistant to change"
good,IBM provides various position to work at. Work on multiply projects at the same time. Work with individuals around the world. Management changes yearly.
good,"Very flexible to work with but here n there ups n downs with working culture , salary, allowances etc are not up to the mark . There is nothing to learn with the data entry of process"
good,"ibm is an american company whose focus is on the share price."
good,"This job is difficult in that the travel is 75–90%; that's hard with a family. I do enjoy the team atmosphere, and the rewarding work. Each job is different and requires leadership of the creative team to get in and make it happen—that's my role."
good,No growth if you will not step forward by yourself.Good chance of presenting your idea to the team or client and if they like that idea they will reward you.
good,This location recently opened and was not staffed appropriately to take on the volume it was asked. Hired for one position and ended up doing a different job.
good,"Personalmente, opino que tiene mucho por crecer IBM , es un empresa de tecnología y esta en camino a lo nuevo"
good,"Good work life balance with the opportunity to work remotely in case of genuine need and able to independently manage work remotely without impacting the work assigned to you."
good,"Being a MRC, the quality of graduates is not same at all. This is the reason for poor salary structure at the rudimentary level ( graduate hire level)."
good,"Overall the people make IBM a good place to work.  Executives/management leadership and support, really depends on who is your manager.  Like any organization, if you are fortunate enough to get a good/great manager, it is a great place to work."
good,IBM is a very community minded company and has a great work life balance focus for employees. Facilities provide a good environment to perform your daily tasks.
good,Unfortunately IBM as a company has made its employees into numbers only.  No real importance any more to the employee or family and even benefits have been lacking!!!
good,Transition period and not focused. Too many quarters of not increasing profit causing chaos. Reduced most of US workforce and established Agile practices to try and rebound.
good,IBM is still a good company but it is struggling to grow in an ever changing and highly competitive technology marketplace.  As a result it has been very aggressively cutting cost which has begun to have a negative impact on employees.
good,"I have learned a lot from  Mgt perspective & Sales team also , How to convert opportunity to order, getting things done  quickly from each & every team do deliver the cutomer within specific period of time , Especially in month ends & quarter ends ."
good,"Employee oriented company, good experience, very organized and committed, Very good work culture and very innovative. had a very good learning experience and professionally very sound company."
good,"Governmental programs at IBM is an international/globally integrated function that is comprised of generally experienced professionals.  It is well managed by IBM standards, i.e. the bar is low."
good,"A equipe na qual eu trabalhei na IBM foi umas das melhores experiencias ate hoje, sempre com clima agradavel e prontos a nos ajudar. O trabalho era bem fluido e dinamico, e sempre foi algo bom."
good,"I worked with extremely bright, talented co-workers and the business and technology was always interesting. Unfortunately, the company has lost it's way in finding new ways to replace declining revenue streams in their traditional businesses (hardware, software, services). They have missed several paradigm shifts in the industry and have been playing catch up (cloud services is the most recent example) for many years. The financial results reported over a fair amount of time have been the result of selling off of lines of business, selling real estate, layoffs and reducing the cost of labor by moving jobs to offshore locations. Revenue has been flat or down for many, many quarters. "
good,"Typical day at work is cool, sometimes tiring.But Company is full of micro management and politics."
good,"Based on account and project team, you can enjoy your work"
good,"Being my first job, first BPO job i have learnt a lot from this company. The Phone speaking behaviours  and a control on rate of speech which was a arduous task for me."
good,There is no appraisal given every year. The work life balance is good. Management is not that employee friendly.     There is no job security.    Lot of online training can be taken.
good,"Not a great place to start the career. Quality of projects is ordinary, salary is low and growth is hard to come by. Work culture is decent as its a MNC firm."
good,"Employee can work from home when it is necessary"""
good,"In IBM flexibility of work from home is very good, and one need not be present in office all the time due to this culture work life balance is maintained."
good,I would like to take the high road and not make any disparaging remarks.  While once a wonderful company to work for where employees were valued it has sadly changed over the last 10 years.
good,"Um bom lugar para trabalhar."
good,"IBM is OK not the same place it was years ago, But they do have work/life balance. and they do have flexibility. "
good,"Typical day, worked tickets to resolve job abends. Maintained procedure library and job monitoring tools. "
good,"Shift work, 24/7 mainframe operations environment."
good,"IBM is a good company to start your career with.It gives you opportunities to learn and gain a lot of experience in terms of technology and implementation."
good,Very good team to work and managing both work & personal life is good. Learnt many new things in Excel and learnt to balance the things and was very flexible.
good,Satisfactory career growth. I started as team member and graduated to technical team leader and later project leader. I learned financial and operational management as well.
good,"The people in the company are a lot of fun to work with. You work with a very wide range of people from customers, VPs, sales, etc. I got to work with a lot of people from a lot of different groups which is a great way to see the business. "
good,"Having worked in IBM for many years, it was a good place to work and had gained a lot of experience as a result . "
good,"Great Company to work for , "
good,"-- Good Place to start your career."
good,IBM does expose tk good technologies but the salary offered to employees is too low and the annual increments are not often at par with market corrections. This was 8 years back though am not sure if things ahve changed now.
good,IBM has a good management and work policy. I joined here as a graduate hire. Trained in SAP BW domain. Got allocated to Maersk line project at Chennai.  I got to know about the big picture of IT industry from this opportunity. Colleagues (from my team to senior managers) are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is the variable shift timings.
good,Joining as a fresher is a good experience in IBM. Flexibility is there and professional grooming is very good.learning a new technology was always welcomed.
good,Concentrix it's now from IBM daksh no work life balance full of pressure weekend working just makes your life as bad as it can good for freshers if any one want to join
good,"Its a cultured place to work, yet, with growing dimensions of new era of professionalism and corporate culture, IBM may be required to step to new energy and dimensions. A good brand to be associated with and adds value and respect to our resume!"
good,"IBM ""Resources are our most valuable asset"". "
good,"My managers let me to work on my own paces as long as I can have my  tasks done."
good,"I joined IBM as a fresher and i was into support services. Hence the learning and growth experience was limited."
good,"Great Place to work if you got your domain / area of interest"
good,"Product, heritaged, original moon-shot company going through deep transformation to cognitive/analytics (Watson) and Cloud. Marketing jobs should be plentiful since a move to mandatory co-location in 2017 is causing higher than normal attrition."
good,Of the one and a half years that i worked with IBM i found that it was always about work. There were hardly any fun activities. The HR team is invisible
good,"It was a new experience working in a BPO sector. I had no idea what work was done or how to do it but the training provided gave me an outlook what it is all about. It was a good experience like talking to customers , Having a nice rapport with my colleagues.The workplace was always busy and tiresome. Lots of calling done everyday was sometimes a boredom. We had less time for fun. It was all WORK WORK WORK."
good,"I had no problem with my immediate manager but senior management tended to be not very communicative or supportive of workers. Even though I had received excellent reviews I never received a pay raise or promotion in my 5 years there. Even though I was classified as one of there SME's I was never actually promoted to the SME level. The Senior management than arbitrarily in 2016 decided that they wanted to locate all workers to one of there 5 service centers around the country. Which in my case was in Columbia, MO. I was informed that if I wanted keep my job that I had relocate to there. No relocation assistance was offered and was told I would have to do it on my own. Which I said I couldn't since it was almost 1000 miles from were I lived. As a result of this decision almost all regular IBM workers ended being replaced by contractors"
good,"My job is of SAP SD. I work in Shift from 12:30 pm - 9:30 pm."
good,I enjoyed my years working at IBM.  It became very challenging once the work start moving to different countries.  One good thing is I got a chance to visit countries I would never dream of vacationing.
good,"Working with IBM in a service line does not take you anywhere in your career unless you chose to move to another company. Work life balance is good , thanks to work from home flexibility that its known for, but the at same time this option might cost you more than what you expect."
good,"Working for IBM maybe great, but when you're part of Global Services you often feel as if you're expendable. I was often told that we were so important to the company, but that didn't feel true. Being caught between service provider and customer in an outsource is rough. Working 60-70 hours a week without extra compensation was pretty normal. I had a great manager there which made life somewhat better, but I would not want to return to the same environment."
good,"The working is very nice, Company wise also manager wise also. It was manageable according to our timings. Everyone was really supporting. Could able to learn lots of new technologies."
good,"I work with a wonderful group of people who are highly skilled professionals and team players, and I've gained a wealth of knowledge, which has greatly enhanced the skills I already had. The hardest part of the job, and the most disheartening, is the company's new policy of transitioning from a work-from-home policy to colocation. They are losing a remarkable bank of talent whose dedication and expertise are only measured by where they live, rather than what they have contributed to the company."
good,IBM is an okay place. You have to understand that they are in it to make money like any other company.  You as a consultant drive their revenue thus you are a profit center.  You are just a number that makes them money.
good,"Working remote option is doing a 180. Company is going back to a shoulder to shoulder approach to office environment. Overall, salary & compensation was always very good."
good,"Hassle free work culture as WFH is prominently approved."
good,"Decent place to work for as there is not good learning and exposure."
good,Good company........good environment...........but night shift.....so left job.....good management......working style is little good......overall company was good ...
good,"Surviving Job/Life with salary."
good,I would definitely work there again.  Good people.  Enjoyed working with sales teams and the IT group.  Lotus Notes was painful and did not provide productivity help.  Way behind Microsoft products.
good,"When I first joined IBM, it was a terrific company to work for.  However, over the years it has discarded it's core values and principles that once made it great.  Today, there is no semblance of the original IBM.  Executives are focused more on the temporal.  I fear it is on the pathway to irrelevance."
good,"IBM has changed. No longer pro-employee, executive level management is more concerned about reducing costs and moving US jobs overseas."
good,"IBM is a good for beginners. To learn work culture, punctuality, discipline. But employee payment is less compare to other companies in the industries."
good,Job security 100% but not a good pay master specifically for Bharti Airtel Project. A very good software company great working environment. A good place to work
good,"Like most large organizations, it can be stressful and rewarding at the same time. There are always a number of challenges to overcome, but with help/support from colleagues you would always overcome them."
good,"a good place to learn different tools and different technologies "
good,"IBM is transitioning back to a workplace model, mandating office positions and forcing tenured employees to relocate. The culture is challenging for any employee as a result of these changes."
good,"Good place to work, work from home is a good facility."
good,Depends on the project and the manger you work under. If you are facing some problem and your manager is not good then no will help you. Salary hikes are very less in IBM it also depends on the project.
good,Was in contract role and can not move into other teams easily. Flexible with work timings and work from home option is available. Can login from any IBM buildings.
good,"Low pressure, hands-off good for mid-level developers. Unfortunately little support or development plans for less experienced developers so a high turnover."
good,"•	Handling Calendar for optimum Time management"
good,"Need healthy workplace environment. Learning new client issue resolution. cooperative team members. "
good,"IBM has progressively moved toward cloud computing and away from traditional operations.  They are also going in the direction of fewer permanent employees and more contract employees.  This unfortunately has become a disturbing trend with a lot of companies today.  During a typical day, computer operators handle multiple accounts with multiple applications and multiple systems.  Permanent employees should not have to suffer by facing layoffs and being asked coming back as contractors just so IBM can increase it's profits by not having to pay benefits despite their profits being in the billions of dollars annually.  This creates a very negative work environment and reduces employee loyalty."
good,Good place to work. Got to learn a lot and got the wonderful opportunity to transition a project. But difficult to maintain work life balance. It gets very stressful at times
good,"I liked the work I did but salary was a concern for me so moved."
good,"Great organization to learn, good co-workers, pay structure can be better....Good place to start your career... Huge, bureaucratic organization... Flexible work timings is a bonus."
good,"This is a company where people gets work life balance stabilized however at the cost of no benefits during the year end for the individuals performance."
good,"Technology Focused People & Company"
good,You will work very hard yet you will be very satisfied about your accomplishments. Documentation and facts are found here.  When you are looking for something the proof will be there.
good,IBM is a good company to settle in because of the work from home facility and flexible work hours but not good in terms of benefits and salary.
good,Work day consists of creating tickets for issues or the previous night that were not ticketed. Reboot servers remotely for customers that have programs that were stuck and they could not access them. On a monthly basis remotely reboot Linux and Unix servers and bring up all the applications. Ping servers that users could not access to make sure they were not an issue and login to them to make sure they were up.
good,"Very individual if within the high role area. Different approach, different rewards. Although it is not very bad but management surely not the best, they did not covers entire level, especially operation ones. The culture is by far are rather racists in the eye of some people. The hard parts are how you can manage leveling up without stand up or doing something unique or be an excellent man. The flexibility of time is the most enjoyed element, as long as you are being responsinble for the job and can finish your job then you could have time to work from home or stay in the office as short as you want."
good,Typical services based organisation. Basic application management profiles. Relaxed work environment. Work from available in quite a few projects. Not many high end and complex projects.
good,"The organization is pretty good but the team I got to work with is not challenging. Commercial softwares were used by the company."
good,"Working for a company like IBM, you would hope to be able to build a career.  Unfortunately there is no job security and you are constantly wondering when you will be ""on the list""  While employed, co-workers have been great to work with."
good,"Multi-Task work. Great team. New challenges every day.Great Management team. Multicultural atmosphere."
good,"My tipical day as i am based at one of our clients site o provide support , i come in the office and do a system check on all the servers ( VIrtual servers and physical servers ) ."
good,Aprendi muito na IBM mas exploram demais o funcionario com horas extras e lavagem cerebral.
good,"Major transformation year after year, lack of funding and resources for proper planning and execution, too many silo and bureaucratic"
good,"Supported the Internal Recruitment team by sourcing, screening and creating candidate pipelines in North America and Globally also •	Responsible for opening all Job Roles for North America in Brassring as well as posting on third party job sites (Career Builder and LinkedIn); including maintaining and updating tracking logs, quality of applications, and cost per advert"
good,"good place to work for women's, colleagues are very supportive, less pressure, cool place to work however, salary is too less, very less chances of growth"
good,"I don't think my experience at IBM was a typical one.  I was part of an acquisition and through that there was a long pain period of leadership transition, lack of direction and poor middle management.  I had 3 managers within the first 2 years of my tenure, one left due to better opportunity, one was removed per request of the client.  The third, however, was very people oriented, driven to help his direct reports succeed.  His efforts to have me promoted to his level fell on deaf ears and 4 years working to gain more responsibility and use my leadership skills un-fruitfully proved time for me to move on."
good,"Receive call on I phone accept and provide ETA. attend call pinform when onsite , speak to customer regarding problem and repair or order parts to fix. on to next call. call team during day to see if ok and assist where needed. provide shift list  and process holiday and training for team."
good,"IBM offers lots of opportunities with little support. Their system of matching people to opportunities is pretty messed up, but the learning opportunities are virtually limitless."
good,"Good work/life balance and compensation/benefits.  Had issues with job security due to global restructuring and reallocation of positions to China. "
good,IBM was once the go to place to work. They ruined that with a culture of layoffs and never speaking to rumors which only created more tension. The benefits were good but dwindling quickly. Work life balance was still fairly good but not as good as many other similar companies.
good,Was a great experience and got a lot of corporate exposure. Came to know about a lot of things related to corporate world.
good,IBM is one of the best organisations to work for. A lot of learning is provided to employees and studying as well. A stable organisation.
good,"Company with strong ethics and conduct"
good,IBM stands its own in being one of the lenient companies allowing employees to grow. It also allows them to harness time & develop new skills. A secure environment .
good,Used to be a good place to work at with flexible work/life balance. The culture started to change right with the frequent layoffs and the offshore of the US jobs. Employees started to feel less appreciated.
good,This job gave me the experience in learning and development that I needed to advance my career. I learned so much for the al the different managers and their style of management.
good,"O unico problema é ser uma empresa que para seguir sua gsstao elimina empregados considerados com salarios altos, para contratar novos funcionários com menor salario, ao invés de rever a quabtidade de gerentes para as mesmas funções"
good,Good pay and benefits but long hours. Must start as a temp before you qualify to be hired on as a permanant employee and the hours are not always regular depending on the shift
good,This was a good starting contract position that allowed me to get experience in my field. I've met many great colleagues through this job.
good,"Good experience, but if you like managing high-tech projects, then there are more exciting companies to work for with better opportunities."
good,"It is nice experience for me but what I excepted is not there here"
good,"Good company to work for especially if you have an IBM contract."
good,"IBM has lost its focus on the current contractual obligations it has with its large outsourcing clients.  To increase profit, they reduce cost by offshoring labor but this has a negative impact on technical execution and client satisfaction."
good,"Overall the company is solid, but the company is going through major transitions with downsizing and constant shifts.  There is a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt, and conflicting messages from sr. leadership on priorities.  Still very siloed and bureaucratic.  Parts of the company suck and new initiatives are transforming faster than others.  Once ship has turned, should calm down."
good,"IBM is great organization to work, lots of learning opportunities."
good,"Sadly IBM is a place where senior management continually shoot your toes off then tell you to hop faster.  Local successes and individual customer requirements take a back seat to regional financial imperatives.  Long term success is sacrificed for short term results.  It's difficult to make a commitment to a customer when various types of 'freeze' may occur without notice, be they travel, capital, hiring or so on."
good,"Spent 7 years in one department under the same manager, then the next 7 years on another team I lost count of the managers, executives, and senior management team - it was like a merry go round. Constant churn meant no ownership, lack of knowledge and expertise, and an unhappy, positive environment to work in. Management is too top heavy and lacked integrity. Cost cutting starts at the bottom, where the work is done. Should be cut from top down where the large paycheques are handed out. Non-management jobs constantly being sent offshore where work ethics are different. Impact  of offshoring to business is noticeable, yet IBM sells it to the client as seamless. They don't walk the talk. It became too impersonal and uncaring to work there any longer."
good,During my time at IBM Australia I have been successful in moving into new and challenging roles. I am passionate in delivery a quality outcome to my Clients.
good,It is a good learning place where you can learn different technologies and skills which have a good demand in the market.
good,Learned to handle calls during issues in data center.Co-workers are highly cooperative.Hardest is not there if we enjoy that hardness also we can enjoy the work with dedication.Handling server issues from beginning stage to ending has given joy in my career.
good,"Working at IBM over the past 1.5yrs has had it's highlights."
good,Wide range of resources from IBM database. Great place to learn technical skills. Kelly Services was great. They took care of me.
good,Uma empresa de excelente estrutura onde visa desenvolver o funcionário de forma a evoluir e ser capaz de lidar com a responsabilidade que seu cargo exigirá.
good,Great company to work for. Limited jobs in the US.  Limited growth options. Lay offs twice a year.  Remote work available.  Overall great company to work for with regards to IT and sales.
good,"The culture and environment in IBM in 1984 when I was hired was one that made me and everyone I knew who worked there ""bleed blue"" and feel incredibly proud.  "
good,Overall a good place to work but once you get rolled off from a project its become very difficult to get a project as nobody helps you in getting one.
good,"Obtive muitas experiências profissionais."
good,Nice place to work as you get a perfect work Life balance at work. Flexible work culture. The day starts with day to day activities and follow ups and goes on with a team huddle. Had very good co workers to work with who are very supportive. Every quarter we had team outings which helped to build a better understanding of the team.
good,"IBM GBS is focused on billable hours.  Often leading edge technology and processes.  Some groups have a great deal of flexibility, others very little.   Most often a lot of travel."
good,"IBM allowed me to apply the Agile software development methodology and the best practises of the software test. I adopted languages as Java, Perl, SQL, shell script and some tools as JUTAA, Selenium, SoapUI, Rational Functional Tester for the test automation. The colleagues are friendly and the climate is good. Compensation is acceptable but 30% lower respect the average salary of the other competitors."
good,"As an IBMer you would required to be driving yourself to stay relevant in the organization. "
good,"I have seen IBM change from the best work environment to the bottom 25%.  We had fun in the past because their was a sense of building a career and team work. Today, IBM continues to reduce the US workforce and hire abroad. IBM makes goals that are not achievable thus not having to pay bonus. Today as you work for IBM, they make you feel like , be happy to have a job."
good,The IBM of today is only a shell of the great company it once was back in the days of Thomas Watson Sr. Even if you work hard your chances of being let go are high as management continues to divest  what remains of the corporation. I had a great team and for the most part the work itself was very satisfying.
good,"Firm provided opportunities to learn and develop methods for business transformation, both internally and for clients.    Dedicated and knowledgeable peers served as a great foundation and community with which to work.   Hardest part of the job...simplification and the challenges of aligning business units toward a singular strategy."
good,"Good place for starters , Managers without technical background , staff is helpful. Great medical benefits, IBM is not doing great financially for one n half decade and laying off."
good,"This is a test review I will submit on another date. This is a test review of IBM I will submit soon, tomorrow. Fun but hard working evironment as well"
good,13 hours work including 3 hours of travelling.I have learned Good communication skills.My manager was very cooperative and helpful.My co-workers become good friends and everybody loves me too.I was very hardworking and dedicated towards my job and i always complete my target on time.The most enjoyable part was the parties organised by company in certain period of time in our Cafeteria and sometimes in other hotels.
good,"Good company, great benefits. Due to industry, stability is a concern. very strong teams within the different brands.  training is an issue"
good,"IBM has been a great place for me to learn and grow. The job variety was awesome. This allowed me to make excellent contributions to every team to which I belonged.   This opportunity still exists, but is usually in the low cost countries."
good,"Starting here is great if you're trying to get your feet wet in the industry, not so much if you want growth and have an extreme passion to progress and learn new things."
good,"Work long hours. "
good,Decent company to work with is IBM.The branding is good and so is the culture.The salary and perks are too average.A typical day at work is decent.Rather all paramenets given are decent.
good,"Good company to start with but no job security. job nature is good. no overload. friendly coworkers. due to recession, lots of employees are getting laid off, no security."
good,work life balance is good. salary review is not good. managers are good and cooperative. process time is more. did not understand completely about the salary review process
good,"It's a good experience for me"
good,"With IBM's changes to their strategies most all jobs in the strategic server outsourcing area are being off-shored.  Great learning opportunities, no longevity for employment."
good,Had great team members including the management team that was on the account I was assigned to.  Great teamwork where each team member helps one another.  With budget cuts and reduction of staffing while continues to increase which makes it difficult to meet deadlines.  There is little time for work life balance as project has to meet deadlines.
good,Lot of work is moving off-shore to save money rather than remaining in US. Many positions allow work from home which is a plus. Recent lay offs are making for a very lean and challenging work environment.   Management is very cost driven and saving money in all aspects is a big driver.  It is great to work from home but the downside is never leaving your job and working long hours.
good,"Excelente empresa para adquirir conhecimento e experiência nas mais diversas áreas. Bom clima organizacional. Benefícios abaixo da  média. Alguns momentos de turbulências nas atividades, muita pressão por resultados para os executivos, trabalho excessivo por conta de péssima distribuição de carga e muitos ocupam cargos de gerência, despreparados para atuar com pessoas."
good,"Work life balance. Good for women employee. Work from Home only for majotory projects"
good,Good work life balance and hands-on work. Can learn many new technologies. People are very friendly and very co-operative.
good,"Working from home, monitoring and acting upon failed application jobs, problems with systems, helping clients do their work.  The 36 years I worked on this account (19 with BellSouth, 11 EDS/HP, 6 IBM) have been for the most part a pleasure. Hardest part of the job was watching my co-workers get laid off a few at a time during EDS/HP tenure.  Most enjoyable part was working to make 2nd shift as abend free as possible, streamlining job execution to prevent bottlenecks, abends and job schedule malfunctions"
good,"Jobs in IBM are not  secure for local Americans / Canadians in regard to business "
good,"Flexible place to work but management and salary benefits are not so good. Work culture is good,but not enough scope for new technologies."
good,Currently Going through Layoffs.  Corporate vision is changing in an attempt to remain competitive in the marketplace
good,"The numbers are the bottom line. IBM is trying to move as many US jobs overseas."
good,"Pocas opciones de promoción para colaboradores externos."
good,"Very busy. lots of traveling. Do RFP's "
good,"IBM was a place where i was able to learn new things and motivation was provided by our superiors to learn new things, involve ourselves and come out with a better understanding of the issues and earn fruitful result. Most difficult part of the job was to shift timings which resulted in some health issues otherwise good place to work."
good,"For many years it was a great company, respected their employees opinions and work. In the 37 years I obtained  knowledge in many fields, loved the supervisory positions over the last 27 years"
good,"Best Customer Satisfaction"
good,"Being the industry leader in many service and product , IBM has it's own advantage for huge resources and process but sometime that cause issue to get quick access and reach out to proper resources."
good,"IBM is good place to work, Work life is balanced. This is the place who don't worry compensation. Benefits are good. over all ins good company, Job Security is ok. Its not bad. Management and Job Culture is fine."
good,IBM é uma excelente empresa amplamente falando. Porem um dos pontos fracos seria a baixa remuneracao e como ponto forte tem a flexibilidade para se trabalhar ( home office)
good,"Its nice environment to work and learned so many skills both technically and functional also . I t improves my communication skills also and enjoyed new implementation projects in job . The hardest job i did in this company is production support to my last client . This compamy learned me so many things."
good,"El ambiente era genial, rodeado de gente de joven y de distintos paises. Me dio la oportunidad de conocer como funciona una empresa tan relevante como IBM y aprendi mucho sobre trabajo bajo presion, en equipo y muchas funcionalidades."
good,"I've worked on everything from networking technologies, to sales reporting and commissions, to monitoring of cloud-based web applications. IBM has nearly endless opportunities if you can handle the pressure."
good,"Prestigiosa empresa, con solidez y grato ambiente. Eficiencia en la atención al cliente."
good,"No comments. I do not wish to put my current work place on display."
good,"While IBM provides a considerable work life balance, there is high amount of inequalities in the salary ranges of like skilled and experienced people."
good,"You can learn new skills, good part is flexible work timings, work from home options,  co-workers are supportive, bad part is very less or no hike"
good,"Shift schedule was best."
good,"Excelente empresa para se contar com os benefícios, porém o salário está bem abaixo da média de mercado. Atualmente, com a crise, deixou de ser uma boa opção no mercado de TI, ainda demitindo muitos funcionários."
good,"Good work culture, people are polite to work with. But most of the people are not that competent. The most enjoyable part was working with my colleagues. Compensation is below national average. Lot of management emphasis on employee productivity. But IBM itself is struggling with lack of focus. Very limited career growth opportunities."
good,its been a good time working and learning at the institution.the shifts are fine if you are only into making money and nothing else. its hectic and fun during the office hoursat the same time .
good,"IBM is a very different place in the last several years. ""Respect for the individual"" used to be an important concept in IBM. With all the constant lay offs in the company, it has become a difficult place to work. This is really a shame as there are still some great people working at IBM."
good,"Everyone is siloed to their job where the overall business objectives are defined, but because of the vast matrixed company, there is a very rare expectation of executive promotion. As long as you do what you are doing well and duck the lay off train, you can have a long career and be happy at this company. You can have a successful career and be very lucratively comfortable at IBM, but don't expect to get rich."
good,I joined IBM in 1988.  All I can say is its different now.  There are some situations I have seen recently that have shocked me.
good,"I was employed at IBM within the Hertz building from April 1st 2008 to May 29th 2015, due to a outsourcing by the Hertz corporation."
good,"Arbetsdagen bestod i att kontrollera att övervakningssystemen fungerade, om inte så felsökning  också mycket kontakt med andra datacenter inom koncernen för att utbyta erfarenheter samt hjälpa till vid problem."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to keep my deliverables ahead of time with quality. I always enjoy extending my hand to my colleagues to be of help to any processes I am in full-knowledge.
good,Working a large amount of hours and long commute times to each project site is not conducive to a balanced work - life model.
good,My experience on an individual level was average. I appreciate the growth that I experienced and I can firmly say I am now a professional. Working a large account that has high turn over and a majority of contract employees makes for a greater than average work load on a frequent basis. Most of my colleagues we're great and we worked well together. It was an awesome experience to tackle a huge challenge in unison as a well oiled machine.
good,"IBM was a great place to work, but there doesn't ever seen to be enough workers making  the workload is heavy and there is a constant threat of layoffs (IBM calls them resource actions). It's difficult to get into new roles because most many other people are scrambling for safe harbor as accounts fail to renew and work moves offshore.."
good,"Estar presente numa grande empresa é um diferencial e tanto, porem certos processos engessam novas demandas e devido ao crescimento rapido e sem um controle, acabam por colocar pessoas em cargos gerenciais sem a menor nocao de como lidar com o ""negocio"" em si, incapacitando certas areas de serem produtivas e competitivas. Mesmo se autodenominando uma empresa Global, a IBM nao consegue agir globalmente, significando numa tendencia contra de seus proprios principios. Vc ve a IBM USA prosperando, se tornando competitiva, com novos desafios e novas demandas, q nao refletem em outras unidades, nem permite que as pessoas tenham essa interacao maior  por nao permitir mais Designacoes Internacionais que trariam o beneficio dos novos desafios e novas experiencias."
good,"Still a good company to have worked for, but IBM is no longer the great company with stellar product and service offerings it had."
good,"It was a very good start for my professional career. I had a pleasing first time exposure working for an MNC. I was moulded into a professional by the staff there. Learned a lot of valuable lessons like   daily productivity, quality results and building professional work experience. A good start for any fresher."
good,"Company going corporate wide re-structioning, not all divisions and management jumping on board. Makes for very tough working conditions."
good,Was pretty happy working at IBM . Pay was really poor realized that once I moved over to Wipro .Management needs to realize that the employees are a huge part of the success or failure of an Organization. No focus on employee satisfaction.
good,"A empresa no Brasil necessita de uma melhor organização em seus processos no relacionamento com  o funcionário."
good,"The current job seems to be okay , but need to work on some innovative technologies that would be helpful to the professional carrier."
good,Is a good place to start but company doesn't offer any advantages since they only have you or keep you as supplemental to become permanent is very hard.
good,Lot of learning but low salary. Difficult to maintain work life balance. Employees are expected to give 100+% and not expected to ask for salary hike.
good,"Equipe de trabalho muito boa, clima agradável. Sempre que possível há interações entre todo o time."
good,"Manage Storage Solutions on Daily Basis. Resolve issues in Timely manner."
good,The position I held provided me with great flexibility and the coworkers were all outstanding.  There was little chance of advancement due to the contract.  IBM cuts personnel 2 or 3 times a year.
good,"This company is very dynamic. The culture here is advanced, always looking for solutions to strive for better. IBM is a great company."
good,"Het bedrijf stimuleert de medewerker zich te ontwikkelen door het volgen van online cursussen en seminars te volgen (persoonlijke ontwikkeling is onderdeel van het beoordelingsgesprek.)"
good,I loved the people I worked with which made my time at IBM so much better.  it was a scary post recession environment with 0 pay increases but I stayed because I was happy with the overall work experience.  I left because it was time for me to move on and move up.
good,"Help Desk related activities."
good,"direciona para o atingimento de metas"
good,Great place to work if you are in a profitable arena. Culture becomes hostile in  a heartbeat when profit pressure increases. Overwork their employees.
good,Awesome place to work and great place to maintain personal and worklife balance. Day to day work is at its best and loads of learning opportunities. Over all its a great place to work.
good,Managers are not think in  realistic way.Always they are looking for extraordinary results.Even for freshers also they put more pressure with out knowing their situation
good,Great place to work with good people. Management is hands off as long as you are on a project. But don't expect to do the job you applied for. Applied for entry level Java app developer position and has done little to no development and I was the lucky one as for application development. Others in my group that hired in with me for the same position hasn't done any development. Which may be ok for some but definitely not ok if you have aspirations of becoming a software engineer.
good,"Generally a good company to work for when you are fresh out of school. "

good,"A typical day at work consists of fielding calls from NAB and Advantedge clients. Monitoring the email queues as well as our internal help desk system (ISM/Remedy)"
good,"IBM it's a good place to work but not one to do a career. It's complicated to handle the burocracy that exceds the normal amount of paper work thank other companies has."
good,"The people were great to work with. The work environment was a great team environment. "
good,"Heavily infused with politics to the point that it was very difficult to get anything done.  Toward the end of my time there, a typical day was filled with the same tasks that could be done by rote.  Almost everyone was fearful of losing their jobs, so they looked for ways to under mind their co-workers and make themselves look good."
good,"A typical day was to support training of Business Partners to sell IBM E-Commerce software.  This required at time extensive travel to business partner locations to educate them on the latest product enhancements, and available sales plays for their organization."
good,"Good Place to work for starters but you need to move on after a while otherwise you'll be sucked in to the system. "
good,"learned monitering of server,ITIL process and linux task."
good,"All the factors are nice except the salary & the transportation issues. "
good,"Working for IBM for the past two and a half years has been overall fairly positive. The company offers a multicultural working environment and huge networking potential. Also there are some opportunities in terms of free education for employees but always within internal mechanisms. It was also good to consolidate my Excel competencies and develop my skills with business analytics software like Hyperion, SAP or SPPS."
good,"It is good working here and currently i am working here for various accounts in the project."
good,It is our job in this position to verify IDs on our customers' servers and  the privileges associated with those IDs.
good,At IBM you work hard and top performance is rewarded. IBM does not pay the highest but offers flexibility in turns of being able to work remotely and flexing your schedule. People are encouraged to continue to challenge themselves and do not stay in the same position for more than two years.
good,Great environment for people who are curious and driven to always learn and hone their craft while helping others. There's no lack of things to do or get involved with. Lot of learning and It's up to you to manage your personal work-life balance.
good,el trabajo a diario en esta empresa es pesado ya que el ambiente es de mucho stress y en algunas ocasiones se falta al respeto entre compañeras por la tención que se vive en el puesto de trabajo
good,"IBM gives a boost to overall career and growth, one of those companies who actually values different work stream equally. I have personally learnt a lot on project management from this organization ."
good,Very organized organization to work with. Met people from all over the world
good,"had good experience"
good,Work place was awesome sophisticated advanced.but nature of work was not suited for my qualification. It was a BPO job international Call center does not match my studies. salary point of view was not satisfactory
good,"Efficency of work, fun at work, Lot of politics between employess"
good,Good Experience to work here and gaining knowledge with daily stuff.
good,"Mid career is problematic. No raises or promotions. You're pretty much locked into the job you start with. No money for training. Management is entirely metrics driven. Everything according to a spreadsheet. Period. Senior management runs the company like a hedge fund. Buy and sell companies, squeeze the cash out of them throw them away. People are an irritant to them, at best."
good,"Good place to work, work life balance, good skillsets, projects etc"
good,"Work load and the environment are Manageable and great! co-workers will become great friends and it is a fun place to work!  "
good,"Good salary and benefits, and on the surface offers many employee programs to further career and training, plus flexible working hours and locations.  HOWEVER: should you actually request access to these programs or increased flexibility, they then refuse all requests.  Beware if you have 'invisible' disabilities such as mental health issues: you WILL be discriminated against."
good,It was a learning experience in many ways.  I have a strong work ethic. Working as IBM employee helped raise my personal level of professionalism to a new high. I'm thankful I had the opportunity to  work for IBM.
good,As It was not in the home town. Coming to the job location & going back to rest room was too hectic. If it was in home town might be the burden lightened. Also Salary was too less. No company accommodation/Food was provided.
good,"- Co-workers"

good,"Low Compensation for FAs "
good,"Has best working environment."
good,"A typical day was sitting at computer, running diagnostics of customer designs and attending many meetings. "
good,"Working evenings, weekends and during vacation is expected. You work hard to develop processes, train off-shore employees in the processes, and then your job is given to them and you are left to seek out another job within 30 days. There is no job stability."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,The company is huge so it is not properly organised. No stable policy.
good,"Comfortable work environment with room to grow, very flexible schedules. Management was great and understanding when it came down to employees personal life"
good,"Compensation/Benefits are great, Job security is the scary part."
good,I loved working at apple care for the people that work there. The management was very nice to you but really bad at help there employers. They change your schedule  with out telling you. Force you do thing you did not want do. If they don't like you they will fire you for any reason. It was fun place to work all around because of people that work you.
good,My typical day at my jobs were working either in the office job. I learned a lot of different things that came in handy later in life. My managers were easy to get along with i didn't have any problems with them. My co-workers were nice to me and i got along with them and everyone was really nice. Their were some hard parts but i got around them with out any problem.

good,"It is good place to learn new skills as opportunities are plenty. However you have to work it through with your manager who kind of can shape or ruin your career. Very hugh company, too much process oriented which sometimes are counter productive."
good,"After working for this company for several years, there has been a steady decline in morale due to layoffs initiated by upper management and executives. Most times, a professional working environment with flexible work schedules, opportunities to advance, decent pay, and accrued vacation. A lot of hours depending on the projects assigned to. What used to be a career driven company, has turned into just a job."
good,"What was once a great culture, environment and workplace no longer exists - micro-focus on short term financial targets eliminates any ability to move business strategically, and sucks the morale out of the hard-working and intelligent people who know how to make it successful."
good,"Era possível trabalharmos em casa (home office), devido as atividades de atendimento ao cliente, podendo ser acionada a qualquer hora ou dia da semana."

good,"Global environment to work with. No geograhical boudries, Person need to be flexible with time changes. Work-life balance."
good,Your day was consistently running plans and expediting in product due to JIT and inventory levels that Lexmark was running to.  Your day would start with a critical list parts & supplies meeting.  You then would spend the day reviewing plans and updating as necessary to meet customer demand.  Then expediting and moving in shipments as needed. This helped me to improve my planning and purchasing skills.  Most of my Vendors were in Asia which give me a lot of exposure to World Trade Purchasing.  Our management team seem to change constantly due to the hiring of new people and managers being promoted.  The people I worked with were very good and worked as a team.  The hardest part of the job was the Inventory levels that Lexmark tried to hold.  It is hard to meet Customer demands when you are not aloud to hold sufficient inventory levels.  This created a lot of emergency shipments and movement of purchase with vendors.  Resulting in higher product cost. Getting to meet new people and some travel was one of the best parts of the job. IBM was a great place to work but Lexmark was a totally different employer.

I developed my project management skills from IBM Education Centers. Overall the management at IBM is very dynamic. Several times over the last few years analysts have predicted IBM's demise but it is still standing and profitable. Really enjoyed co-workers because they were highly motivated and skilled. The hardest part of the job was being add as the project manager of a project and the project had already been started. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with project team to successfully complete the project."
good,"it's good work with life balance, but for salary increment is very poor."
good,"O que mais pesou negativamente, quando a IBM ganhou o outsourcing de nossa  área da Gerencia do sistema de reparos , foi a condução dos superiores imediatos que promoveu mudanças inadequadas por falta de conhecimento dos processos de nossas áreas, gerando um clima de insatisfação geral."

good,"Good work environment at Job and Friendly work nature, Career growth and Management."
good,"Lean manufacturing / job instruction training "
good,"At IBM company it was a different task everyday procedures, In which you had different problems to resolve and learn how to resolve them in a timely manner. I gained alot experiences with working other departments on access on problem determination on issues. Great time was built on learning new materials within the networking farms and vlans equipment with WAN and LAN. There was a great bond within the team members."
good,"The biggest perk that comes with working at IBM is the flexible work hours. I sometimes start off my work day at 8:30AM and on other days I won't get started until 11:00AM. You are able to schedule your work hours the way you like, so long as the work gets done!"
good,"While I appreciated the ability to work from home, and the 401K match...that was about it for highlights.  Frustrating to get some issues resolved because there is no local human resource person, but you call a number and get someone in India to answer your questions.  You are given the right to review yourself....but your local manager seems to have no control over if you can get promotions or raises.  Its easy to get lost in the system.  "

good,"Average Company, Good projects, Average skilled resources, very few good managers."
good,"Reason, why i am not satisfied due to PayScale what they offered to me in 2.5 Years"
good,I have learned to be professional at work.
good,Era muito bom trabalhar da IBM.
good,It's a learning process how to use basic programs to help bankers to customers who need help on how to use Microsoft Office correctly. And sometimes they have a hard time understanding why a corrupted file won't open. Seriously?
good,"Handling up to 60-80 calls a day with customer querys, in accordance with their order placed online such as delivery, payment, invoice, return for refund. Placing orders for customers."
good,"your growth in every manner depends on ur manager so what all u have to do is have a ""yess boss"" attitude...all the benefit you possess is the brand name...."
good,good company to balance both work and personal life. But management is worst.
good,Good Pay and experience of Multiple Large scale environments
good,I have leaned a lot in IBM .My first work place where i started my carrier . . need to moniter the server 8 hours without a break is the tough thing . . enjoyable part is my team . .
good,"Interesting work environment, Excellent Training before Production. Job satisfaction and Job security guaranteed . Good incentives for best performers."
good,"Always busy, Follow guide lines management was encouraging there was never a dull day"
good,Very Challenging and rewarding environment.•
good,The Co-workers are good in IBM. Learned using Tools Like SABA.
good,"I could work at home or in the office, my co-workers were very friendly, the hardest part of job is overtime and time to leave, the most enjoyable part of the job is IBM sailing club"
good,IBM has gone too far in outsourcing jobs to lower paying countries. IBM has fallen quite far from its ranking as one of the best places to work.
good,"Fast paced, heavy phones assisting customers and field engineers."
good,"Highly motivated and results-oriented professional with extensive experience in a command center environment. Proven record of strong analytical, customer service and problem solving skills in an operations setting. Automating manual intervention to increase system efficiency and a reduction in human error saving both time and cost. Responsible for creating and maintaining documentation for system procedures. Attention to detail, quick learner with excellent time management skills which contributed to the team and consistently exceeded client expectations."
good,"I greatly enjoyed working with my group of colleagues. IBM's pay was competitive, but despite how profitable the company was during the year, the pay raises and bonuses (regardless of personal performance) was always well below the cost of living index."
good,A place where i learnt imp aspects of Team work. It helped me learn a lot of things with respect to processes and other areas pertaining to my area of work. It gives you ample opportunities to learn not only from your own skill set but other departments as well
good,"Global company with individual opportunity for growth, depending on division, skill set."
good,Quality co-workers.
good,Fast paced including client requirements as well as IBM. All employees are hard working and dedicated to the task at hand and what it takes to successfully solution every scenerio. Opportunity to learn procurement best practices from various clients.
good,Lots of analysis and KPI generation with exceptions identification
good,Its a good company to start. If you are honest to your work you can excel here.
good,The most enjoyable part was the team/group as we interacted daily face to face.
good,"A nice company to work for, if you feel secure. Very top heavy. Coworkers were amazing!"
good,** Cant share **
good,"After 7 years of hard work, I am being laid off. They are so focused on PTI and EPS that the work is being transferred offshore and the quality is steadily decreasing. Due to the terrible compensation packages, all of the great people with the knowledge and talent are leaving."
good,"I joined in the early 80's and that was a fantastic time to be an IBMer. Great working atmosphere GREAT people to help if you needed it. A sence of acompleshment when you got your work done. Yes you did have to work, but it was worth it. Your manager reconized what you did and thanked you for the job well done."
good,Management always in tune with my needs. Compensation was lacking a bit. Training provided to reach other areas of the company. Sorry to see CEO being replaced.
good,"Long hours, good pay.  Tech industry is competitive, overall, but IBM is emerging as a player in Cloud Services.  Personal development is in the employee's hands unless you are in development as an engineer."
good,The salary and benefits are definitely the best part of this job. Employees are treated fairly and with respect.  The job itself is easy but mentally draining. Sometimes you'll watch a line making one product for hours. That's a major con for me because I'm used to having a more physical job.
good,I was an outside contractor comishened to remove asbestos from the buildings I did not work directly for ibm so I’m not sure how they are to work for.
good,"Great organization to work for, extremely process oriented and hierarchy driven. Most enjoyable part was working on different brand campaigns, collaborative with partners and agencies and other global teams."
good,I had worked on 8 months experience at Ibm company full time. Environment is good work place. Work pressure is there and life salary is good. I have worked in data stage jobs.
good,"•	Attending weekly calls  to solve the queries of the clients,"
good,"working environment is healthy. "
good,"IBM is a good company which provides employees flexibility at work . "
good,fun place to work. highly recommend. Very friendly work environment. The company does a great job of creating a fun environment that also motivates people to be their best.  For example we had quarterly team exercises that are invaluable in getting everyone to work well together.
good,"Compensation is below industry standards"
good,"Good to work , culture is good with flexibility to work from home or work from any location in India . Work life balance is very much appreciated at IBM"
good,I had worked in AP profile and need to be mindful about the cost cutting factor. IBM don't have any past experience and expert management to handle to the finance process.
good,"IBM is so BIG that you cannot deny there is a role for each type of person.  However, the size of the company and the redundancy it creates generates more overflow of acquisition roles and nowhere to incorporate new employees who may be at the top of their game at their former company.  These individuals are set free to find their way, leaving the remaining employees without the support they used to rely on."
good,"Good benefits(HMO, Leaves, Gym?Medical Reimbursement, Group-Life Insurance). Inconvenient work location. No shuttle service. Shifting schedule. No career progress. Minimum to average pay."
good,"The culture varies greatly.  Depending on department, job function, etc... I have met many people who are extremely happy with their job, team, and management.  As a subsidiary of IBM, there was not a feeling of inclusion. I learned a so much about technology, management, and leadership."
good,"IBM like many big company, your experience is depended on the team and manager you are on.   I have had amazing team and manager who motivated you and helped you grow.  "
good,"Great Company, great people, great culture. how wonderful! Come work for IBM! Great Benefits, great access to develop business acumen. Good Leadership."
good,Very difficult to grow. Management is not good. Work life balance is ok. No hike. Good opportunity to learn. You can do work from home. Team is good. Project is also good
good,TEAM projects on time together everyone accomplishes more. Meetings keeping the group involved. Learning along the way. Morning beverage with collogues.
good,"Would like to preface this review with fact that I held this position back in 2014/15 and things may have changed since then."
good,Work culture is collaborative and energetic. Client base is undeserved to to lack of available resources. Brand growth has unfortunately not kept pace or matured in line with competitive landscape
good,Adds a brand name to your resume. It's a manager centric company so your growth depends on your relationship with your manager. Nepotism is widely found in the organization.
good,"Tiene trasporte para gran área del estado y comedor subsidiado ,algunas prestaciones."
good,Good work life balance. Lot of good managers are there who can understand theirs peers problem and try to help them as much as possible.But it is challenging when you will be on bench and no other than your contact can only help.
good,Enjoyed working with some best minds in the industry. Got opportunity to prove myself with the emerging technologies in the market and learnt new things.
good,IBM has a challenging environment filled with a lot of work but you learn a lot and employees can easily change career paths. Would recommend to a friend.
good,"CEO and higher management are more interested in their earnings rather than customer service and satisfaction. Middle management are scared, care less for their subordinates."
good,"The work life balance is really awesome.But the negative aspect of the company is that the pay scale is not well suited."
good,"Location relevant pay and above average benefits. "
good,"Unfortunately, IBM has struggled to rebrand and keep pace with modern tech companies. "
good,Alot of shouting during operation hours and micro managing. Frequent change of staff as people are unhappy with the work environment. Offers during interviews differs alot once you get the job.
good,"Good company to enhance the knowledge using the vast knowledge resources available at the internal  learning site."
good,"good place to work, where we get knowledge on different security tools and technologies. Its a great place to work , where we can enhance our knowledge on our respective domains"
good,"I learned so many things in IBM. How to managed stressful environment, multitasking and etc. How to handle irate customer, how fast you can collect the date over the phone and how to manage the interaction with the customer."
good,"I had my best learning time there, but the company does not let you grow up if you are in manufacturing, since it is very bureaucratic company"
good,"a normal helpdesk job, you wont be able to know the time you enter and left as there will be alot of calls to pickup. team lead and manager will be shouting to pick up calls."
good,"Poor current strategy and management team. A lot of time and effort is wasted in previous complex product lines. After the acquisition of Red Hat, all cloud related products need to be re-developed (on open-shift)."
good,Large company with many deeply ingrained systems that are sometimes challenging to interact with. It provides less than optimal support for remote employees.
good,Wrong fit for what I was looking for. Management was focused on bottom line. Clients a a poor perception of the company. Anticipated upside never happened due to poor perceptions.
good,"Glad I can work remote,  most people in this company cant.  Wish the upper management and lower management were on the same page.  The goes down or up dont match what  happens in real day to day."
good,"Not a Good Company to Work For"
good,"Not a good place to work, no or little support from Management. Do not care about employees,once you have done your job they find a convenient why to get rid off you."
good,Great Company to work with. Opportunities to excel and growth is a take away from this organization. They have presence in many major cities in India and are present in more than 150 plus countries
good,You will learn a lot about the corporate culture and how other IT companies basically copy and pasting them but IBM still remain a high investor-driven organization losing his value internally.
good,"Me surpreendeu que a IBM ainda utiliza e vente tecnologias antigas (Lotus Notes), e também me surpreendeu que a gestão / diretoria brasileira considera parceiros internacionais como concorrentes, sendo que é tudo IBM."
good,"Typical government job. Flexibility, less payment than market, job opportunities not much due to process constraints. No motivation. Work life balance good."
good,"good company, with management and colleagues .. as of now going good but need to get plan more about future technologies and waiting for opportunities"
good,"Good company. I am not sure about the review about. It is is not letting me through go further. Anycase, I had a short stint at IBM. it is a great place to work with."
good,"I have been working at IBM full-time for more than 5 years"
good,Good place to work with exceptional pay.  Wish the position would have worked out so that new hires were given an opportunity to showcase their talents.
good,"Seterus was a fast moving and complex environment, and was in the midst of an enterprise system upgrade while I was there. The office was quite cramped, with long rows of quarter cubicles. People were under pressure to fulfill their regular business duties and run projects for the enterprise upgrade. It was quite stressful for many."
good,"Worked : Interaction with offshore/onshore, requirement gathering, distribute work among team, team management. Participated in IBM Techathon and gave innovative ideas, got  awards and lots of appreciations from client as well as IBM."
good,It was a learning experience and very productive. Great workplace to grow your skills by attempting the training and courses conducted by IBM. Overall experience was great.
good,"Ovearll, it was a very bad experience working with IBM. Very immature managers, work life balance was not taken care, no hike for more than two years."
good,"If I could say anything about IBM, I would say that it is great for people that need a little extra on their resume or a place to sit for a while and find something more permanent.  Do not get me wrong, I loved working for IBM.  However, the one issue with the company is it is not a matter of IF you will be fired (or RA-ed as they call it) it is a matter of WHEN.  The company culture at the executive level sees the employees as a revolving door, where it is more beneficial to them to only retain people in spurts.  Do a google search on ""laid off by IBM"" and you will see what I mean.   That is not to say I wouldn't actually recommend it to certain people.  As I said, I loved my time there and knew this going in.    IBM looks great on a resume and opens many doors, but one must know that comes with the cost of literly having the sword of Damacles over your head every month.  The thing that makes it worse is being laid off has zero to do with your performance or skill level and everything to do with factors outside of your control.  Usually whatever contract they are currently working on.    However, on the positive side, the benefits are amazing.  The work culture aside from that is great."
good,no hikes past 2 years in IBM. I did good work but they are not given hike .in ibm they calculating the hike depends own market level.if market level reached then no one get the hike
good,"There is No structure, No training and No policies and procedures in place for New Hires!! It is the most difficult place I have ever worked!! Management need more training and leadership skills."
good,"Al principio era un lugar donde podias divertirte. Sin Embargo han perdio esa capacidad de resolver conflictos administrativos y no ofrecen competitivad. Se han quedado estancados. En lo personal creo que es unicamente una empreza que sirve como catapulta hacia otras empresas donde creo ofrecen mejores prestaciones."
good,"Had many issues with staffing cases. Too many new consultants, and not enough work being sold. Very difficult to get staffed on good projects. Unresponsive senior management."
good,"The culture varied across the divisions.  In my experience, the best years were correlated with high business unit performance.  The most enjoyable part of various jobs at IBM centered around the success of the team and the valued relationships that remain today with many of my former co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was delivering bad news to management regarding sales performance in the latter years, as the intensity of the competition increased."
good,Ping pong tables and agile workplace is a nice building to work in. The soda machine and snack bar is a big benefit. The people are Minnesota nice and pleasant to be around.
good,"No need to introduce BIG BLUE.  But did you know that it's all about Cloud and AI? It's like working in a start-up, cutting-edge every day!  Working with traditional Suisse customers on their digital journeys to disrupt their industry."
good,"* Scope for learning and development"
good,"Good organisation"
good,"Great history, but company is now facing tough compeition,  no one gets bonuses because company is constantly operating in the red.  they have a long way before marketing new proprietary products, that once made them a leader."
good,"Best place to work in India if you are looking for flexibility in your work schedule, When other players in the industry turning micro management - such as 9 hour swipe in policy, it is only IBM where you get 100% flexibility, I can firmly say that no one in the industry today can offer IBM’s level of flexibility"
good,"Good Life Work Balance facilities.  Good opportunities.  If the reporting managers look into the welfare of the team members, it would be the best place to work for"
good,You can grow if you want to in IBM.Its always gives you pride to be working for an IT Gaint. Internal job postings will be there..you can switch to your ideal role
good,Good working experience with good team members. Salary packages and hike is not as per expectation and its difficult to take leaves more then 5 in a month. In case you are having a ODC project then its difficult to take more leaves or in case of any emergency.
good,IBM are one among the leaders of information technology and i take great pride having been part of this organization. The learning experience in my journey with IBM has been immense and i can vouch for the fact the IBM would definitely be an amazing workplace for years to come in terms of learning and personal development.
good,Ever changing work environment. Lots of opportunities to explore new career paths. This company embraces change and has taken steps to remain relevant in today’s evolving market.
good,Good work / life balance.   Good compensation benefits.  Good job advancement.  Good management.  Good job culture.  Overall good company to work for.
good,"Managed Service technicians in 3 Atlantic provinces and also acted as Atlantic Client Advocate for major accounts.  Role was challenging and required 7x24 response.  The hardest paart of the job was the continuous fire fighting, the most enjoyable part was the teamwork and people."
good,"We were a very strong data center before AT&T sold us to IBM. We sat stagnant for a few years, before IBM decided to close the data center. I left us with a very unhealthy work atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work. Transforms corporate culture. They coach you on everything in the company or they do it themselves,.. staring with trust. Everyone trusts that their colleagues are bringing their best self to work. This results in a strong team environment that is very innovative."
good,My experience working as a contractor at IBM was overall a positive experience. My role changed several times throughout my experience how management was easy to work with.
good,IBM allowed for a balanced work and life to provide me with the best opportunity to succeed. I learned how to develop interpersonal skills along with honing my creative talent.
good,"Good team"
good,"IBM provides a very secure Job experience which resulted in working in a environment lacking creativity and Innovation. "
good,"Workplace was constantly asking more and management often wasn't happy with results. Projects were fun but were few and far between, needed more innovative work tasks"
good,Have to dedicate yourself to work here long term. Very specific skill set for the role. People have to work long hours on salary. Great if you start as an intern.
good,Did not get a chance for perm or benefits or long term supplemental . Others were in that fortune. That is where it was and had to be accepted.  I never got what would have been longevity even though contract went on for 7 years.
good,"I held a variety of professional positions during my 12 years at IBM. As you might expect, some of these positions were more fulfilling than others. My best assignment was two years at IBM Research in New York."
good,More work than can be finished in any given day!  My experience is limited to GBS only. Cannot speak to other parts of IBM.  Very matrixed organisation due to its size
good,"Overtime is required especially during payroll week."
good,"IBM is technology leader and there product are very great."
good,tech support for a variety of clients.  Great learning environment and engaged management. 24/7 support environment required in an incoming call center.
good,"Productive and fun work place, i have good work experience with IBM,"
good,It was an okay place to work. I think it depends on the territory you have. After I moved I had very little to no work for day to day operations. It became very boring.
good,Good place to work and ppl were all professionals and team work was highly desired. Hard working meet project dead line on time. if need to work beyond need schedule work hard to meet those deadlines as well/
good,"IBM is a large company with many talented employees. However, the culture of consulting, where sales rules, has tainted the experience. Management constantly sells projects with farfetched milestones, that ends up putting the suffering on the delivery team. Could really use a large-scaled replan of company direction and values."
good,Does not treat you well and long hours. Good benefits and nice perks if you are willing to put in the work. Good opportunities to travel and learn new skills.
good,"Good place to learn "
good,"not stable income and no a lot of change for advancement, management need to have a better way of making sure that the employees have a wokr life balance"
good,Good company to work with culture wise provided you have good management and job satisfaction. Larger teams and many opportunities to work. Getting into the right team with a good management is the key.
good,"Collected and analyzed data to detect deficiencies, duplicated efforts, extravagance, fraud, or non-compliance with laws, regulations, and company policies. Inspection of Oracle FI for financial issues. Examine and evaluate financial and information systems, recommending controls to ensure system reliability and data integrity."
good,"I have been working for IBM Watson Health for almost 4 years. "
good,Fun place to work and a lot projects give out different opportunity to build up technical skills as well as PR skills. Good place to work and a lot challenges to deal with as well.
good,"Quick-paced, busy, dynamic environment. Expected to drive to meet near-impossible results. Pay is not as competitive as other companies. But in general, the people you work with are great."
good,The role to which I was assigned at IBM was concentrated in global Treasury trading and management.  There was extensive exposure to all capital market instruments and operations.
good,"Not a nice place to work. Very poor work/life balance. Very much a dog-eat-dog culture. Accountable to IBM USA, unrelenting in demand for higher profits regardles of the exchange rate and country culture."
good,"Oprerations and implementation of PIM CyberArk"
good,"Job not secure due to layoffs. Long hierarchy. Not transparent with employees. Low bonus. Low payscale. Bad management, nobody knows who their Manger is."
good,"Nice place to work   got to learn so much."
good,"Rating IBM on a pass/fail metric would be a pass overall. There is a lot to like about IBM. The breadth of activities creates a lot of possibilities."
good,"Learning opportunities are enormous, flexible work life balance, Good place to work for women employees , "
good,"The culture is good and management spends time to make us understand the client and application, management understand and supports its staff, however process is slow and needs to be fastened and aggresive."
good,"IBM is not what it used to be , very high turn rate , the decision making process is broken , lake of vision from the company leadership , no competitive edge in any area"
good,"A good company, was able to improved knowledge and skills related to Workforce Management. Hoping to have more opportunities to grow internally though."
good,"IBM is the place you can learn and grow in your career. No pressure, management is helpful. lots of learning paths and links are available."
good,"Depending where you end up you may have a fun and exciting place to work, or it could be soul crushing boredom plagued by micromanagement."
good,"If you are looking for something good for your profile, you should consider this company. However, be prepared for unexpected tasks, quick turn-arounds, and politics within."
good,Company had great training.  Some good managers.  But lacked a strategy that everyone believed in.  The company had a lot of divisions and didn't really know how to leverage all that capability for the customer.  I went through several transformations each promising renewed and better ways to market.  They are still going through these transformations.
good,Needs to focus more on the fundamentals. good work/life balance. good people.  people usually try to help but can work faster.  not as globally minded as one would expect
good,"It appears that the new way of IBM is the Supplemental Employee.  Hire them for certain contracts without the possibility to advance or get a pay raise.  I am a current regular full time employee that was placed on a project with all supplemental employees and their rhetoric has been that of no chance for a raise.  Not only have I never received a pay raise in my four years, I was let go in the last round of layoffs.  (Resource Action)"
good,"No clear assignment and "
good,"No career progression, and was in the same or similar role for more than 5 years. Not much new training and learning opportunities."
good,A good place to work. The work week is very challenging and the workday is never the same.  Always learning something new and different. The work locations are constantly changing.
good,"working at clients sites during the contracting period.  it is beneficial in terms of understanding the needs and easy to communicate with clients."
good,"IBM is a good company, good benefits and work environment, I enjoyed working there. The work was busy and rewarding. I would recommend IBM to  others."
good,"We worked very hard at IBM, but we always felt like our jobs were on the line at any given moment.  A lot of the day-to-day experience will depend on your particular manager and if you are in a growing segment or one that is contracting and may be sold. "
good,"IBM is good place work but not good place to gain money. vey less hikes."
good,"The biggest problem with IBM was that they don't pay very well with little if any raises."
good,"I joined IBM via an acquisition and it was a proud moment. 3.3 years later, my team was laid off. It seems rudderless, unable to know where it's going"
good,IBM isn't the place for everyone.  Spent over 15 years before my job was eliminated.  Its common to happen at all levels and its just a matter of time when you're team and department are eliminated
good,"The dept I worked in was always changing, which was good just a lot to keep up with on top of everything else. Worked with a good team which always makes work more fun but a tough role"
good,Poor upper management with a constant change of priority and lack of focus. Lots of wast of money yet would not provide money on things that were needed. Bought companies and ran them into the ground and lose of customers.
good,Overall IBM is an OK place to work if you are fine living in an environment where you could loose your job at any time despite being a star performer or not and regardless of the number of years you have worked there.
good,IBM is a huge company with a focus on many things.  The Managed Web hosting service in Managed Apps was purchased from AT&T (which was purchased from US Internet).
good,"Pros - ability to telework full time, access to online educational resources, good coworkers"
good,"As a new hire, I found myself working over 50 hours a week and performing tasks that were not related to technical or expanding my technical horizons.  On the top of that very slow increases on the salary.  By quiting and moving to a contract position, I immediately trippled my yearly salary which learning and expanding my techincal vitality."
good,IBM is struggling to grow bottom line revenue while facing competition in many fronts (different product and software groups). Management is struggling to find the balance between grown and cost cutting.
good,"Pros: There is work life balance in IBM"
good,"Working through a transformation is not easy, but rewarding when you succeed. IBM is currently going through a transformation, IBM Systems is in a fiercely competitive market place, and having the full backing of resources in North America is key to success."
good,Nice company to work for. As a help desk only contract with very little option to grow. I work there for several month in a Call Center Culture. Working at IBM was valuable experience
good,It was cool to work for IBM until they started slashing the benefits that we were entitled for working long hour shifts and week-ends. Then raising the insurance premiums.
good,IBM is the leading B2B brand in the world.  IBM woks hard to make sure it is well regarded.  My business unit leadership took good care of us and always went to bat for us.
good,It has been far too long for me to comment on IBM.  When I was there in the 1990s it was a great place to work.  My peers who are their now do not seem happy.
good,"Exciting projects, too many layoffs to be confident in your employment. Excellent international opportunities with quality training.  Great place to work if you like project based contract roles."
good,"I worked for IBM for 3.5 years,"
good,"Job Security - good company to work for - due to customer requirements this job was not conducive to work/life balance. However, in all fairness, I have not worked there for over 20 hears and I don't have any idea what it is like currently."
good,IBM has come a long way from the stories you hear from folks who have been with IBM for 30+ years. Long gone is the opportunity to create a job for life and build upon any relationships you may have had.
good,"I found the environment to be stressful and less than rewarding.  It seemed that IBM only cared about their shareholders, and little to noting for their staff or clients.  I couldn't wait to get out."
good,"Buen ambiente Laboral."
good,"Good place to work with"
good,I was a contractor with IBM. I was part of a team that did Risk Assessments for new applications and re-certifications. I worked remotely during the whole contract.
good,"My time at IBM was tumultuous and difficult, and extremely rewarding. I am thankful for how IBM prepared me to be a global business leader and to create value across industries and technologies."
good,CGS was a contractor for IBM helpdesk.  IBM put down unreasonable expectations on the contractors. It wasnt bad when I first started but at contract renewal time the IBM expectations were unrealistic and made CGS a sweat shop.
good,Fairly helpful place to work. Not a bad work enviroment pay was not good at average making around 10.00 an hour. Work was easy but fast paced and depending on the customer very stressful.
good,"In my 7years in IBM, I had the pleasure of working with different people with diffirent backgrounds and culture worldwide."
good,"Originally, the hiring manager that interviewed me explained that the position was a network architect position. As I started my daily routing, the position started to reveal to me as a project manage position. With the sour taste in my mouth, I existing the job quietly."
good,"over all OK since I was a contractor so not many things that I could enjoy."
good,"Only advantage is the work from home facility, but growth opportunities are limited and lateral options also are limited.Hence, not that great a place to work."
good,"Job at IBM was good while it lasted. When company was sold, it went downhill. Company switched from no punch clocks to having punch clocks. Cameras were put everywhere and your every move was scrutinized."
good,I had great learning opportunities and good ambiance while working at IBM. One concern I noticed is the firing attitude of the company and obviously the yearly increment was also a concern.
good,"In general, IBM was ok for me.  The company itself wasn't all that great, but my team was good.  Everyone was friendly, and willing to help, but hearing about layoffs all the time in IBM was a little off-putting."
good,It have worked with IBM for two years. The Management was not that effective as after getting married I moved to England but I did not get the opportunity to work over there resulted leaving IBM was the only option left with me.
good,"Manage Software customization, IT Infrastructure and Network engineering Projects from initiation to service transition to develop, upgrade, fine-tune, secured, backed-up, re-categorize, migrate, validate and implement Social S/W (Web/Mobile app) using Cloud / Digital technology and IT Infrastructure H/W (Build Serves, NAS/SAN Storage, Network, and Firewall) solutions by following ITIL methodology"
good,"Great place to work and be associated with, but a  forever changing  environment and always unsure that there will be a job for you there. Although, having their benefits were  the most worthwhile in this present time."
good,"There are 2 typical days, one during close cycle and one not during close cycle. During close I will show up at 7 and leave around 5-6. During this time there is a lot to do in a few days so it is stressful and fast paced. When it is not during close a typical day I arrive at 8 and leave at 4. There is not much to do unless you have certain requests. Work life balance is great. Management is very encouraging in any direction you desire to move."
good,"Nothing I can say right now could possibly be relevant now, considering I worked there 15 years ago.  Entirely uncertain why rating a company is a mandatory thing."
good,My pay changed a few times working there and I wasn't able to get a stable 40 hours a week.  I don't have enough to say so I'm jjust going to fill out this.
good,I was only sub contracted to IBM so none of these questions are relevent. i cannot expandmy answer to meet the minimum of 150 characters. extra extra extra
good,I cannot believe they make you do this.  It is 10 to 4 and I have to drive to a meeting at 4.  This should be optional indeed.com.  I feel like a hostage.
good,"Excelente compañía, muy buena gente. Ambiente adecuado."
good,"Every day is fun with having good teammates around to always guide and support you. The culture here is amazing and full of diversity. However, IBM has been a wonderful company for me."
good,"IBM is the company which balances your personal and professional growth.It believes in employee recognition."
good,"Best part is that company trusts you for the hours you work, so there is no in-out time captured. We get to learn how to take ownership of any work, how to delegate work. Company rating and reward policy is very enigmatic i.e. person with top rating may never get salary increment for that year."
good,"International Business Machines Corporation is an American multinational information technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries"
good,Work place ethics could be focused in future so that there is lot of peace within the team while working. Partial treatment among members of team could be avoided and work need to be allotted equally among members without the intention of giving headache or pressure to one specific member.
good,"Overall there is good work life balance."
good,The work life balance in IBM is very good. Very less pressure to work. Technology advancement depends on client if you are working for IBM GBS. Salary and other perks are very less.
good,IBM was good company and provided good benefits while I worked there.  I was part of a resource action in 2015.  I enjoyed my positions over the years working at IBM.
good,"After the Tutorial and Architecture guide, you'll be ready to continue exploring Angular on your own through the other guides and references in this documentation set, focusing on the features most important for your apps."
good,"Not much tech development in the interal departments."
good,"Good Work-Life Balance"
good,"I am not interested in talking about IBM. It was a good company to pass time."
good,"With good people, a lot to learn from. Can be too big of a company at times. Working from home has been just about eliminated, office culture can vary."
good,"GPromotes people that treat staff badly, good people are retrenched. Hires people as contractors so they get NO benefits at all and in fact are treated as employees, no independance at all."
good,Ein Guter Arbeitsplatz um vieles zu lernen aber sie respektieren die work/life balance nicht.
good,Currently work here. Experience depends on Client and Manager. Individual experience might differ. Due competitions in all sectors cost cutting efforts wide spread.
good,"IBM has a decent management. During my tenure here in the company, I have felt that the HR structure needs work, especially with the magnitude of the workforce that the company hamdles. It is only moderately employee-friendly, with some job security."
good,IBM has gradually begun replacing services positions with offshore resources which has caused a drop in quality.   This quality drop has affected IBM's ability to grow revenue.
good,Lots of bright people but management doesn't reward hard work.   Commission structure is not lucrative.  Leadership from the top is not inspiring.   Certainly not the IBM it used to be.
good,"Good place to start career in IT sector, Great people"
good,"Good Company  Work hard and learn allot.  Travel alot, but to interesting places.  Amazing you can find an expert on any subject.  Great COE for project management."
good,"Emploi très intéressant"
good,"IBM was one of the greatest places to work until about 1990. Visionless management lead to many problems starting in the mid-80s. Then the wheels fell off and it was not longer the great company it had been. "
good,"I was removed due to there being issues with Temp agencies  at the time..I think them laying off people for that wasn't good. But over al, it was a bad working environment."
good,"I enjoyed working for IBM.  I started out as a word processor, and eventually, was promoted to Account Administrator.  I worked in my local area, then cuts were made, and I was told my job was in another area.  I did not want to relocate because of family ties."
good,"This was an internship so there was not much insight into the company's policies, culture, or working style. People seemed happy working there from what I observed."
good,"Decent Company, but delivery model is not good. They can improve the appraisal model and can provide better increment to the resources. Also the yearly incentive could be improved."
good,"Flexible work time."
good,"Good place to work and enhance your career. "
good,I learned alot working at IBM and met a bunch of great people. The pay was really great but the required overtime that never seemed to come to an end was a little bit of a burn out for some people.
good,"This is a great place to work and learn. You can work on different projects and different industries.  You have a lot of training either in class or self-paced.  The vacation is not bad and some work from home time. "
good,IBM of the 21st century is no where near the place to work that it was in the 1970;s- 1990s. They lost their commitment to their employees somewhere in the late 1990s. Been gone for 9 years so thinga=s may have changed but the company is so big that I don't it.
good,"This subsidiary doesn't exist in UK for the moment. Only France got this kind of practice. "
good,"one of the best company to work at  leader on innovation but lately they does not show a good strategy or employee growth "
good,"Clear scheduled work day."
good,Todo está muy bien buen ambiente no hay mucha oración
good,"I wish I could work in fun and flexible work space with colleagues that I can learn a lot from. I have graduated on Electrical engineering but I have a strong desire to improve myself in a way of Finances, Sales and Marketing."
good,Really must pick what you say and do wisely. Co-workers will throw you under the bus for any reason in hopes of currying favor with management. People always nervous about layoffs.
good,"It was great work at IBM . Learned so many skills like as oracle sql, linux, middleware activities.. Handled 3 application at a time and was the part of change deployment, meetings"
good,When I first joined IBM the employees and the customers were the top priority.  Not the priority is the stockholders which diminishes the quality of the products.
good,"just the best startup companies for any fresher, with good overall exposure to all the live technical scenarios on day to day basis enriching overall carrier."
good,"IBM as a leader in the software industry has died.  IBM has slowly killed the many enterprise level products that it acquired over the years.  Many great products, many great engineers, and many great customers all gone because of misdirection by IBM Executives who think they have all the answers about where the industry is going."
good,While it is very fulfilling to work with many talented people the organization can be difficult to navigate. There seem to be 3 to 4 managers for every person in the company and very little can get accomplished very quickly.
good,This is a high paced work environment that evolves as business changes. They encourage personal skills growth to keep up with new missions for the company. Must be able to work with cross functional teams globally.
good,I have worked as a contractor for IBM for more than 15 years with the hope of becoming a full time IBMer always dashed or postponed due to budget cuts and hiring freezes. It paid the bills and the people were friendly but they do not reward hard work and dedication like they should.
good,IBM is a good place to work if you join here with good experience and pkg as IBM is not a very good payer in the market + the growth is really slow.Rewards and Recognitions are very rare
good,"Since it was my job in career and I was like a beginner for corporate world. I didn't notice how fast this one year past with this company."
good,Being DBA have deployed and managed multiple database environments. Worked with entry level developer community development and guided them on performance tuning.
good,"great team culture, supporting their staff with good training. promoting agile environment, supporting creativity. great staff plans and career road map,"
good,"Sales group had trouble arranging engagements. They messed up the information needed. Also, they sold engagement time without knowing the problem and customer needs. As a consultant, I had to rescue more than one."
good,"I was working as a consultant for at Vodafone Turkey and there was a lot of job pressure and none of Ibm managers took action for it. They were supporting it. THere were no tables for outsourcesto work, just find yourselve a place and work. And endless work hours day and night."
good,"Great upper management"
good,"Handling customer’s complaint of mis-sold insurance, gathering information, escalating customer issues with different levels of support and drafting the letter to the customer for settling their amounts that they receive accordingly."
good,"Very high expectations from this company because of its reputation, great benefits but if you are a consultant be prepared to work at minimum 60 hours a week. Very demanding position that requires travel, lot of time away from home and somewhat difficult to get promoted. No micromanagement, they expect you to govern yourself..which can be good but it also is hard to build connections with your managers when you dont see them, often due to the travel."
good,Work environment is good and it is good fro women employees. Flexible shifts and work from home option is there. There wont be much pressure during working hours.
good,Salários baixos e baixa possibilidade de crescimento profissional
good,"A typical day at work for IBM was a casual work environment, not stressful at all. Flexible start time between 7am and 9am, no lunch required depending on your manager."
good,Excelente management. Muy buen clima de trabajo en equipo
good,"Great place to work. Lot of new technologies learnt. AGILE methodology implemented, automation, COG3, RPA were new technologies learnt along with automation tools such as win-auto, blue prism etc. "
good,"Can change the work timings anytime"
good,My experience was stressful - but it was at a challenging time so anything things have changed - idnk - seems like another lifetime ago though. I hope the best for everyone.
good,"you work for everybody who is lax"
good,Disorganized at lower and upper levels of management. You do get the chance to work with some experienced developers and facilities are nice. Experience will vary based on product team.
good,I recommend to assign new roles and responsibilities to people who are intended to get. Nice place to work here though.. it keeps me busy which I like
good,"Adopting solutions that meet the immediate needs of clients is the driving factor that underlines each and every goal, this is revisited on a quarterly basis.  Hard to see longterm strategy when priority is always given to the immediate quarterly results."
good,A typical manufacturing job. Really liked my job until they moved manufacturing overseas and I lost my job. Only good thing was I was able to go back to school.
good,"Good management and innovative place to work. The job site can be upgraded, meaning the buildings are older. However, the interconnections between the buildings are very nice. The tools used to support your job functions are updated regularly and security is high. All-in-all it is a good place to work."
good,IBM was and is a good place to work and grow ones professional skills. The opportunity to work with people from all over the world makes you appreciate other cultures.
good,Empresa estável porém sobrecarrega demais funcionários internos com pouca promoção (depende da dedicação de cada um) comparado a demais funcionários entrantes do mercado.
good,"Work from home supporting IBM customers around the globe. Fast paced, stressful. Can't say anything bad that you don't expect from a LARGE company.  ."
good,"Offers good benefits, employees are commodity, Communication of company direction and how individual roles support the company direction is poor.  Company is complex to navigate for career purposes."
good,"Working here was good and learned a few things about Customer service in a voice process and for a telecom company."
good,"The IBM consulting business model is structured so that IBMers who work as consultants in some positions may work from home which is very nice, no commute."
good,"A IBM foi uma grande escola para mim, sua cultura organizacional é impecável e o plano de carreiras também."
good,Great company to work for if you came through the right door; The IBMers are provided tools to grow in their chosen career path and the worldwide footprint gives them a wide range of opportunities for growth.
good,"IBM is very much all about the metrics.  Lots of emphasis on reporting and data collection.  Management did not show much interest in their employees' day to day experience or what customers thought of their service.  All efforts to improve were focused on the reporting side.  Customer service improvements and training needs were rarely addressed."
good,"Employed at IBM for approx 12 years. "
good,"Es una empresa dentro de todo flexible en cuanto a la parte humana. Por ejemplo si tenes que ir al doctor, te dan el tiempo que necesites. Pero a la hora de reducir personal son fríos, como cualquier multinacional."
good,After training you are required to work directly on the floor with minimal shadowing in a very stressful environment of dealing with irate customers or sitting doing absolutely nothing for hours on end.
good,"IBM has good people, but it is like any other very large corporation with bureaucracy. While many areas of IT are included in IBM services, it's difficult to move around."
good,"In IBM I learnt there solving the complex problems. It advanced me to enhance my technical skills."
good,"Just a lot of icons with not much else to do. There was a lot of free time, but the staff seemed to just be getting smaller day by day. Also, the developers didn't take the UX designer's arguments that well..."
good,"Good Company to work with lots of People with great skill"
good,"It's busy day almost every day as handling more than one projects which are from totally different scope.  If there were a capable immediate who can guide the follow staff, that would be much more benefits for organization as well as for the staff."
good,As usual...Management and leadership ought to be focussed .A good management and leadership is the key of success . Best resources may not be helpful if the leadership fails .Nothing much can be done without the right leadership in place. Leasership will be the key factor for any company to succeed and the leaders in the market are from the same pool and same attidue .As usual
good,"- Good Management and learning opportunities"
good,"Strong focus on delivery"
good,"IBM requires employees to work at least 44 hours a week.  Depending on your  project, you can set your schedule and working from home is allowed.  Coming into IBM as a mid-level manager is not a great way to grow in the company.  Coming in young or as an executive seems to be a better approach."
good,"The company's management has changed over years and its all manager owned now. Only advantage is having few flexibility like WFH,leaves etc. There is less opportunity for learners"
good,It was a very boring job and I did not enjoy working there.  Management did not communicate with us and they did not hire permanently.  I would not refer anyone to IBM.
good,"The company has a vast employee base. Managing the available workforce and mapping them to the requirements is a challenge in this organization."
good,Really good place for work. But HR department need to be in touch with employees as it is completely managing by managers now and should give opportunity to employee to work on his interested technology
good,"24x7 position requires alot of planning with clients we home office self manage our work loads and our clients ."
good,Nearshore model ended up having Atlantic Canadians working longer than their Ontario counterparts but also working for a lot less money. Management didn't really care about employee wellbeing or work life management.
good,"- Good Company to star with"
good,"They have nice parties/events but we actually share works space, like we share desks! We do not have our own cubicle. That can be challenging. The salary could definitely be better for contractors considering we do not receive any benefits."
good,"It was a pleasure working with other IBMers, but it was difficult to plot any career advancement. Between transferring of work overseas and consistent layoffs or non-renewal of contracts, it was a challenge to feel secure in a job role"
good,"Working at IBM reminded me of eating oatmeal. It was just fine. Nothing stood out as amazing, but nothing was earth-shattering terrible either. The best thing about it, in my opinion, is the maternity/paternity time, which was substantial (3+months for the men, 4+ for the ladies). Other than that, if you just did your job and were not lazy, you'd be fine."
good,"Lots of off time with little to no progression on projects. Projects are badly broken up and daily agile ""scrums"" last an hour. Team members are knowledgeable but not used to full potential."
good,"Good working enviroment, good place to work, although the salary could be better. Vertical company."
good,"Company is Good but not good salaries hike. "
good,"IBM has a portfolio of products and services which encompass the breadth of IT , hence it is ideal for someone who wants to explore IT."
good,Average workplace just like any other Information Technology services company. Some very old clients which provides good learning experience. Decent work.
good,"Nice things to learn ,"
good,"IBM was a third party vendor for Amgen.  Performed similar duties as with Amgen, however employment was with IBM.  Benefits were ""ok"" and the management was substandard."
good,"We started out as an ad agency and it was the most fun, positive, creative place I had ever stepped into. IBM iX tried to keep things creative but have slowly stripped that away from our Columbus office and we have lost a lot of great talent because of it."
good,"Good workplace."
good,"Challenges with product growth and near/future vision. Competition within the Cloud, AI, Security and Management space is having significant impact on business growth"
good,"Challenging and Innovative "
good,"Day to day managerial activities, People management, System Operations. managing various projects in a Global Service Delivery / Outsourced Model in the area Infrastructure Management Services with excellent knowledge on Delivery Management, People Management, Operational excellence, Transition Management and Mainframe System Operations"
good,"Good benefits. OK team work. Management styles vary from the totally hands of and empowering, to the worst micro-manager/controlling. Executive levels follow suit, some can be used as role models, others not always match their talk with their walk. It's ok to work for if you have the goals of getting what, and to where you need, and then move on. I would abstain of an answer if asked about recommending it as a place to work."
good,"always working on your scope, if not, you can sigh them to relevant team"
good,"one can learn a lot of technical things in the company, but innovation here is very limited.Hardest part of the work is trying to make innovation as this will make senior people out of the comfort zone."
good,"It was a good place to work. Great management, excellent teamwork, clear communication and expectations, great environment. I'd come back any time at all."
good,IBM is a big company that you can move laterally in if you wish to move to something else. Depending on what you do you many never see your direct supervisor as in my case.
good,"top down oversight management little freedom for creativity in approach, overwhelming clients with too many meetings and attendees, recent changes in employee demographic implies ageism"
good,"This is a great organization to be apart of, but they are lacking culture wise. Managers should be a resource to help new hires become  acclimated to the company, however, that is not the case. The lack of help and access to resources is a reoccurring theme."
good,The old saying goes the only thing that is constant is change! That IBM certainly lives up to that. They change their mind every six months. They are never sure what they want to do. Kills the team morale.
good,Our contract included a 10% cost annual cost reduction for the client.  That translated into regular layoffs.  Knowing that it's you or the person working with you that's likely to be fired led to a very stressful work environment.  People were reluctant to share knowledge so as to remain necessary.  People were on call 24 x 7 x 365.  People couldn't take an uninterrupted vacation....
good,"I started as part of the CBD program IBM has been doing for years. A 2 year ""mentorship"" where you get the opportunity to learn consulting work with a bigger safety net. The jobs were inconsistent at best. IBM is definitely one of those ""too big to fail"" companies that's on the brink of collapse. It's no longer the powerhouse IT company it once was and has long lost any real competitive advantage."
good,"Typical day: 9 hours shift, Work from home is big blessing."
good,Had a great time there as a administrator and would love to work from home again being that I have 7 children and their growing up is precious in every way
good,Taking new graduates. Working on call which did not provide stable income. It helped me to gain more experience and implement education. The first job after school
good,"I have enjoyed working with a wonderful group of colleagues. As a working mother for many years, my flexible work schedule at IBM has also been a tremendous benefit.  Unfortunately though, because the senior management seems to be internally-focused and out-of-touch with the external marketplace, resources are spent on low-yield development activities--thereby resulting in products that consistently fail to meet customer expectations.  This makes it extremely difficult for even the most competent sales teams to meet their sales targets."
good,"IBM has a lot of potential but under the current Management the employees will not get the chance to find out, "
good,Will be hectic. Can learn things due to opportunity one gets in daily course of work. Management is very poor. Sub standard people are elevated and allowed to take nasty decisions. Work culture is OK.
good,Within the various teams working conditions range from good to bad. Its a giant company so along with that comes various cultures and styles. There isn't a lot of consistency other than mind-numbing bureaucracy and a general resistance to change.
good,"La empresa cuenta con mucho conocimiento en todos los layers, dispone de excelentes procesos pero por la burocracia y la rigidez de la implementacion de los mismos carece de la flexibilidad necesaria"
good,"I worked as an intern, as such my experience at the company is limited. However I would say the experience was decent. I respect IBM for providing opportunities for young people to grow and learn new skills, this is something not.a lot of companies do. The work became a little repetitive, it would have been better if they offered rotational programs. However things could have changed by now. Overall, a good place to work"
good,"Revenue driven workplace. If revenue objectives are not met, Resource Actions take place. The Watson Customer Engagement brand has struggled since 2016."
good,"It was great until my job was off shored. Once my job was off shored, my job was more about training the off shore team than anything else. I was managing a team abroad with out the title or pay of a manager."
good,"It was a great career opportunity, but training and advancement were difficult as a new hire. Training (regarding certifications) seems to be more available to the senior staff. They promote family first, but really expect you to put a lot of your free time into you career."
good,Not the best place to work at any longer. IBM started to off shore their support even when they knew that the knowledge level of the off shore teams were not even near the level of knowledge with the US Help desk to just save money.
good,"***  Not much Innovation promoting"
good,"I joined an intern, they hardly have a real project for interns and colleagues are not friendly as well. Working environments not so good, every day is stressful."
good,"The company has a good product roadmap where they are trying to innovate their existing technology and align it to technology innovations like the internet of things, artificial intelligence and machine learning"
good,"Because it is a social network for companies and helps you communicate, collaborate and create strong relationships with more users. You stay connected in the office or mobile device. Not a real review."
good,"Developed marketing programs and met quota up of $4MM from the full line of IBM hardware, software and services. Project manager responsible for technical selling, designing, installation, and support of IBM systems."
good,"good experience working in IBM but very less growth in this company."
good,I interest the job and a time west for my hous time and college time is 11am to 5pm so my time is west. So enjoin to my job time and college time so no free
good,"IBM as a traditional IT company provides a good working environment. But in recent days IBM has laid off employees in a very stressful manner."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance - 3.5/5"
good,"It has nice work culture and very well aligned management. there is always enough to learn at the work place. Though, at this point electronics division is being given to GF."
good,The company has gone down in terms of employee morale and loyalty. I believe it is largely a result of very poor executive management over the last decade.
good,"IBM is a great company to learn in. It is at the cutting edge of technology and offers s great atmosphere to learn new skills."
good,Overall Good work environment. Could not find a project in New Jersey or New York. Travelling is the major disadvantage. Managers are not co-operative.
good,The processes and procedures are complex and need a lot of approval to do something different in the company. Career advancement opportunities are bounded by one's previous experience.
good,"The management is supportive, intellectual growth depend on type of project. Peers are good and supportive. Salary hike genrally depends on performances"
good,"With down sizing efforts in place, not a fun place to work. More senior staff get let go and the work falls to less experienced staff. However, this is not considered by the teams we must support."
good,"Good Place to work, Good Place to learn new technologies, Has a global presence easy to get new job and account. Except Management in few account not supportive enough company overall is very good."
good,This company is able to offer a lot of benefits and resources to get the job done.  They are also pressured by stock price.  It operates a very strong business culture and people are one of many resources that can be increased and decreased based on the state of the business.
good,IBM is under transition to the Cloud and thus is creating a large volume of change.  Size of services is decreasing due to Cloud transition.  New leadership will help.
good,"Happy to work. "
good,"IBM è un azienda molto grande in cui sono in atto molti cambiamenti e innovazioni anche interne."
good,"Good company to work for as long as it was not contract work. Good management, enjoyed co workers. The hardest part of the job was maintaining job security."
good,IBM is a good firm to work for but the job security is something that the management focuses on. Everything is focused on tactical front and strategic.
good,"Currently working in IBM"
good,"When I was first hired 5 years ago things were great in the field. Sure workload was high due to clients and installations; however it has all started to go down hill. Automation systems attempt to route service calls adding layers to our daily tasks and organization. Raises are non existent unless you count overtime as a raise. The team is great and the first line manager too. However to change out of the team is nearly impossible. Executive management has made poor business decisions leading to our customers suffering and at the same time our morale heading down hill. Has room to be great again but the nonsense must stop and we should get back to putting customers first and actually serving our employees....raises, morale, flexibility, coverage."
good,"join as a technical help desk by assisting the hardware and software issue attending phone calls and to trouble shoot customers queries and related problems and reset user computer and application problem from the remote desktop. "
good,"We assembled computers: Laptops and Desktops. We tested hard drives, sound cards, video cards, system boards, and many other component that go into the PC and Laptops. I leaned a lot about PCs and Laptop."
good,"Peoples from all over the world (countries such as Malaysia, China, India, Philippines, Europe, USA, Indonesia, Japan, etc) are working in this company."
good,"IBM is a good company but you need to pick what division you work for carefully. Avoid Global Services, all about billable hours and they will shoot down transfers if you are still billable on a dying account. Benefits are great and there is still a luster on being an IBM-er. Also good for the resume if you need to leave."
good,"Productive and fun loving place, I started my career as MF Systems programmer at IBM, I was provided extensive in depth Knowledge in MF Systems Programming ."
good,Spent a lot of time on administration instead of innovation. Leadership was always frantic and overworked. No communication between acquired companies that augmented each other within the same solution set.
good,"it was ok to work there, management was all about $$, i left and my former coworkers said its good that i left when i did because management started getting worse, didnt really care about the employees"
good,Nice place to work but no salary hikes and very difficult to change technologies. Lot of opportunities to learn newer technologies related to IBM. Good work life balance
good,"My typical day at IBM consisted of conducting technical and operational analysis of capital spending, budgeting, and tracking using advanced accounting application modules within SAP and its feeder subsystems, Capital Tracking Facility and Ledger Systems.  I was basically analyzing and interpreting complex data identification of issues and development of alternate courses of action with recommended solutions."
good,ano a ano IBM contrata profissionais menos experiente e mais baratos
good,"IBM is a good place to work, but it has become a risky place to be with layoffs happening all the time.  Some of the brightest people end up in the wrong place at the wrong time."
good,"Not worth for a fresher joining the IBM Global Business Services division. The compensation is too low and not much career advancement opportunities available. Band upgrade takes too long.  "
good,The people you will work with are some of the best in the industry but management is top heavy in some areas and strategy is difficult to get moving. The bureaucracy can be very painful at times. GBS need to become more nimble.
good,"Experience at IBM is pretty meh"
good,Seem to buy out companies and stagnate the products groeth nstead of creating from within. Lots of meetings. Good place to work if what you are working on is making money.
good,"IBM acquired Ustream and folded it into its Cloud Video BU. Unfortunately, the business has lost momentum, resulting in a series of layoffs and an unsettled culture. The folks who remain are terrific and are working hard to drive business and stay positive."
good,"Was bored with new opportunities, very pressurized atmosphere. communication needed much improvement, although the people there are very nice and helpful and try to be as professional as possible. no advancement opportunities in my department."
good,"I worked for IBM for a total of 6 years, as a marketing communications manager. My responsibilities were to manage communications campaigns, including, advertising, website creation, literature development, working with internal clients and our outside advertising agencies."
good,"The IBM culture has changed significantly since the change in CEO a number of years ago. Employees are considered recourses that are expendable and can be replaced with cheap labor from overseas market through 3rd party outsourcing."
good,IBM SAP Consulting Services is an ever changing culture with an emphasis on supporting the client in improving their business processes and helping them understand the intricacies of the SAP system.
good,Not in a position to review as my tenure was very short.  But self serve feature in the company was much appreciated.  Flexibility in working pattern provided to the employees was a added advantage what the company has given. One draw back is that team interactions are feeble because of this flexibility.
good,"IBM is a good place to work, but you will be responsible for your own career.  You will have to make sure you continue to learn on your own.  It is easy to get stagnant, bored and not grow.  It is hard to move within the company."
good,Constant re-orgs make it tough to go about getting in a good consistent cadence for the job.  Just when you start to get organized they would change up the job or org and cause chaos.
good,"Customer Support is not a very gratifying position for myself. Most of the day is spent on waiting for customers or development to respond to updates so you can notify one or the other.  Even when you successfully help the client, there is no real recognition.  Just another closed case."
good,Big problems in upper management.  Mid and lower managers are very competent.Too many levels of upper management spoil the soup. Co-workers are generally very knowledgeable but severely over worked
good,"Job happiness relies on the project you get to be a part of and the team that comprises it. If your team are not as hungry as you are, chances are, you'll have a neutral day-to-day work life."
good,"After 3 years with IBM I had an opportunity to start my own consulting business, so I did. IBM gave me the knowhow on how to network and communicate to land my own clients."
good,"Faced a lot of office politics, especially during annual review season. It is a typical problem in a large firm, however, IBM has a great process oriented culture that has zero ambiguity."
good,"•	Perform Level 2 support regarding troubleshooting of escalated tickets and project assignment"
good,"It's a really disaster for IBM time."
good,"IBM terminated contracts of all employees not willing to relocate to three co-location areas: Raleigh, NC; Austin, TX; and SF, CA. This was due to change in upper management at IBM Recruiting."
good,The company is now bought by Concentrix but during my stay the salary was a bit low though life work balance is really good. They ensure that the employees enjoys working.
good,I work  at IBM 2 different times. It was great place to gain IT  experience. The environment at times was cut throat and did not offer a lot of advancement without the political aspect.
good,Challenging workplace with opportunities to be at forefront of digital innovation. Learned a lot about IT and was inspired by the culture of corporate service.
good,"Work Life balance is good."
good,"Je travaille 8h/jour , pour un client francais. Je n'ai pas trop d'opportunites de developpement ni d'augmentation de salaire. Je suis contente de mon travail, car la culture de lieu de travail est a haut niveau, mais j'aimerais bien essayer de me realiser dans un autre pays."
good,"Lots of things to do, lots of nice people to work with.  Much of the work can be done remotely, which is a plus.  I recommend IBM to anyone who likes tech work."
good,"IBM is an average place to work at.  No compensation for the work that is being done i.e no raise, or bonus.  Great place to start your career but not good to grow your career."
good,Uma gigante que sabe como se reinventar pra manter a roda dos negocios girando.
good,The workplace culture matches the clients.  Consultants are deployed at client sites so there is no actual IBM culture or IBM office setting.  I thought I had a lot of good opportunities there but was happy to move on when a good opportunity presented itself.
good,"IBM is a good fit for technical skills. That is and always had been their forte. If you are looking for a Strategy or traditional consulting role, this may not be the best place for you. If you have strong technical skills and are driven to get better at it, you're applying to the right place."
good,Good place to work if you can remain and not get laid off. Fast paced and good management to work. Lots of training and paid time off for family and vacations.
good,Existe buen clima laboral se trabaja en equipo tambien se puede realizar trabajos remotos
good,"Depending where you are placed and who you are with you may do very well, or you will struggle to keep up or find help. Good starting point to learn how a corporation works. Most enjoyable parts are the other fun coworkers to be around. Worst part is management and when you are stuck with no one helping you and deadlines breathing down your neck. Expectation to get work done even in the sacrifice of  the work life balance. Most of the culture is just hardworking and not bothering other people who are working."
good,"Always had to be onsite, very little remote work.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and manager.  Initially stressful with very little direction, but once ypu get the hang of things, very good work environment."
good,"Good prospects, varied opportunities internally"
good,"My work environment is based on telecommuting. The work process seldom permitted face to face interaction or team building activities. Video conferencing was unstable and unsupported by management. There was a distinct lack of communications and support available. For me this was acceptable and I was able to successfully continue in my position."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, porem sem perspectiva de estabilidade."
good,"Good for developing diverse skills sets.  Sales and Management education is top quality."
good,"IBM provided an environment to work in different areas.  I developed existing skills and gained new ones, in the area of project management and cross functional relationships.  Overall, I had a good experience."
good,Compensation is bad. Nothing special about then. But a good place to start and learn the ropes. Don't know if the working condition has improved. They need to pay more.
good,Bom empresa para se trabalhar porem a gentao é distante
good,I chose not to provide a review for this company.  I don't feel comfortable providing the requested information on this forum.  Therefore I will not be providing a review.
good,"Obviously, a very large company, so you are just a number.  The IBM brand is great, the benefits are great.  The salary was better than anyone else I knew of."
good,"Installing, maintaining, updating desktop p.c.'s, laptop, laser printers for various manufacturers (IBM, Hewlett Packard, DELL, Epson, Compaq, Toshiba,etc.)."
good,"A empresa nao é totalmente ruim de trabalhar, porem voce fica ficado totalmente nas tecnologias desenvolvidas por ela e acaba ficando defasado com as culturas exteriores. O salario nao é ruim mas as promocoes sao quase impossiveis."
good,This job was many years ago.  I worked in a very relaxed environment with very friendly staff.  The work was very simply without a heavy workload.  Great department.
good,"Houve varias aprendizagens e condutas, mesmo diante da má gestão e carreira de trabalho."
good,"I've learnt the situation handling very well as I was part of Critical Incident Manager.Process is completely aligned to ITIL,Which has driven me towards Process consultant roles."
good,"- Management needs to take deeper dive into employee satisfaction"
good,"Its perfect Working place for carrer growth , With Productive work place , But Not much hope because of HR system here now."
good,Fun workplace and people. got to learn a lot. But odd work hours. Very learned set of people and willing to impart knowledge. It was a vary fast paced work environment.
good,"My colleagues and managers helped me develop during my first year at IBM and once I was up to speed gave me the freedom to take responsibility for my work without constant supervision or micro management. "
good,"IBM claims to have a vision for moving forward via AI and SaaS solutions, but they don't seem to understand how to run a company like this.  Company is so large that quite often there are duplicate people doing the same thing in different divisions, with no coordination between them.  At the other end, there is a seeming shortage of engineering and development staff to actually get any work done."
good,"IBM tends to lay off folks who's expertise becomes obsolete for whatever reason.  However, if a person works in a long-lasting area, then IBM is a great place to work."
good,"Interesting Work, Very smart people to work , excellent training some internal politics, aggressive sale targets, and the place is managed on tactical short term rather than strategically  Huge stuff turnover, albeit some people do return to IBM; Salaries are lowering for the newer entrants"
good,"The 'new' IBM is a result of transitioning the business from a leading hardware manufacturer to purely a services organisation."
good,"What makes IBM great are the people you work with. The are smart, hard working and always willing to help. There are a lot of great tools to use to learn new things that will help you at your job level or even higher. Work life balance is an issue. We are all so busy and needed more than just a normal Mon-Fri 8-5 day. Nights and weekends are needed at times too."
good,"One very disturbing requirement at IBM is the mandatory utilization rate of 10x% per person.  Your vacation and sick time counts against you.  So to take vacation you have to work that many more hours of OT, to compensate for your time off, so that your utilization rate is not impacted. If you fall below your utilization target, then you get a lower performance rating and bonus is not paid."
good,I never worked at this company so I can't really give any feedback. I used their tools in several other companies. The tools are not easy to work with and very expensive.
good,"I feel that IBM uses contractors for 5,10,15,20 years without converting them over to a perm employee. As a contractor you'll never have benefits and there is no room for advancement. No matter how hard you try to become perm the odds are against you. You are held to the same standards that a perm employee is held to w/o the salary. You have no PTO and is excluded from company events that are for employees only."
good,"There was lack of leadership in the company"
good,"good pay and room for advancement"
good,"Väldigt olika förhållanden på olika avdelningar."
good,"Nice team members, ready to help whenever you need it. The work environment welcomed outside of the box thinkers. This has been one of the best places I have ever worked at."
good,"Working culture is good."
good,"I would say IBM is a good place to learn, but not so good anymore to stay for a long time.  I like working for IBM when I was allowed to get something done for the customer."
good,"Con: always wondering how the company's continual restructuring will affect your team and role."
good,Had good time working in the company while learning a lot. Expect my manager's partiality towards employees. Before i join IBM people used to say that its Manager's company. In the sense you just have to impress(professional & personally) your manager to get things done for you. And i was surprise to witness this when i hit the floor.
good,"I experienced excellent job culture,                           "
good,"Very competitive, very goal oriented, diverse work group, and not lacking with creative thinkers. The goal of the group is the goal of the company. Employee driven, goal oriented."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance is there."
good,"IBM was a decent company to work for, but, the money could have been better.  I was allowed to work from home, but, this was somewhat isolating.  The job was good enough for the time I had itl"
good,IBM was good. no complains. I looking for opportunity which I got in other organization and I decided to move out. Working with IBM was one of the good experience which thought me many things in life.
good,"slow paced, easy to get lost. The company is really trying to get better at the organizational piece of things but everything is siloed, pocketed, etc., like things typically are at large companies. If you find good people to support you though you'll grow fast and work on interesting things."
good,Workplace politics as you encounter in many places and there is nothing special. Management is overdone and you have a lot of managers than actual performers.
good,"Gostei, pois aprendi muito porém não indico pois os cargos gerenciais não sabiam como gerir pessoas."
good,"IBM is IBM"
good,IBM is a good place to work if you are starting out of college and have the right skills they are looking for. It is a struggle though to continue building your skill set or learn new skills.
good,"Lacks promotion as all done internally, management love to delegate without inputting anything. work and home life is good. Disorganised workplace as there is no structure of guideline"
good,"As IBM is such a huge company, you will learn something new every day, and you will meet someone new every day."
good,Days were spent addressing customers technical issues. Worked in a cubical. Was cool. Mostly young crowd.I dont know what else you want me to put on here.
good,"This is what I am seeking is to work remotely as I have been doing so for the past 5 years. I was able to produce more efficiently working remotely. All meetings were with many resources from different locations so if I was at the office, I would see no one for meetings."
good,A empresa é  muito boa para de trabalhar visando muito o respeito das diversas culturas.
good,I have a good experience with IBM; worked in the most interesting and relevant programs in the market. Work / Life balance is not always ideal although there is tremendous learning too.
good,Our entire organization worked totally from home to support our customers.  Environment (computers) was always changing which made the job interesting and challenging.
good,"*  Strong brand recognition, so everyone wants to work at IBM"
good,"Uno se puede desarrollar muy bien en la planta, porque tiene grandes oportunidades"
good,"This job of job is rewarding in helping people in their homes and making their lives for them and their families easier.  "
good,Company changed over the years.  Reduced salaries and significant off-shoring of jobs.  Many good talented people lost their jobs who were very devoted to the company.
good,"Overall no pressure at work, you need to ask for work rather than given to you. Good training opportunities. Plenty of time to learn on your own, but hard to learn on the job. You can work from home twice a month or more with managers permission. The hardest part of the job is getting picked up on a project. Very good mentors at least for me, who would want to teach me and were patient. My functional manager was very cool and understanding. He worked a lot and all the teammates could see it so it gave us a motivation to put more into our work."
good,just another typical software sales job with no guidance til end of quarter.  great product but limited visibility or roadmap and too expensive for most companies
good,Exciting work with high-level exposure to some of the largest companies in the world. Teamwork is what makes this company great along with some strong management
good,"Working in a few different teams of excellent people over the years, unfortunately have seen so many forced redundancies, quite disheartening.A big shout out to a few colleagues who managed to hang on."
good,"In IBM, I have experience the good work experience but management is not ready to understand the piratical problems which employee face on regular basis."
good,"I have been working at IBM full-time"
good,Work force shifting to be cost effective seeking lowest labor cost with a new border less strategy to link up all teams with a 24/7/365 hour service.  Seeking a new young work force .
good,"Worked 3p-11p"
good,"Very fast paced support for 3 offices+. This would involve phone support (Desktop, Software, Training, Hardware). The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of a satisfied customer."
good,"good company to work with,good exposure"
good,This was a contract job at the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza. I installed desktop terminals in offices and installed Microsoft productivity suites on the machines. I also installed printers at the location.
good,This was in 1996 and the dispatching department was a bit unorganized. It was fast paced and fast changing.  It appeared the management was not too sure of what they were supposed to be doing and therefore it was reflected in their management skills.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the ever changing procedures of the dispatcher.
good,Great coworkers.  Learned a lot.  Great opportunities within the company until layoffs started.  Company's focus changed from it's employees to just the bottom line over the years I was there.
good,"IBM pays their interns based on how many credits they have completed towards their degree. The closer you are to graduating, the higher your hourly wage is. Having a high paycheck as an intern is nice but only if you feel like youre actually contributing to the company which is where IBM fell flat. The lack of organization made it hard for interns to get meaningful projects that teams could potentially pickup and continue with after their interns left."
good,"Learned a lot of troubleshooting with software applications and communication skills were developed within the company. The management molded me as a matured employee and well cultured. Hardest part of the job is when shift bidding are up, enjoyable part is when bidding comes up and you know in yourself that your ranking is high and you can choose the schedule that you like most."
good,"It's a job.  Go in the morning, do your job and go home in the evening. The people were OK with no complaints. It's a job like any other with a paycheck attached."
good,No coffee machine. No extra perks. Opportunity to work at new technologies. Quick paced work environment. Extra hours. Low salary. Stable job. Meagre promotion opportunities
good,The management team at IBM - Endicott was amazing!  The group developed a bond that has lasted beyond our employment at IBM. It was a family environment.
good,"Worked for this company for over 16 years. In the end they shifted all the work to India, China or Philipines. They are very ""tower"" orientated and can be extremely slow in moving forward. Don't believe the hype at the Senior Exec level because it just does not get to the worker level quickly."
good,Unfortunately the current CEO is more concerned about shareholder earnings than condition of employees and employee satisfaction. Jobs being eliminated through drastic various means including but not limited to RA's.
good,"IBM is changing quickly. Good place to start your career. Solid technology, great customer base, great marketing air cover, can be complex a bureaucratic. Internal systems (i.e. Lotus Notes  and Sugar CRM) are aweful."
good,Responsible for algorithm development and implementation for an indoor/outdoor location tracking system. Was a research assistant here working with a team of 4.
good,"Promotes work life balance, professional competitiveness and process oriented. High value for integrity and client services. Offer training for career development and growth."
good,IBM is public company.  Like any public company it only considers profit and stock holders.  The employees are under the shadow that lay off could happen at anytime.
good,"Overall a very good company, but heavy on the management side.  Usually the manager over you has no idea what you are doing or how to do it.  Lots of work with off-shore folks, usually in the dead of the night helping them learn the systems and fixing what they broke."
good,"It was educational but slow sometimes. The mood was calm and relaxing fostering hard work, but there seemed to be long days where not much was happening."
good,I worked with a lot of vendors and contractors.  The vendors and contarctors were never the same from project to project.  Too many people coming and going on projects.
good,IBM is a good resume builder and offers a wealth of opportunities and training options.  I would recommend IBM to anyone looking to utilize their consulting experience.
good,IBM was a good place to work. Management was good and the pay was competitive. They appeared to treat their employees fairly. The atmosphere  was good.
good,"Average company to work.  "
good,"its a great place if you happen to be on some god project or you are in software/research labs. some of the divisions do very typical IT maintenance and support stuff, there is not much there.."
good,Difficult to navigate the IBM way. There wasn't much sponsorship or help in how to find or learn ways of communications used or not approved of. Managers were aloof and were not open to new ways of doing things.
good,Time at IBM was a building block for my proffessional career. Everyday was something different however alot of the issue that I came across were repetitive to know what to do for the next time this issued occured. Great experience my time with the company.
good,IBM was a great company to work for but it always seemed that there was no job security. As a consultant I felt I was away from everyone else. They did not have good programs to bring people who work remotely into the office to interact with fellow employees.
good,"Became a meat grinder.  Despite positive reviews as at a minimum an above average contributor to an outstanding contributor.  No significant raises and little advancement,"
good,"Company run by Finance people, lacking creativity and innovation.  Far too many egos at play getting in the way of real innovation.  Lack of fresh views to influence the future"
good,"Empresa com grande desafios, uso continuo de inglês, inclusive no ambiente interno."
good,no comment - not comfortable putting this kind of information into a public data base.  I am not trying to burn bridges or am I trying to provide that level of insight
good,"Great work/life balance and benefit packages! Ensure that you seek employment with an established base of the organization and not a division that was newly acquired. Do your research, as it is highly likely that the cultures will not match IBMs sought after culture."
good,"Plenty of Cross Training and Experience Available, Opportunities to work at several environments. Gained plenty of experience with different tools, infrastructures and co workers."
good,"IBM provided a challenging environment.  As long as you were able to keep up and continue to put in the necessary hours to complete your assignments, things went well."
good,It was a small product that eventually didn't make the cut during the annual planning and was cut. The entire team was let go one morning. I remember it being kind of unreal.
good,"Not much to say at this time. I prefer to not give a typical day at work or what I learned, or talk about management. the work place culture the hardest part of my job, or the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I got to IBM late.  They were on a downhill run when I got there, it just took a little time before I was able to realize it.  Overall I enjoyed the people and the work, however they were in a constant state of flux and could never catch up to their changes before the next round of changes was made."
good,Working here could be an indulging experience if there were enough benefits for the employees. IBM is a tech giant and yet the premises are miserable and no where in comparison with its other competitors.
good,"good vacation and decent benefit"
good,"IBM is an extremely large organization with the typical pros and cons of any company with over 600K employees.  My company was acquired by IBM and we are still being ""blue washed"" meaning we are still in the process of the transition of business after 2 years.  I haven't been affected greatly by the IBM culture other than the systems in place for travel, expense, HR, benefits, etc., are all self serve and very complicated.   I continue to work to try and work my way into the IBM ""flywheel"" and have succeeded for the most part.  The hardest part of the job is understanding all of the acronyms and the different business titles.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with clients and continuing to provide them with solutions that increase their overall viability and profitability as well as ensure they remain relevant in an ever changing industry."
good,"I worked in their marketing department during my placement year so my view might be different to that of a full time adult employee."
good,"overall good experience, contract not renewed... there were many contracts that were not renewed and there was not much of an explanation provided but with contract work, this is not uncommon."
good,"I was fresher in the company, and worked here for 3 years. Typically if you are a fresher, you might not benefit much in terms of salary and hikes and work life balance, however an experienced candidate can retire from here."
good,"I enjoy working in IBM because being a technology and cognitive computing company, giving your personal opinion is always appreciated. I learn about cost centers, headcount, queries, and document for IBM transfers."
good,"Smart people. Boundless archived knowledge. Employees treated unfairly. Slow to change. Restricted by previous generation of managers, trying to do the most with least people, affecting quality."
good,"IBM would have employee recognitions. I enjoyed seeing the anniversary recognitions, especially the Quarter Century events. They were well deserved and nowadays very few."
good,"Don't know never worked at this place, not sure what is going on to make you believe that this is a part of my resume. Were on my resume was there IBM as a company I worked at?"
good,"It was a great job for contract, My manager was very firm and it was a competive position, I had great hours to work . at time I was a single mom, but I survive with the pay"
good,"In initial days IBM provided me with best of career opportunity , IBM provided with secure and stable job with good benefits , IBM provided good work life balance."
good,Big company but slow to react to new tech providers.   Has been week in the software space.   Large consulting arm for corporate customers. Workplace culture changing but still needs to be more agile.
good,"Decent place."
good,"It is a great company to work with leading edge on technologies and other solutions."
good,An interesting place to work. Some great people. Varied roles. Challenging conditions at times. Lots of opportunities for those who are looking to change careers and diversify.
good,"Being a Customer Care Executive for a Business Process Services (BPO), one has to be responsible for performing all duties assigned by the team leader while taking in calls from customer with complaints regarding their mobile phone service."
good,"Nice place to learn new technology, very supportive management, better than average benefits, lots of opportunities to overtime if one desire, inspiring team members will go extra step to help peers."
good,"Doesn't matter what you do, or how, its all in who you know, and who knows who.  This is a typical ""old boys club' work environment.  I would not recommend IBM to any women."
good,"Overall experience is good. But, the pay scale for few competencies are not up to the mark. Good culture and work environment. Job Security is optimal and good scope to learn."
good,"I enjoyed the benefit of being able to work from home when not travelling.  I was hired into a know difficult customer base,  IBM elimited my position after a year."
good,"A good place to work in with a very fantastic environment in all the office branches including Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches, and very helpful people overall."
good,I learned alot while working here and feel prepared for any other jobs that are out there . This was not a hard job but the Hours are demanding. My work days was mostly monitoring the computer Lab.
good,Company with less direct employees. God opportunity for career growth. They require shifting schedules. Extended hours most of the time. Has a good office.
good,A place full of competition to prove yourself. Overtime's gave a good scope to earn more. A place I joined as a fresher. Gives you a good Outlook of BPO work culture
good,"not much options to change projects....."
good,"The only contact i have had with ibm was joint venture working together while on the job site.  they were helpful, professional and courteous and thorough."
good,"Good For Freshers"
good,"IBM  Is not a great place to work. "
good,One of the best things about IBM was the ability to do the job anywhere.  The best part of about IBM is the people that I've had the privilege to work with.
good,"IBM India is a good place to work, and enhance your skill set."
good,"Work Life balance at its best, However salary and job advancement is hard to come by. Now since the company is not generating much revenue from traditional businesses that is also badly impacting employee morale."
good,Good work place culture and employees were free to take initiative drive them self and  proper recognition . Pay and monetary benefits were  very low when i started working.
good,"I have two very different jobs with IBM.  I started out as an outsourced resource from Foremost Insurance and the management their kept us isolated from the IBM red tape.  When that contract expired, I elected to stay with IBM and that's when I saw the IBM ugliness.  In the 9 months the Ariba practice lasted, I had 4 different managers and only ever met one if person.  I was even fired via a phone call.  I'm not sure how this company is still in business if the rest of the company is this screwed up."
good,"Consulting for IBM as part of the Global Business Services is a great opportunity for those who want to work hard and have a variety of opportunities. The downsides to this are there are constant pressures to work work work (so no life balance) and it can be hard to really specialize in a particular industry, role or skill. One's experience as a consultant is very dependent on your manager and projects- both of which can span from horrendous to fantastic, but you don't have much control over these."
good,A great place to work and the management is good as they listen to your concerns and the work culture is healthy. When you love your job all the challenges look less stressful and helps you shape a great career.
good,"Middle management has lost their way.  Job security is non-existent.  Good work-life balance.  Revenue keeps declining.  Benefits are decent, and salaries are competitive, but the bonuses are very disappointing."
good,"Fun place to work, good work balance. Excellent Management team. Work life balance is incorporate in daily working schedule. Good place to start and continue a career"
good,"It was my first company."
good,"I was working on a college project in IBM."
good,Great job and fantastic team and only left the job as the project ended like so many I have completed. Here I was given the opportunity to work interstate.
good,"I worked with IBM on the ATT account.  I had no benefits no vacation or sick time.  It was tough work, very busy.  It was a basically a sweatshop.  No tools, you had to really know your stuff."
good,"It was a long time ago, but watched one of the greatest companies in the world develop the typical greedy focus on PE ratios, and lose its focus on the employee.  What an example for the world pre-1990, a time when ""Respect for the Individual"" was a core motto."
good,"The job was a very interesting and challenging job.  In this position I grew in many directions but the greatest growth was developing my sales and people skills. "
good,"full of work with not able to learn anything . same work repeating with same project.It mostly depends which group you are in IBM, but generally i feel a bit slow career growth"
good,"IBM is nice place to learn, but the work life balance is very low, Hike and promotion does not happens at all. If you are willing to learn IBM is good place to be."
good,Good to start. Good benefits. Constant reorganizing. Definitely geared toward younger worker. Layoffs are a regular part of business model. May someday return to greatness.
good,"Their WFH culture made some days long, conference call intensive when dealing with global markets."
good,"IBM has a Great Solution Stack helps you to have much deeper and meaningful conversation at all levels of your customer's Organization."
good,Gran empresa en la que prima la formacion de sus trabajadores y la consiliacion laboral con lo personal
good,"I worked at IBM for 28 years and it was always so fun to work there. Work atmosphere is so good. Management is great and very helpful. Good benefits , very good salary and 401k plan ."
good,wow tout une compagnie qui avait le soucis de ces employés
good,IBM is a great stepping stone in your career.  The largest advantage to working at IBM is the amount of training the company is able to invest in its workforce.  You will be provided with training that can help you throughout your career.
good,"Its a perfect place for either married women or very senior practitioners where you want to settle down till retirement. Otherwise if you are one looking for growth and an individual who wants to grow and explore new opportunities, IBM is not your place."
good,"I did enjoy working for IBM at the time I was working.  Working as contractor associated with IBM the environment has change. "
good,"I have learn much process here, and compare to technical work , process is more."
good,"Software automation engineer designing and setting up , i  left the company 15 years, more aspiration to to grow my  career to next level. Not much career growth in the company"
good,"- the culture is changing fast."
good,You learn anything in IBM and work in that new learning. But you can't expect much in IBM for yearly salary hike. But you have flexibility to work from home
good,"no work life balance especially when doing weekend jobs to extended hours "
good,"IBM is a good place to start a career. You'll probably be forced into a role that isn't your first choice, however. There are also annual layoffs and the culture is a bit behind the times."
good,"An experience that will enhance your career, no matter what phase that you enter into IBM at. There are many experienced people that you can learn the ropes from."
good,"Regular environment,  customer space for critical mission needs. Vendors and customers management, access controls, daily operations. Infrastructure maintenance"
good,"Joined through acquisition. A tough culture change on joining, with lack of personal feel to the business. Complex matrix organisation to navigate to get anything done"
good,"A typical day at work involved meeting the clients to understand their requirements. Then I functional design of data marts. This was sent to the technical team for design."
good,"This was a fast paced enviromnet. Fun people to work with. We always have activities to do, and support groups on the weekend. We had a great staff and always helpful."
good,My experience at IBM taught me a lot. It was a nice environment to work in. My only reason for leaving is that I was a temp and unfortunately my assignment ended.
good,growth is stagnant. too much work pressure. long office hours. no cab facilities. management is nice. work culture and work environment is friendly....
good,We worked hard and we had fun when the times called for it.  I wore many hats with the roles I had there.  I enjoyed my fellow associates and our business partners.
good,"Great organisation to work for,got a lot to learn.Good team,but salary is less at entry level compared to other such MNCs and compared to the workload.Overall great experience"
good,"It's a good experience with IBM and i have learned lot of things here.i have gained lot of knowledge and good experience."
good,Global Leader in IT. Highly Process oriented. Decision making is slower. Open Culture. Brand value. Provides opportunities to work with large global MNCs.
good,It is a very cut throat job and they did massive lay offs with people that were there for a while making the most money.  I as there 16 years and was one of the top sales people but they let me go anyway.
good,Buena Empresa cuando eres directo pero estaba como freelance contratado por una agencia de USA para laborar en mexico
good,Work From Home is advantage. Salary is not upto mark. Also many projects are maintainance project. Agile is slowly coming up in the organization. But need to be agile in full fledge.
good,"Continuous work reductions in force   were always  present."
good,"Busy environment, very inclosed working space, found the lack of nature light hard to work without. Not very personal, worked as a number not a person."
good,Good work life balance but salary not at market level . we will be exposed to one area . We cannot use 100% of our skills since based on demand resource will be allocated
good,"one of the team who built and implemented a web hosting farm for IBM in Toronto and Montreal, Great experience and great people to work with. But I had a plan to move to complete my PHD, at York University, therefore I had to leave"
good,"Good people, lots of mobility options, really depends on which office and group you are part of. Have not worked in the US offices, so curious to know what the work culture and opportunity landscape in the US is."
good,"Good Organization to continue for long if you are lucky enough to be part of a project where you see Technical/Professional growth prospects. "
good,"IBM over schedules and over commits.  The company is competing on cost against other out-sourcing firms, means that days are long and salary is barely competitive."
good,Global services contracts to various firms for their IT needs. As the contract lasted it was at a great place with good people to work with but when the contract ended that was it.
good,"Good workplace but not recommended for freshers."
good,The schedules are not flexible and are provided only a week in advance. The management is good but the career advancement opportunities are very few. In house trainings or skill development opportunities are not enough.
good,"Pros: Great work life balance. Excellent pay and benefits. "
good,this was a temporary job i worked wheni relocated. i had no issues. the boss was fine and the work was no cause for complaint. i would reccomend it to someone
good,"worked at client side on support projects. at the time, had ample opportunities to foray in the h/w space. quite a competitive and gives a stable growth."
good,IBM in this area was sold to GlobalFoundries.  I say sold but they paid GF to take it.  With 12 hour shifts and rotating schedules home life suffers especially if you work at night.  If you want to advance in your career be prepared to be stuck on night shift.  Departments used to have dinners and managers were giving extra time off but that all got cut down over the years and totally eliminated since GlobalFoundries took over.  Its good for a job until you can land something else.
good,"In IBM, most of engineers  are very professional. Co-worker helps each other. Senior engineer like to mentor junior engineer without any reserve. Most of senior engineers is very knowledgeable. IBMer is working very hard on every project.  "
good,Fast paced customer support with a wide range of complex environments and huge overhead of internal processes and requirements. Completely numbers driven.
good,wonderful place to work during the 80's and 90's.  culture change started in 2000 and continues to be poorly defined today.  it provides opportunities for growth.
good,Excellent opportunity for change and advancement with a variety of positions available. Easy to explore other opportunities within the company and other locations.
good,Good place to work at.  I had been there a very long time ago and it was a good place with friendly executives to work with.  It is a company which values employees

good,"Great team. Very motivated people. Great business idea. Very aggressive schedule. "
good,"Great company with great pay. A lot of travel for work, and not much of a work/life balance. The benefits could also be better. Otherwise, great place to work."
good,"In IBM I put all my efforts to delivery the best in the technical support."
good,"Opportunity to hone your skills in customer service/sales"
good,Worked for the company for almost 4 years Company went on a pay freeze yet required more work as people left. No room for growth in my position to expand
good,I am working here as a contractor. Nice experience to work here as a project management good working atmosphere. We can learn so many new things while working in such a good organization. but as a contractor no extra benefits.
good,Job security has gone down recently. Lot of cost cutting activities taken by organization. Work from home is boon sometimes. Flexible work environment if you are in the right team.
good,"1. A day at work includes meetings with the respective stakeholders regarding the new requirements."
good,La verdad no hay mucha estabilidad laboral pero el sueldo es bueno así como sus prestaciones son muy buenas el único preoblema que yo considero es la poca estabilidad laboral
good,I feel this company is good with different teams being Interactive and collaborative teams and its good to be part of an organization that gives importance to each and every voice.
good,Need to have strong employment satisfaction activities and tasks to be undertaken by IBM. Though the work life balance is good but when it comes to being transparent there is no choice there. Management is also not effective and there is more of contacts required to stay alive here.
good,Lugar adecuado para tu primer trabajo dado la cantidad de proyectos  que puedes participar.
good,IBM Strategic Outsourcing division has been performing poorly on the financial front for several consecutive quarters. IBM's answer to that has been to cut jobs from the workers who are doing the work (NEVER from the management ranks). They are cut so thin at this point in time that it's extremely difficult to get work done.
good,"A good place to work with learning and enjoyment."
good,"IBM will do its best to keep the client happy. However, they tend to under staff teams. The company offers scholarships and grants but refuses to give them when asked for."
good,"I enjoyed this job as they worked around my school schedule and I was able to learn on the job at same time. Unfortunately, management needs help as the company performs a large amount of layoffs and hires in a year."
good,The manager and team was very supportive.  Worked on a lot of different projects and tasks daily.  Very productive environment.  Sometimes worked 16 hour days to complete cut overs. No OT Pay.  I was laid off a year after I rejoined the company.
good,Overall good working environment and learnings opportunities.There are Flexible work timing. But in terms salary and benefits I'm little disappointed.
good,"i just learned in this company no growth is seen in this, they can't see the employees they just see their benefits, if company do just like this then its not good in future."
good,"Company is struggling to survive by switching from product sales to services. They were caught off guard by the swift rise of Amazon Web Services which deprived them of their expected lead. The brightest hope is Watson, the sophisticated analytical software for optimal performance as a “question answering” machine."
good,"I have had both good and bad experiences working at Seterus.  The main thing is that it takes so long to be converted into a full time employee.  You get these LTS positions with hopes of one day becoming permanent, but you are let go before that even happens."
good,"Good to work with this company, there is a job security, good work culture and flexibility. There is lot of scope for learning and growth, Nice management."
good,"Not too good in terms of work culture compensation and rewards and recognition. "
good,"Good company to work with."
good,"Worked more than 6months in this organization havent got any recognisition, might be an problem of my manager, "
good,"Great culture - great people.  Tough to compete, but a real enjoyable climate.  A very smart company with many smart people.  Wish them all the best.."
good,"Leads Life in IBM"
good,Amazing people to work with and learn from. Promotes a health work life balance. Salaries are slowly starting to pick up pace and meet industry averages.
good,"Amazing company to work with.  Sadly, with 21 consecutive declining earnings, being laid off is the norm and affecting over all moral and job performance.  I am now part of thousands having been ""resourced actioned"".  Experience is no longer a job hiring qualification and you will not be earning at your full potential."
good,I have joined in IBM in 2015.Here I gained domain-knowledge.Trying to learn new technologies which I am not aware.Have worked on financial domain projects.
good,Flexible work hours.  Have the ability to work from home.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible work hours.  The hardest part of job was workload vs. employee
good,"Good place to work, got a chance to meet and communicate with different people across the GEO, This is best management company, very good working place.."
good,"As is typical of any large company, there are lots of opportunities, good work life balance, fairly good benefits, but not much opportunity for progressive projects or true career development.  Any personal development has to be undertaken by the individual.  Salaries have become less and less competative."
good,"Worded for IBM for 10 years, had many opportunities for experience and growth. At times long hours were needed to get the work done, but there were good people there."
good,A good experience to work with client like AT & T (Telecom Domain).Work culture & Time flexibility is very good in IBM.Learnt about AGILE model of execution of project.
good,"There was flexible Work from home option , But it all depends on manager of our project ,Allowances are good , there is a lot of scope for learning new things but at times you need to stretch your self for more than office hours ."
good,Provides good learning opportunities. Work from Home facility helps to have a work life balance though the use is getting restricted. Pay package is on the lower side.
good,IBM and Cognos were great places to work. The analytics space was taking off when I joined and there was a lot of great energy. Many of the people I met here I am still connected with and working with in the partner channel.
good,"its just ok lots of work..  jobs keep moving "
good,Its great experience working in company. And learned more technical knowledge and good workplace culture. There is no hard part in job. And it's very good experience to work here.
good,"Here being an on Onsite, things change comparing to working on same role and position at offshore. it's good to work when you face different challenges. Picked up on working cross skill (mySQL, PHP, JSON, Jquery, Classic ASP) initially it was tough but now having good feeling that I got to chance to move out of comfort zone. Colleagues are nice, just feeling lacking of proper input from upline management team for moral booster."
good,"Good Company with good work life balance. Decent pay master but increment is less. It has some good policies , hierarchy is more but overall its a good company"
good,"IBM is good place to work with big projects. Also work life balance is good with WFH options in many projects."
good,The culture in IBM has changed tremendously in the past 5yrs.  A change not for the best.  Many US jobs have been transferred to teams overseas & experienced workers let go.  Not the IBM I started with.
good,Mooie dingen en minder mooie dingen meegemaakt. Werken hier is stressvol.
good,"great place to work. a typical day consist of desktop support..network administration, new pc setup, repair of older broken machines..managing cell phones and ip based phones"
good,"BTP: não é funcionário nem estagiário. Funcionários te tratam de maneira ""diferente"", a parte, fora do seleto grupo de funcionários."

good,"Empresa muito grande, grande quantidade de treinamentos disponíveis."
good,grande scuola sia per il management che per la struttura
good,"Nice cordial learning environment.  I was a consultant to IBM and after I left, the job lead to a permanent position which eventually became a 100% remote position."
good,"Here in IBm there is good work culture, not so much work load on employees , I learned so many things from IBM, good communication skills, In sort I can say IBM is best company."
good,"Work are ethics are really good"
good,Flexible working location and hours. Office is a nice place to work. The people are friendly. I learned a lot and they give you the freedom to expand your knowledge.
good,Working with clients was an exceptional and rewarding experience. The only downside was you were always concerned how long the position would last before being outsourced or moved offshore.
good,Good place to work and learn the importance of processes in the corporate world - Very structured approach to problem solving with emphasis on Innovation.
good,IBM Client innovation center is a great place for entry level to get experience on different projects. But the only downside is that the compensation is below industry standard.
good,This company has amazing people who work very hard to help them be successful.  The company makes decisions that can sometimes make it difficult to work with their channel partners.
good,"The brand name is good and carries great value."
good,"IBM was a really great place to work once but is now on the decline. The flexible workplace culture, workforce talent, intellectual capital and global exposure made it a great company to work for when I started my career. I have learnt a lot during my tenure here and been exposed to working for multiple Fortune 100 clients. However in recent times I feel there is a lack of clear direction from the top management on the future of the company which does not help the employee have a clear vision of the future and stay motivated."
good,"I have 30+ years at IBM, and the company has been a great place to work. I am a second-generation IBMer. I've had the opportunity to learn a variety of skills and work for and with some great people. However, I have few regrets about leaving the company at this time. The push for 'co-location' (IBM-speak for going back to work in an office) is a great example of how, from time to time, we swing the pendulum too far to one side, in an attempt to accomplish a poorly-communicated and poorly-implemented goal. In this case, it is supposedly greater collaboration within teams. However, in my last job, the team I supported was located throughout the world - and we were not all going to be in the same location anyway, so what is the point? Many people believe this is a poorly-disguised attempt to reduce headcount in the US yet again, without having to call it a lay-off or make (minimal) severance payments. "
good,"I originally worked at IBM from 1982 until 2003. The first years were great, the latter ones--after the layoffs began--not as great. I did meet and work with some great people, thoughout, however. After retiring from my next employer, SAS Institute, I have returned to IBM on a freelance basis, doing work I enjoy very much."
good,Great company to work for especially if you enjoy learning. The environment is a typical call center work place and is a fairly simple place to work for.
good,"People I've worked with have been great. Unfortunately, overall IBM corporate policy does not always do what is best for employees. IBM will hire new grads and layoff more experienced staff."
good,"Varied work days, including some standard reporting and any ad hoc requests.  I am fortunate to have a great and supportive team.  Most people are willing to be very helpful.  Working from home was a positive experience."
good,"Too much of work to do, yet every project you are in, definitely there is good scope of learning. The work environment is flexible hence you would realize the pressure."
good,"Good Workplace, Good Facilities, Difficult Work, Work is Time Consuming, Team is good, Good for Starting, Fast paced environment, Typical Culture is average"
good,"More work, less pay. Near my place. I got to meet people in the workplace, who eventually became my best friends. I learned that promotion will not be based from what you have done if no one have seen it, but will be based from what my supervisor is seeing."
good,"It is an overall okay place to work if you like 24/7 call centers"
good,Its a good place to work with plenty of opportunities to work on cutting edge technologies that IBM produces constantly. Base compensation is pretty competitive however the bonus and other perks are non-existent.
good,Rapid change in workforce and product focus results in constant reorganization that strains relationships with customers. Sales personnel cannot establish meaningful relationships with this much shuffling and commissions suffer.
good,Good workplace but need to be placed in good projects and team. If not then there is slow growth curve. Nice place to earn badges and learn online courses.
good,The current project work was challenging as it was a small duration project and have to be always on top of everything . This is a thrilling journey and enjoyed a lot .
good,"Was an agency worker for 6.5 years, so didn't really get to enjoy the benefits of being an IBM employee.  Would have loved the chance. Nice people to work with."
good,"Gives a great learning experience. Pay is not the best, but it is entry level and you gain access to a lot of educational tools, so it balances out eventually based on your goals."
good,I dreamed of working at IBM then I worked there.  Over my 15 years as a contractor then Perm. employee. I lost interest then left the company in the hopes of working for a company that cares more about their product then the bottom dollar.
good,"Satisfied, good. Nice work culture, flexible timings, interaction with clients, get to learn important documentation such as Test Estimations, Requirement specifications, Test Plans etc"
good,A mature company with good benefits.  The ideal offerings to be associate with are cognitive and cloud as that is where the majority of future investments are being made.
good,"It has nice installations with a lot of open areas and eating spots, nice people to work with, almost everybody."
good,"Managing multiple clients while working there."
good,"Work life balance was the most difficult item to achieve.  Employees very committed and the organization able to differentiate high, medium and low performers and reward them appropriately"
good,"IBM used to be a great company to work for, but lately things have changed. For the past decade we have seen very little as far as promotions, bonuses, and job security.  While making  record profits some quarters, thy money never trickled down. I think I stayed too long thinking IBM would take care of me..  They ended up selling our division with little left after brain drain. Between retirements and layoff every year our site took a huge hit in moral. "
good,"The primary focus of the day is to assist your various customers in achieving value and tangible return on investment in their product acquisition.  The activities can range from Product Road Maps,  Support Escalations, Best Practices, Peer to Peer Customer Discussions and creative, out of the box usage of the tools or solutions. "
good,"You’ll have access to all the technical and management training courses you need to become the expert you want to be."
good,"I find that it is difficult to have time for yourself. The expectations are high, a lot of work, a lot of pressure. It might be a good job to start your career, but you might burn out."
good,My first Job after college. Training were good. Good amenities for employees. Organized. Rewards and recognition. Social activities for employees. Secured.
good,"IBM is very cool place to work. You can see a lot of people enjoying their work."
good,Working at IBM is anything but boring.  Your coworkers will be among the brightest in the industry and the jobs are broad and detailed at the same time.  As a mom of 4 - IBM has afforded me the best of all worlds.
good,I was only contracted to IBM for a short period following transfer of the contract I was working on. I therefore cannot leave and accurate review of the company.
good,"IBM is in a period of intense transformation from an on-premise, service oriented hardware company to a cloud and cognitive leader.  With that comes much change and disruption.  Succeeding even though they are late to the cloud game will be the measure of future growth."
good,"Good people but undergoing tough times as it tries to transform."
good,everyone is passionate about the work and the clients served. great overall ministry with people of great hearts helping those in needs. would recommend
good,"IBM is just okay. Honestly, the culture and lack of advancement is hindering. There's little to no training offered, or at least meaningful training to your position and hard skills. There are constant re-orgs that could really affect your ability to grow with the company and at times there is a condescending view of the younger, Millenials that are just trying to make an impact."
good,"Work Life Balance is good, but Salary is not satisfactory."
good,IBM global services was a great opportunity for EMM support engineers.  Exposure to multiple EMM solutions and businesses was an excellent experience and kept engineers engaged and motivated to learn new technology.
good,"As per the above mentioned ratings:"
good,A very competitive place.  I appreciative both the team and the manager I have.  The structure and focus required could be a drawback to one's inventivity.  A good place to work for overall.
good,"Being an acquisition of IBM, there were many adjustments.  However, the company made the transition over 2-1/2 years, and so it wasn't a shock."
good,It was okay. There is no growth in the direction that you would like to go to but there were a good amount of benefits. This comes from working for a company with good money.
good,"Good work experience & job satisfaction. Culture was good. Few demanding customers were challenging to handle, but it was fun. Good team to work with."
good,"Hostile departmental culture."
good,"I love my job and what I do, but sometimes I feel that the management has no clue what's going on.  Shuffling the chairs on the Titanic feeling.  RA's (layoffs) are always hovering."
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"Es gab nicht zu viel zu tun"
good,"Working for IBM was a remote position.  IBM was not physically  located in the Dana Corporation Division Office. "
good,"Leading Technology company"
good,flexible working hours are part of ibm culture-no swiping while entering and leaving the campus-work from home allowed depending on your reporting manager
good,"IBM is a varied workplace. Your experiences differ from Project to Project. "
good,The job allowed me the opportunity to come in and learn pc and desktop support. This was the first real corporate job and it allowed me the opportunity to gain some valuable skills that I would be able to use on another job.
good,"Fue un cambio muy grande pasar al mundo de la consultoría pero el tiempo que estuve allí y los proyectos en los que participé fueron muy interesantes."
good,"Always busy, and not enough head count. Have had many RA's affect our group . Projects are constantly being prioritized and seem like they never get done because of this. Work with many smart people at IBM and learn a lot from them."
good,"You will get to know CMMI level 5 process related things."

good,"laid back atmosphere with good benefits"
good,"During my time at IBM, the company has offered me many opportunities to improve my skills, provided additional training and assisted with Professional and personal growth."
good,"Hard work does pay off, but luck matters in IBM- Softwares. IBM is acquiring small product base companies and then screwing them big time. So if you are one of the acquired emplyee there is a high chance that you will be screwed."
good,"worked at the patent drafting center.  there is a heavy emphasis on quantity and not quality, but you will get the experience to draft applications and interact with engineers."
good,"IBM is a very good company globally, but in India it has also turned in to another Indian IT company. With very little pay hike and perks like Work from home, not so good company to start your career with."
good,"IBM has a very good culture of working at home policy which benefits for the women employes and person with higher experience."
good,In IBM AT&T account you get to learn a lot but there is no work life balance so you end up tiring yourself to the core . Even after working long hours it is never appreciated or rewarded in form of appraisal . No additional Perks . Poor management .
good,"Der Kollegenzusammenhalt ist vorbildlich. Das Verhalten der Vorgesetzten unterscheidet sich sehr start. Langjährige Manager wissen wie man positiv führt. Neue (i.d.R.) junge Manager sind nur auf ihre Zahlen konzentriert und uns sehen keinen Sinn darin dem TopManagement zu widersprechen."
good,Everyone willing to work together even from other department willing to help out. Colleague willing to teach new things and the culture. Good communication among colleague.
good,the project was medium as complexity and as futures developments it don;t show enough perspective
good,"I have fun, but have to work many hours because we have an exodus in the company I need to perfotm the two man works. Not much time for the family because the above explanation."
good,"a nice place to work.  As it it large, there is a great deal of focus on process. for example yearly/half yearly reviews where staff are ranked against each other by management."
good,"Decent place to work. Pays pretty good, but culture was not so great in finance. Used softwares such as essbase and tm1. Learrned a good amount, but did not like the culture. Not very collaborative."

good,"•	Responsible for “Full Life Cycle” recruiting process (developing job descriptions, recruiting and sourcing for IT  professionals by way of internet, cold calling, networking events, trade shows, job fairs etc.)."
good,"I worked 15 years at this company.  When I started, I enjoyed my time.  I quickly saw the value that Big Blue brought forth.  However, over time, I saw good customer service fall to a low priority."
good,"That was my first time full-time job in USA. I had a very good manager. No overtime, No on-call, regular work hours. Learned a lot of from the co-workers."
good,"IBM provides Technical Training's to employees and at least some of the People Managers are regularly conducting face to face update with the employee's. The same cannot be said to Contractor's, if the project decide to cost cut, the contractors are the first in line."
good,"IBM Is a great place to work.  Very interesting people, colleagues, culture.  There are people from all over the world working at IBM.  This makes it a very interesting place to learn about colleagues and their projects, etc..  Where I work has a very interesting mix of Software Developers, Programmers, Sales and marketing people for many different IBM brands.  IBM is large enough to allow you to move internally between divisions with out ever leaving the company."
good,"The office I work in has a nice atmosphere.  It can be competitive at times, but the people are generally very friendly and willing to help.  The managers in the office are also helpful and supportive.  The company feels like it's in a transition phase, trying to focus on Watson and ""cognitive computing"".  Thus, decisions from higher-ups are often late, forcing the rest of us to sometimes change direction (sometimes drastically)."
good,"Over all the company is OK. Great colleagues. Good environment. Work life balance is good. If you know how to navigate, you can find what ever help you want."
good,"As an IBMer, need to have better communication between IBM and Client and have latest Technology and tools to Support the Future growth. "
good,"Company is pretty solid, good structure, very process driven, dress code, large corporation, not many career opportunities unfortunately, a lot of knowledgeable people"

good,"Started off working on laptops and desktops, then printers, then point of sale, the xSeries servers (Windows), pSeries (AIX) , storage (XIV, DS8K). Benefits are good.  But as people are retiring we are having to work more with less people.  Getting call outs more often too."
good,"Good company at start. You have high salary, work/life balance and best benefit. But after a long time.. Youll get tired of routine jobs and yet no growth."
good,Poor Compensation & benefits for existing employees. Management is focused more on their own targets and goals. They never think about employee career & growth.
good,IBM provides immense opportunities to its employees in terms of career opportunities. With its Global Presence IBM is an international brand which has the potential to attract talents all across the globe
good,"There are some great people here but most are mediocre. Management (with a few exceptions) seem to be particularly dense.  While there are a few engineers that are talented and fun to work with, most of them are complacent."

good,Good platform to work as a engineer. Policies towards employ are good. have better facilities and Good MNC company towards employee care.Over all it is Good service based company.

good,"I learned SQL, shell scripting, Unix"
good,"The promotion process is long and drawn out. Some service line leaders require in-person meetings, this is a poor use of time for consultants and clients. These meetings are designed to promote networking, unfortunately the practitioners rarely branch out. This is an issue at all levels within the organization."
good,"This was a great company to work for the first 4 years, they were all about work life balance. Allowed me to go to school and work from home when I needed, All upper management had an IT background which helped because they were all laid back, then we had an exodus of great management.  Big boss relocated, a new boss was hired with sales background, he got rid of all the other great managers and replaced them all with sales people, who were all about reports and numbers. All went down hill, no more work life balance, it was all about the numbers. Finally had enough and left, one year later they laid off everyone in the department."
good,"Working in sales is fast paced, interesting and allows for job flexibility. Sales can be brutal depending on the territory and accounts one receives, but overall the experience has been positive."
good,"•	Worked in Amazon FLP in Amazon.de., handled all over Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and so on ) and  placed their order for desired Items"
good,"Great company to work and gave an opportunity to work with IBM direct account and also channel exposure for power and storage business."
good,"Corporate culture"
good,"I built campaign strategies and coordinated with countries around the world to implement them.  For 10 years I worked remotely but it is no longer allowed.  "
good,If you are looking for a sterio type of profile and not so interested to grow then this company is the best. Though the world has gone so far but here they rather give more priority to the cost than the process or clients
good,Good for managers. Vast opportunities in different skills. Good onsite opportunities. Flexible work from home option. Multi culture exposure. Nice work culture.
good,"As a technical support officer I was required to offer telephone support to customers of IBM mainframe products. This entailed doing detailed analyses of technical information provided by those customers and often writing bug fixes to correct problems with those products. It required that I learn as I go, on the job, as it were, because those problems were often, by their nature, entirely new problems. The work culture was exciting and very demanding."
good,"Operation Management"
good,IBM is a very organized and professional workplace. I liked that they have very structured way of onboarding new people and getting them ready for all the requirements to be productive in their jobs.

good,"IBM is a great company to work from a branding and resourcing perspective.   I made the most of my experience by tying in the different parts of IBM (software, outsourcing, and advisory consulting) into creative packages that helped reach client results."
good,Nice place to work as long as you are getting decent hikes and a good manager. not most of the teams will allow one for a work life balance in this place else this is a good brand to have.
good,More people and less aspiration. Consideration for the work is not measured by motivation its by rule. Not utilize the talent properly. However by brand and starting career is really good
good,"I spent a little time with IBM where I transitioned R2R process for Tyco Valves from New Zealand where other colleagues covered it for Australia, Singapore countries."
good,"Loved the company."
good,Had been working as Change Manager for E-Business and Hosting Server (eBHS) accounts. This is a cluster of 18 accounts managed by a group of 6 people. Hence practicing the resource sharing and utilization to the fullest.
good,"Loads of Exposure"
good,Good company to start your career. Not a company to stick with for long time. Too much office politics. They act like a typical call centre - make you work overtime without your consent

good,"Gives lot of freedom to explore different career domains, within the company. You get to learn different disciplines not only under your domain but across domains."
good,"This was my first job in international company, I learnt a lot here from my colleagues and upgraded my self to go miles in this sector, I met with good people who are friends for-ever."
good,"some enjoy the boss over attitude etc , poor infrastructure ,they basically lease out office spaces and lacks administration, slow great, less opportunity to shine in the organisation"
good,"IBM India doesn't pay its employees at all, they don't even care if people move out of the company as the organization is heavily dependent on contractors."

good,"Just work life balance is only pros."
good,"Productive and Fun Place."
good,"Entré a IBM con el animo de seguir aprendiendo y perfeccionarme mucho mas en mi área de trabajo, lamentablemente me retiré porque no encontré lo que estaba buscando, en 19 meses de permanecer allí no pude aprender mas de lo que ya sabía cuando entré, para mi no fue una experiencia buena ni mala, solo sucedió, y me retiré de la empresa para aprender una versión de la programación que ya domino, pero orientada a Web (CGIDEV2) que curiosamente la que debía entrenar era precisamente IBM ya que es su Patrocinador. soy sincero en lo que expreso!"
good,It is a good company to work for. However for the size of the company it seems to be very disorganized. One would expect the processes in a company of this size to be streamlined.
good,"Good work/Life balance: Flexible timings and work from home option, really helped me thrive."
good,"fun at work."
good,I have fare experience in IBM. Work and learning opportunity are very good but hardly gives increment on compensation. There is no bonus or incentive in US onsite.

good,"Lots of opportunity"
good,Large company with many divisions. I've learned multiple file transmission software solutions.  Due to the companies willingness to constantly improve and grow it gives us the opportunity to learn and work with the newest technology.  IBM doesn't retain staff - you must stay on top of everything if you want to succeed.
good,I was with IBM for a very short period to really provide any constructive review however I worked with some great set of people who believed in providing a great customer experience every time a customer would call up with any issue.
good,"I have worked in IBM India and my work as a Senior developer includes coordinating the developments with my team members, reviewing the quality standards of the code ,as well as develop the SAP objects. IBM is a good place to start. Work life balance is a little hectic."

good,"IBM is nice work place to work."
good,"It might be a one of case with me. However I've been with this company twice and seen a culture adaptability at the beginning. The culture doubts on your capability at the beginning. Here one should be smart enough to get into the ecosystem quickly by understanding the manager intentions, one's knowledge into technical things are irrelevant. Your suggestions no matter how good, will be frowned upon and turned down. Gel with the manager is the best option."
good,I didn't learn anything from IBM I was moved from Centurylink to IBM doing the same work with the same pay. I loved the work I did until it was outsourced to India. I was given a chance to find a job within IBM but with my skills was unable to find anything and was then released. The management is not very helpful when they need things it is a hard process to get help with anything most of what I would need I had to figure out on my own.
good,"nice place to work."
good,"Its a good place to work if you want work life balance but in salary and hike terms, you will be disappointed. "

good,"Friendly environment - IBM has the policy of 'everyone is equal', all IBMers - from a graduate to a partner/VP are approachable. Lots of clients all over the country."
good,IBM has a lot of skilled and caring people working there. Most of the first line and second line work hard to help employees.
good,"IBM has continued to layoff workers, especially in the US, so I do not recommend it for a job.  While working there, IBM is great for collaboration and information because co-workers are good at sharing information.  Best benefit of the job was ability to work from home."

good,Its full of work and a good place to learn. A very stable architecture the applications run on which provides a good opportunity for aspiring developers to learn. People are very kind but with a sense of competition that prevails all through. The difficult part of the job has been the tough deadlines.

good,"The internship there was my early start with companies. There, I got used to work with HTML, CSS, Photoshop. Also, I wrote Unit Tests and documented some parts of a bank application. I had meetings with my team to present my ideas of a feature, discuss and we came with new improvements. My co-workers were friendly, I spent some quality time with them, but unfortunately my internship ended and I had to get back to university."
good,"management is not good, flexibility is a plus point. Everything depends on your manager, if he is ok with everything, then you will not have any issue, HR is not there"

good,"I've been with IBM for 20 yrs and although it's not the same as it was under the previous stewardship, IBM is still a good company  to learn new skills and grow with experience.  There are serious challenges that as a manager I deal with on a daily basis.  Level setting client expectations, dealing with escalations, and expected to answer every call at any given time can absorb all mental strengths from you.  I currently manage 5 teams (Intel, VMWare, MF, Notes Domino, and Backup/Recovery) so there is always an issue that I am working through with the client at any given time. As a manager, you're also expected to perform a 24/7 week shift of on call incident manager where you're paged out for every production issue in the environment.  It is a very challenging environment and client with a non-stop pace."

good,"Micromanagement exists"
good,"Not so good now."
good,"Nice Work place at Ahmedabad."
good,"IBM continues to take benefits from employees as the years go by. There are too many processes that get in the way of us doing our jobs. Lack of resources due to resource actions is a huge problem, but the executives don't seem to care. The problem isn't with direct line managers. The problem is with the executive leadership and the dream world in which they live. They have no idea, nor do they care, how difficult our jobs have become. 17 years ago when I first started, IBM was pretty great. Now, I'm just trying to hold on for another few years until I can retire."

good,"What a mess over there!  Some great people and a great legacy, but things are constantly changing (and not always for the better).  Management pretty much sucks.  Highest contract rate I've ever had, though, and working remotely was awesome (though that is one of the things that is changing for the worse - they seem to be going the way of Boeing and cutting back on that sort of thing)."

good,This was my first company after college to work with and I was proud to be at IBM. The company is solid and continues to be a great place to work at.
good,IBM is a huge company and great talent. Its legacy is both its pride as well as its cryptonite. Corporate culture is slow and desperately trying to transform to be more customer-focused. The footprint of IBM is massive and if you can stomach the culture your impact would be immense.
good,working under contract for Kelly Services for IBM was satisfactory. Training was sufficient and it provided to required skills for IT support.
good,"travail en journée en open space"
good,"As it was a 24x7 operation I had to start immediately upon signing in and had to rely upon a clean handover both at the start and the end of each 12 hour shift. Customer service skills, attention to detail and tight administration were paramount despite consistent criticism from IBM management (most staff were contractors) but the majority of co-workers were a joy to work with. Achieving recorded commendations for my work from customers offset the criticism from management."

good,"Very Demanding Job, no gratification on work well done, no raises in 7 years, unstable placement, alot of acquisitions always taking place"
good,"Great work life balance, however due to IBM being so big, it can be quite challenging to be visible enough to move one's career ahead."
good,"The working environment is very friendly. Each intern has his or her own space. I prefer a relatively private space compared to the open-spaced design in many IT companies in the bay area. Each Tuesday afternoon the team will get together in a tea hour to talk about everyone's ideas, progress or anything you like. The interns will have opportunity to present the work during intern as posters."
good,Good place to work who wants WFH option. Good to learn other technologies and can change your domain. people stay for long time in this company.
good,"I looked forward to finishing my career with IBM however unfortunately the business lead me to new opportunities to move on.

I felt like I was part of a huge family and we helped each other."

good,"in my area we were responsible to pay all the commissions to sales team in Americas (south , central and North) , so as we were haddlying people's money , we had to be very careful and aware of the complience regulations of all countries. There were many procedures we had to follow in order to pay all them correctly. As the system that bussiness partners reported the sales were not conected to the other ones we had to check mannually the sales report in order to have the accurate payment check. Sometimes we had to work till late hours or even holidays in order to haddle the demand as each of us had around 300/400 people to pay monthly. A part from that my team work was really fun and healpful."

good,"This was a typical 9-5 job, with a 15 minute break in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Daily morning meetings were held to identify what each person would work on that day and any other goals management had identified.  The atmosphere between co-workers was strained.  Regular employees did not want to work with contractors for fear the contractors would take over their job eventually.  The hardest part of the job was becoming a trusted team member regardless of whether you were a contractor or not.  The most enjoyable part of the job was forming winning relationships at work."
good,In IBM I had the chance to improve my IT skills and work in a multicultural enviroment. I collaborated with Italian team.

good,"work force reductions are too often, then replaced with third party contractors later.  suggest you find employment elsewhere or at least move on as quick as possible.  IBM is not a great company to work for at all. for example no pay raises for over 10 years."
good,"Everyone I work with is very friendly and helpful, it was easy to slip into my role. There is not a lot of love for the company, many of the veterans have reasons to gripe about executives, management, and overall company vision. Management can be excruciatingly slow to communicate, projects aren't very ambitious, tons of corporate overhead in almost all aspects of work."

good,"Pros:"
good,"IBM has been a good employer for me for the almost 4 years that I've been with them.  The benefits are good and my immediate manager is very considerate.  However, changes in the workplace when it comes to tasks, movement of people from one tower to another are very frequent.  In a way, it can be considered positive because if gives us more learning.  On the other hand, the continuous change hinders us from mastering one process."
good,"A empresa proporciona muito aprendizado, porem esta com gestores que não cuidam do bem estar profissional de seus empregados"

good,"Work place is quite good. Have flexibility in work. We have work from home option. Rarely due to hectic deadlines,pressure is more on employees which is not adjustable sometimes. I have learnt more from my colleagues regarding work."

good,"IBM is narrowly focused on quarterly earnings and it flows down to how they treat their employees.  GBS is turning into more of a body shop and less of a consulting firm.  The culture is not what you would get at a ""Big 4"" firm."

good,"I loved working with all the people surrounding me. It was fun to work with different tools."
good,"I managed 13 executive calendars scheduling all meetings for them, sent important emails on their behalf as well as setting up teleconferencing details for them on a regular basis.  I also arranged travel itineraries and transportation as well as dinner reservations so that they may take their executives and/or clients out to eat in a nice environment to get reacquainted or to establish a professional rapport.  Management was relaxed as they would sit back to allow you to do your job while not interfering as the days were time sensitive and stressful mostly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feedback given to me by my executive clients as to how I had succeeded and how I may improve if at all for each personal executive.  My co-workers were kind and of the same detail oriented mind and we got along wonderfully.  The most difficult part of the job was having to let my clients know that I needed to leave to take care of myself medically.  The most important thing that I learned was that even though I may not physically see my client the work could be done just as efficiently as if I were sitting directly outside of their offices."
good,"At IBM work hard to meet our targets."
good,"It's a good job between career moves, but for me personally it is not a long term option. I excelled and reached seniority status without opportunity for internal promotion so I am seeking a new exciting opportunity to use my assets and expand my professional abilities."

good,"La empresa IBM Daksh ya no existe. La experiencia fue muy buena,tuvieron muchas oportunidades de aprender nuevas cosas."
good,"Our work schedule is fixed (and I was part of the team from the second shift) and the location is near our house. Ours was more of a routine-type of work as we were handling a process, but nevertheless, we know of our importance in the whole spectrum of the organization that we work for."
good,I worked there for one year . It has good environment and has friendly team members I had a great experience in such big company.

Working on the manufacturing site resulted that all rules, applicable for the production is automatically applicable for other, non-manufacturing unit.

good,"Embora não obtive reconhecimento financeiro que almejava, a empresa me proporcionou muito aprendizado e inúmeras opções de desafios."
good,"Flexible work schedule and room for opportunity in the company depending on your network and who you know. The company can be quite political and being that it is such a large company, it is hard to get things to change or move."
good,"Worked on outsource account so upward mobility is limited to only a few people.  My management was good, most enjoyable part of the job was no micro-management."
good,"IBM is a company of projects. You have to secure and keep a project, in order to work for IBM. If your project ends, its up to you find another project within the company, and that's not easy."
good,Good work environment for the most part. Feeling of teamwork and a great place to be as long as you are over quota. Constantly taking accounts away and increasing quotas to make it difficult to maintain consistent performance over the long run.
good,"Hours are not conducive to a work life balance.  "
good,"The work culture is very good. Both the organizations are not only focus on work but also give chance for employees to enjoy their work by doing some creative activities, playing games in spare time. My team members were good and supportive in nature. Sometimes is very difficult to handle the whole team and understand everyone's point of view, however I somehow managed that. Here I used my Leadership and Management skills. At the end its about team work. I am a team player as well."
good,"it a good company but less opportunity to grow,management is little different at a time but learned many thing in past 3 and half year and overall happy with the company but salary is less when compared to other.                                                                                                                      ."

good,"You work a lot and so long you bring the cash to the company you will survive. Advancement to upper level hardly exists. The moment company loses business, your work is in jeopardy."
good,Good learning experience but not great considering Work environment and salary. Benefits are equally distributed which i think should be work wise or work experience related.

good,"company is good for learning"
good,"IBM is a huge company same as a ocean, you get to learn many things & get to meet many people with different background."
good,Compensation is high for more junior consultants but management and culture is lacking.  Typical 80% travel.  Management is more worried about your utilization and making sure you're billing a client rather than focusing on what your career goals are.
good,"Much work, much pressure, high visibility and much politics. Most time of the day has to be used to follow processes instead to just producing value in the first place."

good,"What IBM does for business and IT is great. They have breaking edge technology and are doing great things for the world. But as an individual employee you can get lost. Different parts of the company have work/life balance but not all. The vacation and benefits are very good. But to advance or move up or even get notices you have to do better then great. Great is normal and what is expected so you end up having to think, be, and act way above everyone to move up. You can feel very alone in a large organization."

good,"•	Worked with one of largest outsourcing clients, performing root cause analysis to determine cause of server failures in environment of 3500+ servers."
good,"A typical day at work : 8am to 5 PM"
good,"A day at work if I may say is a quite tiring. We deal with customers who are already irate, upset and frustrated on the onset of the call, yet we have to control our emotions and still provide them customer service that has satisfactory level. I learned to manage my emotions, utilize soft skills to deal with our angry customer. Additionally, I acquired better communication skills which helped choose the right and more effective words to utter. Management is doing excellent performance, always making sure we are hitting our goals without putting anything at risk. The hardest part of the job for me is to deal with an angry customers who never wanted to talk with you. The most enjoyable one is when you know that by the end of the call, there is a customer you sure is very happy for you."
good,"It is good company to work for, as with other consulting companies work life balance depends on type of projects that you work and your manager. Nice people to work with, very professional organization"

good,"Based on the deliverables and situations"
good,"It was a challenging job, but I love it as it helps to improve and prepare me for the next level. I love my colleagues, the workplace and my job. I think communication is essential in this company. The hardest part of the job was coordinating with internal and external (customer) team at the same time in the short period of time especially there was a tender to respond. As long as I communicate with the right person across the organization, deadline should not be any issue."
good,"There are lots of learning opportunities, competitions and events that grant exposure. But, the pay is not on par with market and the progression is slow."
good,"IBM was once a beacon and stood tall amongst most employers. Today they possess one of the biggest bloated middle managements."

Have enjoyed interacting with IBM employees in and around the world. Its given me an opportunity to learn different people & HR policies in countries."

good,"- Monitor and run client systems. Report/escalate all hardware, software and batch failures via ticketing systems."

good,"A flexibilidade que a IBM permite que os funcionários conciliem perfeitamente a vida profissional e pessoal."
good,"Daily allocation and productivity management"
good,"A typical week is full of repetitious meetings where Project Managers report status to various executives.  There is no follow through or roll-up by an old-school management team after that, and mid-level project managers run all aspects of development.  The hardest part of the job is finding time outside of meetings to actually manage projects and drive my team to complete their tasks.  The most enjoyable part are co-workers/peers and the technical nature of the work. I've learned that the customers want simple solutions and not overly complicated ones that require on-site help or extensive documentation.  They need software updates that do not interrupt their business operation."
good,"I worked at IBM for 6 years straight out of college and learning there products, in particular the WebSphere brand was an interesting experience.  It offered challenge in finding bugs, and coming up with ways to automate the test cases. I also go to do development as well with JAVA.  However, because of low resources I could not do anything else but the same assignments that were assigned to me year after year.  I did not get to grow as much in my career there."

Tracked and followed up on orders till invoiced. Created new customer profiles in CRM system. I worked with a wonderful team of 20 co-workers plus all of the sales reps as well as other departments globally. There was nothing hard about the job because my team members and I were always there to help one another meet all deadlines.

good,This was a 2 month temp assignment.
good,"Average benefits, difficult to navigate corporate environment, unclear lines of authority. You need to get your money upfront, because raises are unlikely for 60%+ of all employees each year. It's ALL about the bottom line. Lukewarm commitment to employee professional development (only if it doesn't cost any $)."

good,Learned various people management skills as worked with various management leaders in different projects.
good,Not lot good to appreciate at the same time not such worst to comment except the benefits and growth here. Both are very slow and long.
good,"When I was interning with IBM, I was still an undergrad at North Carolina State University. I worked as a QA tester, and got to experience first-hand what the software development lifecycle can be like. It was an overall ok introduction to the industry."

There were no restrictions in terms of the people we got in touch with or the practices we implemented, ideas flowed and due to a transition project we initiated and implemented a huge number of ideas to streamline the process to make it more effective."
good,"Typically a day involved working on new sales opportunities through scoping the services engagement with the customer and qualified IT engineer/specialist, quoting and obtaining all required approvals through the quality assurance measures put in place to send quote and contract to customer, follow up / sales calls to win the services contract, and submitting contracts for process activation including securing resources to perform the job."

good,IBM used to be a great company .. not anymore.. cutting corners everywhere.. including empolyee growth..
good,"Work is very challenging and the pay is great. Unfortunately, many products get canceled after putting in considerable amount of time and effort into them. The people working at IBM make the company what it is."
good,Very corporate not employee centric
good,My typical day at IBM was never the typical day which I loved. You never knew was type of events or individuals would be thrown at you on a day to day basis. The anticipation behind building and coordinating an event was always my favorite part of the job because the end result was always the same no matter the size or type of event...The end game was closing the deal and making sure the clients and the people involved were happy!
good,"very good company, learnt lot of things from there like punctualtiy, hard work always pays, team work always beneficial, work with cooperation and coordination, communication skills, clean working environment and many more things"
good,"IBM provides so many good opportunities to learn new skills through its on-line and on classroom trainings. Work culture is great as it is a matrix organization, you can directly interact to any level. Each employee contributes towards organization success as an individual and team."

good,good insurance benefits
good,"• Good in people management, Communication, interpersonal skills, self-motivated, quick learner, Proven team player with the ability to resolve the issues, test estimation, recruitment, onsite co-ordination and onsite exposure as well"
good,I acquired this position through a temp agency. My experience reflects more so on the temp agency and not IBM itself.
good, Managed a team of 5 professional buyers.
good,"Usually, you would like working here."
good,Working at IBM has been a wonderful and interesting experience.
good,1) Flexible working environment.
good,the management selected for this project could have been screened much better and thereby the staff would have been screened better for professionalism
good,"I was handling hr operation for recruitment .Because of my job I have acquired confidence for handling stress and managing capability for difficult situation through out my job ,I can maintain a good relationship with my co workers .Optimistically facing my all hardest part of my job,I am enjoying my all part of my job."
good,Good installations and a cozy international environment.
good,"Bom clima organizacional, com pessoas agradaveis que ajudam o dia a dia que o trabalho mecanico pode trazer. Gerecia um tanto quanto distante, porem sempre atende os funcionarios quando solicitados."
good,I joined IBM as part of an acquisition. They struggled to integrate new employees with the existing corporate infrastructure. Many newly acquired employees left or were gently pushed out. I saw several changes in management over a short period of time. Sales-driven culture that lacked the technical expertise to back up the product they were promoting. Management too concerned with metrics to be able to focus on individual needs.
good,"The first thing I did was receive turnover from night shift. I then logged on to twelve different accounts. My duties included monitoring for failed jobs, interacting with users abroad for their requests and needed assistance. I used several different operating systems to complete my duties. I had wonderful co-workers. We bonded well and shared stories of our children. We worked in a team environment and we fused into a family. I appreciated the managers allowing me to do my job with being over-bearing. We all were expected to do our jobs with minimal supervision. The hardest part of my job was severing professional ties with my co-workers and managers. The most enjoyable part was my relationships with my users. I enjoyed doing going my beyond my duties to influence a better work experience for my users from other countries."
good,"I currently am lead for a project to help subsidize insurance policies for a client. I lead a team of 8 others and provide them daily support. I provide the client detailed information to better inform them of our progress. My co-workers are a joy to work with, my manager is fair and equal and overall I am happy. The hardest part of my job is trying to get everything on my plate done before I leave for the day. My most enjoyable part of this job is the self satisfaction as I see the progress being made."
good,Big Name...Less compensation...OK in terms of work opportunities
good,"IBM, what can you say is IBM."
good,"I would not be so negative in reviewing IBM if they weren't offshoring so much work and laying people off. They are known for a good work-life balance and good benefits. However, there pay and raise scale doesn't compare to others in the field."
good,- Preparing forecast for the coming months
good,Gave a good scope for playing a lead role but less co operation among the team members.
good,Typical day would be going to five or six customers where I specialized in brokerage company equipment.
good,"As a remote service technician, I received my problem calls on Blackberry and traveled to customer locations.I was a generalist and worked on a large variety of equipment. I enjoyed the drives and looked forward to the service problems and people waiting to see me."
good,"Loved working there. People are great, leadership is wonderful."

good,Excellent opportunity for FRESHERS to start a Career.
good,It has a lot of top brains.
good,This job was pretty fun to work at. Most of the people are easy going. There really isnt anything hard about this job. I enjoyed the people I worked with. Although this job is repetitve. Its the same thing every day.
good,Communication is encouraged at all levels no matter the senority or position..
good,"8.5 hour day and learned and gain more skills in the field of customer service. the management team was poor not very knowledgeable of the services and guidelines. The hardest part of my job was trying to figure out solutions to problems, especially when the management team lacked knowledge of certain situation, which made pleasing the customer a challenge."
good,A Corporate work environment. Assembly line. Top Heavy Management.
good,training is limited
good,It a good company to work with good environment.
good,nice place.. learning experience.. trying to integrate new os and applications were challenging
good,"IBM was call center based work. While there I worked for two companies, Phillips and Intuit (TurboTax). It was a nice place to work with terrific people in management. The hardest part of the day were difficult customers, but with a background in customer service, this was hardly a problem. Being surrounded by so many great people was the best part of the job. Everyone always made sure you knew everything you needed to know, and if you ever had any questions, they were answered as soon as possible."
good,its a good company as it provides flexibility by providing Work From Home option
good,"Fast pace place to work, people are talented and willing to jump through hoops to get tasks completed in time and within budget!"
good,Customer Communications
good,"The company's history of achievement, its products and services, are legendary and rightly so. IBM's recovery from the brink, and its delivery of shareholder and market value since then will also be legendary."
good,Started as a student and was able to complete my education while getting real world on the job experience.
good,Current manager is excellent and wonderfully professional
good,Well I worked there about 10 years back when it was going through a cultural transition into a services based company. There were definitely pit falls and several management gaps.
good,Not so good work and salary
good,Company continues to try and reinvent itself.  Fast paced and requires a great deal from its employees.  Company is trying to identify the proper way to handle employee reviews.
good,"It's an enjoyable working experience with the experienced and talented team mates. The culture of the workplace is good. There is no discrimination based on caste, gender, age etc."
good,Good place for learning new and upcoming technologies. Employer gives an opportunity to work with multiple end clients in varied business verticals. Employer and employee engagement is average.
good,"It was good working with IBM. Also got oppy to work closely with the Stakeholder and the management, This helped my person skills and focus towards my work."
good,"1) Overall good company to work"
good,There are opportunities at IBM if you want to take them. There is plenty of training and development available but you have to take responsibility and drive this yourself. The management culture isn't great. There is a nasty bullying culture creeping in.
good,At IBM you will have access to the best training materials and world class activities to learn. Opportunities to try out different technologies to upskill and grow in areas which very few companies will give opportunities.
good,"The center in Rochester is a modern agile work environment and the company events are fun. A good place to start right out of school to pick up technical and some soft skills. However, from day one you are thrown into the job (even straight out of college) and expected to just figure it out with very little support from management or your team members. There is a lot of red tape, some departments/business segments can be very political, and it is expected that you will work long hours and over the weekend to complete tasks in order to meet deadlines. Overall, IBM is a big company that is trying to advance itself and become more modern, but given its size and aged executive population that is resistant to change, it is stuck in the stone age of internal business/finance operations."
good,"Excellent work-life balance. Very flexible work culture, not too much workload on one person which is very healthy. Employees gel very well with each other. However, the flip side is the pay, which is severely compromised, due to which majority of the people are compelled to look out for other opportunities."
good,"--free training"
good,"learn a lot in the few months I worked for IBM, people there is friendly ad helpful easy to communicate within the building. overall it was a good experienced."
good,"Though I got to learn quite a few technologies and got to work on variety of projects, growth opportunity and work appreciation has been less."
good,"The work was routine and about the same every day however, team leads maintained good balance all around. Hardest part was lack of challenging work. Most enjoyable part was excellent colleagues, good infrastructure, good leadership."
good,IBM has scope for lot of learning. They are hire very few and technology is assigned . it challenge to work but we learnt a lot as practical experience is best to get hold on technology you work on
good,I am working here from more than a yeras now.  Workculture is good and work load is also fine people can manage their life amd work. Time flexibilty is there.
good,"Culture became quite toxic over the last several years as the business struggled, but enjoyed the high competence and collaboration of the people!  "
good,"Resources are in matrixed management, which has its pluses and minuses."
good,"The working environment is great, outstanding company culture! Team Leads and Operation Leads are compassionate with the well-being of their team members. Offers competitive salary and bonuses!"
good,"Après 18 ans de travail, force est de constater que la société n'est plus dans le développement de ses ressources humaines."
good,"Learning and training related to career was always there besides your daily deliverables. Sometimes, false commitment from management leads to unreliable relationship."
good,Great atmosphere at the office and flexible schedules.  Tools to work with team around the world and opportunities to work within other areas of the company.
good,"My current job, shift work, 2 days work 2 off, 2 nights work, 2 off. The job is okay. Monitoring and taking care of alerts. Some escort here and there."
good,"Its focus is on Overall development of its employees and currently its focus is on Cloud, AI and Big data . All employees are required to upskill with time."
good,"At an IBM CIC you'll typically work on contracted assignments. You'll spend about a month on the bench not working and perhaps training. Management can range from extremely helpful to distant and difficult to reach. The main goal is to have you on a project, they'll guide you in training if you don't already have some experience which is great. I am not personally into 100% travel and some of these projects are that. Though, I've found it difficult at times to work remotely depending on time zones. They will not switch projects for most reasons aside from health. They will encourage advancement if they see you're doing well and will give you a small raise. You will not be encouraged to specialize in any tech stacks and need to be flexible. This can be a pro or a con depending on your goals."
good,"Alot of internal politics, and based in service industry so u can't expect a good hike, but u can learn alot of stuff and has a good job security, but it's more kind of college culture, u are treated has a student."
good,"It is good for people don't have ambitions, comfortable but not motivating. Although the working was easy and without pressure, that also means it was boring and there's nothing to learn or improve personal skill"
good,They provide wonderful benefits and I really like the position but continual workforce reduction layoffs caused discontent and anxiety to employees.  I had four managers in five years (one moved onto a different role and one was an interim manager);
good,"One of the things about IBM is that it is always remaking itself, which means that one day your position might be highly valued, and the next, you are no longer needed. Or, they may one day decide that they no longer want remote employees and require you to move across the country or lose your job."
good,"it was kinda like I was hired in to find my own work to do from an internal job board of potential client projects, however, it did not really work out for me."
good,"this company has a generally low morale throughout the company, there are continual cost cuts, which mean job losses, and there is no investment in retention of exiting staff"
good,I learnt how to work in a team. Got many opportunities that helped me enhance my skills. Salary is neither too good nor too bad. But better compared to many other companies. I happened to work with the best managers and I really liked the company.
good,I had 3 managers during my first 4 years of tenure. My first yearly review was done by a 2nd line that worked at a different site who I had talked on the phone with only once.
good,Upper management messed up more than they should've and lots of people along with myself became expendable!    A typical day consists of repairing Lexmark Printers and testing them as well as entering repair related information in the tracking system that was in place.
good,Good work culture and open environment. a good place for functional consultant. Currently focused in Cloud Area only and loosing focus on Oracle EBS. Oracle Service Line is not in focus and lots of cross skill and up skill are being encouraged.
good,It’s a cool place.. things are flexible and depending on your manager you can work from home which is really cool.. the environment is chilled out and you can learn lots
good,"Too much focus on obtaining billable work and not enough on applying and expanding your skillset. All of the projects I have been on in the past year have are completely different from the work I was told I would be doing, and shifting to a new project is difficult due to lack of transparency about open positions and the pressure to remain billable."
good,A IBM é uma grande escola. Empresa respira processos em determinadas áreas que faz o funcionário conduzir as diretrizes de forma eficiente. Falta meritocrácia e liderança - conduz os negócios de forma paternalista.
good,"In the ten years I have been with the company, I've only gotten 1 raise. They took away night and weekend/holiday pay. It's like pulling teeth to get overtime."
good,"At IBM , I had work life balance. I was given required training and managers were supportive. I enjoyed the team work at IBM. I got exposure to client sites and client interactions. This provided me to learn about the expectation of client which was fed back to IBM. The company provided all required support to up skill my knowledge."
good,"IBM Provides Good Work life balance but somtimes it may comes with a low Salary offer by them. The work you do here depends entirely on the project. As part of GBS business unit, you may get a chance to work on the latest cutting edge technology or maintenance of application or IBM tools."
good,"The job is stable and consistent, but funding has been a problem lately. The work culture is dull, and the work can be stale at times. Most people in my department are quite friendly, however."
good,"I worked in IBM Digital Sales center in Dublin . They have very promising innovations and a bunch of very talented employees, however the complexity of the business model sometimes makes it hard to leverage these benefits."
good,An excellent company with huge potential for innovation. Have brought in solutions in a way that no other ISP or SWG can think of. Hopefully there will be many more to come.
good,"Need good management and work life balance, Shift basis rotation is not proper, culture is good, job responsibilities are good. Have enough employee engagement programs"
good,"Lots of young new people being hired, and a lot of longer termed employees seemingly disappearing.  Can hardly get people to assist when needed.  Constantly changing coverage areas, and it leaves clients wondering who they are supposed to be working with, and in the end they look to other companies."
good,"It is a big name for over 100 years but being a legacy company has its own cons and the biggest one is old systems and bureaucracy."
good,"While your colleagues are always great the continuing culture of cutting man power until a project collapses is harming the people at IBM. Everything is so short sighted, trying to grasp on to the next big thing. No leading, just firefighting profit loss of a once dynamic company."
good,Good company open environment for learning new work. good leaders good manager bad hr department. Salary lower than industry standard but awesome team leaders make you learn work faster and efficiently
good,It's a well known company which will help you very quickly advance your career.  Big company means that things move very slowly and you have to follow all the many guidelines and processes already established.
good,IBM is a nice place to work. I really enjoy working there. I have learned so much about computer repair. Becoming a lead was a plus. Moving up in the company was a plus for the work I do.
good,Good place to work. Great benefits.. Great work life balance. Poor management. Not a clear company direction. Too many layoffs. Commission were decent.
good,IBM has a lot of opportunities to grow and is hardwired for change. Its a one stop shop for almost all of the clients IT needs that very few companies can boast globally.
good,Ibm is one of the best company to work with.Work culture is good. you will learn lots of new thing n get yourself certificate. There is no work pressure however growth is slow.
good,"It's impressive and great working environment."
good,"Once an individual has met all stakeholders in a project, life becomes chill with work from homes. "
good,"Pues Es Un Buen Ambiente Laboral Solo Que Hay Mucha Gente  Y Poco Trabajo En Si A Largo Tiempo Aburre No Tener Nada Que Hacer En Todo El Turno. "
good,In the past 10 years the company is more focused on survival and cost cutting instead of strategic growth. Less focus on training the sales and technical teams with the skills required to be the best int he industry.
good,"IBM acquiring the company you work at feels like a hostile takeover. It hasn't been fun switching over to IBM's inferior workflow tools, non-open source technologies, and a borderline unusable cloud. This is a sales driven company. Sales has promised products to our clients are impossible to make and on ridiculously short time lines.  No one young seems to be in love with the company. That being said, as a big company IBM does have money and is able to purchase cool data. There are some good teams at IBM and if you find one your experience here can be enjoyable. They are flexible about working remotely and is usually a have pretty chill environment to be in."
good,"While IBM is a great place to work, some expectations were not expressed clearly. If you did not speak with the correct person it was not a good environment.  Felt disconnected the entire time with the company as a new employee, and always felt out of the circle in conversations."
good,Work Culture is Good in IBM but while placing in client site the client guys will treat you like slave. It is Good platform to learn new technologies.
good,"Acredito que sim, é uma boa empresa e que você consegue buscar seu lugar ao sol, porém, pode levar um tempo para conseguir, por isso, é importante se manter atento a vagas e seus requisitos, ou seja, se mantendo updated ou buscando o conhecimento de uma nova área, você terá mais chances que serão disputadas com outros IBMistas. Para mim, a melhor parte é o dress code, bom plano de saúde, comunidades diversas (para fins corporativos e pessoais, como mindfulness), plataforma interna de aprendizado entre outras coisas da intranet."
good,"Assigned objectives often unattainable"
good,"I had some great teams and some ineffective teams within the same org. It's a huge company, so your mileage may vary. Advancement depends heavily on your current manager."
good,IBM is a good place where Work and life balancing is good.We can learn many things by the training's they conduct but Salary is less than expectations. Hikes are almost nothing .
good,"The people are very nice and everyone is very social."
good,"Good projects"
good,"chaotic work culture, "
good,Work is varied but within my department there is no scope to progress. You can provide your input and manage your own workload which is a good pro but you are never recognised for your achievements and often marked down for minor mistakes by management so you can not achieve bonuses or pay increases. Workplace culture has depleted over the years due to lack of pay rises and team members turning on each other to get noticed for their achievements. There are no perks other than working from home which is great for work life balance but this can depend on your managers discretion and you cant just choose when you work from home. It has to be officially approved and you must spend at least 3 days in the office.
good,"When I first joined IBM many years ago, it was a wonderful company to work for. I was very proud to call myself an IBMer.  In the last 20 years it changed to the point that I would not recommend IBM to anyone."
good,"If you are a quick AND self learner, you will be successful. This is the big company that you only do the small piece to work so need to learn yourself whole big picture by own."
good,"Very unsecured job environment. Layoffs were occurring daily.  Good benefits, relaxed atmosphere, business casual dress.  Limited opportunity for advancement."
good,"Management cares about bonus,  less and less about workers.  Lots of good people with a lot of reusable information.   They have changed a lot through the years."
good,"At one time IBM Service was a very rewarding place to be. But because of cut backs and resource actions the job became very stressful as far as stability of work schedules changing ."
good,This position was fun and exciting because I got to learn the entire process of making raw printed circuit boards from the best manufacturer of boards in the world.
good,"I worked a lot of hours in finance for this company.  It is so big, you cannot see the fruits of your labor.  I had at least 5 bosses who also had5 bosses.  It was like this everywhere in the company."
good,"flexible working hours"
good,"Some of the management hires and direction was questionable in the HR Talent Acquisition space. Outsiders brought in to ""change"" the face of recruiting failed miserably. Positives were the exposure to new and interesting tech and processes. Middle management was engaged with workforce. Upper Management, did not really understand the nuances of the work and overall Talent Acquisition. It did appear in order to move up in the company, you had to be very political, which is typical in a larger environment."
good,"we will get lot of work but at same time there is a lot of fun with the colleagues."
good,"Known for its flexibility, it is becoming a bane and the Org is getting top heavy and benefits are becoming very minimal. Cut the flab and elephants do not dance all the time."
good,They have pretty good benefit and offer a lot of trainings. Being able to work from home is the best. The company supplies you with everything you need.
good,"typical day at work: 8-5 with plenty of pointless meetings required "
good,Working with this company has been one of the most fulfilling days of my life. This is because of the wonderful people. Individuals with different personalities yet still jive and collaborate with each other.
good,Learning wise it is a nice comapany.Good Work life balance.But compensation wise it is not a good company. They dont even gice onsite opportunities to freshers or 2-3 experienced professionals
good,"IBM is a good place to work and employees can have a good work life balance."
good,"freedom to work any hours, flexible, nice team of data scientists, manager was not helpful with work assignment, absent, hard to get good consulting projects, assignments coming from a poor job board."
good,"After working for about 5 years in IBM, it is a great place to upgrade the skills (both technically & professionally). It gives an opportunity to work on multiple platforms/domains thus increases scope of learning"
good,"Uma ótima empresa para desenvolver-se profissionalmente e um ambiente de trabalho sem igual, onde o respeito e o bem estar do individuo é muito valorizado,"
good,"Good company happy to work and good environment and management will support for all innovative things.            "
good,"Oportunidades de aprendizaje."
good,"Great place to start your career."
good,"In the right role the company offers opportunities to be at the forefront of technology.  Even when meeting or exceeding performance criteria, the company reorganizes often resulting in Reduction in Force of older, highly experienced and highly compensated workers in favor of outsourced roles and younger staff replacements."
good,"A cultura é muito bem trabalhada, assim como valores e a missão. O ambiente de trabalho geralmente é bom, com bons profissionais."
good,"IBM biggest strength is the way it make use of all its resource. a day in the office consist of jobs, reports, conference calls and lot of learning on daily basis. In this managers are the most supportive part of IBM's structure. they are really helpful and understand the need of the employee well. hardest part is to balance core work to the peripherals work, such as reports and calls. over all IBM is good company for a fresher."
good,"It provides lot of opportunities within the company, only depends on the person how to grab it. In India, work-life balance basically depends on what type of project you are involved in."
good,"-Excellent Work Environment"
good,I had a great experience working in IBM. Got exposure to a lot of new technologies and got to coordinate with many other teams. Successfully delivered a lot of projects within a short time. A lot of opportunities for self-learning.
good,"IBM is an OK place to work. Can be improved. "
good,"The working culture and environment is good, flexi work option is available for employees. IBM Invest more on training employee in current technologies"
good,IBM has been trying to return to a profitable company.  They have been making major changes every 6 months and has changed the focus from serving the customer to focus on how you can meet numbers that are not beneficial for the customer.  IBM has lost many good people due to the cut-throat environment it has built in the last few years.  Sad to see where it is going.  The customer value has to be a focus if there is a target of longevity.
good,"Empresa con un ambiente laboral pesado para los empleados, pero se debe asumir el reto de trabajar en ella."
good,"IBM, from my experience, is the typical big business. There are mentor ship program, career mapping and talent development for those who are interested and willing to seek out those opportunities. The size of the company makes it difficult to move from one opportunity to another and hinders individual creativity."
good,"	Understanding Boot Process & GRUB recovery procedure."
good,"Worked with some of the best people, and we did incredible work. However, senior executive leadership destroyed the positive culture in the company, and good people were weaned out of the company. "
good,The company was wonderful to work for and provided me many opportunities both with furthering my knowledge in my craft and career advancement. This i believe is an attribute to their success.
good,Great place to work at challenges come from every direction all the time. Environment is supportive and push you to move forward. Pay is not that great but you have room for solid negotiation
good,"-Managers are overloaded with employees and often overworked so it is challenging to gain their visibility or mentorship if this is the case for your team. If you work hard enough, you can turn this around. "
good,"Working with IBM was OK. There were regular meetings, a steady flow of tickets, IT techs supporting each other effectively, effective management, easy going uses and normal business hours."
good,"Funciona como una empresa chica."
good,"Creating and implimenting the changes and working on Customer requests, Patching servers,  Incident Management and change Management. Working on customer Emails on high priority issues for Linux/Unix servers."
good,IBM is a good employer but chopped employment a lot when business became difficult. Management was fair with the employees but directives from higher up removed much flexibility.
good,"IBM has a lot of benefits and securities, even before you're given tenure and provided a regular position. Though sometimes, you may get a lot of pressure at work, but if you love your job? Definitely worth it."
good,"Great opportunities to learn from very smart people in a global, virtual environment."
good,"Tremendous opportunities for training / career growth, and using industry leading as well as innovative applications and tools for identifying talent and creating positive candidate experiences. Very keen on streamlining and working smarter rather than harder."
good,"Very exciting company to work for, going through a big digital transformation,  plenty of enablement for those wanting to progress,  very extensive portfolio of products"
good,"I started working as a Finance and Accounting Senior Analyst to our clients from Asia Pacific countries which includes Singapore, Thailand, Australia, Philippines, and others. I was part of the Toshiba Team during that time and I belong to the Order Management Customer Fulfillment Team. "
good,"It's a ok place to start your career"
good,"Environment is nice for sure, I just find that there's no opportunities like they say they have.  I can't complain about the shifts and benefits cause that is very good. But I need experience and IBM doesn't really seem to be able to give it to me."
good,Workplace environment was fun and management was always attentive and willing to lend a hand . Team leaders were always willing to share knowledge and cross train employees when new subject matter needed to be studied.
good,"I am grateful for my time at IBM but there was no job security."
good,Good place to work. Being able to work from was a plus. I had a great manager who allow me to work without looking over my shoulder. My manager always had my best interest at heart.
good,Had great project to work on and explore and management was supportive .Great work culture and I was also able to explore new tools and technologies. Overall good experience.
good,"I've worked with IBM in two contracts -- one with a highly mature, cohesive, and skilled set of people, and one that was understaffed, not well trained, with a lot of pressures.  This is par for the course as a contractor.  But one thing I really didn't like about my time with IBM was the annual attempt by management to have contractors take a pay cut or risk being let go."
good,"The company, still age discriminates, although that is legally hard to prove. They could really benefit from a either a co-CEO model with one focused on vision and the other focused on culture, create a Chief Culture Officer role or give the responsibility to the COO. If they can fix the culture (too many people not being held accountable, lack of follow-up on matters), they can revitalize the company. They have too much technology lineage NOT to be relevant. They need to shun Wall Street results for an internal revolution that would make the Street take notice and boost the stock organically, rather than just chasing the goal of raising the price."
good,"Typical day at work good"
good,"Work life balance is well guaranteed. It is also a great place to learn. "
good,"Overall, I liked IBM in the beginning.  Very supportive until the new CEO.  Job cuts everywhere.  The only thing that protected me was my account.  When my account did not renew, that was the end.  Many long term employees were being terminated.  "
good,The workplace culture is friendly Open-air collaborative environment for collaborating among peers. Management is very outgoing and honest on day to day activities.
good,Worked from home. Workplace culture is comfortable. I gained very valuable professionalism experience at IBM. Collaboration and communication is very crucial at IBM.
good,Good Company with lot of flexibility like Work from Home.We can learn new technologies.We can balance work and family by working in IBM.Management is also good.
good,Took advantage of the wide open learning center and was able to attend a variety of classes.  Opportunities to learn and perhaps advance looked hopeful for a while.
good,"IBM workplace culture is good, growth & opportunities are not getting easily due to huge employee strength. I didn't find any hardest part of the job in IBM."
good,"High turnover, but a good place to get started in financial analysis. A lot of what you learn felt specific to IBM but the idea of reporting on deadlines with people across the world helped immensely to prepare me for more difficult work."
good,"Management was really good and did not micromanage everyone. Unfortunately, almost all employees are contract based with hardly any benefits. I very much enjoyed the flexible schedule and the ability to have half days on Friday."
good,"Check and respond to customer email via Service Now que"
good,"Perhaps in an effort to build a more competitive, innovative workforce and reduce costs, IBM seems to have abandoned a once cherished tenet of ""respect for the employee""."
good,"Is a good company but on a daily basis our management is more focus on results, with almost no time for coaching. So when you need advice or someting else, mostly they do not have time for you,"
good,Industry behemoth with 100+ years of experience. Amazing training facilities with cutting edge technology. Timeless brand reputation which strengthens the CV.
good,They provide flexibility to work from home. Work is monotonous with very little to learn and no scope for growth. There is not much of interaction between coworkers which makes the work culture boring.
good,"Miss the ""people' smarts"", the ever-evolving tech trends, the breakthroughs, etc. Wish though the ""work life pendulum"" would have been more titled towards the middle."
good,You don't source candidates. You are sent resumes through Taleo by employees of the company. You can easily receive hundreds of resumes for one job. It was hard fining the best candidate quickly.
good,"As an employee working my shift was fantastic. IBM allowed employees to work from home and supplied laptops, pagers, etc. to work remotely."
good,"Four layoffs in three years.  It used to be a place where you could do your job, and know that you would be there for the long haul."
good,Poor vision for the future and how actions affect the clients. Excellent lower tier managers. IBM provides a wide range of training opportunities for those who are driven enough to find them.
good,The hardest part of the job is to travel sometimes from coast to coast due to lack of projects. Management now is more focused on having employees being billable rather than the skill set of resources But this could also be due to lack of good projects.
good,"I have worked for IBM for many years in lots of different roles"
good,"Working with co-workers from all over the world adds great experience, project management is all about connecting with people to get the work done with established timelines and this global experience teaches all about time management"
good,One of the perks while working was the ability to work from home. And the working hours was flexible and/or this will depend on the project you are in.
good,"Empresa enfocada a los resultados, posibilidades de ascenso, condiciones contractuales y salariales regulares. Buena escuela."
good,"Great challenges - great peers overall.  I worked with some truly talented coworkers on some fascinating projects and had a great manager.  The challenges tended to come from higher management and sales leadership - with goals not aligned with customer needs leading to delivery issues on projects.  (Typical IT consulting challenge).  Overall we often delivered outstanding results, but the rewards to teams and customers sometimes were not as monetarily satisfying leading to a lack of customer sat and employee morale plummeting."
good,I cam to IBM on an acquisition and love working with the people in my space. However there has been a lack of commitment and investment from IBM in our brand since the acquisition and now great people are leaving after losing confidence in the direction of our brand and IBM as a whole.
good,"IBM has been going through a deep transformation in order to adapt to new market trends. For several years IBM has struggled offering products and services that were no longer relevant. Changing to a new line of products and services has been taking too long and many mistakes have been done along the road. IBM is attempting to look like a fresh high tech company the like of Amazon or Google but it is a long way to achieve this result and it may not succeed."
good,"Funcionários de uma mesma área que executavam a mesma função, muitas vezes com salários diferentes, gerando assim certa discriminação entre os mesmos constrangendo o ambiente de trabalho. Muitas vezes também promoções de ""fachada"", onde as atividades eram alteradas, mas salários e cargos na carteira de trabalho não. Por outro lado, os gerentes das áreas faziam o que estivesse ao alcance para amenizar o ambiente de trabalho."
good,"Career focused, productive, friendly and fun workplace. There are various technologies one can get to learn. Lot of scope for upgrading your skills to new technolgies."
good,Important for Career Development because is a huge company and you have a lot of opportunities. It is a local where you will find lovely people and no so lovely. Be careful
good,Demand for long hours and stressful environment.  Management is in a continous flux and at times not willing to stand behind employees.  Demanding work environement.
good,"There's a big desire to bring IBM closer to the bleeding edge of tech and there are many innovative thinkers within the organization that have been bringing on great change, but IBM still struggles due to its size. The way the company is structured make it incredibly difficult to make institutional changes, similar to any large corporation."
good,"IBM has a good work culture and there is no attendance tracking"
good,Communication is terrible but the pay is great. Tough line of business but not enough resources are properly allocated. Just depends entirely on who you're working under.
good,"Lots of skilled people and great ideas to work with, although there is a lack of direction and coordination that can foster individual accomplishments and not necessarily an ""integrated system."""
good,I started my carrier in IBM and I have learnt how the IT culture was and i always feel proud that i was in top IT company.except shift timings i was enjoyed each and every moment.
good,"The ability to learn different products to work on. The products I work on are IBM labeled and Lenovo Desktops, Laptops, and Servers and Apple IOS and Macintosh computers."
good,The people are good but most are frustrated with work.  Systemic problems never seemed to be addressed by management but they do seem to keep finding administrivia to pile on.
good,"Relaxed office environment but very demanding job with tight deadlines."
good,"IBM is an American multinational technology and consulting corporation. IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and offers infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology."
good,Constant work but not as organized as I'd like. We were trained through phone calls and one or two days of in person training and then were thrown in. We did not shadow with agents as our manager suggested. Manager was not in same city. Only spoke on phone once or twice.
good,"The environment is consistently rushed. Management will assign completion dates for various items without consulting the folks actually working on the project. Several managers are unwilling to work with other teams, making it their goal to play politics and point fingers. "
good,The most satisfying factor is in IBM is Job Work/Life Balance. Second things is Job Security. But what i understood my 4 experience in IBM is above mentioned factors are depends on Departments and managers where you are working.
good,Layoffs kept me from still being with IBM.  IBM seemed to prefer shorter assignments instead of employee loyalty.  It was difficult to stay with the company which was disappointing.
good,"Era un trabajo muy entretenido, consistia en ""organizar"" la agenda a los técnicos informáticos. Ellos tenían que ir a solucionar las averías a los clientes y mi trabajo era decirles al que tenían que ir, que llevar. La clave era realizar el mayor número de averías en los menos kilómetros posible."
good,"Processing insurance policy for life and death insurance. Mailing room some of the time. sorting,filing, answering of the phone, questions and problem solving. Running error , alot  of problem solving and data entry."
good,I was an intern so I was only there a few months . It was very fast paced but overall a great learning experience for me. I learn a great deal about time management.
good,"The Lansing, MI branch is a low cost center with minimal opportunities to increase in salary or position. Good place to start off but no long term potential. Excellent benefits but the salary is so low it doesn't matter."
good,"una empresa muy grande, buenas instalaciones, y gente amable"
good,"Collect payments."
good,The company is great for job security but requires you to give back to the company beyond the normal work day that sometimes encroaches the weekend.  Making your utilization is priority at the expense of your family time it seems.
good,enjoyed my work and a relaxing place to work like going in to work there was no stress get on well with other colleegs  job was enjobly because there was direffent task each day
good,Organization has lots of different opportunities to move into different business units. Your success is very dependant on the management team you have.
good,"Professional and Good Work Culture"
good,"I love my job but am watching the organization offshore roles daily.  It makes no difference of my work ethic, I am always looking over my shoulder wondering if my job is next."
good,"Loved the company, my peers, and the position.  My department was shut down due to unforeseen circumstances that were honestly beyond the company's control (9/11)."
good,"I still root for IBM and consider myself an IBMer."
good,"It was good entity to work with. At lower lever too much child politics to please the bosses. Normally, top management are the bosses but here even small employee considered himself/herself above them. Otherwise pay wise is good and freedom to do as you like with little supervision. Routine work with boring and no advancement to bring your skills. Otherwise excellent."
good,"A good company to work at with flexibility (depends on team and job role ultimately). Workplace culture is pleasant. Various locations across bangalore to work from. As it is a huge organization, it takes time to get things going like role change/team change."
good,"Overall, working for IBM was fine.  Over the years, IBM has cut back on salary bumps, and bonus awards.  The stock has been 'fair' so don't expect monetary growth there either.  The building I was in was old and way out of date.  IBM used to promote mobile working, but recently began requiring employees to come into the office.  The lack of getting into the office almost becomes grounds for dismissal."
good,"Nothing must excited, kind of slow paced job."
good,"On a usual working, an employee would answering approximately 19-22 calls, Creating ticket and assisting the business users."
good,".Overall good  Work/Life Balance with lot of career options"
good,"IBM was a great company to learn from. Lots of great people to work with and learn from. A lot of changes happen weekly, monthly, quarterly and you have to have the ability to adapt. As they say one person alone cannot steer an entire ship. "
good,"IBM comes up with more excuses not to give raises than any company I've worked for, except for manager raises, they always seem to have money for them. Bonuses too, don't plan on getting any."
good,"I would be contacted periodically throughout the week via phone to discuss with the other team members what is going to be worked on this week and the following week, then I'd be instructed to do a certain task in that time frame and email them my progress. I've worked in other game development projects but this one felt at least somewhat official with me getting paid for my logged hours."
good,"Overall great company. The size is stifling if you want to grow your career.  The caveat to that is if you are just starting out of college there is a lot of room to grow, but plan on staying at IBM for 15-20 years.  If your mid-career level, it's stagnant. Will stay in same or similar type of role no matter how well you do or not. Also, with that comes greater threat of a RIF. No matter how well you do, if your overall group you are in is doing poorly, you are at risk."
good,"Learned a lot.Management is very well advanced.Lot of work from home opportunities with Approvals ofcourse."
good,"work ethics , work culture , work load was good but individually learning wise is not that great. Basically i am flexible to learn and explore things ."
good,"IBM has a great work/life balance.   However, the company is burdened by bureaucracy and legacy management styles.  This can slow innovation and new ways of doing things.  Has a track record for mass lay-offs."
good,"No fixed in and out time."
good,Good place to work. Work life balance is good. management is good. Women employee safety provided. Office environment is friendly. Team is very much helpful.
good,"IBM is very flexible and secure."
good,"Great company. Smart people. Great learning opportunities. Travel was constant for me. At least most travel was regional. That was cool at first, but got old when I realized I was missing our kids' early development years. I can't believe I stuck it out there for seven years."
good,"IBM é uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, com ambiente excelente, harmonia e equilíbrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal. Porém a remuneração é abaixo da média do mercado e as possibilidades de crescimento na carreira são raros."
good,I worked for IBM India for 1 years in IBM GTS. Management is not that great. Laptop based company so flexibility was there. I worked under a team having 8 members.
good,"Atuei na área de GPS - Global Process Services, onde atuávamos como prestadores de serviços de Recrutamento e Seleção para clientes multinacionais. Por atuar home office, possuía autonomia para gerenciar os projetos, todavia, a comunicação com a gerência no exterior (EUA), era prejudicada e consequentemente, haviam ruídos entre IBM e clientes. Devido a esta falta de direcionamento claro quanto as prioridades dos processos, a carga horária de trabalho era excessiva e maçante."
good,"Flexible but no fixed model in the career Growth to follow, People used to identify position based on the band level but no specific job title given to employees."
good,"I have learned many new things. people use to encourage me in every part. Good working with the IBM and also with my colleuages."
good,"Project managers are typically responsible for developing project plans, leading project teams, making cost estimates, ensuring that the process goes efficiently and that the project is delivered on time."
good,Solo si trabajas con proyectos internos se puede aprovechar lo que Ibm ofrece
good,"IBM is a very large company and people's experience will generally correlate with whether a particular IBM division's revenues are thriving or declining."
good,"1. No burden of work"
good,"IBM has many benefits for those who are starters in the sales area. The renewals department has many benefits like a good salary, good environment to work in and many tools to start your learning. You can also work remotely from time to time, which is a positive thing."
good,"Days are pretty similar.  Take calls, work with colleagues and put out metaphorical fires.  Everything I know about my job I have learned out of college.  The AS400 isn't even mentioned anywhere at my university."
good,"I have a fulfilling career at IBM, and it used to be easier to find and move to other opportunities at IBM to match your skills and work topics you are passionate about. Recently, it has become increasingly hard to find other opportunities at IBM, and the recent back to the labs IBM initiative required moving to certain IBM locations."
good,"By definition this means, ""change (something) so much that it appears to be entirely new."" I suppose the marketing folks at IBM have picked an appropriate word, since this happens at IBM just about every quarter. Teams are rearranged and shuffled, product direction changes, even logos and tag lines can change."
good,"IBM would allow us to rate our manager on a yearly basis; that was called the Executive Interview....and that was a  big plus"
good,Na IBM eu aprendi muito e pude me desenvolver como profissional. A Cultura empresarial me agrada é muito inclusiva.
good,"Worklife balance is good. "
good,Experience the world of bpo at this place like none another. Superb principals and ethics. Following sop and providing every employee equal chance of sharing their expertise.
good,"IBM / Kennexa offers a competitive salary and a good ""Work life Balance"" but, keep in mind that you will be hired under either a one year or three year contract. IBM bought an RPO several years ago and still doesn't have any real insight on managing an RPO and unfortunately it's the mid level employees that suffer. IBM should probably focus on technology and leave full service recruiting to the experts."
good,Fast-paced environment but overall good management. Solid team culture with a lot of knowledgeable and dedicated employees always ready and willing to assist when/where needed.
good,Success is very contingent upon what sales team you are placed on. This will be probably the most important factor in determining how successful you will be within this organization. Very brilliant colleagues who can help solve problems you are not able to solve on your own.
good,"IBM provides good work life balance, and providing good opportunity to learn new technology, but here there is no job security even though if we perform good"
good,I am sure IBM has some great IT jobs that you can work for and earn a good living but not as IT help desk agent. If IBM is ur first IT gig then go for it.You will learn a lot in short amount of time.But the growth within company is not that great. Eventually you have to move on .
good,"The good"
good,"Participación obligatoria en proyectos adicionales al trabajo acordado, horas extra y jefes extranjeros con una relación pobre con el empleado. Poca independencia, se controla todo lo que hace el empleado en el día."
good,"IBM was once one of the greatest and most respected companies on planet Earth.  It still is probably respected, but after 5 straight years of declining revenue and many many Resource Actions there is a brain drain in progress at the technology company.   The company seems to be placing all of its technological eggs in one basket.  Watson, and the IoT (Internet Of Things).  I expect that iOT will only get more and more popular because people are willing to give up their privacy for convenience at the drop of a hat.  "
good,"Upon the merger of Chase and JP Morgan, IBM was contracted by the new JPMC to assume technology service delivery for the (now much larger) firm; and approximately 2/3 of incumbent technology resources were re-branded to IBM.  SLA guidelines were clear.  However, not all business sectors within JPMC were receptive to all SLA parameters - thus making for occasionally strained relations.  Internal communications within IBM were sometimes inefficient, but the clear SLA made for effective scaling of, and efficient service delivery by, the company.  A very valuable experience."
good,"I think most IBMers would say they do exactly know the direction their department is going as it changes so often and not communicated well across the board.  The company has a tremendous amount of good, strong people with sharp skills and learning resources that other companies have a hard time offering.  But, the climate and morale is low as they continue to lose money and many colleagues are stressed over job security."
good,"At Work, attend routine calls for IBM Intel servers, Power Servers and Mid range storages."
good,"good to do my training from their as an network engineer,their i learn various things about cloud technologies and use of cloud computing ,its great to do that"
good,"IBM helps you to improve the self confident at all level and you can build a very good network across Geo."
good,"Very top heavy organisation with very little encouragement or opportunity for those below to showcase their talents."
good,"IBM was an immense learning experience for me. On the plus side, there is practically no area of interest in which one could not find a position. Salaries were decent, as were benefits. That said, there are a few cautions to keep in mind."
good,"Always enjoyed my job as a proposal/bid manager since it capitalized on my strengths like coordination, attention to detail and leadership.  The people I interacted and supported were one of the best team environments and made my job enjoyable."
good,"It was a good place to work with. It provided a lot of exposure to the upcoming technology and was employee friendly too."
good,Very good company to stay for a longer period until and unless you don't mind to spend much time with your family.. but work load very good and salary increments are very average.. very ideal place to learn much and gain knowledge
good,"IBM tiene muchas oportunidades de crecimeinto."
good,Chefes sem knowhow para exercer função na companhia. no projeto onde eu estava alocado.
good,The job required too much travel but it was all interesting work with decent products. I liked many of the IBM team members I worked with and everyone had genuine interest in doing right for our customers.
good,"A typical day in IBM depends on the project you working."
good,"My company was purchased by IBM and after four years I couldn't take it anymore. Layoffs were frequent, morale was low, and projects would run for a year or two and then get cancelled."
good,"The work culture is worst , I've seen in my entire carrier. It could be region specific , because IBM Bangalore work culture is entirely different as compared to Noida"
good,Of course it depends on you but work life  balance is so so here. Job security is high here.Can't expect much hikes here. You can't expect a professional life here.
good,Company is not doing well financially in recent year so only numbers matter to management. Company should not only looking at numbers but need to have strategy on how to gain market shares.
good,Each day is a new day resolving a large variety of complex issues with a diverse clientele World Wide. The hardest part of the job is having to explain to a client that we will need data to analyze and resolve the issue more efficiently. The most enjoyable is the sense of relief the client shows when the problems are quickly resolved and they are back to normal production generating normal revenue.
good,"Has a very flexible work environment and ability to take work from home as and when required."
good,"Prolonged projects which undoubtedly secures your job."
good,"I have worked at IBM for over 18 years and it was an amazing experience.  I loved that you could stay with one company and have opportunities to grow your skills and change careers...but over the course of time that became more and more difficult to do. "
good,"The Littleton office is a good place to work with many good teams. Advancement can be slowed because of the size of the company.  Management in my team was good, however the higher you go up the more out of touch they seem to be with workforce."
good,"Once you enter the company, increment is low almost negligible."
good,"Corporation is top heavy.   Execs making outrageous salaries as the employees who are actually doing the work get pennies on the dollar.   "
good,They pay very less as compared to industry standards. There is less work and you can enjoy your life working here.They do not fire people and this ensures that everyone has a job security.
good,"i enjoyed working with IBM, good facilities, but when comes to appraisal very typical of them. i had good set of members in my team. healthy environment to work in."
good,"I still love working for this company, but they will not stop laying off people, no matter how much it affect's their service.Our team is at a bare minimum but they are still laying off people and trying to outsource to other parts of the country."
good,"Less salary and hikes are the worst part of IBM India. Management is good, mostly depends on the project you are working on. Work life balance is good."
good,"It was great place to work at one point in time."
good,"Monitoring external companies mainframe computers is what i do all day. I have to run, edit, and fix batch jobs as well as callout technical groups to work on issues"
good,"It was a good experience working there,."
good,IBM has a collection of great resources to work with.  IBM treats their people like numbers..  Not a great environment if you're wanting job stability.
good,IBM has gone through many changes and transformations in the last two decades. Currently IBM is in flux from a hardware provider to a cloud centered business model. This changes as well as other have been necessary.
good,IBM changes very rapidly.  You must be able to adapt and make changes to keep up.  You must also play the political game well to fit in at IBM.  Management needs to listen to the people more.
good,"Pracovní doba začínající mezi 7- 9 hodinou (volně volitelné)"
good,"el area de trabajo bueno, los jefes son muy exigentes y tiene facilidad de horario para descansar"
good,"Top down culture, there is a lot of focus to get work done, too many initiatives all the time, work life balance is not that great, salary is not great especially if you have been working at IBM for long time"
good,Good. Job security is high. Salary benefits are very low. No hike. Very flexible company. Work from home facility is there for all employees. Overall good
good,"IBM has been a great place to work, but now after 20 consecutive quarters of missed revenue targets, the great blue giant is stumbling to the point of no return.  Layoffs are commonplace.  Morale is low.  People with institutional knowledge and lengthy service are regarded as too expensive.  Forced co-location is causing mass exodus of enormous skill.  Sad state of affairs."
good,"Nice Place to work  and very good work culture "
good,Job culture and learning is good. The working hours are long. The colleagues are good and knowledgeable. The pay and bonus is not that good anymore. Especially the bonus is very less.
good,IBM contaba con múltiples beneficios en salud y mediante el fondo de empleados
good,"IBM offers excellent work life balance. Most projects are combination of Implementation and Support projects , so the team is big and quality of work is excellent."
good,Responsavel alem de gerenciar o projeto de acompanhar os faturamentos e pagamentos dos fornecedores bem como das importações necessárias

good,"> Diversity is a key feature. Lots of different areas where you can head into working here."
good,"Good work life balance"
good,"They have the one of the best insurance policies."
good,It has been a wonderful long years with this company due to the employee satisfaction approach. It was a huge learning experience with the kind of the managers and colleagues I worked with.
good,"IBM tends to become very bureaucratic One needs to follow the process, which sometimes gets annoying. Lots of internal dynamics needs to be managed in IBM.."
good,Leniency to work from home or remote locations. 15 days paid vacation and sick leaves. Annual Performance Bonus. Annual Increase. Fun working environment with fun colleagues. But not ideal management organizational structure
good,"job security is there but no proper channel to switch ur field if you are not feeling comfortable working in the current profile."
good,". Work with Offering Manager (Product Manager) on an Offering launch (Product + Services), once the Customer needs and segmentation, and competitor landscape is understood in a given Market segment."
good,"Doing the same stuff everyday. No change in the work. RCAs, client meetings. Running after the support teams to get the RCA done as per the guidelines."
good,"Productive place with flexible work timings helps us to maintain good work life balance."
good,"IBM is a highly matrixed and bureaucratic organisation.  It is highly focused internally and there is too much overlap on roles and responsibilities."
good,Overall I really enjoyed working at IBM.  There is a lot of pressure to make revenue and profit targets while I was there. Often times this pressure led to a lot of cost saving measures.  You can only cut cost so much before you begin to hurt the business.  I think IBM is at that point in their outsourcing business while they desperately try to ramp up their new sources of big revenue.  In the end I was one of those affected by that pressure.
good,It does not make us to grow in Reserach field. We need to keep on working as application software developer in SAS or COBOL according  to company requirement
good,"Better within complany owned workplace, onsite options are less to move out of india, within india its bad to move on customer location or else remain in central location of project."
good,"Good work environment."

good,"A IBM, como toda empresa centenária preza pela inovação a todo custo, já tiveram problemas nos anos 90, então isso e ainda mais forte na cultura organizacional da IBM."
good,Good work culture. Great work life balance. Lots of opportunities to learn and build skills. Good for freshers. Progression is very slow. But not a good payer.
good,The company has great ideas for future projects and every team seems to have members that contribute. But job security is always on your mind. Workplace and culture are good and great work/ life balance
good,"IBM can be an enjoyable place to work and compensates employees whom put in the time, but sometimes gets caught corporate initiatives which may not be beneficial to all areas.  Therefore, IBM is losing out highly rated employees whom get RA'ed or do not conform to these strategies, such as co-location."
good,"Flexible work schedule, IBM had a relaxed work environment with minimal pressure and stable work schedule. With a diverse team and large organization  their was plenty of room to grow and expand your influence."
good,"Sales roles are varied and often duplicated. Training is readily available via many sources (web, classroom, etc.)  Management is stacked to the point that a clear vision is often lost in ""self-preservation"" leadership."
good,I had a great team and great co- workers. The company downsized over 70K employees after many received an excellent performance review. The hours were very long and travel could be global.
good,"My career has many various assignments and roles. I did work at a commercial site, a traditional office and telecommute from home. I have provided customer support with many tools such as remote takeover, the telephone, and technical on-site support. Different accounts have required pager duty, weekends and off-hour schedules. I have developed training material and assisted with transitioning new accounts into the call centers. I was rewarded IBM stock options as valued employee"
good,Amazing place to work if you get a good manager over you. basically manager has complete control over you. SO recommend this company to only who can manage their manager.
good,Project-afdeling waar time-management een must is om deadlines te voorkomen mbt het plannen van projecten.
good,"Work is really hard, but you wouldn't figure that out until you start because the pay will indicate your doing something very simple. However this company gives you a big badge to put on your resume."
good,"IBM has been going through major changes and is slow to move forward. Their key issue is competing from a pricing perspective with other firms. They have top notch resources. Value growth and career advancement. The challenge is moving a giant quickly to meet the changes in the market."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar e adquirir experiencia no mercado de trabalho, no que diz respeito a empresa multi nacional.  Contato direto com US, Canada e outros paises onde a empresa possui filial. Dessa forma a vivencia com a lingua estrangeira se torna imprescidivel para a rotina. A IBM tem muita flexibilidade no trabalho com a cultura de home office, que ajuda muito o equilibrio da vida pessoal com o profissional sendo uma grande vantagem para os funcionarios. Muitos beneifcios sao oferecidos pela empresa alem dos convencionais."
good,"Highly performance driven culture, but also a lot of nepotism in the culture. Its a top heavy organization with lil room for growth"
good,"Being as a fresher i had learned a lot in IBM"
good,"Best thing is work from home facility. I worked on contract to hire. So, I am not aware of salary hike rates. Rest was good."
good,"It was my first job, and I was with a relatively small team. It was good, everyone was nice, but unfortunately a small team doesn't last long in the big machine that is IBM. Always be ready to jump to a new team/position when your old one eventually gets removed."
good,"A typical day at work would be like checking you mails, have a standup call to discuss about your work as if there are any hurdles or any technical queries etc., and then carry on with your work for the rest of the day. "
good,"Culture at 'local' level is amazing: committed colleagues with high skill levels, excellent local management, rewarding work."
good,"team work, administrative skills and good employees. Rewards good work. Going on team building get away. Skills development is promoted. Management allows for independence and growth"
good,My co - workers are very supportive & helpful. They are very much innovative and always work extra mile to achieve and also to maintain matrices green.
good,good place to gain experience. But the culture and the working habits may varies from team to team. work/life balance is great tho. you can come in late as long as you finish your jobs
good,"Management by inspection, IBM is not a growing company and is managed in such a way.  The people are hard working and very loyal to IBM but concerned for their future"
good,"The good thing about IBM is their good work culture and policy like work from home. Their policies are also fixed and whatever written is applied. However, year to year salary hike is not good."
good,"Working from home option for work/life balance was good."
good,"IBM a company with history of one hundred years,While in terms if salary it is good place ,However the roles are more management oriented since IBM offers IT infrastructure  services to lot of clients,"
good,"Pros: cool work, nice building, smart people."
good,"good company to work for."
good,"Management is good"
good,The company provides the greatest work flexibility that you can work  from home and is very flexible to fit your work-life schedule. Co-workers are nice and helpful.
good,"Aprendi muito no período que trabalhei na IBM, pois a empresa trabalha com todos os tipos de tecnologias."
good,"En IBM, he aplicado todo mi conocimiento adquirido en trabajos anteriores en los cuales, solo se aporto una refrescada de memoria por analisis de costo y stock."
good,"work place very productive ,learned more about management skills ,work time and refreshment time manageble good .HR and manager are more supportive well security and safety place to work staff and co workers are supportive ,recreation facility lawns are also availble .good time to work"
good,"My time at IBM was both some of the best times I have had during my long career, but also some of the worst times. Impossible to feel like there was any chance of a long term career due to current business model."
good,This job taught me a lot about my technical skills and pushed me everyday to perfect multi tasking abilities. I feel that I will take away improved management skills and the ability to put those skills to the test in a fast paced work environment
good,"IBM is an organization which goes through changes all the time, and which is most probably not letting it to stabalize the work as well as in person environment"
good,Messy work. There is little organization in the company but they are trying to clean it up but they still have a LONG way to go. This is a contract position so there is no job security. Aerotek benefits are terrible too.
good,"Typical day group huddle and distribute work, send out daily reports, answer queries via email, telephone and Same Time. Access and authorise changes ensuring successful completion. Report any failures to management and customer. Prepare and host CAB meetings"
good,"IBM was a good place to work.  The issues I saw were that there was no raises the whole time I was there even though I got superior reviews.  I did receive bonuses for the work I did.  I also saw no way to better my position within the company.  "
good,"overall a good company to work, No challenging work ,Work From Home Benefit,work and life balance is good.good to join in mid career level as compared to freshers."
good,"Coworkers were always professional, I was able to juggle work and home life by being able to work from home, great team to work with.Strongly recommend all engineers to seek a job there."
good,"- Very friendly co-worker and have great working environment."
good,"IBM offers great flexibility. There are lot of people who are exceptionally talented and great co-workers"
good,"I was working as consultant in the IBM It was Fun and productive work place.Good work life balance."
good,"Environment was well disciplined, "
good,"People here are friendly and cooperative."
good,"IBM, was an Ok place to work once you got accustom to the unorganized, lake of direction, and focus.  They are much to lean on direction, and information for the employees. once you have established, your own networks, to get information and direction, things for the most part work much smoother  My Co-workers where great, and fairly easy to work with once we there was a direction."
good,Good company and flexible work hours. Lots of opportunities for growth in the new technologies of big data and analytics.
good,IBM is a great place to work and with huge size of the Company it allows us to explore great opportunities same time giving us the work life balance.
good,"I was a traveling consultant for 3 years, and I don't believe IBM has figured out how to run a consulting company yet. Short term quarterly profit incentives are pushed out to everyone in the company on a regular basis, which creates a culture of short term focused decisions. Everything in the company seems to be a patch work (technically as well as organizationally), and to get anything done within IBM is a struggle. "
good,"Unfortunately, yearly raises do not match or exceed inflation even for top performers.  Bonuses are depressing at approximately 2% of salary.  The culture is to have a job for life which results in a ton of poor performers that should be let go.  There is not enough compensation and reward for those that actually work hard and drive results."
good,"I do enjoy working at my current job. The culture and the peoplemake it a great work place. But im looking for more responsibility with new and fresh challenges. I have worked on and successfully completed several projecta,from start to finish."
good,IBM has a very good work culture where employees are very forthcoming and help each other irrespective of the organizational structure.  Its sad to see people being let go despite that fact.
good,"As a fresher its good place to start your career, with a good amount of exposure . Its  a process oreinted organization to make your career"
good,"Excellent company for development.  You will gain a lot of knowledge and experience in order to further your career, but that is all."
good,Lead a team in my department. A strong team player. Execute job tasks given by manager at shortest time with Zero Defect.
good,The typical work week is normally 44 hours per week minimum within my sector with the expectation to do more on a continual basis. There is little balance between family and work.
good,"Its really fun working in IBM, very good work culture but middle management attitude is not that great."
good,"IBM is a good place to work on. It have very good job culture.People will enjoy to work in IBM, Work ethics are very good and process of doing work is properly defined."
good,"IBM is a great company to work for.  It afforded me an opportunity to see so many different customers in an intimate way I might not have achieved in any other role."
good,"Such a pleasure working with supervisor as smart as what every company needs, happy and cool co-workers, a Splendid Manage Company."
good,"When I started at IBM 15 years ago, there was much more innovation and building great things for a better business for our customers.  Then the accountants and auditors came in and made a fun job, into a pile of compliance and process requirements, that made the job a bore.  Some ""Process Expert"" came through and said you can save $X of money by making this process your working operations.  From there the jobs was cut up and shipped over to India.  Then we hung on for ""Leadership"" purposes.  Which meant we did more and more of the work with fewer and fewer people in the USA."
good,"Some people are ecstatic about working for this IBM owned recruiting company, others, not so much.  It really all depends on the account that you work for.  Some accounts just work you to death and give you little to no recognition for your efforts."
good,"I was lucky to have worked in different profiles in IBM. The work pressure is not that huge. Joined as a fresher, I appreciate whatever i have learned but IBM lacks in Training logically with more emphasis on work done but not how. Management is mixed and is supportive for academics. Co-workers are good but politics is part of every organisation. The hardest part with the job was inability to cope up with the pace of training being a fresher. The most enjoyable part was appreciation for the good work I did and all the fun activities we did other than work."
good,Good company to work with.But variable pay is an useless concept.Work from home option is good for ladies.Management should be well execute.
good,"Non applicable "
good,"+ ständige Weiterbildung, grosses internes Angebot"
good,"Good place to work, friendly and dedicated staff. Lots of material for professional development. Throughout my career at IBM I have had to opportunity to work in on large scale challenging project that have given me the ability to learn and grow professionally."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job in IBM EE/A is flexibility and possibility to develop further technical career in different directions.
good,"Admirable part of IBM could be its work culture. It always helped me in balancing my personal and professional life. Connecting to work, from home, is indeed the best option, I had during adverse situations."
good,"working on IBM power series mid high and enterprise series servers installation trouble shoot and support ."
good,"I  have learnt how to use and mastered Micro soft Excell, SAP, Oracle, CSCC and CCW application"
good,"Overall a good place to grow. I enjoy working for IBM, but they regularly lay off groups of people. Layoffs are not performance based."
good,Good company to work for.  Learned operations management in a  cross functional organization. Great teammates to work with and a great client to work for.
good,"Uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar, com ambiente corporativo e clima organizacional alinhados em satisfação de equipe interna e entrega de valor ao consumidor final."

good,it was a good company but employees were not treated well I wasnt treated well and there is lot of work pressure but i learned many thing on that work place
good,beaucoup de harcèlements psychologiques.  Avenir incertain. Loi du silence
good,"Its a big ocean and easy to get lost, however with every challenge comes an opportunity - the opportunity to think creatively on your growth."
good,Good Work life balance and Flexible timings. Provides good oppotunity to learn and groom skills but is again dependent on the kind of Projects we get into.
good,Productive and fine place to work with co-workers and the most enjoyable part of the job is quality and the standards maintained
good,"It was a very good experience working with IBM Concentrix,Bangalore. Work culture was really amazing and flexible.Learned many things about how does the banks in the other countries work.Lot of improvement in the communication."
good,"Work culture and management is good."
good,"The organization is no doubt one of the best in terms of job security but if you are looking for things like job growth, competency improvement, better salary this is not the organization for you"
good,"I have enjoyed a twenty year career at IBM. The diverse and challenging careers have afforded me a great wealth of knowledge."
good,IBM India is a very nice organization to work. Here the work-life balance is well maintained and the working environment is very good. The managers are energetic and help us by providing all our needs.
good,"O Ambiente era estressante, sempre correndo contra o tempo, porém as pessoas eram agradáveis e brincalhonas, isso aliviava o stress formado e nos motivava sempre a sermos melhor e prestar o serviço com qualidade e eficiencia."
good,"IBM Daksh provided me the first back office job in Insurance sector. "
good,"Although there are routines, this work is focused on individual talent and responsibility of every employee. "
good,"IBM is very good Company."
good,"Good experience. Learnt management, working in large member teams, got more scope to work singe handedly in few projects. Overall its good."
good,I retired. Once was a great place to work; not so much in the end. Corporate culture did an about face from caring for the individual to caring exclusively for the bottom line!
good,"Overall Good and safe place for ladies employee. Hike is not that good in the concern."
good,"j'ai bien aimée travaillé chez ibm ,la formation est très bonne,par contre travail répétitif"
good,I left IBM because of their lack of commitment to winning in the PC business.  No executive was willing (or perhaps empowered) to make the drastic changes to make the PC business profitable.
good,"Pressure of continuous innovation. "
good,"Good. Less work pressure. "
good,Typical days were very long. My co-workers were often stressed.  It was a challenge to achieve work-life balance. The mose enjoyable part of the job was being rewarded for launching a product on time.
good,"Biased.No Equal opportunity provided for the employees.No fun at work.Very slow growth,no early hike,no bonus.No awards No recognition,no appreciation for good performers."
good,"Its a nice place to work technically and easy to approach anyone. The best team I had ever seen in my career."
good,"I have a good experience with AEGIS and as it was my first job so I had learnt so many things from my up levels."
good,"Everyday at work is a new learning, from the people you meet, people you get to work with, speak with, even just have a call with. I am always grateful that I, in my 5yrs, feel my worth with the people around me and my worth in the company. More because I am a people manager, you get to lead people towards the company's goal. Together everyday, you aim to be within the company's targets and goals. I am always thankful that respect in my work environment is always felt regardless of tenure to the company and age. It's just that the hardest part of the job is to keep them motivated all the time, and keeping them aware of their job's worth not just for the company but also for their personal growth because everyday should be a learning. Because when the challenge and the learning stops, it's when you get to ask yourself your worth that leads to losing one' motivation. But the most enjoyable part of my role is that, I have in my team older than me, more tenure than me in the domain but still respects me whether decisions are regarding work of outside of work."
good,"iletişim kabiliyetim gelişti"
good,"A lot of work flexibility, easygoing culture though salary increment and professional advancement record is not up to industry standard"
good,"This is also a typical service company.."
good,"Lots to learn and be involved in. Lots of room to grow and makes an excellent career path. Enjoyed every day at IBM, it is sad that they had all the layoffs."
good,"not a bad job, just long hours on the days that I do work. Would like to work somewhere closer to home, dayshift hours again."
good,"Good place to work."
good,It was my first company where i learned how to work under immense pressure. It was a good experience working in a BPO. Again not a good pay master however it was a good solid foundation for me.
good,"usually a hectic day, evenly distributed work load, facility to work from home is a great advantage. Sick leaves are umlimited. 6 months of maternity leave for women with pay, 6 months additional without pay is a great help for new mothers"
good,"IBM is a big place - the whole work experience is dependant on particular department and your manager which can be good or bad. The work is what you can make out of it, could be challenging or simple, trainings are available although the funding is always tight. I would also recommend to negotiate your salary upfront as it is unlikely to significantly change once you sign the papers."
good,This job has been great stepping stone into my IT career.  In less then a year I have accomplished and achieved many goals.
good,"Working with IBM - Systems Hardware, we have the not-so typical work environment."
good,"I truly enjoyed working with IBM. The flaws are in the 4 years I was there, there were no pay increases, promotions and guarantee of extended employment due to constant layoffs world wide. I would like to find a company I can grow and mature with long term."
good,"Although the environment challenges a humans capacity to balance work and family life, constant sacrifices of mandatory weekend innovation work, and ever increasing utilization objectives, it also provided cutting edge technologies and advances that betters todays environment, and economies."
good,"Empresa com grande volume de trabalho e com muitos processos a seguir e dar andamento, sendo que 8h de trabalho se tornava pouco para atender as intermináveis tarefas. "
good,"Challenging workplace, expert co-workers, global resources, busy work pace, constantly evolving technology, opportunities to learn"
good,"I am a contractor here. I have been asking multiple times if I can move up or at least become permanent but it goes to a deaf ear. They had a layoff in May and let go of regular workers. I don't feel they will keep the contractors as work is super busy at times and completely extinct at times. 3 bosses all quit at the same time and went to a different company. It makes you wonder about the stability of this company. I am salaried and sometimes I am working 50 hours a week but only being paid for 40 hours. There is no way, you can effectively do your job in 8 hours.Many SC's are working on Saturday's to stay afloat on their workload but are not getting paid for it."
good,learnt here the basic level of troubleshooting. During holiday also we have to work hard to complete the given task. co-workers are friendly. Working in holiday is the hardest part
good,"IBM's greatest asset is that there is no such thing as an average or typical  situation. The rapid intense projects are lead by management which, trust and support on an equal level.  IBM's diversity of large scale clients present a  wealth of unique and challenging puzzles to solve.   The variety is the challenge and most enjoyable part of the position. From the varied environment to the varied issues I felt like a thoroughbred horse that had been forced to trot that had finally been allowed to run at full strength."
good,"Even though IBM is great company, but very less paying company."
good,"Slow growth and no possibility of career"
good,"A typical day at work was calm and relaxed."
good,"Best place to work , Learned lot of things , got plenty of management trainings and upgraded my skills .. It was one amoung the best company which i worked."
good,"Fair environment with diversity at workplace. Management is not conducive to the needs of the employees and hygiene is always a challenging issue here."
good,"IBM has flexible work timings giving it edge over others.It is nice to be part of it. But the over procedure oriented approach has stunted its growth,"
good,"The management was great. The atmosphere was nice.   I enjoyed the job and the people.  The job was sometimes stressful due the amount of work required, but we maintained good morale."
good,"Best part of the job is knowing what we do makes a difference and impacts people's lives. Having co workers who care just as much as I do, wanting to do what is best for customers. Knowing everyday that when I go to work I am making a difference."
good,This company offers a lot of training and seminars that will help you boost your career. Good culture and working environment.
good,"Challenging and fast pace workplace environment.  A typical day at work is 12-14hrs.  Very demanding workplace environment, with difficult clients."
good,"IBM has a strong base of employee talent with a wide range of products, but the corporate direction is changing quickly."

good,"IBM is a great place to learn technology, but management is not fair with employs. Trainings are added advantage. Co-Workers carry a team players attitude."
good,"IBM is a place where we support multiple client and use Multiple tools , One of the best place to work and gain knowledge ."
good,"Need to extend the hours daily, apart from this very good working culture here and currently associated with as a Tech Lead in IBM."

Recomendo para quaisquer profissional como uma ótima empresa."
good,"Great company, great team, and overall great place to work!"
good,Working as Project Manager & have a total 12+ years of work experience
good,"*great training"
good,"I've been with IBM for many years and have seen a lot of ups and downs; the challenges IBM is facing now are the most substantial I have seen since the 1990's when Lou Gerstner was the CEO and kept the company from being split up, but also got IBM on the path to both services and software focus.  IBM has been late getting on the shift to Cloud but is making good progress now.  As IBM adopts its new divisional makeup we'll see how good a job it does maintaining employee morale.  Over the years I've seen IBM go from being a very special, more ""paternalistic"" employer that clearly cared much for its employees to just an ""average"" company in this regard.  This was accompanied by reduction in various benefits and amenities.  It has been a sad and unfortunate path, but it was probably necessary in order to stay competitive."
good,"IBM is a great company with an incredible history struggling to maintain it's legacy in a business environment that is extremely challenging.  Apparently, it can no longer afford to be the company it used to be that valued it's employees and their families as a unique way to deliver excellence to it's customers."
good,"attending meeting over the phone, making sure that the proposal looks good and no unanswered questions."
good,a typical day at work assisting customers troubleshooting problems ranging from simple to complex. I learned different ways to assist and fix problem via phone or internet
good,"Its a good place to work"
good,"The company was always shipping jobs oversees to cut costs, coausing impact to our customers"
good,Learned a lot in IBM. Got exposure to SAP and now an expert in handling the  activities assigned to me in my current role. The hardest part of the job is the month-end close every month. Rest all the month is enjoyable. Colleagues are good and we all work in harmony. The only thing that is demotivating and discouraging is that  there is no increment and salary step-ups and this is ongoing from last few years.
good,"Good work-life balance, mainly work from home :-) . If i get opportunity i would like to work again."
good,Good learning experience with banking employees calling with challenging technical issues
good,IBM is a very productive work place with great people.  The department I was in had no room for growth.  Great management and great co-workers.  Just no growth in my department
good,"Overall : Good company to work for"
good,"Flexible Timings"

I was involved with the management of a couple of application integration projects, which were both learning experiences and made good use of my communications skills as well as the development of the SLA between IBM and AT&T.  This latter function was both informative (I learned a considerable amount about what was critical to the various AT&T IT Departments) and afforded me an excellent opportunity to delve much deeper into data collection, analysis and the user of both Excel and VBS scripting, skills I've enjoyed using ever since."

good,1. Helps new learnings
good,"Flexible at work, can manage your personal life, join for long run with a good package and band"
good,A typical day at work for me is data entry. I enter claims into the system that are assigned to me in my work queue. During my employment here I have learned a lot about the mortgage industry. We are required to have 40 hours of continued education each year so my knowlege continues to grow. I found that middle managment could have been a little more insiteful about keeping the employees informed of changes and what was going on in the company. My co-workers were great. The hardest part about my job was the mundaneness of doing data entry. I have a lot more to offer and have a lot more skills that could be utilized. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I was doing reconciliations. I am a numbers person by nature and I really enjoyed diving in and researching why something did not get paid.
good,"I have learned a lot of Skills like Networking,Menagement."
good,"Working at IBM-ISL is nice. I have learned how to manage a big product, how to resolve a problem with your teammates and also learned about some technologies.

good,- a typical day at work
good,"Everything depends on the project. Typical hours from 8.30-5.15, but you can talk to a project manager if you would like to work different hours.

good,"I usually start my day answering emails and having a quick chat with my supervisor about work that needs to be done that day. We go over the schedule, tasks and other related things. Then I usually get on the phones and answer incoming calls and aid IBM employees and customers of IBM with whatever they need help with, whether it is reporting a faulty server to a technician or if they need updates and contact information of various departments within the company. This job could easily get a bit tedious but what has made it rather enjoyable are my co-workers and the people I work with. It's a big company, a company that values professionalism, but it's nice to know that you can sometimes just relax with a bit of banter with your coworkers when the situation calls for it."
good,I have learned so much while working with IBM however the work culture more hectic there. But it is a nice company to work with.
good,Typical Work:
good,The company taught me a lot in a professional way i have leaned lot in IT and put in my knowledge which i have learned and acquired in the years. the Company has given me the atmosphere and the tools. environment which i need to broaden my scope in IT Management Services.
good,There is a lot of turn over and outsourcing that is always going on.
good,I was a helpdesk representative for the post office. I received calls and walked postal employees through repairing their machines and if they were un-repairable I sent out replacement parts or either a technician. I learned how to teach and be patient with people at IBM. I knew my job and I was employee of the month while they acknowledged employees. IBM was hands on and mental and I loved it because I am a quick learner and I 'm good wth my hands as well as my mind.
good,New to IBM
good,Exposure to Technology is good.
good,Good place to work with. Provides opportunity to directly interact with clients.

good,"Responded to email, communicated with WEBAHEAD Team on new inventions for purchase for project launching to customers; learned new techniques from the team, co-workers creative and educated, travelled additional 40 miles to other site for administrative coverage. Enjoyed working with other co-workers"
good,IBM is a good company they provide job satisfaction to the employee. They have own values and culture and they follow the value. On the part of salary they are not a good paymaster.

good,"With all the outsourcing and reductions, it is very difficult to count on job security or advancement unless you are one of the chosen and have an ""in"" with management."
good,"Pay is really low. However, this will help you build your resume."
good,IBM is a large company and operates as such. If you are lucky to be in a position that has growth potential and is in a value position to the company you can have a long career. I have learned allot working for them. Education is a hot button within the sales organization.
good,"IBM had three guidelines, respect for the individual, best customer service, and excellence, When these were in effect, it was the best company to work for. As the CEO's started forgetting these basic beliefs, it became a company who blamed the employees for the mistakes of the upper management. Then they ""downsized"" almost every year."
good,"not a good payer, but u will get the work-life balance is there."
good,"IBM is a very good working place , with lot of opportunities for freshers who would like to step into the IT world, as a stepping stone."
good,"Most highlighting thing is to be able to maintain work life balance."
good,"IBM as a company is great to work with given you have got to work with good technologies. "
good,Lugar de trabajo estable pero muy poca pagá para los diferentes niveles de estudios
good,"IBM is a good place to have balance in both work & personal life. Multiple opportunities to grow yourself in various technologies, Employees are treated with fair respect and they are trusted."
good,The environment was work hard and play hard. The emphasis was always on getting the job done well and most efficiently. Could mean it's a fast pace for people who require a longer learning curve.
good,Your work will be based on the project which you get. Job security is not so good. There is no hike after your initial offer.  You can learn technology with industrial experts. But that company has gone long back.
good,El trabajo en esta empresa esta muy bien para personas sin experiencia ya que tienen muy buena capacitacion. Solo que deberian de mejorar el salario y las prestaciones.
good,"No pressure or stress while working, People are very Helpful, They will encourage you to work hard and smart.The most enjoyable part is that I get to work from Home and realized that I was great at delivering and effective.There are some people eager to work with you and some that can be difficult. You just need to recognize who you're dealing with and adjust the conversations accordingly. Overall it's a good place to work."
good,"There was high turnover in management. Nobody seemed to want to relocate to Baton Rouge  As a Delivery Manager, it was hard to source local talent to fill demand. Great co-workers!"
good,"Within IBM people work closely together across service and geographic lines to meet deadlines and commitments to our client's, drive continuous improvements and best practices."
good,company do provide rich culture and exposure to the work & learning environment. company is more like manger centric then in HR control but hope thats not the case every where but this is what I felt during my job period.
good,your team is spread out Globally therefore; you may have meetings off hours.. IBM is really good at letting you letting you establish relationships with the customers.
good,"I joined as a fresher at IBM .The kind of work environment, work culture and management i receive gives me time to understand the IT industry and work better."
good,"IBM needs a strong HR leader to drive the show, first thing to remove the old timers from the pack and get some young talents in to the system, the old ones are the bottleneck and dont let new trends and technique to flourish in to the system"
good,"I don't have anything against the company management overall, only about the process of assigning us to projects, it would be better if the resource manager understands our skillset than focusing on closing the open positions in projects.I'm going through a bad experience now of being placed in the wrong project and wrong role."
good,"Bueno es una empresa que me enseño mucho en el desarrollo de aplicaciones. Una buena escuela de aprendizaje, pero con muchas cosas por mejorar como lo sería las diferencias entre consultoras y los empreados de planta."
good,"... the quality of the work experience is dependent upon the group you work in.  Your manager, and the culture he/she conveys, dictates the quality of your work experience & environment."
good,"Good company, friendly, work from home there, no swipe in out, no tension,  promotion and hike don't expect, environment is good, many branches in Bangalore on"
good,"The pay is excellent, but they don't hire contractors, no matter how talented/skilled.  I don't feel like part of the rest of the company, because I'm not an employee.  Moving up is completely ambiguous.  There's no clear path for advancement.  It seems like someone only gets promoted if they can ""play the game."""
good,A good place to work. You have job security at IBM and also stress free work environment. Work/life balance can be maintained is extremely good.Multiple growth options are available within IBM.
good,IBM is socially progressive and promotes diversity in all forms.  The atmosphere is one of collaboration and working across segments.  Some of the collaboration between groups is better than others.
good,"Big Blue trying to become Agile, with limited success, as it is hard to coordinate resources across 12 time zones.  Scrum teams are too large to be flexible, though the work products are ""Agile-like"".  Many tradition large teams trying to squeeze waterfall-like activities into an Agile environment."
good,"It is good to work for such company where you have work and personal life balance but, at the same time, we want our job security which was missing in our team."
good,"Great benefits and pay.  The managers are usually very good to work with but the higher up you go in the management chain the difficulties begin.  Unfortunately the red tape to get anything done, slows the progress.  Also, lots of changing of minds you must be flexible at all times.  Tenure and dedication is not highly valued.  Very inclusive culture when looking at diversity."
good,Really happy worked in IBM. I learned a lot from my team members and managers.IBM always allows to learn new skills. It would help these skills to my next carrier growth.
good,Good work life balance in IBM. However not a very good compensation and benefits.Good place to learn if you are at client place.You will have good exposure to technologies but limited opportunity to grow in your career path unless you managed to make very good network within the organization.
good,"The review system is based on a manager's review. Unfortunately, sometimes ur reviewer isn't from the same team. This aspect can be annoying cause your review is dependant on two people, one you actually work with and one who doesn't know much about your working style and marks you purely based on whether he or she likes you or not."
good,I got a nice experience there with a lot of responsabilities the work life balance can be a problem when you are sent abroad for long period of time. Good colleagues
good,I don't feel comfortable putting information like this on a public domain such as indded.  I would be happy to speak with someone about what my specific experiences were and why I left.
good,Its a good place to work. The organization is big and hence things move slowly sometimes but the company ensures that the right talent is hired and gives market value to the candidate as well.
good,I had to bring my expertise to the table but they gave me the liberty and did not put nose into everything I do - They also were supportive. But they did expect that  I talk to them once before I took any action which is fair.
good,"Working at IBM requires good skills at navigating company politics, patience in dealing with lots of administrative tasks, and significant role ambiguity."
good,"work life balance"
good,"It is important to have defined processes, especially in a large IT environment.  But all processes need to also work with the Businesses goals.  All guidelines have exceptions, and the business can determine where processes can be streamlined."
good,"Si bien la empresa posee una fuerte cultura organizacional, varios aspectos del bienestar subjetivo enfocado a los trabajadores se podrían mejorar."
good,"Work culture is good but yearly compensation is very bad hence looking for some better opportunity, Looking for some better opportunity now hence floated the CV"
good,My entire time at IBM has been as a remote worker. I handled database consulting on multiple engagements. I was able to have a different gig ever other year.
good,I completed 2 weeks of work experience in an IBM office. I predominantly worked in IT where I observed the team tackle technical issues efficiently. Overall a positive experience.
good,"Salary was good, but the work environment really dragged the whole experience down. I think the problem was really with the change in people manager. Plus I don't think this company values mental health."
good,"Job was very fulfilling.  Worked at home which allowed independence and relaxed environment.  Worked scheduling calendars, travel, processed lots of expense reports and kept up with meetings -constantly busy, following up on numerous projects.  Worked with managers' staff and clients."
good,"I like that I constantly stay busy, but with all the work it seems like they should have a higher starting pay. management is really cool and understands that we do are best to get as much done as possible. Sometimes it seems I'm barley above the water, but I do the best that I can."
good,"Good overall but increment is almost zero."
good,"Lots of opportunities in pretty much any area of technology, competitive benefits, nice work environment. Great organization to learn and move to different roles."
good,"IBM is a settling company. Joining this company early in your career might not be tge right decision. "
good,Good company. stopped working and lost contracts. Overall it was not a bad company to work for specially gaining some valuable experieince. its a big company.
good,"My day consists of intangible tasks, such as answering questions an concerns for Client Support Specialist, managing escalations, providing feedback to management on current projects. It's a fast paced and dynamic work environment and no two days are the same."
good,IBM is good place to new technologies.I really loved working at IBM halifax CIC center. Co -worker at IBM are very helpful and management is doing great job for the employees.
good,Did not like the work culture or management. Managers wanted to know why you are taking restroom breaks and wanted to be know the reason whenever we are away from desk.
good,"IBM is a great place to learn and upgrade your skills. You need to make sure you are along with ask from management and you can prosper in IBM, Innovation is one of the mantras in IBM."
good,"IBM is a very curious mix of employee empowerment, loose managerial control and self compliance. It can give you a very good environment to work but one has to be a very good salesman  externally as well as internally. The company puts it’s clients at the center but can equally frustrate you through its buruecratic ways of doing things. This company is like a thousand different companies working under a single brand name. Depending on your nature, IBM can be the best or the worst company for you. You will also come across dozens of employees who talk to their supervisors only once in a year & go around undisturbed and unnoticed for years together."
good,Benefits were great.  When I first started with the company the culture was fun and organized. After a year the morale was gone and it became difficult to find it again.
good,"Was a good place to work, not very challenging. Became boring and stagnant. Therefore, did not apply to work there as part of a graduate scheme for 2017."
good,IBM is an MNC and you can find lot of project with different kind of technologies. it's an ocean to explore the things. you will learn the process to be followed in project.
good,"Have learnt a lot about IT infrastructure"
good,"Two things I enjoyed most about my time with IBM: working from home and the benefits. The latter is still true, but recently they discourage the former. Most of their jobs involve either moving or a lot of travel. They now spend a lot for subcontractors instead of accommodating their remote employees. It's also hard to move to a new position to get new skills as most of the jobs require 3+ years experience with those skills. I wouldn't dissuade anyone from trying IBM, but they should know what they're getting into."
good,"If you just graduated from school and looking for working experience, IBM is the ideal place. It is a little bit over managed from my oppinion but would be good for young guy who need more guidance."
good,A productive fast pace workplace everything is based on numbers fun work place overall. They do have events for employees and its a fun environment. Working here I did learn a lot of information about mortgage
good,"Pros - Flexibility in work timings and good resources to learn anything"
good,"I was very glad to have had the experience of working at IBM. Having never been in the corporate world before, I was exposed to many new angles of industry."
good,si es un excelente trabajo y muy buen ambiente!!!!
good,Dynamic at times but mostly quite and mild.  Struggles to retain young talent. opportunity to grow varies on management as well as available opportunities.
good,"Good experience at work as well as learning opportunities."
good,"not a good company to work for."
good,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment."
good,"Not for everyone. Decent enough work/life with some benefits. Mental health benefits somewhat lacking. Some discrimination regarding disability with mental health. Otherwise, decent company to work for with movement and pay raises. Too many pointless meetings in the day."
good,"kept busy, typical days, management did there job, hardest part of the job, staying with in the guildelines when speaking with the customers with the loans they needed to be more educated on the loans, communicating with people"
good,Its a good company to have a work-life balance. Moderate work pressure and easy timings. Its not a good paymaster but if you want to settle and want no growth in life then there is no company better then it.
good,"The experience was really great. I learned a lot of things and grew as a person and as a professional in my time of stay in IBM Philippines. The Management as well is great and they never left our side when it comes to decisions. The hardest part of the job is when there are customers that doesn't even listen to what we are trying to say to help them, sometimes they even tell us to resign because the issue that they are calling for support is already out of our departments scope. The most enjoyable part of the job is the workplace because everyone is great and helps one another in times of need."
good,"Good place to work at. In the bay area sites, lot of young folks."
good,"Es una empresa en la cual te puedes formar como profesional, es una excelente universidad laboral, ya que te dan la oportunidad de hacer carrera y crecer dentro de ella. Sin embargo los salarios no son competitivos,"
good,Je travaille avec une belle équipe dans mon lieu de travaille.
good,I joined ibm as a fresher. I was trained in Bangalore and got project location in Chennai. In IBM the work environment is good and friendly in nature.
good,"Trabalhei como terceirizada dentro da IBM, os clientes são bem exigentes, e infelizmente não há um olhar ideal para o serviço prestado."
good,IBM is nice but challenging environment to work for. Its nice place for learning. There is no micromanaging at IBM & thats the best thing about IBM. Everyone who works for IBM belongs to different background & diversity is the key for IBM's success.
good,"I was hoping to learn more, but I ended up on a team that barely had things for me to do so. I was working with a team from Austin and in Germany so I had no internal help in the Markham location. Some of my friends had a great internship though"
good,"Old fashion school, not for young peoples."
good,"Was a good contract. Salary was great. Lots of travel but ability to work remote occasionally. Projects were quite varied, but very interesting and cutting edge, as you'd expect."
good,I appreciate IBM for offering employee training and certification to become more knowledgeable of their products and services.  It is a fast pace culture.
good,"Lots of great people, but has become very cut through with siloed group agendas vs. focus on what's best for the company.  More to do to return to that mentality."
good,Great company to work but slow in decision making. Good work life balance and culture but one need to compromise on Salary and other benefits. It pays good over long term but really takes your patience on test
good,"IBM as a whole provides it's employees with the resources they need to succeed moreso than any other company that I have worked for. With that said, in the case of acquiring other companies they do need to improve their logistical operations in regards to integrating the core values of IBM."
good,"Great work culture, flexible work timing, Big company with wide range of opportunities, No great hikes and other bonus.job security and enormous opportunities, However First Line Manager decided  Employees career, which is dangerous sometime."
good,IBM was a company that did provide competitive compensation and advanced training in newer technologies depending on what business unit you worked in.
good,"IBM Brazil provided to me very good opportunities to work in global projects and join of a very etic culture."
good,"Quality leadership is few and far between. If you want your skills sharpened there are few leaders who can make that happen so be prepared to figure that out on your own. Also, you're asked to wear multiple hats almost all the time."
good,Wonderful to travel globally for IBM and work with some of the largest companies in the world as they determine digital strategy and change management goals.
good,IBM is a great platform to build your career. You will get many opportunities to learn about new/trending technologies and products. The management is employee friendly and takes employee's career into consideration.
good,"Managing contracts for IBM has been very challenging and rewarding.  "
good,Local Canada mangement team is great but Head office direction and control is a mess. IBM is taking new direction and removing all local control and head office is taking over control and not listening or understanding local requirements. Once they used to care about employees and work at building a strong talented and dedicated work force. Now it is only about cost savings and not quality. I understand need to centralize applications and process but not the method being used is not best for a long term requirements.
good,A fun working place with good leaders & a good change for carrier advancement. A good understanding of the products is needed in order to perform daily tasks.
good,IBM is a great company but the growth is very slow. Long work hours and no competitive salary makes the place not so exciting. No good options to switch role and work
good,"IBM is good ,i am working with a  third party contractor,which i am not satisfied to work with.Proper hikes are not provided.So i am willing to change to permanent company."
good,"Het is goed om voor IBM te werken, nadeel is dat er meer managers zijn dan medewerkers"
good,It's a great place to work. There are often times when we need to stretch working hours but it's not too hectic. The only issue is with advancing to the next level.
good,Clima laboral de alta competencia. Falta de trabajo colaborativo.
good,"very large Byzantine operational and management structure makes it difficult to get things done.  There are a lot of competing interests and not everyone is pulling in the same direction all the time. "
good,"Working as  a Tester in Health Care Domain, Learning so many interesting & new things in this Domain."
good,"Although some management seems to prefer a specific personality, the company strives for diversity and very much cares about their people. I worked at the Austin office where there was free food and drinks. The salary is lower than other top companies, but the benefits and culture are amazing."
good,C'est une société qui n'est plsu vraiment à taille humaine mais qui possède beaucoup de technologies intéressantes.
good,"The best part of the company is the trust given to its employees to manage their work schedule as long as deliverables are met without compromising on the quality and timeline."
good,The management keeps changing. Most of them are not updated with new or current technology support. Appraisal system is utmost unfair if there is any appraisal happening.
good,"This is a good company for learning and tackle new challenges."
good,Management has no clue what the are doing. Half of the managers are extremely unfamiliar with the products they are responsible for. Many inefficiencies throughout the company including constantly redoing unnecessary work.
good,"it is no doubt there is a good job security in Concentrix Daksh , but the salary given to employees doesn't justify the amount of work they do. Concentrix india Pay really less to it's employees and it's a well known fact. that's the main reason the company has failed to retain it's employees on a large scale."
good,IBM has always been a great place to work and to be with. I enjoyed working as a Team and learnt many advanced Technical things. Self learning is the key part of IBM.
good,"I have been with IBM for 7 years and was hired with the understanding that I would be able to work from home, which I have done for the last 4 years and I absolutely love it. My work day allows me to get all tasks complete along with handling business that normally would have to wait until the weekend or things I would normally have to take off work for. It also allows me to get ahead of tasks and to be proactive as our business peaks."
good,The consulting practice provides many opportunities for growth as well as supporting the creation of new client solutions. Often work at client sites globally. Great opportunities for collaboration with global colleagues.
good,"IBM has always been a leading company when it comes to creating technology. When it comes to being consultants, we are okay. Really great people (that is the best thing about this company). The management could definitely be better though and the work-life balance pretty much sucks. Good experience though."
good,"Management was alright. Spotty in quality. Lots of people stay to raise families, it's a stable place to coast. The in-flux of designers were fun to meet and get to know. But don't know how satisfied any of them were. I wasn't particularly myself."
good,"I like working for IBM.  I work from home which I loving, and my managers have always given me independence to get my work done without micro managing.  But they do not pay enough, received 1 raise in 5 years.  And no cost of living increases, which is tough living in Chicago."
good,A career at IBM is not for everyone.  Generally people move around a lot.  If you like variety and adventure and uncertainty you will enjoy working here.  If you like stability and have a comfort zone in which you like to operate then you may not like it here.
good,"Good work life balance, enough work from home. Less salary hike. Exposure to best projects and to learn out from them."
good,I was hired on at IBM through a placement agency.  I was told that was the only way that they hired and so when I got there I was making significantly less than my coworkers.  Good job experience but I would not recommend that to anyone.
good,Work is challenging and interesting provided you have a good manager. IBM is involved in cutting edge technology hence being part of the right team is very important.
good,"One of a number of architects in a virtual team spread across the UK reporting to a manager who you only met face to face for appraisals. Had 3 different managers in the 4 years I worked there. Terrible work life balance as you were expected to deliver to ridiculous timescales. It was common to start the day with emails sent in the early hours of the morning from colleagues and working through your lunch was the norm.  "
good,Working at IBM has taught be a number of invaluable lessons. Whether they be work ethic related or office space related these are lessons that will always remain dear to me.
good,"Significant resources and advisement are available when needed as there are many highly skilled resources and this helps in moving projects and solutions forward, as well as, improving career skills ."
good,"Hard projects with tough and unrealistic deadlines, worst pay , but very flexible work from home options."
good,Was probably not exposed to the whole culture as was working in the Laboratory. Allows excellent work life balance which is the most enjoyable part of the job. Upper management (Directors and VPs) are really tough and it is quite difficult to gain exposure. The hardest part of the job is not having very much job security. I have however learned a lot while working for this company
good,"Perhaps it was my questionable boss, but the while the work was decent the pace of work was frantic in many cases due to a lack of organization and a lack of testing plans.  However, they are highly dependent on contractors."
good,"You can't expect a good hike, work life balance depends on the project u tagged in. multiple projects allocation and good place to learn and explore urself."
good,"IBM offers great opportunity for work/life balance. Their mobile employment options enable IBMers to work remotely - which is great, but it comes with an unspoken expectation that mobile employees be available for work 24/7. If individuals are willing to give their personal time to the company, the company will take it. The amount of travel required varies greatly by role, but generally expect to travel 25% to 50% of the time. "
good,High volume workload.  Time-management and ability to prioritize are essential.  Smart people.  Coordinate activities with many divisions/groups within IBM.  Work-at-home a definite plus.
good,"Grande Empresa multinacional, que esta mais preocupada com os lucros"
good,"I was a coop. But I felt like a total full-timer. The workload was above and beyond. The manager was very focused on his promotion. But I learned a lot, although was not so keen to do all that so fast"
good,"- Flexible schedule and work location"
good,"The Job Roles were challenging and I always enjoy a challenge and jump at the opportunity at gaining more knowledge, learning new things, advancing my skills.  IBM is a workplace that allowed me to do all of the above."
good,"Regrettably IBM now employees over 50% of their work force off shore and will not look for US based candidates in favor of cheaper off-shore support. It is a shame to see such a great US based company abandon it's own country and the communities it could support by hiring locally. Same issue with off-shore support attrition rates and the constant retraining by on-shore SME's, which will is drying up as they displace more on-shore/legacy support."
good,"Self motivation is key to success in IBM, but that was difficult with minimial support and no local network or knowledge having moved to Perth from overseas."
good,The pay is low but benefits are good. There are a lot of meetings with offshore personnel. Management can be really bad or wonderful- it is hit and miss. It is hard to get information/help on HR related issues. Moving up is a long and not straight-forward process.
good,I worked long hours and traveled alot.   It was hard to manage the demands of both home and work. When I first started at IBM it was a very different company to the one I left.
good,"Gives several opportunities if you know the right people. My manager was very accommodating and helped in every way possible."
good,"IBM is a good place to start your career as a Software Engineer. Bureaucracy is prevalent anywhere in IBM. The Engineering culture is overlooked because all the managers care about is getting it done, they don't care how."
good,"Less technical growth found, "
good,"I initially enjoyed working for IBM, but the company culture changed in a negative way for domestic workers.  There was an increased emphasis on off shoring technical and project management jobs."
good,"IBM has become more interesting and more progressive over the years, especially in the area of Cognitive and Cloud Computing.  It is a steady place to work, with good benefits, nice people, and good work life balance."
good,Competitive work place with lots to learn. Offers opportunities to work across geographies and wide array of clients. Good avenues to learn with lots of challenging projects
good,"IBM is recommended for flexible work life as it encourage the work from home."
good,Many opportunities to grow internally and perform at multiple geographies levels. Management is quite supportive and Geographical leadership team is quite engaged and supportive overall.
good,"As usual with big companies, the focus is on profits and shareholder returns.  "
good,Empresa líder no segmento que possibilita o aprendizado constante de novas tecnologias. Possui um quadro excepcional de colaboradores mas necessita aprimorar suas políticas de avaliação e retenção de talentos.
good,"Job security with IBM  but no financial growth ."
good,Is a great start in your career needs more organization. I started with three horrible managers last manager was ok but didn't seem to be helpful. Your career is in your hands have all the training necessary to be successful.
good,"Unfortunately, there are too many circumstances in which I am required to work late evenings and weekends to provide research, input, or support for initiative beyond the full time project I am working with little to no reward for the effort."
good,"See review summary, it is a pretty nice place to work, however everything works very slowly and they have a difficult time promoting and keeping talented people in the company"
good,"It's a huge organization...hard to navigate, chock-full of abbreviations and you have to yell to get your voice heard. On the plus side, they do have great benefits, and, if you get the right manager, flexibility. However managers can vary from great to mediocre to dreadful."
good,"The job itself was quite hard for me at least at start, since I was hired as a Junior,but then thanks to help from great colleagues it got better. In the end (just after few months since I was comfortable) the job got kind of boring and monotonous."
good,"Good exposure in telecom domain"
good,"IBM has a great work/life balance.   However, the company is burdened by bureaucracy and legacy management styles.  This can slow innovation and new ways of doing things."
good,"IBM (International Business Machines) ranks among the world's largest information technology companies, providing a wide spectrum of hardware, software and services offerings. "
good,"lots of opportunities to learn. good work life balance. process oriented work environment. "
good,"productive and fun work place.IBM's policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations (sick days, doctor visits, etc.). Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and"
good,"I am very appreciative of having had the opportunity to work remotely.  It's an opportunity that benefited my entire family. "
good,"Good pay, many projects available with flexibility. The benefits are good. The management is capable of being very frustrating. Overall a good experience."
good,"IBM is a company having vast scope of learning new technology and process. Implementation of process is too cumbersome which makes it slow to move forward with speed. Management is defensive and not pro-active in real, they just do for the sake of saving their job."
good,".Great management and work environment. Flexible work hours and good balance with work and personal time. . Poor compensation and  job stability. Lack of salary raises, bonus and career growth."
good,"Lacks management and Compensation Areas"
good,"Alot to learn. Employee can work from home when it is necessary"""
good,"Re-organized several, no many times.  Survived several lay-offs until this last one.  Always wondering when I am going to be cut.  Not a pleasant environment.  My manager fought for me a couple of times, but this last time he and his manager were also cut."
good,"Work and life balance is very good, management is good but the salary benefits are pathetic, very little growth. Management should focus on employee benefits."
good,"Started working at 7:00"
good,"The best place to work and prosper in both career and knowledge wise."
good,"- A good place to learn something new everyday"
good,"I worked as a contractor with IBM for one year. My manager has been one of the best I have ever worked with. Great work life balance and flexibility. I recommend anyone to work at IBM."
good,"There is a good number of peers who are smart and capable. I feel well-respected in this culture and am generally pleased with the challenges presented in the break-down assignments. "
good,It one of the largest organization in the in the country working in this type of organization is very good and we will be able to learn important things in our life
good,"I was software development management in a research and development department.  It was during the recession years so the company was going through constant change.  One big issue with IBM is that it could not innovate and the innovation occur by acquiring  smaller and leaner companies.  "
good,"the company was great. had a chance to work with some great techs, learned a lot and good paid well for it"
good,"Application and Management B2B – E2E"
good,I really enjoyed working at IBM.  The past 11 years I worked remotely so there is really nothing to say there.  When I began in 1995 I have a great sense of community there and really liked going to work!
good,My previous company was bought out by this company. While the management and culture is amazing the salary is low for this position and the benefits are very high.
good,"IBM changes so fast that it's the ideal environment for fast-paced individuals that like to get on the ground floor of transformations. IBM is a great company for entry level employees looking to get their feet wet in the corporate world. Once you gather approximately 3-5 years of experience, however, things change. Past this point, other companies outside of IBM will pay top dollar for your talent."
good,"worked on bharti project with data center rating to tier4. Responsible for assuring that all critical services are met the SLA targets."
good,There was not much event planning in this position and the job duties that I was responsible for did not give me the satisfaction that I required to utilize my skills.  It was a temporary position however I took with me training that assisted in future positions.
good,"work time flexibility"
good,"Company was a good place to work in the beginning, but declined as the company direction changed.  Work was mostly remote, which was the best part, but it made it difficult to develop relationships with teammates."
good,"This position enabled me to work from home, manage a global team and support a global customer, until leadership decided a WFH role was no longer acceptable."
good,"Good and decent organization to work with. Very good work/life balance. But other areas like job security, management, job culture, etc. needs improvement (compared to other Tier 1 organizations)."
good,"IBM is pretty flexible when it comes to work-life balance for its employees. They make efforts to listen to the desires of their employees when it comes to the workplace environment."
good,"You will be treated as a number and you can lose your job any time a round of lay-offs come. However, you can learn a lot, the pay is great and you co-workers will inspire you. So make the most of it while you're there."
good,"- Good organization with work life balance"
good,"Good team environment.  co-workers are supportive - reaching out to each other to ask questions, provide backup when you will be out of the office.  "
good,"I was only there for about a year, but everything seemed to be moving really slow. The management seemed to know what they were doing but took their time assigning new things."
good,"I enjoyed working at IBM as a temporary employee.  Both the IBM employees and all of the temporaries I encountered were very pleasant, including the management."
good,"All you have or do not have in IBM depends on your Manager. Work from home is not like before, there is a restriction. Thay pay very less. Work culture completely depends on one's manager's mentality."
good,"if you join any project check it whether its long term or short term,if it is short term means you will eliminate soon because the project based only there hire you"
good,Good organization. Has good employee engagement initiatives. Very good for people who aspire to build a career in the BPO industry. Very employee friendly work culture.
good,I enjoyed the Coop program put on by IBM. The work was interesting and the people fun to work with. I even appreciated the option as a Coop to take training classes from the experts.
good,"I have worked in this company for 8 years and it is a great place to work. You have the flexibility to work from home and have a good work and life balance. "
good,"IBM has some policies that are really good and beneficial for the employees, but some of the aspects are purely based on your managers whom you report to."
good,"Overall experience was good and I've learnt a lot during my services at IBM. The only challenges I face was the frequent change of Managers. During my service,  4 managers were changed one after another after a month or two, managers left their job as the process I worked for has ramp down. The training period was good. As part of my suggestion the company should have fun games and team outing too in order to refresh our mind and should keep a manager that have good knowledge on the particular process/ product."
good,"Opt Work from Home anytime, as such there is no strict rules and regulation , Company & your People or Functional Manager always approve your WFH request."
good,"I learnt in IBM- 	Assist in defining the deliverables and work plan."
good,Its working fun here . I enjoy  day to day challenges faced. Ability to grow in all aspects. Open environment and opportunity to  grow in term of technical as well as managerial front.
good,"Working culture depends on the project"
good,Good organization to work with. Workplace culture is good. No time restrictions as long as one completes the required/assigned tasks. Work from home option.
good,"IBM is a large technology company now with standard compensation and benefits. It provides opportunity for advancement in skilled R&D, but not much in other areas. Work/Life balance is still good, however that is steadily declining like many other personable benefits once enjoyed 10+ years ago. Positives include ample opportunity to gain skills and experience with latest technology, and in creating leading-edge technology and solutions."
good,Its a good company to work with however you would have to get into the right process. IBM has a lot of process but not everything is the same. You may want to know about the process you are getting into before joining.
good,There is many opportunities to explore among the big firm however many of the leadership is outdated in understanding of Technology and can be very frustrating at time
good,Multiple roles without any benefit. The company is highly bureaucratic and highly needs influential people to get things moving. There is no recognition for hardwork. Only the ones who do favors succeed
good,"Help customer in development of self-service process where development teams can scan the application and fix the vulnerabilities before moving the code to production"
good,"IBM is nice place to work, managers are supportive, wokplace culture are secured, learned a lot from IBM in HR. most hardest part when say no i to the candidates who appear for the interview. rest I enjoyed my work a lot"
good,"Flexible work nature, Work from facility available, multiple technology to work on, horizontal growth, no 9 hours strict swiping, good reputed clients"
good,"Nice place to work, only if you expect easy and smooth work environment, and not much salary. Management is OK, could be more better. Less motivation."
good,"Good branded IT company with international recognition."
good,"Work life balance is great but salary, increment & job security side is worst. Work from home option is good during vacation and emergency periods....."
good,"ibm is the best place to work, if you compromise with the salary and growth. for a career starting people its a barrier for thier growth. but its an ultimate company for any individual to settle at last"
good,"A empresa é séria e agradável de se trabalhar, disponibiliza diversos treinamentos online para melhoria de skill."
good,"IBM gives you a flexibility to work at your own suitable time. Only completion of work is what matters. "
good,Here in IBm everything depends on the manager . The work culture is pretty good and you will get more exposure of the different kinds of the technologies. Work life balance is really awesome.
good,It is a Good start for any new comer or an experienced candidate to work in a new area. Very vast exposure and gives the opportunity to interact with world wide managers and leaders. This builds confidence within.
good,The people are really nice as they will help you with anything you need especially if you are new in the team. The company is good for those seeking managerial work.
good,"Currently,i am working in IBM.I am working on RPA tools,in which i am learning various technology skills like javascript,powershell,web services etc.The most enjoyable part of job is when i achieved the target."
good,Backlash of conventional IT practices especially involving 'Project Transition' and directionless middle management with decision making in complete doldrums
good,Working for a major Oil and Petroleum Organization for their LMS. IBM was the complete end to end solution provider for the LMS and so was responsible for the support and maintenance of it.
good,"while work life balance is good, you have flexibility in work, however, remuneration is on lower side. Being in a big organization also means that you have a specific role with less likelihood to acquire new skill sets. However, on the good side you can make move to another process with different skill sets."
good,"Great company in terms of work that comes your way. The opportunities are abundance in terms of what you get to do and what you learn. Although there are many technical issues to deal with on a daily basis but there is also a satisfaction that there is some new learnt trying to solve the issue."
good,It is a great place to work as long as you are in the right BU. Abundance of training resources and good work life balance. Technology based  company.
good,"If you as an individual is technically minded and wants to work with an organization that  is always in the forefront of the next big thing."
good,"The account is very stressful but I am always excited to go to work everyday because of the people that I am working with."
good,"It is a nice place to work, car parking facilities, work from home are advantages. Nice healthcare and pension schemes."
good,"IBM Provides flexibility to work ( from Home or Office) provided Project is remotely supported."
good,"Flexible working environment"
good,"I've been working for IBM, for 4 years now, but always in some client's office. It is complicated then to rate the office. On the other hand, I can say that IBM offers a lot of self learning and some other benefits"
good,"innovatives Unternehmen"
good,"IBM India is the place where few 25% of the workforce works with great enthusiasm and 75% of the workforce slack and just push the pixels. So if you want to join a org and lay low, you can survice for 5 years without doing any work."
good,"Company having flexibility at the best. No mandatory working hours."
good,Band Progression in very slow.So is the salary increment and bonus.In terms of developing new skills there are ample opportunities and projects in various work streams are available.
good,"In customer care service i had taken the outbound call from assam circle of "
good,"Good work life balance but no hikes even if you are a good performer. "
good,"A typical day would be to review and take action on all emails and voice messages. Follow up with unfinished tasks"
good,"Management was friendly and supportive in every manner."
good,"It's hard to manage a company of 400,000+ employees across different business units and countries.  IBM has a great culture if you can get a hold of it.  It really depends on the company within IBM that you work for as to how much you'll get out of working for them. I like where I work, and I've had the opportunity to experience the good things that IBM has to offer."
good,"Good to work in this Company and we have lots of opportunities."
good,"IBM India Pvt Ltd is one of the leading outsourcing Unit which offers services on various domains like F&A, Training, Banking Operations, etc with High Customer Satisfaction."
good,"Good Place to learn, but don't expect much salary. One good thing in ibm is you can do work from home. "
good,"Worked with IBM as Technical support office for BP process as service desk "
good,"the working condition is good. a little far away from the center of silicon valley, but it is relatively easy to access because it is right on the side of 101. but there are too much work, even on weekends."
good,Working at big company like IBM there is not much culture. People you work with are located all around the world so getting things done efficiently is difficult and you do not develop strong relationships with others. IBM does compensate well and there is a good work/life balance.
good,"Nice company learnt a lot in Profession, Looking for Career growth and more responsible Job Hence Need to change the Company"
good,IBM has acquired all the right assets for a great solution. Integration is a problem right now.  Not hitting earnings in several years is causing layoffs in a random fashion.
good,Management has little regard for your personal / professional needs. Individual contributors feel like they are pawns as executive leadership fights for power. Lots of change for the sake of change. It's changed a lot over the last decade - some of that change was needed but a lot of the change is disenfranchising the workforce. My co-workers and clients are wicked smart and that's the thing I enjoy most.
good,"Perfect work life balance"
good,"I enjoyed the work in our team."
good,It was a good experience in  IBM  i have learnt so many things  like SAP and other.and i have got knowlege about Invoice processing and bills payable.
good,"Al ser una continuacion de mi trabajo en la empresa anterior GrupoJWT, la valoracion es muy positiva porque han sido12 años  de continuo crecimiento profesional y personal. Muy Satisfecho con el trabajo realizado durante este tiempo tanto en el departamento de IT como con el resto de departamentos de la compañía."
good,"Not able to recall any such incident as left Company in 2013, But I can say confidently is, its a good brand to start your career & Work culture definitely help you to learn how to work under pressure which will improve your patience level."
good,"Great work-life-balance but that is by far not everything that matters. The compensation is horrible and there is no hope that things are going to get better soon."
good,Lot of work pressure and have to meet deadlines. Long working hours. Too much of Iteration. Good peers to work with and job security is always there. No much of compensation benefits
good,"It's a great place but you have to be in the right group with strong direct management. IBM is going through so many changes and is under severe pressure to stem revenue losses that it's a continual game of re-structuring product groups and sales teams. Be prepared to be moved into new groups once or twice a year. Big downside is you rarely are afforded any input on where you end up after the restructuring. But, it's a great place to work when you have a product that IBM invests in and you have strong managers. Still a leader in many areas. There is no downside to working at IBM - you may not have a long term career but still provides great experience and ability to learn. Still leader in selling value to largest enterprise accounts. You need to be able to network internally to advance your career."
good,The company is not reliable any more. You always have a fear of losing your job at IBM as full-time employee. They're laying off almost every other quarter. They lay off more full time employees than contractors. If people are looking for a contract job where they don't have to worry about losing their job then they should apply for IBM.
good,"Good work life balance , full ownership of all the work, Large knowledge base, flexibility  of working hour ,Salary is not align with market , need to improve salary structure"
good,i was exposed further more into the Agile development. Especially when I interacted with the client of IBM. You get to work on an environment that is great and challenging
good,"Constantly competes with the market on new technologies and innovations."
good,"I started my day with the login in the computer. This is the first thing which all the employees have to do in the IBM. After login I checked the daily updates and work related e-mails. My job profile was to resolve the customer queries through e-mailing."
good,"IBM is a great organization to work, however my experience was terrible due to management of the particular team where I worked"
good,"IBM has got the name. It had good work life balance but slowly it is going. Other than that there is nothing positive to say."
good,"The best thing about IBM is the people.  It has great employees who work hard and take their jobs very seriously. IBM is committed to growing those people.  There are many opportunities to learn more and grow."
good,"Work culture is good,,no timings,,not required any log in and out timings...no need to go to office ..working from home is availableno"
good,Very family oriented and they understand people get sick. I saw how management really went out of their way to accommodate an employee's personal issues.
good,Have enjoyed working at IBM. Gives you a chance to connect with people all around the world. Very challenging and keep changing as per the new requirements. Flexible but demanding. Mostly people are very friendly and help each other. Lots of opportunities once you invest few years.
good,"Built the IBM Cloud platform digital presence from the ground up, was able to work with teams from around the world and gain new skills in a fast paced environment."
good,People are helpful but no work/life balance. Employees have to work way beyond their log out time. HIgh work pressure and unsupportive management.
good,"IBM is huge company, the benefits are really good, but the salary, at least in my case was not very competitive. Have an IBM in your resume is something that the recruiters like."
good,"Began as an apprentice, gaining vital experience and skills which will hopefully allow me to progress, as opportunity is lacking within the company."
good,"-- Only the consultants work, managers are not even aware of the process or technical know-how."
good,"A IBM é uma empresa otima para começo de carreira e desenvolvimento profissional contando com grandes recursos e bons funcionarios."
good,"A good company no better or worst than most others.  Lots of travel long days.  Make your own way must be self starter, not much free time very fast paced."
good,"Making strides in transformational efforts to cloud, digital, and SaaS model. Things still move slowly, though. Lots of duplication of work / ""right hand not talking to the left hand"" sort of issues."
good,"You have to be flexible working with people world wide."
good,"Plenty of opportunities to learn from lots of legacy code but also plenty of opportunity to do new things."
good,"the work was located at a hospital in the far south of the town.It took me one hour to get to work everyday.regardless of commuting to work, working hours were quite flexible."
good,"- Trop de compétition en interne, le client met trop de temps pour atteindre le bon spécialiste."
good,"Company lost its ""innovation"" years ago. convoluted process in doing the simplest of things (expenses, travel, time reporting). Great part about IBM is still the people that work there, even though Canada is treated as the ""oops child"". No autonomy and everything is driven by the US. Even worse in the West, as decisions are also executed mostly in Toronto. Calgary office is 100% the best office in Canada, but lacks opportunities outside of oil & gas."
good,"Good Company for Work and the atmosphere is cool. Management is not up to mark in IBM. My Team members are good."
good,I've started my career with IBM and it was good to have started my career with IBM had been a great learning curve. It was fun and presented great opportunities while working as well.
good,"Work culture is good"
good,IBM is has a very relaxed and flexible work culture .Lot of learning but dont expect good money .My carrer is bit spoiled with this company .
good,"A typical day at work would be to login to your workstation/laptopwith a coffee mug at your desk, browse through the ticketing system for problem/incidents related to your capability and resolving them, and later meetings with clients/team. Apart from technical knowledge, I learned how to communicate with clients, how businesses work, work cultures and ethics of different people from across the world, etc. I'm lucky enough to have some good managers on my project, they would provide with few opportunities here and there, and discuss about the professional growth within the company. I've had a fair share of smart and hard working peers in my team, they were competitive and friendly."
good,".in nove anni di attività ho potuto vedere molto nel dettaglio i meccanismi di una global company in tutte le aree - con i relativi pro i contro, e le contraddizioni."
good,I would recommend working here if you are very competitive.  The benefits have been getting worse and worse over the years I worked there.  I did not enjoy the company culture.
good,"I was able to learn a lot of finance related things that helped me in my job. It is kind of a dying company though. It was mostly a work from home environment, which can be hard if you are just starting out your career."
good,Joined IBM in 1995 in the AS400 call center.  Most of my career was working 3rd shift on site and from home. A typical day consisted of working with customers who were restoring systems or installing/upgrade.  Learned how to work with anxious customers and take control.  I did not see much management and did not interact with them much.  Worked closely with co-workers for support on many different levels.  The hardest part of the job was covering the vast amount of different call types.  Finding help on certain type of calls was the hardest. The best part of the job was  co-workers and the good interaction we seem to always have on issues.
good,The company is very process driven and looks to replicate its past successes with current client problems.  This is both a benefit and restraint to client engagements.
good,"There are areas in IBM that are still doing really great work, leading the IT industry into new and very exciting territory.  The area in which I work is not one of those-- many brands and divisions in IBM are suffering from significant understaffing, resulting in poor quality of work and drop in employee morale.  Too many jobs have been shipped to low cost countries and this pattern continues, leaving those of us who remain in a constant state of worry that no matter how great a job we do and how much of a contribution we make, our job may just disappear anyway.  The benefits are not up to industry standard and there's no incentive to remain with the company since they all but eliminated most of the loyalty perks like pension and stock options."
good,"BPO organization, if the request is more then we need to extend our working hours, "
good,Work culture changed over the years. Numerous layoffs with added workload for employees. Overall still a good place to work.
good,Not great but good work life balance. Employees are not satisfied with the salary structure. No suck big promotional benefits.
good,"Co workers friendly"
good,"it is a home office in small team of eight people, management does not interact as long as there is a problem or directive. We are self-sufficient, help one another and solve problem of FIFO of best effort or skills basis, never waiting for one another if that´s possible. Always helping and caring, always ready to substitute and work longer hours."
good,"A place must to work at. Adds value to your resume. At IBM India, there is a lot to learn. It's the right place to learn & grow. As IBM pioneers a lot of technologies, you get opportunities to learn and participate in those."

good,"work life..challenging work fast paced..."
good,"Doing routine jobs. Learned about the hiring and procurement process for IBM. Co-workers are fun to be with. Being an open concept, you get to talk to different ranks in the same office."
good,Fun workplace with great team work spirit. High pressure to achieve business results and lack of supportive management team. It is a good company to learn and improve your carrer.
good,IBM is a great company for everyone. It was my first job and I worked there for 8 years. They taught me everything I should know.

good,"When I joined IBM, its for the first time, I was introduced to a consulting environment where large teams are invloved in consulting activities for various clients across the globe. A very good introduction to my consulting experience happened here."
good,"Typical day at work would be providing financial, administrative and clerical services in order to ensure effective, efficient and accurate financial and administrative operations."
good,The work environment is very laid back at IBM. We have a open door policy so a majority of the time managers and team leads are very willing and able to help answer any questions. Hardest part about my role is working with international time zones. I've gained a much better understanding of corporate finance.
good,"Como uma empresa muito grande, as relações com os colegas de trabalho depende da forma como a gerência transfere o conhecimento e as estratégias corporativas para o time. Durante 4 anos foi excelente, depois com as mudanças gerenciais não houve o cuidado adequado na avaliação e condução do novo gerente ao time, mudando completamente o clima e o trabalho entre todos, tomando atitudes nocivas e desagregadoras."
good,IBM is fantastic company to begin a career with. IBM is a sea of knowledge. It is an enriching experience at IBM and one gets to learn so much more
good,"IBM has great work culture."
good,"Large Solid organization based on process and procedure, which has served them well in the past. Unfortunately, competition is strong and then need to be agile and flexible to meet new demands creates stresses. because of it's size, organizational structure,  and processes, it can be very bureaucratic to accomplish simple tasks.  The employee resources are talented, however there is a long legacy of structure. Domestic advancement is limited above a Senior Technical position. Advancement in management is extremely limited. Salary growth is also very tightly controlled. The hardest part of this job is working the legacy processes. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the talented resources that the company has."
good,"over 60 hour work weeks, lack support.  No consistency.  Most coworkers solid.  Culture lacking.  Atmosphere turned negative once IBM purchased company."
good,"Developed and Tested the reports using Cognos Workspace Advance and Peoplesoft queries."
good,"Employee freindly, flexible shifts, WFH is given to most of the employees according to their convinience,"
good,Vista la diversità delle mansioni che si possono svolgere anche all'interno dello stesso reparto hai sempre qualcosa da imparare e non ti annoi mai per un lavoro ripetitivo. Molto appagante
good,"The work environment is great and is a great company to work for."
good,Daily work entails working with a team of 13 collectors handling diversified accounts. The industry on where the account belongs is a new learning for the past 10 years I have been handling credit and collections. The client has been very supportive of all ideas presented and in making sure that people are happy with their work and they get good commendation and rewards for a good job done. There are challenges to complete every task but I do not consider them as hardest part of the job but rather opportunity areas for further growth. The best thing I enjoy doing my job is that I am able to be myself being allowed to express ideas and get the support needed in order to achieve a common goal.
good,"Great company in terms of transforming itself and embracing disruptors as part of its new operating model.  Heavy emphasis in Cloud, Analytics, Security, Mobile and services"
good,"Instead of fixing archaic processes to streamline the effectiveness of the business, management only knows to lay people off."
good,This organization is a great place to start your career with. Have had a great team all this while with a great work culture .
good,"I worked for this company for over 25 years.  It has evolved tremendously in that time.  Some changes are good, some bad.  Some of those changes are driven by political necessity; and I recognize that."

good,"En mis 8 años de experiencia de IBM pase por varias etapas/sensaciones, los cuales en principio fueron muy buenos, pero con el correr de los años se fueron degradando, hasta llegar a ser un lugar de trabajo que creo muy pocos querrian tener."
good,"It's a really fine routine."
good,It is best place to work when you look for better management roles and learn the new things

good,This company was my 1st corporate experience & job function. This was a great start to help advance my career.
good,"administer the application server"
good,"it is good to work in IBM as we have a lot of flexibility in timings and Work from home facility is there. But, as far as I noticed, people in IT usually keep switching the companies, so it happens to IBM people too."
good,"I love working at my help desk at IBM. My lead for my desk is brilliant and genuinely cares about us and our desk. However, upper management, as well as middle management do not and our desk is very clearly not the priority in the grand scheme of things and they aren't shy to let us know this. We also as employees aren't valued by these individuals, as our pay and managements constant attempts to walk all over us demonstrates."
good,"IBM is really a good company to work."
good,"every think is good but I  need change."
good,"I worked and learnt many things in IBM. As I worked for my client Google, so I got to learn new things about google environment and some professional things"

good,"Learnt the Process of IT industry."
good,"The work consist to pick up items, fun place to work great coworkers."
good,"Depending on the projects and management, had both good and bad times."
good,"IBM tends to pigeon-hole its people into just the job it needs from that person. In my 18 years at there I knew I was stuck in a job that, if I did my job well, would dwindle away to nothing eventually - and it did. As I told ever manager I ever had, I knew I was in a gilded cage - no place to go, no advancement potential, lateral or otherwise, but making too good a salary and was there too long to voluntarily jump ship -- so they made me walk the plank after I basically worked myself out of a job. But such is the life of field service hardware support in a corporation that reclassified itself as a ""services"" provider instead of a manufacturer - those pesky machines just won't stay running whereas code can be written overseas by anybody."
good,"For five years, IBMers have been working with companies, cities and communities around the world to build a Smarter Planet."
good,"-Divertido y excitante"
good,"IBM was hired by NSTAR to automate billing system.  NSTAR wanted meetings 3 times per week so that we had much less time to develop IT & bring in hardware as well.  IBM had meet & greet dinner to NSTAR, meetings down 90%."
good,"Many procedural changes."

Sometimes the business can be very demanding, but everyone within the company is willing to help and solve any issue in the best way possible. In my first year at IBM, I learned a lot about client handling, effective communication, deal closing and network building."
good,"Learning about Lotus Notes-interesting job."
good,"Good Company, I have learnt many things from my co-workers. better understanding on the process and have mentored the team members with same interest"
good,co-workers are the glue; days can be hectic; hardest part of job is getting stuff done with aging tools and equipment
good,"Good work culture and job security. "
good,"By doing job here i learnt about so many thing."
good,The big blue is really huge when it comes to number of resources working for them. IBM brand has its reputation in India and non-US regions. One will definitely appreciate the work from home policy.

good,"IBM was a learning experience. 3.1 yrs of hardship had got me 2 promotions and an award of ""star employee of the month""."
good,I have only been at the IBM SO Delivery for a little over 2 months.  I find that it is a hardworking environment.
good,"IBM is a giant in the technology area, but it is also very slow to adapt to changes. Management with the STG group was great, being former engineers themselves."
good,"Buena compañía, beneficios de ley, un clima organizacional no muy bueno."
good,"Just another average organization."
good,Excellent learning environment with top notch talent.  Work from home a plus but no such thing as job security.
good,"At the beginings, I used to be very reserved but after some days I learnt to be interactive & professonal."
good,It was hard having three employers.   The client was Express Scripts.   The main contractor was IBM and then I was under a sub contractor company.   It was hard to keep up with everyone
good,"Good work culture"
good,"Good for work/life balance and new grads"
good,"Most recently I created and implemented successful channel marketing and executive communications programs."
good,"Nice company to be with, started my career about 6 and half years ago in IBM as V&A trainer and moved roles every year to pursue my interests and career. Encourages and gives oppurtunity to learn new aspects."
good,"IBM stresses work / life balance on many of their employee calls. However, having worked in the events arena for them for 2 years, you many times were expected to put in 10-12 hour days.  Many times there were 14-15 hours days.  I will do what it takes to get the job finished, however, there has to be some balance or the employee will get burnt out."
good,"I am currently in Banking domain . "
good,Well run team. Work environment is very professional. Ample resources company wide to fulfill my role.

good,"I have learned the typical IBM way of project management. I do interact with lot of programme managers and sales directors, which is very interesting."
good,Nice place to work
good,"IBM could be well served by union representation. HR does nothing for employees who get ""manufactured"" items like not providing their sales forecast (lie) or not returning phone calls (lie) and feel that they can push out people who've given 25 years to them at a whim. The management team acts with little controls beyond ""documenting"" getting people out and offshoring jobs every chance they get. The company was a ""full employment"" culture when I joined in 1983 it is a very very difficult environment for all good employees who are now left."
good,My exp. with IBM was really good. The staff was supportive. I did not have the plans to leave the company so early but due to certain unavoidable reasons I had to leave them. Hardest part was that I had to take sometimes more then 50 calls in a day and at the end had to submit the report as well. Enjoyable was that sometimes working with such a great team and interacting daily with new people was interesting.
good,- Prepare capacity report/dashboards and share with customer.
good,"Very good company to learn things,many options to move up."
good,I learned company never worry for employee
good,"es divertido trabajar para IBM pues es una empresa limpia, responsable y preocupada por sus empleados aunque los contratos son por muy corto plazo."

good,"First 3 months are the most difficult, however when you learn the business the job is not very difficult. Workload is not very heavy if you are organized."
good,unstable work place the last 10 years which made everyone very concerned
good,"IBM GPS as a company is a good to work in but there is not much in the hands of subordinates against their supervisor which can be considered as effective measure of escalation. There are certain policies in IBM which are good but are good on papers only, they are not implimented so that their final purpose is met."
good,Tive grande oportunidade de entrar nessa empresa e trabalhar com uma área diferente. Gostei
good,Its is a good place to work where many flexibilities are provided to balance your Work and Personal Life.
good,working at this company is very good but not from all the ways...
good,"Empresa de grande porte. Aprendi muito as rotinas de departamento pessoal, recebi uma promoção a qual troquei de timee aprendi muito mais. Não existia muita gestão de pessoas e ficava dificil se desenvolver lá dentro. A parte mais agradavés foi o conhecimento adquirido, o contato diário com a lingua inglesa e minha relação com os cologas de trabalho."
good,serious work and continuous meetings and feed backs
good,"> ITIL based Incident , Change , Problem & Risk Management"
good,Good to work in IBM
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was to help the customer , to give them resolution on first call."
good,"Vandaag op kantoor achter het computerscherm en telefoon aktief, volgende dag op reis door het land om incidenten op te lossen of een uitrol van nieuwe of vervangende machines en andere apparatuur te plaatsen of te begeleiden. Service gericht en met specifieke targets en effincency operend management., fysiek soms belastend, geen negen tot vijf mentaliteit werk. Af en toe avond of weekend werkzaamheden. Doorgroei mogelijkheden, ontwikkeling nieuwe skills en competenties."
good,"- typical software company, when its close to the deadline then things can get stressful"
good,Worki ng with IBM is good. Feels more comfortable at work as we have our own identity. Most important is we have a job security and growth aspects are more. Work environment is too friendly which inturn makes us happy at work
good,"a typical day at work is related only with work, no other benefits or pleasures"
good,Greatest company...I started as a mainframe programmer years ago and years later did a contracted tape ops supervision job at a local company.
good,"The company's greatest asset is its people. Most aim to collaborate and work well with teammates despite the fact that over 60% of the employees worldwide are mobile. This huge, global company can become an intimate and closeknit work experience--- and it all depends on who you work with. The key is the first line manager. Insufficient support to their roles puts pressure on reports."
good,For work/life balance IBM is one of the best company to work with. Personal growth is also quite good.
good,IBM is having some of the good leaders and flexible working hours as pros. But the problem with IBM is slow growth and lesser salary compared to market. IBM need to change it's old working style and they should take some bold actions to speed their plans/actions.
good,Relaxed environment. Good work culture. Good Work life balance. Friendly team. Manager and other team mates were always available for discussion. Nice ambience.
good,"IBM is very family oriented and was very flexible for employees needs. Opportunities to work from home when needed and flexible hours were available if needed. Employees were never shamed or ""put down"" if something came up with a family member and they needed to rearrange there schedule."
good,Good experience working with IBM . The company does provide a lot of opportunities for professional growth. Would recommend for others who are trying to pursue. Good work-life balance
good,Working at IBM is encouraging and gives you opportunities to try new roles at work. Work life balance is good. Hike is ok but policies for hike such as one year completion is minimum although you have completed close to 10 months and wait until next year hike cycle is not good.
good,"Company is good,but low paid.i am working with the company since last 10 years.but no good growth as expected.so i want to leave this company."
good,"IBM has a good culture for employees to learn and thrive. It is an ethical company where obeying laws, doing right for the clients is above the profitability of the company."
good,"IBM is a storied company that is struggling to keep the narrative going into the present.  The last 25+ quarters have not seen revenue growth or very slight growth, year over year.  Job cuts in the U.S. and elsewhere have been the response to this.  Benefits and vacation and work options are very generous, however."
good,"Es buena la empresa, trata bien a sus empleados pero la paga no es buena"
good,Lots of changes at IBM.  Make sure you are aligned with a division that is growing and part of the strategic direction of the company.  Also make sure you understand how you are paid.  IBM has an interesting compensation plan.
good,"IBM provides a great platform to grow. It has a great learning portal, providing better exposure to new upcoming technology. "
good,"Open desk policy, great and beautiful environment in a nice vibrant city. Hierarchy is somewhat flat and you have a lot of flexibility. Amazing place for young grads."

good,"IBM ISSC Hungary is a great place to learn about the multinational environment, the company culture and the personal growing at a workplace. Wokr/life balance is managable"
good,With IBM the experience is wonderful. Am always busy in work & getting full learning of new things. I am getting full support from my manager. Overall its great going.
good,"IBM is a fun place to work, said that, we become complacent after few years working on the same type of job. Flexibility in shift and work schedule."
good,"Many things to explore in terms of learning, The management is good and gives opportunities for everyone to explore however in 2013 -2015 there were no salary increments"
good,"There are a lot of college hires at IBM, which creates for a fun culture of young people but it is not matched in work which has created a culture of resentment"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Es una empresa que me dio la posibilidad de iniciarme en mi carrera, encontre un ambiente distendido de trabajo."
good,"Typical day is productive and quite, a typical work week is 40 to 50 hours. Great training, excellent hands on classes that have non-trivial projects, the teachers and assistants are great. Management is usually not good but your co-workers and the workplace culture are GREAT!! Hardest part of the job working on older platforms that do not seem to be the future. The best part of the job is the great co-workers and great work-life balance."
good,Problem with IBM is personality conflicts within the departments. Managers would sometimes hold you back - one year I get 3 raises because previous manager would not give anyone raises.
good,"Allowed me to be creative, encouraged my creativity and allowed me to innovate consistently. Learning is encouraged, using AI to assist in learning is great, it encourages growth in specific areas and allows you to nurture or enhance those areas. Identifies weakness and encourages you to increase skills in the weak areas."
good,"I liked working here, the people were professional and the environment very supportive."
good,"In the time I've been there, I've seen a lot of evolution, and not all of it necessarily for the better. The services part of company is very focused on cost reduction to the detriment of delivery quality. I think it's drastically affected our clients' confidence in IBM."
good,IBM is a good place to work. But the Salary and compensation is not so good. Many projects don't work on the latest technologies in the market so personal growth in the company depends a lot on the project you're working on.
good,"I worked for 2.5 years with IBM. I was working in Sales Operations department and for 2.5 years, I had very minimal salary hike which was a major consern"
good,"A lot of people fear for their jobs, especially after older workers continually are targeted for layoffs which happen often. Layoffs are held in waves to avoid a larger layoff that would affect stock price. MANY IBMers have been targeted for layoffs 40+ years and older. Best to work for this company in your 20's & 30's, then leave for another career before they lay you off and give you only one months' severance (used to be 2 weeks for every week of service up to 6 months if you've worked at IBM a long time, but severance has been reduced to only 1 month after you have worked very hard for this company for many years). Per feedback from employees still at IBM: Employee morale overall is low due to continuous layoffs."
good,"1. Large multinational with lots of opportunities"
good,"depends on the group you work for, some group pays your tuition and encourage your to learn new technology. They hire quality people, but people are leaving for new tech companies."
good,"Permet de découvrir la mise en place d'un projet au sein d'une entreprise."
good,"IBM was a great place to work, but as I was going to be a Manpower Contractor I needed to find another regular job with benefits.  IBM allowed work from home and were very work/family orientated.  Typical day was scheduling meetings, travel, doing expenses, working as a team with colleagues."
good,"Good environment to move forward and learn how to support a large infrastructure. "
good,"IBM is no doubt one of the largest organisation and lot of scope to learn, But it's been identified they hire anybody like that only. There are illiterate managers. who really don't have management skills and attitude."
good,"IBM is a great place to work as far as day to day stress but long term you are not going to learn the skills necessary to survive in the tech industry. They don't use any modern languages, frameworks, etc. and eventually you will get left behind. Also no free coffee, snacks, anything, and the food at the cafeterias is insanely overpriced. They don't care about their employees at all and it shows in your environment. Old school dusty 4 person cubicles."
good,"Experienced Resources can be better utilized."
good,"On the whole smart, charismatic people on projects, but  management is scattered and unclear of their duties. Overall I felt like I was paid well and had opportunities to travel, however I do not see my future here. They are putting more and more emphasis on technical talent. No home office culture for traveling consultants."
good,When I joined IBM its my first job & I was so excited and learned so many things from the organisation in terms of presentation &personal development. Management and workplace found good.
good,"IBM pushes to get the very best from their employees. Expect the unexpected, decisions and changes can come in a heartbeat."
good,"Good work culture, Policies - IBM is good in these. "
good,"Ein grosses internationales Unternehmen mit vielen Möglichkeiten. Leider stark aus den USA gesteuert und ohne Verständnis für die kleine Schweiz. Wenig Spielraum für das lokale Management"
good,"The only reason I am thinking of leaving IBM is because I didn't receive a promised and earned commission check for clerical reasons. The sales management can not be trusted. Once you are away from sales it is a great place to work and allows you to work remotely. The work is challenging. Do not come to work here if you are an inventor. You are required to submit all of your ideas, even if they have absolutely nothing to do with your work, to IBM. If they decide to patent it, you get a really small sum of money. Even if they make millions."
good,Grew into my career as Project and Program Manager while at IBM.  Primarily worked remotely and occasionally traveled to customer and IBM locations to support project deliverables.
good,"Świetna kultura pracy, bogaty pakiet socjalny, fajne miejsce ale... awansujesz bez podwyżki. Obiecują że zgodnie z polityką firmy dostaniesz ją po określonym czasie. A później zmieniają politykę."
good,"Pretty good benefits for probationary employees, since you are already given leaves and an HMO."
good,I have been at IBM for 5 months and have learned a lot from working with some amazing people. I was assigned as a IT Support Intern and learned a lot about troubleshooting.
good,Typical day begins with a stand-up meeting to go over current progress and ongoing tasks/issues and/or demos.  Team had multiple managers and seemed to progress like molasses. As always there were a few interesting and fun people to work with alongside multiple non-interesting drones. Hardest part about the job was staying motivated and interested in the project. Software seemed incredibly boring to the average individual and was highly specialized/geared towards management staff. Most enjoyable part about the job was working with those team members who were friendly and outgoing.
good,"mgmt provides no strategic direction for the group"
good,"IBM are an organisation that will throw you in at the deep end and lend assistance when you have an issue. This I believe is the best way to learn. "
good,"Área financeira pouco desenvolvida, com poucos funcionários."
good,Gran ambiente de trabajo con una gran administración.
good,"because of work from home facility, It is possible to maintain very good Work/Life Balance here. Not getting good salary, and very less salary hike. Having less projects, this creates concern about relocation. Looking for better work in Spark development area."
good,A typical day starts with a meeting followed by several discussions with the dev team as well as managers on how to move forward. Workplace is cool and feels good so see so many energetic faces around you.
good,"Bon environnement flexible, mais en tant que RPO il y a toujours le poids du client"
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte, localizada nas diversas partes do mundo. Visa trabalhar em vários segmentos, abrangendo assim seu mercado e suas oportunidades mundo afora."
good,"For this job you would have to have customer service experience, over the phone inboud call center. The area which where I worked did not require a payment from the customer"
good,"Everything depends on your First Line Manager. If he is not supporting you, your career will go worse in IBM. No hikes and benefits without first line manager approval."
good,"Good company, but the upper management has got to be replaced, the CEO is running the company into the ground. every year there are more and more layoffs and no profits to be seen"
good,You come in do what you have to do. It's quiet and everyone just do their job and then go home. Management walks around every now and then but they don't say much unless they have to. They have a cafe in the building but they charge an arm and a leg for food.
good,"Empresa bacana, mas um pouco engessada no Rio. Funcionários precisam se desenvolver mais também."
good,"Good company. Great Benefits- Flexible schedule. Focus on Continous  improvement projects. Tight schedule based work with deadlines and targets."
good,"Un día típico en IBM se basaba en revisar las agendas de los distintos gerentes ayudarlos con los recordatorios tanto de reuniones como de calls (teleconferencias) solicitar sus reembolsos para que no hayan atrasos, revisar si tenían viajes próximos para coordinar, hotel, taxis tanto locales como en destino, coordinar próximas reuniones, aprendí a dar soporte a varios gerentes a la misma vez siendo eficaz y trabajar bajo presión, la parte más difícil diría fue trabajar para una VP a quien solo yo le di soporte por el idioma ya que ella no hablaba castellano solo inglés y era muy demandante, lo que mas me gustaba era el ambiente laboral muy tranquilo e independiente."
good,"Good environment"
good,A great place to start and nurture your skills set. Here you can learn any skills/process irrespective of your experiences and chase opportunities to apply that knowledge. If you get any such opportunity your growth would be exponential otherwise straight line :)
good,"Annual layoffs occur especially if you're not in the right group.  You must own your own growth - don't expect the managers to do it for you.  There are good people there, but they are mostly old-fashioned and generally don't like ""millennials""."
good,"IBM provide very good work life balance.Most of the projects provide work from home facility and unlimited sick and casual leaves."
good,"Good work culture, good work life balance.Good management."
good,Lots of learning opportunity. Though pay is not good in GBS unit but learning opportunity is tremendous  and one can grow very easily in this company.
good,Must be willing to work a lot of overtime.  You need to be available for travel.  You should be willing to give up some family time.  Work  and train people from other countries.
good,"IBM better than AT&T"
good,"frequent reallocations;"
good,"8 horas diarias, laborales, con derecho a vacaciones y festivo y posible home work."
good,"Good company to work for apart from some internal politics."
good,"I enjoyed working with IBM. "
good,"Days could be long as we designed, delivered and set up computer solutions including hardware and software solutions. I learned a lot about applications for computers, from simple work resolutions to providing mechanical (robotic) solutions for businesses. The direct manager was helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job was occasional long hours. I enjoyed providing solutions for clients that had unusual or difficult issue to resolve."
good,"Very nice place to work and prosper"
good,"IBM has changed since the first time I worked for them.  As the company has divested many long time business lines, it has been very challenging in determining a new direction for the company.  IBM has always been a premium vendor and attempting to compete in areas that have lower margins has really hurt IBM over the past 3+ years.  There is a lot of fat that needs be trimmed with regards to the people in middle and first line management.  Most of those roles have managers that have never sold solutions in the areas they manage.  Thus, IBM is experiencing a huge bottleneck with productivity.  It will be interesting to see if the current executive leadership team can right the ship or if IBM will have to look to new leadership to restore the company to the past years where the company enjoyed so much success."
good,"Working for IBM the work-life balance was great. "
good,"Get to work with senior management to solve complex problems. Hard to steer such a big ship though. Used to have a great flexible work program, but that is decreasing."
good,Direction of group and uncertainty as to job security always a concern. Team members worked together great sharing information with entire group.  A concern was ability to charge time against work orders from week to week..job security
good,"People are great to work with, however, the workplace in other account is not as good if it’s not located on the company’s building itself. Management is good but still it depends"
good,"Employee can work from home when it is necessary."
good,"I was part of a software cloud storage provider called Cleversafe. Cleversafe was acquired and rebranded by IBM as IBM Cloud Object Storage. "
good,Enjoyed working at IBM. Learned a lot during my tenure. Picked up a lot of skills and my Manager was pretty much awesome and provided support in every way.
good,"Worked on computers and made computer secure. Learned how to keep computers secure. Build computers, AIX RISC boxes. Installed O/S, customer software. Analyzed, troubleshoot and fixed the AIX RISC boxes. Ran ABAP Performance Tuning on production ABAP code and evaluation of the code. Application functional, integration, and regression testing on web client and server for customer. Scheduled daily batch jobs and troubleshot the jobs during SAP support. Workplace culture was start a job, finish it.  Management was there for you and if you messed up to correct the problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping the machines secure and  the hardest part of the job was keeping the machines secure."
good,"No confidence in senior management. They have not had a single quarter of growth in over five years, yet they remain profitable by cutting as many workers over the age of 50 that they can and replacing them with recent college grads.  There are some growth areas like Cloud and Cognitive, but it is difficult to get into those positions."
good,"A good company when it comes to work life balance and work environment is also healthy."
good,"Benefits and salary revision is bad but work life balance is good. "
good,"IBM has been a market leader in IT. They offer flexibility to employees- work times and WFH options too. "
good,Career growth in IBM is not very good for people in mid-40s and older. There comes a point when everything becomes stagnant because the company wants to save money.
good,Not appropriate to share in this forum.  Happy to chat if needed.  The Company has sound Cloud and Cognitive strategy and currently executing on it.  It is fun and exciting to be part of this.
good,"IBM provides good opportunity to maintain Work-Life Balance. During my stint with IBM, I wa allowed flexible working hours and also flexible working conditions. However, it is all dependent on your team and your Manager."
good,"The company has good work life balance . It has a diverse range of projects . There are a lot of scope of enhancing one's skill set via certifications. "
good,"- Good & Supportive Management"
good,"Grande empresa com ótimos profissionais, porém repleta de burocracias e muito segregada entre as diversas áreas."
good,"When I worked at IBM my day always started with me check-in my email to see if have some ticket pendent to be replied or opened with some of the customers we attempted to assume and try to fix quickly this problem together with the solver. At IBM my team and I always have to attend the customers with cordiality and always be polite under pressure. "
good,"Management is poor due to work load."
good,"Flexible hours, good work life balance, work from home or in fact anywhere,understanding people, cross functional skills etc are all the things that come to you if you work for IBM. If you are doing your work properly no one will bother you for staying in office 8 or 9 hrs daily."
good,Es muy buen trabajo solo q hay no dan planta y los contratos los eligen al aventon y no por lo que uno trabaje
good,"Its a great place to work but no financial growth"
good,I started my carrier at ibm just to learn how things go in corporate world ended up in making good friends and learnt how to deal with the corporate world. it was always fun to work in shifts.
good,IBM was a great company up until the late 1990's. They were very concerned about employee's benefits and welfare. There is no job security since they have changed their business model. Employee's are very concerned about being laid off from work.
good,"I was mainly working in calling process where I had to make calls to Brazilian clients to resolve their issues."
good,"It's not the IBM of old. Employees are self-directed and self-trained. Employees are told to certify before they gain any experience, which is backwards. It may be a good fit for some."
good,There are lot of benefits such as work from home etc. A good place to learn various technologies. Flexible work timings. Overall a good place to work.
good,"Not as much structure as I was used to. Felt like my job was unnecessary at times and had to find/make my own work and carve out my own role. Not a lot of room for growth. Morale is pretty low right now in marketing because of executive decision to co-locate. We're losing a lot of good talent to competitors. It's extremely difficult to get things done or be innovative at a company this size and we're constantly reorganizing which also makes it difficult to accomplish anything of real value. The people are what make IBM more tolerable, as well as the flexibility."
good,Excellent place and great experience . Had learn a lot especially working under pressure and balancing work flow and managing people . It been a excellent forum to learn a lot of things related to work culture. ocean of opportunities if you are willing to buy :) friendly management willing to promote skilled candidates on time.
good,"Nice environment for working but all depend on your manager, no major interaction of HR, Salary hike is in hand of one single person your People Manager, No interaction with HR in most of the cases."
good,Life at IBM has good Work-life balance. I enjoyed working there.
good,"My experiences at IBM were enjoyable for the most part. I was blessed to be able to work from home the majority of the time, had excellent colleagues and the culture of rhe workplace was good. One area which was a concern was the proliferation of jobs being outsourced. IBM is a company in transition and as such there have been a significant number of layoffs in the past 5 years with me being one of them. However, I cannot say I disliked my experience. I was disappointed in not being able to move on in another area."
good,"Good company to start career."
good,The work is not shoved on to your throat as it is in different companies. Its good comparatively to others in market. We have the option of work from home. Professional work place.
good,"very nice place to work "
good,"Not as challenging for one who would really like to be aggressive in their career, but, a great place for those wanting job security, and a comfortable, flexible family life."
good,"Empowered to develop new skills & bring new ideas"
good,IBM is a fun productive work place to be with but salary hike wise do not expect any miracles..After all we need to get paid for the service we have given
good,"Working Environment of IBM is good."
good,"Great work culture"
good,"Gathered work experience in customer financial services. I had the opportunity to learn management skills.."
good,"It's a really hit or miss experience. IBM lets you change team after a year, which is good. They have some pretty good initiatives related to reworking their design and product management programs. At times it can be very relaxed and other times (when a big conference is coming up) the pace picks up tremendously."
good,"My typical day at work is like coming to office, exchanging pleasantries with everyone present there, switching on my computer and starting my work. I follow a fixed routine when it comes to taking breaks. I, being a senior member of the team, make sure to help people around with their queries and issues."
good,"Working at IBM was my very first job. Since it's my first, I learned a lot from working in a enterprise environment, I got to know lots and different people. I learned good soft skills and fair knowledge in technology since it was a sales internship. I got to practice my French skills as well"
good,Diversified learning concepts which gives better career growth and development.Flexible work timings so that employees will be able to spend time with the Family.
good,"It does just one good - to shower money upon employees. Besides this, nothing is good here. An impressive appraisal to worst possible cab facility. This what it is."
good,IBM is the first place that I have ever worked in. I think it is a good first choice because you get to meet a range of diverse cultures and backgrounds.
good,Things have been going bad for IBM and has decreased in terms of the value chain in terms of management. The culture which persisted earlier has diminished to a great extent. Earlier the bonding which existed is now not seen. It doe snot value people who are there in terms of salary and benefits. People from outside get packages more than th ones onside
good,Great company to work for if you want work life balance. BUT this depends on which team you land in and your boss. The company as a whole is a great place to work in.
good,IBM has the work culture to get impressed with. People here are always happy to help you. Employees in IBM work as a team and not individuals. It is really a great workplace for women employees as IBM provides pretty good benefits to them.
good,"-Plenty of tasks to do "
good,"I enjoyed work here that provided and Co-Engineer are so friendly. I was appreciated every time whenever I was offering any project. But even after the appreciation, the increment was only 7% that was not acceptable so now I've decided to Job change."
good,"•	Floating of enquiries to the approved vendor after receipt of requisition from user dept."
good,"---Working hours can be suited according to needs."
good,"its a company with a modern environment and the crowd is all young and challenging, with technical people around you its a employee supporting company and a good pay master."
good,Working for Seterus which is a company within IBM that handles fannie mae loans with my position i had to bring delinquent accounts current and handle information as far as escrow accounts and so forth. The training was okay but really learned more when i got on the floor and spoke with customers and actually went through the accounts with them. The working environment was okay i just didnt like the moral standers of the company but i do now understand that it was due to trying to keep there account all current.
good,"In IBM, lot of new things to learn, Flexible working hours, work from home was an added benefit but again depends on your client."
good,"IBM Provides enough growth oppurtunity, but is limited to areas in silos. Being a big organization, the approach of management is to micro management. "
good,Worked with IBM. Everyone one was cooperative and would help if we were stuck. Learnt lot many things. Dealth with glo al peers. Was a.fun working at IBM
good,"I enjoyed working at IBM.  It is an incredible technology company with a very interesting and simulating business environment.  The people that I worked with were really good.  The hardest part of the job was ""reporting"" to multiple leaders."
good,"Having Millercoors as a client was a great time. Fun atmosphere daily and even with the stress of the job, the people made it all worthwhile."
good,"IBM was the Pinnacle of my IT career. Working there was meaningful and I didn't mind working a regular 8 then going home to support servers over night in another locale. That's part of being a Sys Admin. Make the effort to keep everything running smooth."
good,Always very busy performing the job made for 3 people. Co workers were great. Lots of Layoffs. It was great to work from home. Managers were great and always willing to fight for the team.Always stressed about job security.
good,"1) Every Day is unique and challenging"
good,"IBM is filled with extremely competent, talented professionals which makes for a stimulating and challenging work environment.  "
good,"It started out as a great place to work for. However, over a period of time, the future and direction of the company become a big question mark."
good,It was good learning there but work life balance was really poor. When I was there I was engaged 24 hrs a day. even week ends were also not free & there were no incentive for that.
good,We spent all of our day on the phone helping customers find solution to their problems. Since it was during the tax season it got a little overwhelming at times but i had great co-workers that were always ready to help!
good,"Good company but the only thing to worry about is salary is less out here and not much of benefits.                                                      "
good,"Remuneração muito baixa para a demanda de trabalho e cobranças. Nunca esta bom mesmo o funcionário trabalhando perfeitamente."
good,"Job Security and good Work/Life Balance"
good,"I have learned how to work as team and individual."
good,"Quite volatile. ""I B M""  I've Been Moved is quite appropriate. Lots of nice people. Lots of recent college grads. With transition to a cloud - SaaS based company - lots of interesting opportunities in the cognitive or ""Watson"" areas."
good,"IBM provides the best training for the candidates"
good,"IBM is a solid company and has a lot of great products, services and people but it also has over a hundred year of bureaucracy that's outdated and can stifle innovation and creativity. While it is possible to work around some of this, it can slow you down."
good,"Key Project During the employment as an Associate:"
good,"Overall IBM does offer a wide area for learning , knowledge and the people there are of the best I have ever worked with . The life work balance seems to be above all the rest."
good,IBM is a good place to start the career. you can learn a lot depending on the account which you work in. Best place for Woman to strive in
good,Hiring freeze. Without good team its hard to deliver to the expectations. Needs to withstand and outgrow the transformational strategic goals.
good,There's nothing much I could tell about working in IBM. My co-workers possess the determination to accomplish task and fun to work with. My manager was nice and down to earth as well. I love working from home which is a big plus when you get to start a family. There's nothing much to complain about but salary.
good,"My experiences with IBM are mixed, they have a great brand and I have worked for great managers, but over 15 years have had seven different ones."
good,"Biggest issue is being placed on projects that does not corresponds with your career goal.  Placed where needed."
good,I like working at IBM but find that I work very long work weeks.  The number of things expected of you as an employee is enormous and yet so much of it is interesting.  The unfortunate part is that you sometimes get lost in your work because you love it and forget to have a life.

good,"IBM Work culture is one the best in IT which provides very good facilities for its employees. "

good,"provides freedom with employees advancement and provide competitive benefits. Family oriented, fun environment. Flexible work hours, many choices for career and job roles depending on your skills."
good,Good place to work if you are looking for IT experience but basically that is it. I mean the benefits are great and the schedule is pretty nice most of the time. But after three years with no raise and no raise in sight and nowhere to move up from here it is time to move on.

good,its okie.. just that no salary hike..learned alot. its a good company to work woith.. whch supports diversity candidates alot
good,Work life balance and work culture is good at IBM. Benefits are also good. Overall IBM is a good company. You can can opportunities to work with different MNCs
good,"It's what you would expect of a large company.  No room to overachieve, lots of B and C players riding the success of A players.  Any A player will leave very quickly because you are not rewarded for your exceptional performance.  The cost cutting measures that continue to come over and over again at the expense of the everyday employee."

good,"Bei IBM verdient man vergleichsmäßig mit anderen Arbeitgebern in Bulgarien sehr gut. Allerdings ist, wahrscheinlich aufgrund der Größe des Unternehmens, die Organisation ziemlich negativ auszuwerten. Ich werde das Unternehmen verlassen und nach Deutschland zurückkehren, weil ich mir meine Zukunft weder in diesem Unternehmen, noch in einem Anderem im Ausland vorstellen kann."
good,All is very very good. But But monetary wise worst company. If are joining the organization and expecting appraisals or growth dont join.

I was sad to have to leave when I became pregnant with my son, and the support they gave with little to non, I started off as a regular security guard and became Assistant supervisor in no time. I was prepared for the job and organized and happy to take it without prejudice. There was a lot of organizing and work to be done at a new site down town, through the stage of the 1st year contract, it was really easy to manage and start up and nothing but good things. My supervisor was lovely, she was a well educated and equip worker."

Salaries are fair and benefits are very good.  Work/life balance is managed by each individual as long as you get your work done.  Extra efforts are always expected and typically rewarded."
good,"The lowest pay in the market. Managers always see how to cut costs. -Even basic tools like MS office are not provided to us as IBM has to acquire licenses for these.

I am working closely with India in terms of processes and deliverables. I am managing the development team here in the Philippines.Challenging part of my job is to coordinate first with India before going to the client.Apart from that, I must adapt to their culture.

good,"A typical day at work is common with most sales jobs: meeting with clients and creating a strategy to meet quota objectives. The team is very supportive (not as competitive as it may be in some environments). The down side is that the pay may not be as good as competitors and there is so much to sell with overlapping technology that customers can be confused."
good,"I had the misfortune of having to work for Artech Information Systems, they happen to be the top IBM recruiter/placement service. Not a good company, they seem pretty incompetent. Do sign any contract with these people, you'll be sorry. IBM was okay, this was my second stint with them."

good,Get job done by emails.
good,"Hands on cutting edge technology, good chance of internal movements."
good,"Good company to work for, but not your father's IBM from 1980. They look and feel more like Accenture and Deloitte now."
good,"Management and co-workers were excellent. Opportunity for advancement including college courses provided through Marist College were great. Hardest part of the job was leaving, but it was for retirement which made it a little easier."

good,"Management changes like the weather. Their business practices are very unpredictable. A lot of lay-off so job security is not there. IBM will let you work remote, but I think it depends on the manager you support. Just keep in mind, this company is not about employees, it is soley about the shareholders."

good,"IBM will throw you to the sharks! If you have even beginner skills they will throw you in the deep end and hope you can swim. You'll learn as you go. Every day is like drinking from a fire hose! It is always go go go go! Non-stop! You'll be busy while you are brushing your teeth. You'll be on an airplane 2-4 days a week and doing business meetings on airport wifi. Then you have to do all your expense reports and after a full week of work, usually 50-60 hours sometimes 80-100 hours, then you will still be expected to do training and innovation work. Not to mention book all your travel for the next week or 2. Watch out or you might just find yourself burned out, no charred to a crisp! But you will always be on the very cutting edge of technology!!! Tip of the spear!"

good,I have worked for 10 years at IBM and overall had a great experience. Work culture is like any other MNC.  Flexibility to work from home is an advantage for women employees and the hardest part is job security.

good,"It is great company to work. Which provide good work/ life balance."
good,"I enjoyed working at IBM for over 20 years in a variety of jobs. As a Software Client Leader I was able to be very successful over my last five year period of employment.Teammates were focused, professional, and worked easily with teams on shared goals of success. The corporate culture became challenging as revenue decreased and IBM was forced to make workforce reductions and change the strategic direction of the company.b"
good,"Working for IBM means dedication is expected, sacrifice is required, and challenges are satisfying.  The work is challenging and offers growth in experience and ability."
good,the people are great i wish they gave free meals or least free coffee. i worked at the sales office and it was old and cold and not inviting they need a new office or remodel
good,"If your organization is acquired by IBM, chances are you will be laid off.  It seems IBM's business model in acquiring other companies organizations is to lay of folks for cheaper labor abroad or automation."
good,"I was laid off in 2013 and was hired with Manpower which is a contracting company through IBM.  Very different from being a regular IBM employee.  IBM offered the standard benefits and vacation, etc which I found fair.  I do not receive any of these benefits being a contractor."

good,"IBM was a good place to work, I learned a lot regarding various software, applications and technical resolutions to problems.

good,"Best Place to work with .but salary is not upto the market growth."
good,"Working in GBS section of IBM, you will be put on an application from another company, like a contractor, and support the app. You will rarely be asked to do work, and thus your days will get increasingly more boring. Compensation is minimal, as they mostly are trying to make money off of you by charging double your salary."
good,"High Stress"
good,"IBM was a great place to work for a number of years, I personally felt that the lack of career advancement, constant changes in management and territory coverage, as well as having to travel up to 5 days per week, caused me to seek other employment opportunities."
good,"most days I watch you tube because of the slow passe of my jobs."
good,"Jobs are fun at IBM, there's some flexibility into how to get the work done, so even where there's a lot of stress in the job, IBMers usually know how to have fun. Benefits are good too."

good,IBM was a great place to work as an entry level job.  The shifts were 12 hours and your schedule was a rotation of 5 days on 2 days off then 5 days off 2 days on.  Production operators received 196 hours of paid time off that could be used whenever and however you wanted.  The work was generally easy and quick paced but could become stressful occasionally.  Be warned the work is extremely repetitive so boredom was ever present but IBM allowed internet access to the computers on the production line so when things got slow you could at least surf the web!
good,"not bad. high expect for employments. creative and time management is important for IBM culture. If you are good at them, you will be fine .. a lot of meeting each week is expected"
good,"IBM provided a balance of work and life. IBM also has very good E learning facilities which helps you improve your skills every tenure."
good,Motto work hard play hard. Hard driving pace with strong leadership and good training for consultants but no advancement or plan to maintain consultants. Poor decision feedback.

good,"Fun at Work and good work life balance. i learned a lot from this place."
good,A great place for internship but you have to have a good manager else the experience might not be that great. If you have willingness to learn there are ample opportunities but if you just want to chill you can do that also
good,Part of a resource action. 90 Days notice to find a job. At least they gave us some time to find something! My team was great. Working remote was great. Salary was ok. Benefits were too expensive.
good,"Job security is very less .Salary scale is very less .Very hard to manage Family .Work flexibility is there ,If require you have to stretch a bit is customer demands"
good,I was working as a System Administrator and usually i will be handing the incident handling management where our clients are IBM Employees will be raising the ticket and will be fixing the issue either through remote r desk side and after getting the confirmation from the user will be closing the ticket.
good,es una compañia muy completa que apoya al empleado de manera general
good,"IBM is a very good place to work and learn at the same time."
good,great work culture and team work. Management is very supportive and peers are helpful. Big resistance for the group I was working in using new technologies
good,It is a giant of an organization with. I would recommend it for those seeking to have a relaxed work culture. It is not for the ambitious since it is too silo'ed.
good,"Werken in een enterprise omgeving is geweldig, je leert niet alleen veel op technisch vlak maar maakt ook kennis met mensen van over de gehele wereld en dat is wat voor mij dit werk leuk en uitdagend maakt."
good,This was my last job as an employee although a contractor. The project that I was working on was Great but unfortunatedely I was dismissed because the great part of my team is based at India and just me at Brazil and IBM decided to work with Agile this way was impossible to me proceed working inside this project because this work methodoloy requires a face to face meetings all the time.
good,IBM is a win win situation for 4-5 years experience level employees but for graduate hires it goes a little less paid plus learning is not great in initial years.

good,IBM is my first IT company I worked with . I have learned all bout IT in IBM.It was really a big organization and cool environment to be work with.
good,Worked with many accounts.  Led knowledge transfer of work from USA to India teams so work load would be handled by global personnel.
good,IBM was a great company to work for. I was assigned to the State of Tennessee account as a Mainframe Computer Operator with a one (1) year contract. I worked the second shift from 07:00 p.m. until 07:30 a.m. on Tuesday through Saturday with every other Saturday off. My manager and co-workers were great and always there when you needed them. The hardest part of my job would have been doing my own time for the hours I worked. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work from home.

good,"I was hired by a third party , they would renew and end my contract periodically . I would be without work for a week or two before being called back for another 6 week assignment , at the same place , same position. It was very unnerving to have this happening for over a year."
good,"IBM ayuda a aprender lo que es una carrera profesional, sin embargo el crecimiento dentro de la empresa esta sujeto a mucha burocracia."
good,Enjoyed working with a friendly team and got to work with latest software. When team grew larger offshore and diminished in size in Austin it became challenging.  Flexible work environment but missed the face-time when working from home.
good,"We are located at the client site, therefore interaction with other IBMers is limited to those we directly collaborate with when dealing with issues"
good,"Good Management,"
good,Enjoyed working with IBM.  Great company with a lot of great benefits.  It was very nice to be able to work from home and successfully complete all of my tasks.  Only drawback is that they sometimes only see the forest and not the trees.

good,"Its a Very good company to work with which gives an Opportunity to work in the Area of your interest and encourages cross functional experience. However, the Annual Salary Increments are very Poor and they give least preference to the Employee needs and the Market trends"
good,"A typical at work is perfect when I have a lot of activities to do and don't have time to look to clock. I like to work under pression."
good,"Mostly worked from home or at customer site."
good,Lots of talented people who did their best for the client everyday.

good,IBM provided growth to me and everyone willing to grow and nhance their skills
good,This was a temporary position that was rewarding and exciting to work with agents in the field.
good,"Whoa... There is never a typical day at work, answering calls, solving problems, making tickets, data, typing, ect.... I went threw training at ibm learned customer service basic computer skills. My hardest day at work is when your at ground zero and your answering phones and no one is there helping you and you don't find the files to help the person with the problem. The thing I enjoy the most is the environment, its really peaceful and nice when you get to know your teammates."
good,"Good place to learn new technologies and start your career in Information technology, work with a diverse culture of striving for the best and flexible schedule. However, advancement is only available for employees, the company does have a system to recognize good contractors formally."

good,Empresa.. Com ótimo ambiente para trabalho.. Seu forte e diversidade e respeito a todos  com igualdade
good,IBM Taught me alot about upcoming technologies and strengthened the skills taught to me in school. IBM has a great work culture. I really enjoyed learning about the different technologies.
good,"Having 18 years with a company, a lot of details fade into the background. I started fresh out of technical school, and found myself challenged with a lack of knowledge; it was the classic ""they never prepared me for this."""
good,They do not have enough employees to handle workload. There is little allowance for personal time. Being called in on days off is commonplace. There appears to be no resolution on the horizon.
good,No work pressure. One gets complete work life balance. Company lacks in catering to employee benefits and compensation. Employees get very low hikes every year
good,Able to be part of a large company is very exciting. However business is quite slow and it is getting replaced by other competitors in the same space.
good,A lot of self-help learning resources that allow you to learn more about the products and services. This can be extremely helpful to learn the entire portfolio
good,"IBM is metric driven. Did you complete your education, did you work your minimum 44 hours, did you complete your monthly assessment? All of these plus a stressful project lead to a toxic environment to work at on a large project."
good,"very slow paced, requires better or easier career advancement tracking. "
good,IBM offered a lot of opportunity and I truly believe that this is one of the best company for me. Working and building relationship with different culture in different work shift with different work role is unforgettable. :)
good,Good experience working with this small organisation. Learned design & estimation of IBMS system. Good work culture & good management.  Lack of technical knowledge.
good,"Great people to work with, nice friendly enviroment with lots of encouragement to innovate. Lack of management made me choose to leave the company along with the opportuniy to work abroad and find new chagellenges."
good,Overall good work experience. Local management and team were great. There seemed to be a disconnect between team management and upper level management that made progress difficult at times. IBM as a company was very supportive of me as an employee and offered me a lot of great opportunities.
good,"the environment was good "
good,I worked for 7+ years and I have never felt that I didn't had time for my family. IBM respects each and every ones problem when it comes to famliy. I loved my role and my work was appreciated.
good,"Worked for them right out of college.  There seems to be an unbalanced focus on career advancement. For some the managers are very active in helping, others they seem to be nonchalant."
good,I worked here for very short period. Therefore i am not much aware of this company. But this has a good reputation in Global. Unfortunately for the better opportunity i quit here.
good,Was a average contract.  The rates were good.  The work was interesting.  The team was good.  But they are very budget oriented.  So renewals are limited.
good,"could be the greatest team work, but sometimes deff not. Pming, I enjoyed. location I loved, but some colleagues were awful. Some are lifelong friends"
good,"It was a tremendous experience for me because it was my first job in a huge organization. The work itself was very dull and repetitive however the atmosphere of the workplace made the time fly by quickly and pleasurably. Furthermore, I was able to complete several trainings which helped me to become more skilled in my field of study."
good,IBM is a good organisation to work with. I worked on multiple projects and learned lot more new technologies and was lucky enough to witness upgrades and transitions.
good,"Work environment is good but salary for fresher is less."
good,"Excellent Benefits, rather low salary. Management at East Lansing was excellent. My Blue Pages Manager was also the Project Manager for the 5-year assignment on which I spent most of my five and a half years at IBM."
good,"Good companies,excellent work culture, helpful staff had a great time with the mentioned companies but the only problem with IBM daksh was its transport rest all good"

good,"A cégről és az irányelveiről nem tudok dicséretet mondani."
good,"everything depend on managers,lot of politics,its good for girls and 40+ age guys"
good,"I have learned to work under pressure and mingling with team, learned management skills working under first class managers."
good,"I learned an immense amount while at IBM and I loved the people I worked with and for. It is a highly matrixed organization so it takes a long time to get anything done. The right hand never knows what the left hand is doing because plain and simple... the Company is too big and not efficient at all. IBM as a whole had lots of opportunity to learn but not advance and it seemed like every March all month long everyone was worried about their jobs. And IBM layoffs hold no boundaries, they laid off people who have been there 17 + years and only came to this area because of IBM. The biggest thing I can say is that when Ginny Rometty took over IBM as CEO, she for 3-4 quarters straight did not break a profit or help the company grow, laid off thousands of workers then gave herself a 3.25 million dollar raise. The failure starts from the top, not the bottom. If the company was not making money and laying people off... then she should have been the first one laid off and not taking  a substantial raise!! Be a leader and take responsibility for your and the companies failures."
good,"Very good place to work."
good,It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with IBM.My Colleagues are always supportive to me.
good,"This was really good company to work with gud enviornment,If i get an opportunity to work with IBM then i would really happy ."
good,"As freshers I learnt various things in IBM, from scratch to various IT field aspects. Management is helpful and advices how can we grow more in our career. With my colleagues, I got to learn how we can work as team, as in every work it is the team which completes the task, not the individual. Its nice organization to work as it provides very much flexibiltiy by providing good working culture."
good,"A typical day at work requires me to get out of bed, grab a cup of coffee and go to my upstairs office to work."
good,A brand company to start with and it prooves your ability in every area.
good,"A typical day is a  office environment behind a desk with a computer. Answer phone calls and work online, and organization of files.Long Shifts. I was able to put my Microsoft skills to use. The job was very tedious."
good,Extraordinary opportunity to network with professionals in the technology sector. It's also an amazing experience to run a business and making executive decisions.
good,"Good management, strong team member support."
good,If there is one company that allows flexible work hours its this one.
good,"Great technology, services and product offering.  Typical big corporate culture."
good,"Un dia tipico era llevarnos bien entre todos, trabajar a la par, aprendi mas sobre el compañerismo y a esforzarme dia a dia."
good,This is a very nice place & platform to learn more as a fresher and gain lot of knowledge
good,"My typical day at work includes Health check of all boxes. If any error comes, i resolve it . Do normal BAU work and the challenging work is to perform Global Mirroring on DS 8000. Tracking the error in My environment and discuss with in team and eradicate it . We celebrate the Birthday of every member in the department ."
good,Get the job done and have fun doing it. I only left this job to go back to school. I really liked it and the people who worked there there like another family. When I run into a lot of the employees even today we catch up on everything we can.
good,"the day used to start with customer inquiries with lots of recognition for appreciation.i used to love to ring the bell for good amount of appreciation from customers to managers,the seniors were more helpfull than any one at workplace with weekends party and supportive management the overall it was fun with work or work with fun."
good,"Its been a great place to learn, work, share n improve your career in a best possible ways"
good,Good Place to Work but low salaries. I absolutely adore the work culture here. People are very thoughtful. Only downside is dearth of consulting projects and low salaries.
good,A good place to work in terms of benefits. Lot of opportunity in different fields and industry. Has a wide range of training links through which you can learn new technologies. Has tie up with best online books resources - which you can avail for no cost - It is good for aspiring candidates for reference. Lot of forums around the world to reach out for issues in your field
good,"Job advancement is very hard to acomplish. Our entire department were offered jobs in another state with a weeks notice and if you didnt accept the relocation, you were laid off. "
good,"IBM has been going through a massive change for the past decade, which means there has been high turnover.  Most employees are easy to work with, very friendly and helpful. Work schedules are flexible almost all employees are required to now work from an office. No more remote work."
good,"If you are looking for a good work environment, then IBM best suits your needs. Nice work culture, vast sources to learn new things. But don't expect compensatory benefits. Don't expect hike or Variable pay or bonus."

good,"I was only an Intern so alot of the work that I did was busy work. The team did try their best to make me feel apart of what they were doing, and my manager was great. All in all it was a great experience I just wish I was able to see the outcome of the projects we worked on."
good,"IBM  supports good work-life balance and supports a very stable role."
good,Best company for fresher's and IBM itself a brand name. Management is overall good and friendly. Fresher's can learn a lot. Best part of this company is job security.
good,i had learned that time management is the key to all things in your life  because if you don't have that you  not go be able to success for the long run.
good,I have been with IBM a great number of years.  IBM has the opportunity for advancement given ability to learn.  Customer interactions were outstanding.
good,Its productive and fun place to work. Good Management. The best thing in IBM is work from home facility which helps in balancing the work and life. The only problem here is the salary hike.

good,"ayudan a construir un mejor perfil laboral,le dan capacitaciones"
good,This was a wonderful company to work for that allowed me to work from a home office for years.  There was always a fear that your job can be outsourced to overseas. Finally it was after eleven years.
good,Some times i faced huge problems and some days i will work with 24x7 also because my client will calling by midnight time then after IBM provides cab facility when my self late to logout ....
good,Company allowed us to grow professionally and had a high employee retention. Employee's would move to new positions by a promotion often.
good,"Diversified working environment. Good salary and benefits. Not very open with external recruitment, tend to recruit internally more. Professional staff. Social life at work is great, friendly and cozy."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was learning a lot from peers and embibing corporate work culture as it was my first job."
good,A competent IT professional with an expertise on IT Desktop with IBM GLOBAL ACCOUNT
good,Great people to work with. I did not work at IBM. I worked with IBM.
good,"Employees were thrown to the lions without any real training - it was left to the employees to learn the job requirements, and therefore success levels would vary greatly."
good,This was the training conducted in the last year of bachelor degree and was very helpful in placement and we got certification for that training which made us learn how projects are developed.
good,"There was a time when IBM was THE company to work for. That all changed a few years before I was hired in. But I still count my 15 years with the company as an overall positive experience. The work was hard, and I worked 7/24 365 days a year. But they eventually divested themselves of their service arm and I, along with 310,000 others, lost our jobs. It happens. No hard feelings. My last two managers were good people, and my last manager and I became good friends after I left IBM."
good,En producción estás como esclavo haciendo máquinas
good,"Manager Driven Company. IBM do have good projects, anyone can learn a lot out of it, If your manager giving you free hand to learn and do things out of the bucket then you are lucky and grab the knowledge. Else, on the other hand you will learn how to deal in such pressurized situations."
good,"I had 5 clients I supported as an Executive Administrative assistance at IBM for 9 years.  I managed their calendars, travel arrangement and expense reports.  I worked from home the last 6 years I was there."
good,"- L'environnement plutôt conviviale, tranquille et agréable pour bien apprendre"
good,"Buena empresa con oportunidades. "
good,Company provided provided initial growth potential but position was hindered by restrucuing in the US offices and GDF
good,People do care about only for the process no personal growth and even your manager is not concerned about that
good,"Many processes have many work requirement"
good,IBM peers are excellent people to work with. We share out knowledge and our experience to one another. We also helping each other when needed. The culture is not as good as expected due to outsourcing jobs oversea. The biggest problem that we all facing is the long working hours and long working week without any compensation. The most rewarding is to get the product installed to production without any errors. Make us all proud for what we design and work on.
good,"IBM is good for support projects. Good scope to learn new languages  and simultaneously will get the new opportunities across globe, its good company."
good,"Not the same company it was 5 years ago."
good,"I have been an INFRA PM for over a year, with IBM. "
good,If you just need something to get by then it will be ok... It is not a place where you would want to stay forever. There is a lot of favoritism there and brown noising...
good,"I didn't like the approach this company took towards employer contribution towards 401K plan. "
good,Overall  experience in and out the campus it was good only.But as concerned about the management there should be regular change in it.Where the management should consider its employees without any discrimination like contract and on roll.I felt ridiculous at an instance when my manager called me asked something which should not come from his mouth.
good,No longer a company who takes care of its employees. Does not care to hold on to good resources. Too much money minded people at helm. No focus on up-skilling or re-skilling the workforce.
good,"Though salary is not that competitive, I have a learned a lot from this company. Their pieces of training are of high value and they are an equal opportunity company. Career progression is possible, depending on the account."
good,Direct management wonderful to work for however do not leave your future up to upper management. Not very knowledgeable in their own industry in which led to their demise.
good,The company was alright to work for. When I had court related issues that came up there were a lot of problems with the company giving me the time off
good,"As the newbe in nix* systems I've learnt a lot in this job, from basics till advanced Power Systems administration, I'd never been where I am right now, if I haven't received enormouns help from my co-worker, who advised me during my daily tasks."
good,"O niv el de aprendizado foi ótimo, tive a oportunidade de trabalhar em outro Pais ( CHILE),"
good,"Manage the team, co-workers are very helpful along with managers."
good,"you can learn a lot, but they use in house tools that outside world don't use. The project length is longer than most other companies. They provide lots of free snacks."
good,">it was very stressful"
good,"Lots of great system engineering work, lots of opportunity to work on"
good,leadership and sales not in alignment.  Vision and investments do not align with the managements ability to execute.  Many jr managers who don't know how to manage and motivate.
good,"learnt a lot"
good,"Good place to work flex hours. "
good,"Ho trovato questa azienda troppo rigida nei suoi processi interni e molto lenta ad adeguarsi alla flessibilità richiesta dal contesto del Cliente,"
good,Flexible working time.                               Good company to learn new technology.            But salary is below average and poor management.
good,"I enjoyed working there, I learnt a lot from that company. it is a good IT company to get into. And the head office is down by the embankment. IBM as a company treat you very well."
good,"je ne prefere pas  trop faire de commentaires dans ce sens ,si vous pouvez comprendre cela"
good,"Bom lugar para trabalhar para aprender e ter experiencias, os benefícios também sao muito bons. "
good,The hardest part of the production support analyst job was working on the mainframe which was very manual and did not provide opportunity to work on software applications.
good,"We have to follow up many times to get promotion or salary hike or genuine rating from IBM management in India."
good,"It made me feel as though I was a cog in a machine that paid no attention to its cogs. I was far more productive than my teammates, but was punished for my excellence."
good,Good organisation to work without expecting a hike or onsite. Work from home is always available. better plan to join here at your retirement age. Friendly atmosphere
good,A good company to work and improve the skills as individual level and organizational level. The most flexible thing is the work from option availability.
good,IBM has so many things to sell and is terminating their most experienced sales/technical representatives.  They to not promote an environment to climb
good,"I have been working in IBM India Private Limited for 2 years and in Century Link Account."
good,Overall my experience at IBM was an Okay one until I met my one manager.  He was not a nice guy how showed no leadership abilities or the willing to help others when they needed it.  So many times I would reach out for help to this person and he would not respond in a timely manner and when he did he would not make sure I knew the material before moving on.
good,Great mentors in the company to give a proper guidance in career progression.Very flexible work hours :). It helps in a way that whenever you think you are productive then work in those hours without any pressure.
good,"Culture is such that management feels it is ok to disrespect others to get the job done, no matter the circumstances. Working for IBM looks good on the resume, hard place to work."
good,"•	Smooth inter-relation with Housekeeping & Maintenance."
good,"By far, my co-workers are the top of their respective fields.  They are always willing to educate you on a process, or knowledge."
good,"Co-workers will not mingle with team."
good,"Learned BES, GoodMobile, RSA Security, New Application Support, Mac Support, Monitoring Network, Working in a team, It is nice to work for a Large company like EnCana Gas Company, Enjoying supporting people in person and over the phone and remotely login and support using Logmein."
good,"learned about IBM softwares."
good,Busy day
good,"Otima empresa para trabalhar, ambiente de trabalho bom."
good,Need to pay more and let people advance. No room to grow and the ceiling is very low. They treat employees very terrible. Not the best company to work at.
good,"My experience at IBM afforded me the opportunity to move to many different roles throughout the company.  Some of those roles yielded positive working relationships, some, not so much.  The variation from manager to manager was very different. In my opinion, IBM needs to manage Management/Employee relations more closely.  Proper policy was not strictly adhered to either when it came down to HR.  They let me go the day after I shared with my manager that I was pregnant."
good,"Management is not good."
good,"I have learned a lot in IBM for trade finance sector. However was the work culture or management , the important thing was it always allowed me and supported me to learn more and grow."
good,"Worried more about profits than personnel "
good,It was as good as could be for the level of job responsibilities and work environment as a contractor.  At that time I was in between jobs in my profession and took it during our recession.  It was a life-saver for me at that point.
good,"Developed good business relationships at client organizations. Exciting and rewarding work were great for career growth.  Difficult travel and long work weeks.  Expectation for my billable utilization as a consultant was 96%, which I accomplished for 8 years but was let go the first time my utilization was under 90%."
good,"Horribly wonderful place to work."
good,"Arrived by 8 am worked till 3:30 pm or 4 pm. "
good,"have been working at IBM full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"No job security, basically always worrying about the next assignment, it does not matter what you know but who you know get you somewhere, no one checks out the actual assignment requirement to ensure it if is posted correctly on the internal job posting or not, placement people don't have any knowledge about any of the job, they just automatically withdraw with seeing the qualification of the individual"
good,"You will work next to geniuses, and this comes with both pros and cons, like learning crazy new things all the time, but having to deal with miserable people with no sense of social norms. The culture is miserable and although there are some execs that want to change this, there isn't enough support from the top. It is a hugely diverse culture, which is fun, and IBMers will always look out for each other. The management is generally terrible though as it is developers and engineers who have been forced into a management role and have not had adequate training or any personal passion. It is a good place to work if you work really hard but you need to understand that it is a business and the bottom line is determined in a building in New York."
good,"Effective customer service and indeed resolution."
good,"Takes trouble calls that come over the ""Brick""."
good,"The work its self was good but, In my department we had poor management decision making, creating a blame culture, a procedure based environment, where procedures were ignored when it suited. My other colleagues and the customers were the best part of the job."
good,"A gerência não entende seus funcionários, que não tem prazer em trabalhar."
good,"company has no continuing training program and no process to backfill vacated positions.  There is no longer consideration for assisting employees with placement within IBM when the employees current position is deleted from the company."
good,If you are career oriented IBM is the place. If you are looking for good pay I am sorry you wont recommend IBM because you may join IBM with a good hike from your old company but you wont get big hikes in IBM.
good,"Excellent working place, Login time was at 1:00 p.m and log out at 10:00.p.m.  That was the only issue."
good,"Average team. Few great people rest below average."
good,"Decent company to work for perks include 21 days vacation time, and work at home opportunities. Daily tasks included presenting data, correlating events, and consulting on customer environments."
good,"It was mix, support was good. RM was supportive. But they give less salary benefits and Employee engagement is not availble"
good,Was there for many years.  There were changes in the industry and we did not adapt well or well enough for more people to benifit.
good,"Disconnect between Exec's and Contractor"
good,"IBM is a great employer. I have  nothing but great things to say about them. Worklife balance is very good, the ability to reinvent yourself by moving around the company is fantastic,."
good,"My work helps me develop my knowledge base, it is a brain-stimulant because of the many challenges that I tackle at work and It gives me a sense of achievement at the end of the day of course, the money that it offers."
good,Packed makeup into customer’s boxes.  Maintain a clean and safe work environment. Customer-focused and solution oriented.
good,"Work at IBM is never boring.  It is constantly changing and evolving.  The company is always in Beta, every changing and responding to the technology and advancements that are happening very quickly. The company is very large and is only a good place to work if you are confident in your skills, are proactive in pursing your career goals, and are willing to work long hours to not only do the job, but often times to learn the new skills required to do it at the same time."
good,Worked with a new vertical in IBM with a view of working with a global leader under the impression of better culture and HR policies but found just the opposite where the organization is mostly manager driven with very less intervention of HR system in case of any problem related to work etc. Enjoyed meeting industry leaders to guide the way as I joined a new industry to generate ideas.
good,"Consolidation, downsizing, and moving jobs abroad have been a major contribution to why IBM is failing.  I loved my job in the early days and had a wonderful rapport with my colleagues.  It came to a point in my later years that IBM forgot about family and I was working a 24x7 work year.  I was compensated for my dedication by being laid off in 2002."
good,"Overall it is good place to work. With good work life balance."
good,Never quite fit in with the veterans of my area. And was never allow to. This position was never going to work out from the start.
good,"i have enjoyed my tenure here so far, yes few thinks like too much cost cutting on transport and events"
good,IBM is very flexible which can allow you to work from home or finish your task at night. Most of the project managers day would go in meetings and presenting status. I learned a lot at IBM on how to communicate with executives.
good,"Normal work space, good thing is work from home facility."
good,"They won't promote within, and train employees to advance in the company."
good,"Never knew when layoffs were coming but knew they were happening every 6 months."
good,"As with all other mega-corporations, it can sometimes be hard to make personal contact with others, especially if you're working from home, or working remotely."
good,"IT Project Manager fro software development and production support enhancements  with domestic and global  team members. "
good,"While the establishment was nice, the positions pay well, and the overall customer service expectations were outstanding, the relationship between management and call center staff was horrid. No respect for illness, emergency, or even someone being hurt on the job. Only thing that mattered to management was numbers and statistics, as with many call centers, but at the cost of the staff morale and integrity."
good,It was a nice working experience working. I have learnt a lot in the project I worked. The client was challenging. The management provided support to a great extent.
good,my first day when i start claim processing
good,Great place to work. With such an old company it's difficult to avoid stagnant managers.
good,"Working for IBM is nice in some ways, but unless you are a Senior level programmer or designer, you will have little chance of getting ahead. I worked in the call center for a temp company, and if you are looking at the campus in Boulder, there is a 90% chance that is where you will be working. The pay is decent, but the drive is long if you aren't in Longmont, there are no benefits of any kind, and the job security is decent if you just show up. The people are nice and the jobs are mostly simple for the wage, but you will kill your car with mileage and burn up gas money if you don't live very close to Gunbarrel."
good,"Os benefícios são excelentes."
good,The Management of IBM is good but if we talk about promotions and parties there is zero funding provided by IBM. No space/utilities for extra curricular activities.
good,Good place to work and great learning opportunities. IBM has good devices and strict process before devices go live. It was a good experience working with IBM and other team members.
good,It used to be a good company to work for But now they are going downhill. Not keeping qualified train people. They just don’t care about their employees anymore.
good,entreprise ameriquaine avec ces bons et mauvais choix
good,"IBM used to be a wonderful company to work for, but the corporate culture has taken a turn for the worse.  It's too bad.  I hope that they can recognize this to make changes"
good,"When I first started, IBM was great, but you will never get paid a lot. You have to leave and then come back in order to get a decent salary, which sucks."
good,"Several Meetings daily"
good,Worked with some very knowledge people with great skills in the sector.  The team and people are ready to share knowledge and help each other to succeed.
good,"A place of opportunity for chosen individuals. I am working as a contractor so i honestly can't have a solid or valid opinion of IBM. I did however, enjoy working here."
good,"Most recently part of a huge RA layoff.  "
good,"Overall, the job experience was great for understanding the basic call center environments. However, we had lack of structure and poor management from a front line to a manager level. The pay did not compete with any other position in the company. No room for advancement, and lacked integrity."
good,Nice place to work a lot to learn advanced Technologies friendly people good team building strategies friendly teammates flexible timings grade understanding between things
good,"Innovative company, interesting work, good benefits, sub standard wages, no advancement. Good culture, rewarding volunteer opportunities. Inconsistent management"
good,"Productive and good place to work.  Management was good but they were often transferred to other accounts thus hurting your chances for promotion. By the time you build a relationship with them, they were gone."
good,"They let a lot of their employees go and gave their positions to workers in India, for a fraction of the salary in Toronto. They do not care if you have a family."
good,IBM has changed far too much over the past 20 years of my career.  Work/Life balance is non-existent in most cases.  Continued off-shoring of jobs and unskilled hires has made those of us with experience a rarity.  This company can not continue to be successful with the current practices.
good,Work load is intended to be shared over all technicians per shift but is generally the burden of the high-performers to carry the team and bulk without any recognition. The lower performing technicians are coddled and not pushed into working harder. Training is not provided beyond the most basic use of the home-grown ticketing system. They have the really neat outlook that if you do better than the others you get to also do their jobs without any compensation but you're not able to pull back without management coming down on you for 'slacking' or 'not being a team player'.
good,"IBM is in a major transition.  Because of this there is tremendous pressure to hit sales targets and quotas.  To the point where  there is an imbalance between job satisfaction and responsibilities,"
good,"IBM is a very good company no doubt.  Very unstable in regards to ""true"" job security.  Very poor management, too many silos and way too many processes to get work done."
good,"You will always be busy and proud of the work you do. Management may not recognize that nor reward you for it, but a perk is being able to work from home most of the time."
good,"Although a respected name and on the cutting edge, there is no job security as they frequently lay off staff.  They acquire many companies and tend to leave them behind when the next technology comes around."
good,Moving from a small company to IBM was a culture shock. There are many processes and many people to get through to be successful. The on-boarding process could have been better.
good,"Great folks but many are leaving due to changes in leadership and technology.  The workplace culture overall still good, there's smart caring people there, I just wish sr mgmt would've been better."
good,IBM es una buena empresa para el area de desarrollo.
good,"I found that the vast majority of team members are solid, and are eager to collaborate across functions and product areas.  First line and second line management are engaged and helpful.  The big picture strategy is communicated well by the company, but not how it pertains to the individual employee.   You can be doing your job well, and contributing, yet still find that your employment is terminated.  A lot of training is available but you must actively pursue it and block out personal time to complete it.  It is difficult to re-invent such a large company, and it is easy for good employees to become a casualties.  It has become stressful in that everyone is concerned about the stability of their own job."
good,"Typical work day was 12 to 24 hours long. I learned a lot about consulting on a large global scale. Hardest part of the job was the amount of travel and the long hours worked while deployed. Although they were under a great deal of pressure, Management was very poor and left a lot to be desired. Most enjoyable part was working directly with very talented and intelligent colleagues, on some very interesting and challenging projects."
good,it was a productive workplace and some areas was fast pace. I enjoyed the job because the managers cared about the employees. the commission was great.
good,"good company to work"
good,"Not much agree with the team I was into. but learned few things, how to judge the people, learned on excel usage, data management, interaction with the people."
good,"Management doesn't have defined policies for employees, its managers to define  policy"
good,Good learning in IBM. I have learnt IT culture. Hardest part was to learning new things in IBM Eg- Servers and technical part of it.MOst enjoying part of the job is learning new things in IBM Eg- Servers and technical part of it.
good,"Working for companies like IBM can be challenging. They, like other companies of their size, don't really know the staff that work for them. The work/life balance is stressed as something we should strive for in our live, however when approached with situations that is the last thing they want to do. "
good,i love this company because i am given a little understanding between the cultural differences of filipinos and arab nationals because my boss came from uae.
good,It was a good experience working with IBM. The salary growth is not good in IBM but we have flexibility to work from home. The managers which I have met have become the victim of situation in IBM India. They are even struggling to give hike because of earning max profit from client.
good,"Once upon a time IBM was known for ""Respect for the individual"" but over the years they lost that meaning and poor results "
good,It's an OK job but I had to do hectic work and I had to work very efficiently every time which made me very much tired and took lot of Time to get managed and it made me learn a lot about a job and had much knowledge in the particular field the most enjoyable about the job was very interesting as it needed my whole concentration and nice and a healthy atmosphere with all my collegeues
good,IBM is not a stable environment because of  the financial and business challenges.  IBM has a nice Work Life Balance but you have to take into consideration that there is little stability in your job role.
good,"Gestione Client utenti (Windows ed Apple)"
good,"Advance Project"
good,IBM is transforming itself into a Cognitive Company build on Cloud.  It is an exciting company to work for.  The company is valuing skills and not necessarily experiences.  It would benefit the company to have a balance of new skills with experience
good,"Doing 24X7 shift to provide employee transport ."
good,"Empresa com oportunidade de aprendizado, porem sem tempo para estudar, pois há muita pressão e muitas cobranças por atividades técnicas e não tecnicas"
good,"I have worked with IBM being my first BPO. I "
good,"At the start of this job things were good. Gradually each year you had benefits removed, expenses removed, bonuses stopped, health care costs sky rocketed, advancement chances were practically null."
good,Love my co-workers and my job there they were all respectfull an kind. One of the best Jobs in ever had wish they never down sized. They let us take lengthy breaks.
good,"When a company is making billions every quarter and still pay the online factory workers $12.00 per hour, when we should have been paid in the $15-20.00 range. You could never go to HR and make a complaint about anything without getting lashed out by the Management Team."
good,This employment was not the most enjoyable job. I had no chance for growth within the company. There was no challenges for me to advance my skills within the work place. It was a steady job that provided me with  Monday-Friday 9-5 employment.
good,Empresa que oferece uma ótima experiência no trabalho em equipe.
good,"A great place to learn/hone skills. As a contractor, there are limited/no benefits, no paid days off, no paid holidays...overall, the benefits are as good as non existent. Can learn many things here, but not a place to spend a career. A great place to gain valuable skills and experience. A great job for someone out of highschool, or someone looking for temporary work."
good,While there are numerous advantages inside this company it sometimes is fraught with challenges. Staffing decisions directed by earnings reports and Wall Street expectations.
good,"Grande azienda multinazionale ,leader nel mkt IT, che permette di fare molte e diversificate esperienze sia a livello nazionale che internazionale ."
good,It's very good working environment and I enjoy most of my time here with IBM. The co-worker are very helpful and cooperative here.
good,"I actually worked through a Contracting company call CCI (Career Connections Inc). IBM contracts out to CCI and Kelly services, however we're semi IBM employees with some benefits. The atmosphere however is very...you'll be gone in a few months anyways I don't care. It's sad because they don't work to great with scheduling and tend to leave it to CCI which, they don't really work with you at all on it and tend to just push you aside."
good,good place to work but not at a entry level. Once you join a mid level management place best place to stay. More and more exposure to controls and good platform.
good,"Testing, IBM is a good company to work with. Advantage: Flexible, Work Life Balance."
good,"Job culture is good but there is no job security for contractor. They fire contractor at any time without prior inform but we can learn lot of thing such as process, communication, presentation skills and much more."
good,I learned a lot for the past 12 years in IBM. I enjoyed working with most of the people around me. The hardest part is I heard people leaving. I like to work with people around the Global.
good,"An excellent company to start your career. It is an ocean of knowledge. If you have the inclination to learn, then only sky will be the limit. The co workers are really very helpful. The best thing about the company is self learning mode."
good,"This company have lots to learn and the work load is very high."
good,"I was in a global department providing security services to US and International clients. A typical day is extremely high pace and demanding. It is an in office open cubicle environment so team interaction happens all day. The hardest part about the job is the high volume of clients and their daily tasks ranging from high severity issues, projects, to business as usual. It is never slow, and the amount of people on the team do not add up to the workload. This is challenging, but rewarding for skills in the end."
good,"Assist customers with secured and unsecured loans. "
good,"Uma emprea sólida, porém com um plano de carreira baseado em avaliações gerenciais muitas vezes subjetivas. A remuneração está abaixo do mercado, porém, o pacote de beneficios é muito bom."

good,"Excellent environment and peaceful."
good,"Bilingual / Tech support/Customer Service Agent"
good,Work wise it is very good but need to deal with other consulting company which is very efficient and with high team work.  Client is a bit tricky and the project is more political than functional.
good,"Culture has changed considerably since I joined the company in 1978. Respect for the individual, loyalty, etc. not what it used to be"
good,"Muitas informações podem ser adquiridas através de treinamentos e/ou workshops disponibilizados pelo empresa."
good,"Gostava de trabalhar, tinha muitos treinamentos, aprendi muito."
good,After 16 years... they have no problems laying you off.... Lay off will come eventually... you day will come sooner or later
good,"Enjoyed my time with IBM, wish I could have stayed there when they downsized in 2001"
good,"Very Bureaucratic nature within the company. The pay is under what the market is paying. You are encourage to transfer within the company, but doing so is next to impossible. They tell you when you are hired you will be working overtime, that was a lie. The management has little or no idea what you do. A lot of accounts are frustrated with the GDF model."
good,"Most days at IBM Batch Operation department were routine monitoring of batch computer job streams and performing job restarts on failed jobs. The none routine events were periods of madness due to system problems or scheduling issues which caused multiple job failures and entailed contacting on call support reps all over the country or world. I learned to handle stressful situations with ease and composure. I also learned to operate several scheduling packages and make jcl changes or repairs to production programs. I worked with a very knowledgeable group of people who were skilled at what they did. The hardest part of the job was dealing with users and support staff when I woke them up at 3 or 4 in the morning to effect repairs to their applications. The most enjoyable part was meeting the scheduled deadlines for job streams that had given me trouble with job failures, and the gratitude that the client sometime expressed for my efforts."
good,Assist field service technicians with technical support in a call center environment via phone.
good,This place has thought me a lot. Working under pressure. Made me realise what sense of achievement was when you take a rist and get it right. Great place to learn.
good,"Very Nice Building in Markham, ON and a professional enviroment."
good,Lot of opportunities early in your career but those tend to be fewer as you get older then you tend to feel less valuable and are a target for layoffs even when you have great skills
good,"ERP implementations/support engagements are stressful (more so since past 2-3 years). Earlier, the management was better however now due to market pressures, this is being felt in deliverance of projects."
good,I won't return any time soon.  I spent the week trying to get acclimated and getting properly set up to work and had slow response and no contact with my immediate supervisor.
good,"I was working for the GPS vertical. We were not allowed to take-offs, also we were not allowed any holidays. That was a bit sad. Also, I had 13+ years of experience and joined at an entry-level. Probably that added to my agony"
good,"I was thrilled when I got hired at IBM in 2010. The culture has changed a lot since then. "
good,"Giant company with a constantly changing org chart. It's almost impossible to know where you are in the overall company structure. "
good,"The work was great and tough, but no paid holidays and vacation days and no paid sick days. Also no medical benefits. I also wish management would understand everyone needs medical benefits and true paid opportunities with sick days and holiday days and paid vacation days"
good,"no comment at this stage, this is not required from me at this point in time"
good,"Worked as middleware admin and learn so many things during my tenure in IBM,Team was encouraging and supportive during my tenure in IBM"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, pocas oportunidades de crecimiento fue mi primer trabajo en la rama de la electronica no me gusto estar contratado por la agencia son muy poco accesibles."
good,Good place to work - to learn how to grow a channel partner program and drive revenue through other sources. Long hours at the end of quarter and year.
good,IBM is a great company that still has some loyal customers.  You can cross-sell and upsell easily as it's always acquiring customers.  If you're young - there are many opportunities abound as ageism is quite prevalent.
good,"The ability to work from home was good. Team-wise, there was a good culture of helping each other. "
good,"I faced poor career growth and also ther is no Work life and personal life balance.many managers does not follow orgnisation guidelines, insted they trying to impose there own."
good,"Unfortunately, the Sales teams tends to over sell and support teams have hard time delivering services to their customers. Good collaborative team work amongst the support teams when services need to be delivered in a timely manner."
good,I worked from home so I did not see much of the culture of the company.  I got the feeling that there was no chance for advancement if you were not working at one of the IBM centers.
good,"Empresa que coloca o serviço e seus clientes em primeiro lugar, deixando a desejar na remuneração de salários compatíveis com a função."
good,"When I left IBM, I did it for a 50% pay increase. They offered me 25% to stay. Of course, I rejected the offer. It was a good place to work. Too bad it didn't pay well enough."
good,"Muitas possibilidades em trabalhar em funções além de suas atribuições, porém com pouco reconhecimento."
good,"I worked on the migration project and worked on some of the new versions and migrated  the jobs. the management was very cooperative and the work culture is good in IBM and the hardest part is having regular meetings on daily basis."
good,"It is the good place to work for fresher you can learn multiple skills "
good,"Great company if you come in through the right avenue, If your looking for promotion and movement, stay well outside of IBM GTS arm."
good,"If you want a casual job that let's you have a simple job with decent pay, work here."
good,"The potential for greatness does exit her, but it will take time to truly manifest. Company struggles with its own corporate culture and lots of internal politics competing with client interests. Very siloed and burdened down by (often antiquated) processes. This has led to lack of agility and competitive losses in several key areas as the company tries to re-invent itself. It is possible to navigate and get things done, but it takes significant time to learn and understand how to operate within more informal channels to accomplish this. Further, there is a significant push to modernize the culture and processes within. It will take time to complete (some of the ""old guard"" will likely have to exit as a part of this), but if successful, they could again become a very formidable competitor and undisputed industry leader for many years to come."
good,IBM is good place to work. I like the work culture and respect to the individual. A true IBM manager will always support his/her peers well. Gives all the required support to maintain work life balance.
good,"Good company to work"
good,"Mobile team because of all the traveling it was a work from home position. The flexibility to dictate your own schedule a great plus. Internal resources not bad, Co-workers tend to help where they can."
good,Verygood work culture and Lex application is very helpful in learning the latest technologies on the go. Good work life balance for employees. Good in WFH.
good,Good  Experience large legacy companyEnjoy the assignments travel good challenges and flexibility definitely see myself returning in the future. Was happy to be part of big blue.
good,"It seems at times IBM supports partner firms while at other times they directly compete against them. The partner firms typically are the first line of contact with customers and out of necessity are driven to be highly responsive - while IBM's huge wheels take a long time to start turning."
good,PM outsourcing and sell off to ATT caused issues.  I loved working for IBM and the people were great.  Most were professionals.  Worked with my clients to deliver all types of IT projects and found many strong professionals
good,Es dificil que te de den la planta aun con promesas y sirve cuando eres foraneo y planeas hacer mucho Home Office
good,"Working with IBM was always learning with lots of new roles and responsibilities."
good,"Company has declined much since my employment, due to struggling financial situation.  I enjoyed my time there, but was not employed permanently only as a contractor."
good,During my work at IBM i got to meet different cultures and people. Also got to learn new things and get experience about IT in a bit corporation like IBM.
good,The wok it self is interesting. The benefits are really good. The management could use some improvement. On the job training could use some improvement. The commute to work is not bad either.
good,A good place to work as long as you could be kept billable to external clients. Opportunities to travel should you like it.
good,"All the companies I worked for had a nice environment. Management was always there to support you in any way possible. I also like the comradery. There was lots of oppertunities to further your carreer. Courses was made available. What frustrated me was sometimes you need to go through to much REDTAPE to get what you want. A typical day would consist of Planning for the day, continue on current projects, normal BAU and any emergency or sev 1 problems."
good,"IBM provides a place with lots of learning opportunities, great benefits and a good work/life balance. Unfortunately no one seems to know the direction of the company and management does not inspire the type of confidence one would expect for a company that size. It certainly needs to get significantly smaller and nimble in order to compete."
good,"Apesar de ser muito presa a processos, possui muitos profissionais competentes e dispostos a ajudar na realização dos trabalhos"
good,Shifting schedules and learns securities on vendors. The management was not primary. The hardest part of  my jobs was escalation avoidance.  Housekeeping works overloaded because thats the agreement target of third party and they called it performance base. Imagine the housekeeping working for IBM was not satisfied on their situation because they feel insecure the way how the facility management handles them. Its about value of diligence.
good,"nice place to work if you want flexibility, the company as a whole is mismanaged and seems to hemorrhage money bad. IBM over pays for companies they buy and doesn't know how to run them after. The one great thing about IBM is the work from home and the flexibility they give you. Other than that its unfortunately not a company you can retire at they will do layoffs every Feb of the year they call it right sizing. If you survive the layoffs once a year there is a good chance they will sell you division like they did with Lotus and Rational etc.. all of which they payed big money for and just mis managed until they sold them."
good,Nothing I need to share - Company is good for those who enjoy it and its not good for those who don't enjoy it. Not sure why this is required just to setup an account
good,"Good for female employees. Work life balance for women employees."
good,No dan oportunidad de crecimiento laboral vacantes muy pocas para la cantidad de personal con la que se cuenta
good,"Work Culture Good , but poor management , No career growth "
good,"IBM will train you and hire you for a position but do not expect you will definitely do that for them. I felt like I was a ""Front"" for the off-shore team. I basically did no real code, just fix off-shore's errors. IBM was good at training though and a great place right out of college. Just don't plan on making it a career."
good,"Provide employment to contractors because no one likes to have temporary positions."
good,"IBM was a school for me, I learned many things beyond culture, company politics and more. It was a good learning curve for my career. The bad part for me was when they changed the project manager and we did not have a good impression on the person. But nothing to complain about, people who are social with everyone."
good,Watson Health was over aggressive in their expansion by buying too many companies at once. Now that the dust has settled and sales are not what they expected they are having to lay people off.
good,IBM is one of the big MNC's and a good place to start a career. It provides a good platform to work and learn the different work culture and cement a place in the business.
good,IBM Canada offered the opportunity to obtain Canadian experience after migrating as I was already familiar with the work culture having previously worked in IBM.
good,"In my role as a Change Manager / Critical Incident Manager, it was very busy. "
good,"Good company to work to maintain balance in work n life."
good,This company support you to do productive work and company recognizes your effort towards your job and based on your performance they give best opportunity to develop your self in company
good,"While I was paid fairly, most of the job was very boring.  There were very repetitive tasks.  I would be told to do something and then nobody would ever look at it.  People were always too busy to help you with anything."
good,"A typical day at work involves forecasting incidents, analysis on Incident , change & problem.Creating reduction and improvement plan for the clients & reviewing them to drive towards the goal"
good,"pro"
good,"- IBM has a variety of roles to offer"
good,"We would receive calls from electronic consumers about their electronics haveing issues. We would perform basic troubleshooting with them, and advise on where to repair if their item needed it."
good,"IBM is the definition of corporate America - much bureaucracy, good advancement potential. Terrific capability to join strong team of consultants driving technology."
good,"Accurately maintaining of proper accounts in a correct manner can give great confidence to the company, to make sure the accounting procedures and other processes are taken out smoothly, should find accounting issues, analyze and interpret the data and provide customized financial reports to the company. Ability to deliver results within scheduled time and maintain confidentiality of clients"
good,"There was a company wide mandate for local collaboration. However this was interpreted to mean coming into the office daily regardless of necessity, and majority of remote work was no longer allowed."
good,"Flexi work types (wfh), no free food or beverages. Supportive team members, good managers. Freshers received training on products before joining which were very good till date."
good,"It is good working at IBM."
good,"Done migration for one of there client, which is RBC and Scotia bank. Lots of pilot project to go and learned a lot. Lots of traveling and you can meet plenty of knowledge people."
good,"The role is good for a starter looking to get into IT.  After 8 months or so most of the issues and fixes will be known to you, if you are technicaly minded."
good,But not a best place to continuously strive for excellence and growth in career. Need to learn skills from outside the company as the scope is very narrow.
good,"With a employee flexi benefits every thing is fine except certain managers."
good,"Partea pozitiva in acest moment este ca am un loc de munca lejer, insa nu imi ofera nici o provocare in plan profesional."
good,"Hard to advance.  Very competitive internal environment.  Good culture of learning so there are great opportunities to learn.  However, compensation is relatively uncompetitive  relative to the industry."
good,"Overall IBM is better than many companies in the world but have several management issues in MEA area, we are working hard to accomplish projects in hard times with hard terms"
good,"IBM has evolved into a premiere software and cloud services company, We have learned to adjust to the client's focus. Industry based territory alignment"
good,"As the team leader of my consultancy group, it was my role to communicate with our client and within our team as well as prepare the business case and presentation materials."
good,"my job in IBM IBS is not a typical kind of work, we report  12 mn til 9am, our day off is tuesday and wednesday. you cannot bring food, celphone, ballpen or paper inside, candies are allowed  but are the ones wrapped in pillow packs. your workstations  and the whole operations section is surrounded by more than 50 cctv's and at least 5-10 motion detectors. i learned a lot regarding cyber security and confidentiality of the information inside the secure room because of the nature of the job. my co workers are kind and friendly, most them the serious type, the hardest part is the schedule because you are working late at night and its hard to get a sleep specially in the morning and during summer. the most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to catch a fraudulent transaction."
good,"it was good working at IBM.It was my second company and i worked on Separations, Full and final settlement and reconciliation."
good,i was in ibm is very difficult to servay in the jobs.it nice to share all technical issues.every things are going good management is different.
good,"es muy buena empresa solo que no hay posibilidades de crecer ya que no hay muchas vacantes, en fin gracias a FOXCONN he aprendido muchas cosas principalmente linux"
good,It is a proud feeling to be part of the international IBM brand. Very mature process. IBM as a global company is highly competitive and innovative organization. Poor management initiatives. Not employee friendly.
good,"Good company to work but less job security in these days."
good,"Although IBM needs to work on management, employee compensation, and treat their employees better, the experience and work ethic of the employees has to be recognized!"
good,A typical week comprises of 12 hours travel and 50+ hours of client work. No Work/ Life balance. The Management does not reward folks who work very hard to do the right thing to the Client

good,Work at IBM has made more more confident of tackling critical issues and delivering results in short time.It has been challenging and has helped me progress and undertake tougher challenges
good,Day would start with a quick meeting to get caught up with what is going on and the production/maintenance priorities.  Co-workers were helpful in learning new things.
good,"Empresa dinâmica onde o funcionário precisa ser flexível e acompanhar o ritmo da empresa que oscila conforme demanda."
good,"IBM has a high starting salary for developers ($70K) but it offers very little raise and bonuses (if any) even if you are promoted."
good,Boa empresa para crescer profissionalmente mas muito exigente.
good,"Excellent work experience, but very little work/life balance. Was hired as long term contractor with 0% chance of going FT permanent. IBM outsources most positions and eliminates positions quickly, based on current business needs. Employees are rarely offered the option to transfer. I did like that my job schedule was flexible within reason."
good,"Lateral reporting structures ensures a significant level of responsibilities oversight but can be cumbersome when quick decisions are necessary.  The company's culture has been damaged by it somewhat because there is no turnover of the senior ranks as a lot of the executive team are lifers."
good,"When I first Started working at IBM/Burnham Services I was a Receptionist for the Parts Department that was connected to the main parts warehouse. Not only was it my responsibility to take and route calls for Engineers and Staff, but it was also my job to file and scan weekly sales reports, email other Parts warehouses nationwide and schedule weekly meetings with IBM Personnel. I was Promoted to Parts Coordinator in just over 4 months."
good,Employees work as a team.  Everyone works together to keep the customer happy.  Mid managers can be overbearing and very short-sided.

good,"unstable environment and limited advancement opportunities along with job advancement;"
good,"There is a tendency working at IBM to feel like one is being under-trained somewhat. A worker has to spend lots of time self training."
good,"Did not mind being responsible and accomplishing what was required of me, especially when reviews at year end were great."

good,It is a really good place to work.Employee flexibilty is given.We can learn many things.
good,I am working has a Citrix L3 support for US project and I am very good technical works
good,"Empresa super Dinamica , com processos consolidados que me proporcionou momentos muito bacanas,  Aprendi muito com seus processos. O senso de equipe era muito bom, que ficou um pouco comprometido com algumas mudanças ocorridas no período, mas tenho muito a agradecer a IBM pelo periodo que passei lá.."
good,"End to end recruitment"
good,1) They are serious about working. They have a horrible system to input your working hours. Management was okay.

good,"Abundant resources"
good,"The project is very structured with too many processes in the control of the employee. There is a tool just to put what are you doing. "
good,Don't want to make any comments. Have enjoyed my work and the GFT is very supportive and holds positive relations.
good,"O único problema que encontrei na IBM, foi por ela possuir uma classe hierárquica muito forte, onde muitas vezes gerentes ou supervisores não se sentiam na obrigação de ajudar, isso na minha área, sendo que em outras, conheci colegas onde supervisores e gerentes ajudavam e conversavam com os analistas, foi ai que reparei que era do pessoal de cada um, na minha operação não ajudavam, você sente falta de uma motivação, era apenas cobranças, onde cada um queria fazer sua parte e nada mais, porém os analistas são peças fundamentais para que os supervisores e gerentes tenham o prazo e metas cumpridas."
good,Al trabajar en IBM se desafían tus conocimientos y las ganas de buscar nuevas oportunidades.
good,"I have rcvd 5 RNR awards for best quality in our team"
good,IBM was a fun place to work for until about 4 years ago. It seemed the business was shifting away from hardware development and embedded products to focus more on its software services side of the business. What I enjoyed most was my co-workers. They were always great to work with and were some of the smartest and kindest people I have ever known.
good,"What can you say about big blue, they have some of the best business processes in the world.  Their philosophy is that there is no new money just new buckets to put the money in."

good,"My work was completely typical..Start time and end time had to be as per the schedule..Had great time during breaks but while working, it was not that enjoyable."
good,"IBM has a track record of successful growth and IT consulting dominance.  The consulting capabilities of IBM are unmatched in the industry.  IBM is able to take a company from the inception of a strategy through to the long term outsourcing of an instantiated strategy.  With the ability to provide consulting, hardware, and software IBM can solve virtually any client issue."
good,"A typical day at work is to support in delivering the HR policy & benefit to all staff members at the 3 locations in Vietnam. I've learned more about the matrix management, HR procedures and process, policy."
good,*As tarefas do dia normalmente já ficavam meio programadas. Mas na maioria das vezes existiam imprevistos para serem resolvidos de ultima hora por estar trabalhando diretamente no cliente.
good,"Empresa com um alto número de funcionários, muito bom para poder adquirir networking e aprender com os colegas de trabalho."

good,Good opportunity to interact with international divisions and executives.
good,"Couldn't say enough good things about working with IBM but as with any major corporation there are some things I did not agree with, but I managed to work with them and enjoyed my time working with IBM"
good,They offer you good salary when hired and after that annual compensation is peanuts. It's manager rule company as most of people have spend ages in IBM.
good,"Pros"
good,"Worked for IBM just shy of 20 years as a regular employee.  Worked normal business hours but also on weekend on off shift change windows in the middle of the night and 24x7 on call support. When I started with IBM my department had a lot of members that supported their own external accounts.  Over the years we automated manual tasks and people retired or moved on to different roles.  Department head count shrunk over the years causing remaining members to pick up the workload.  Older members who could retired did.  The department then received new members from Brazil, India, and China.  Was required to train the new member.  After many months of training and documenting every thing for my duties I was told I was no longer needed."
good,"I have been working at IBM full-time for more than 4 years"
good,Was able to work from home and when in the office worked in a relaxed environment. Work effort was collaborative. Worked with a great team of employees.
good,"It's the best among all the MNCs in india,And the best thing over here is you will get a wfh flexibility and you can maintain work life balance as comparing to some other companies here the pay is not that high for freshers but for experienced they'll pay like anything,there is a huge discrimination between new comers and experienced in IBM, especially between contractors and permanent pay roll candidates"
good,"I resent this bullying to extract information. Want do your really want? Words, words, words. I cannot philosophize about current state. It was once a great company, but suffering for years with lackluster, embarrassing performance."
good,"Good experience in a technology firm. Opportunity to work on holistic solutions with real impact on organisations and society."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"IBM offers many opportunities to grow by moving different roles and divisions.  Practices are contemporary and sophisticated, however, expense controls related to the employee experience impact the corporate culture."
good,"Taking calls and helping various clients with computer issues. Lots of different clients, with enormous databases for technical support. Training wasn't great. Often left alone when having questions."
good,"IBM continually changes. You have to proactively make the most out of it or become a commodity. "
good,"a place of boredom and political."
good,"Fortunate enough to work with a great project team.  At the start of each day we reviewed what we wanted to accomplish (objectives). We identified the things that we were lacking and the remedies of same. There was always a very willing, can-do attitude which was pervasive, as a team.  A truly unique experience which I will not forget."
good,I gained knowledge and good experience by working with the company. One will have novice experience altogether. My company being the reputed brand renders lots of learning opportunities and lays out right platform for aspiring professionals.
good,"En la empresa llegas con tiempo para prepararte a trabajar, una vez estando en el puesto de trabajo empiezas a realizar y a ver cuales son las prioridades del día, el trabajo fue temporal."
good,IBM has vast presence globally and few years back it was one of the Top fav company to work for. Big company has its challenges and getting in was the most difficult part. Mixed leadership where some are very good for people and project mgmt perspective. Some I have encountered in IBM as a dictator who don't even know how to speak in a large forum and just bully the team being in top level.
good,"Long-time IBMers don't like professionals coming from the market, even worst if taking high-level jobs (band 9 and above)."
good,"The experience  have the value whereas skills and talent have no value in IBM, as well the growth is on the base on seniority even though that person is not working he has growth. The person can't raise their talent in front of seniors they will be make the shut down. Salary is very low compare to other companies, tenurity exceeds but no promotion's."
good,The technical team I worked with was excellent.  Management was spotty at best.   Advancement was difficult.  A lot of promises that were never met and a lack of communication hampered promostions
good,"Time management is crucial, creative problem solving essential. I did not experience the true work culture as I was contract through temporary agency."
good,"Best company culture to work for.  It is process driven, and does indeed make efforts to propagate that type of successful mindset to it employees. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"IBM is a well known company to businesses and governments, but not so much to young graduates, IBM doesn't seem to care about attraction and retention of foreign employees."
good,Be prepared to pivot  the company is in a state of influx and people need to be prepared for influx this is a good company and an old company and sometimes it behaves that way..
good,Be prepared to work hard and stay competitive and you will be rewarded with rich experience. Be able to adapt to global and multi-tiered organization.
good,IBM WH is a good place to work if you like a challenging and fast paced environment and are a self-starter/independent worker.  It is nice that you are able to work from home sometimes.  Compensation could be better as could advancement opportunities.
good,"Good work culture overall with supportive teams, but plagued with management problems, including budget cuts leading to increased workloads and minimal pay increments."
good,IBM is for working professionals who are looking for stability. In IBM you can look to exceed in our current role but enhancement to new avenues is tough here.
good,Good company for freshers to start. Best opportunity to learn emerging technologies. You will gain good hands on experience and which surely gona help you in future.
good,"When I started at IBM 25+ years ago, the employee was highly valued and there was great focus on work life balance.   Over the past 10 years I have seen a decline in that type of environment.  Resource actions have resulted in major shortages of employees to perform the number of activities required day to day.  Moral has declined. And the recent change mandatory co-location (work in the office) has put a strain on work life balance."
good,First time employed by IBM was better.  The 2nd time employed at IBM was not as good as the work I was hired for they were in the process of trying to win via a contract bid.  If I was told that in the first place I wouldn't have gone there to work.
good,"I truly enjoyed the work, the people, the constant challenge.  I was isolated from IBM with no direct management so it's difficult to judge the true IBM environment."
good,"i have learned to always stay focus and complete the work at hand, IBM overall is easy to work with but some of their contracted companies are just not that well to me in terms of work."
good,"Being promoted to a management position would mean that I would end up with a lower salary.  The best experience you could get, but others will pay more for the same work.  From what I could see almost double."
good,Loved this job but ultimately there was no future. I was on a 5 year contract and after the contract was over there was no future with IBM. Great work environment and was able to work from home on occasion.
good,IBM is a leader in many areas of technology. The sales and product management culture could use some help. Staff is not incentivized to work all that hard which breeds a culture of laziness and passing the buck.
good,"IBM is the best place to work , with respect to technology. When we focus on work life balance, then for me, it is not the right place."
good,"A typical day at work is usually extremely busy. Almost not time for lunch."
good,"As everyone would say, there are some great people here with fantastic integrity and great technology. But.......the continual emphasis on cost cutting and micro management has really taken the energy and fun out of the place. It is very hard to see how you cut yourself to growth."
good,If made into a permanent role I would definitely be interested in pursuing and based on my performance I would be offered the position even though the commute is longer than I prefer.
good,I have learned how to be more agile.  My current management is people centric.  The workplace culture is always reinventing and becoming more automated.  The hardest part of the job is an every changing work culture.
good,"Dit werk was voornamelijk goed om veel te leren over de businesswereld en het werk als bid manager. Ik werkte bij de Shared Service Centre in Boedapest en ondersteunde hier het NL/BE sales team. Hoewel het erg leerzaam was, vond ik echter ook dat er niet veel doorgroeimogelijkheden waren, en veel cultuurverschillen tussen het HU en NL team."
good,Happy leaving with friendly officemates. Every payroll day is a busy day wherein it is so busy for validating and checking the ATR's of the employees.
good,It does have great benefits.  My team  gets along great.  Communication with upper management is not good.  I have mixed feelings about how things are being handle right now with the transition
good,I was supposed to have a career that lasted until I chose to retire.  Unfortunately that did not happen!!  IBM changed all policies and had a Layoff for the first time in the companies history.  Also retirement options were drastically changed for the worse.
good,"IBM is a phenomenal company to work for. I highly recommend working there if you get the chance. The history and legacy and most importantly the phenomenal IBMers at Big Blue are what makes this company the tech giant it is today. Going through a lot of transitions with all of the acquisitions. Expect changes every six months on the business end. Still working through listening to the market and employees compared to the status quo of do what I say not as I do. Lot of mid-management integrity issues. Waiting on the Big Blue to return to its core. Lots of brilliant minds, high energy. Hope the company continues on for another 100 years and beyond."
good,"Focuses only on IT consulting, despite what they advertise.  If you are foreign or not used to Corporate America, you will need to figure the structure out on your own with zero mentorship.  Performance assessment seemed random and unstructured.  Many bosses that you feel lost and left without an ally.  Good to have on resume, regardless, due to consulting experience.  Forces you to develop and grow independently.  Great sink or swim environment to set you up well for next job / career."
good,"A cultura na empresa até quando eu trabalhava lá era algo que tinha que ser melhorado, uma promção demora séculos para sair, o RH é bastante fechado, porém aprende-se muito, a universidade online é bastante ampla e os benefícios são ótimos."
good,"IBM is famous for meetings but my experience has been a positive mix of meetings and focused work. "
good,"I keep learning a lot of things each day , The management here is friendly , flexible , the work place culture is comfortable "
good,Work is challenging but rewarding and allows and develops great solution driving thinking. Environment is diverse and interesting. Workplace culture has changed in the four years I've been there.
good,"The particular manger that I had a very different attitude. Some says was good and some bad... It can make you not want to come to work.. I also experienced favoritism. If you were not kissing up to people, you would not be able to move forward to another dept."
good,"Always a new challenge. Learned how to go about troubleshooting.  Pay very closs attention to detail.  Relaxed atmosphere. But when needed we get the job done, we do it efficiently."
good,"Working from home is the best benefit, otherwise it has no benefits. Low pay, no job security. My job was cut and transferred.  Great place for a student looking for good training."
good,"Los programadores son poco objetivos, por lo que trabajar ahi me resulto dificil"
good,"Not for the weak of heart. If you can meet the high standards and deal with the pressure, you can handle the work environment."
good,The outsource experience is unfortunate.  Workload is increased and resources are decreased.  The overall culture and experience has been stressful.  I have enjoyed learning about IBM's history through training etc.
good,Very boring. Paid for education. Provided a severance when they let me go because they moved my job to Singapore.They failed to promote me when I earned my degree and started doing higher level work and additional justification.
good,Working for IBM is great foundation in building a career. I worked 12 hour job 3days and 4 days alternating weeks and I really loved the schedule. People i worked with are awesome.
good,I can't speak for all of IBM. There are thousands of smaller mom-pop sized places that are still IBM.  I was in the mortgage industry recently purchased by IBM working information technology and security.  It was a monumental task to bring us to the corporate standards of IBM.
good,"I enjoyed working in IBM as a contractor for 19 years."
good,"This IS your father's IBM, but for how much longer? Workplace culture is merit-based and results-driven. Corporate culture is changing because of executive influx from other industries. Expect to train your replacement."
good,I cannot remember that much about working at IBM since this position was over 20 years ago.  What I do remember was the high call volume during the holidays when a new computer was introduced.
good,"We can implement any innovations. Open doors for innovation. "
good,"IBM has changed since the first time I worked for them. As the company has divested many longtime business lines, it has been very challenging in determining a new direction for the company. IBM has always been a premium vendor and attempting to compete in areas that have lower margins has really hurt IBM over the past 3+ years. There is a lot of fat that needs be trimmed with regards to the people in middle and first line management. Most of those roles have managers that have never sold solutions in the areas they manage. Thus, IBM is experiencing a huge bottleneck with productivity."
good,"In general IBM is a high quality company that lives by its core beliefs.  The employees are fantastic and work hard to deliver quality solutions while solving customer issues. "
good,"IBM has a lot to offer but may come up short if you decide you want to change your career path. One of the things I liked the most is that you have free access to most of IBM's products (Watson Analytics, Db2, Data Science Experience, etc). If you're heaving into analytics and IT and like the idea of working for heavily marketed, household IT name that even your Grandparents are familiar with, work here. The pay is not competitive and benefits are geared towards employees only, and some parents with multiple children have had a tough time managing costs."
good,Working with a very demanding/difficult customer and having to travel (with all of it's issues) made for a tough work/life balance.  IBM as a company was fine.
good,It is a Big concern to work on. Such a cool environment to work with. Had a super colleagues to work on. I have learn a lot from them. Learning so many stuffs still.
good,"Accounting professional with over 7+ years of experience. A self-managed, high energy and result-oriented person with expertise in Record-to-Report, General Ledger Reconciliation, Fixed Assets accounting, Intercompany Reconciliation, Bank Reconciliations, Recognized for success in solving problems, eliminating obstacles and making decisions."
good,Main focus is on the project you're working on and around the technologies used to deliver on the same. Yet you are surrounded by great/experienced people.
good,The work life was ok. They could have done things differently to be more efficient but since I was an hourly consultant I didn't push back when they wanted to drag things out.
good,"Diversified job roles and company sensitive to staff divulging information in the public domain. One of the front runners in Cloud technology (Blockchain, Agile etc)"
good,"When you work at IBM as a writer, you are basically getting a paid-for MBA in business communications. As an intranet writer for the Sales & Distribution area, I went from soft-skills English major to solid technology & sales writer. IBM gives you an opportunity to develop your interviewing, writing and editing skills, all while learning about selling, building strategic relationships and understanding issues in technology systems."
good,"very nice people at IBM; but have outdated and cumbersome tools especially CRM. most meetings were sales management reviews, but received very little pro-active pipeline data."
good,"Flexibler Arbeitgeber, wie zum Beispiel von zu Hause aus Arbeiten."
good,"Started off great, but management decisions and switching of sales teams and clients as well as products sold multiple times over short period of time really hurt."
good,"I started my career at IBM and worked there for 9 years.  Learning experience was great, however the environment was too much over an unnecessary pressure and the followup/blaming culture bothers me a bit."
good,"Working at IBM can be stressful but also very challenging and rewarding.  I gained a great deal of knowledge in the area of project management, had excellent co-workers, and became a great team leader."
good,"Laid off after best quarter ever. Be careful if you get ""senior"" added to your title, as you are about to replaced by a college kid. I am still a tad bitter."
good,IBMers are great people to work with. Management is also great. There is a lot diversity and a lot diversity groups that you leverage to growth at your job!
good,"Me considero responsable , puntual activa , con iniciativa"
good,work life balance is just about good. Fun place to work. Manager driven company. Workplace culture is people friendly and the hardest part of the job is the compensation.
good,"Manager driven company."
good,My previous  experience is very nice and challaging to learn new technologies and apply them within application for which I am working. As learning perspective it's great experience.
good,IBM was a good company but depending on where you were located in the company it was difficult to move around to new positions.  It was almost like you needed to know someone to get into a different contract or internal IBM.
good,"--> good  work culture"
good,"IBM is a great company with great potential. I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to work there. Thanks to IBM I learnt a lot of about IT itself, that means I was working not only with Windows operating systems, but also with Linux and UNIX or MAC. The workload of all my positions there should be described in short like this:"
good,IBM is a mature IT employer and great place to work.
good,Being part of an Acquisition from FileNet which had a work culture that was more of a team atmosphere and being able to disconnect from work while being on PTO versus IBM where the balance between work and PTO did not exist. You were required to be connected/available at all times.
good,"- Good place to work."
good,"I was only here for a few months but it was fun. Each floor had a rec room with tv, pool table etc. Management was very good with helping and listening, actively encouraged us to ask questions and give new ideas."
good,This is a very big brand company. However HR policy is not great for India. Professional growth opportunity is very limited. Movement between assignment/domain/industry is very difficult.
good,IBM is a good company to work for as they believe in career growth and a work life balance. There is a big focus on service quality and service delivery
good,"Great place to start to learn new things."
good,"This position was inside sales. It was a very fast paced, team first environment. This was a highly competitive industry. The sales cycles were very long."
good,"As a fresher , you get lot to grow here . Seniors are very helpful and you get to learn new skills . Quality of work you get is very good but you get quite a less hikes in salaries."
good,As an implementation consultant I provided long term project level support on Oracle Packaged Applications.  Further served as a project manager.  IBM is a large full service company.
good,"Always a time to get together to have fun, just to get all minds to work together. flexibility in work schedule and always time to improve yourself if you are the type"
good,"1. Process oriented"
good,I had an issue with work life balance. The shifting schedule and work on holidays made it quite difficult to spend time with family and enjoy life outside of work
good,For Freshers it is a good Job to know how the company and support process work for core tech people main frames and cloud role would be up to the mark
good,IBM was great back in the 80s and 90s then they had massive lay offs and moved many jobs over seas.   Since 2000 there have ben very few promotions. Also since 2000 ther were very few pay increases even for strong 2 rated performers.  When you eventually did get a merit increase it was very small.  Pay increases were 2% to 2.5%
good,Unfortunately IBM does not retain top talent.  You need to stay on the leading edge of technology and business.  There are areas in the company that are fantastic to work and you feel special.
good,"Day to day work culture is good compare to other company."
good,Profesional pro activo. Trabajo en tiempo integral
good,"IBM is a good place to work with a good culture but the career growth is quite gradual."
good,It is great to work with team members.some time there is team outing lunch and fun. The Reps of Middle East region are good enough to talk to and deal with them in terms of work. There are many new things to learn about different acquisitions.
good,"Flexible work timings, supportive team. Learned a lot from my team-members, excellent grooming and exposure provided. Stakeholders and clients are also pretty supportive. Overall a great place to work."
good,I lrant a lot. I learnt communication skills. I became more technical. It was fun to talk to Americans. I like the new enviornment. The hardest part of the job is nothing. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to different people.
good,3.6 years of Windows and Vmware Administrator experience in IT Infrastructure and Hosting based 24X7 support environment. Strong perseverance and diligence towards attaining challenging goals and quick learning ability.
good,Huge multinational IT company. If you are a pure product of consumerism then the IBM brand alone is worth working here. Competitive environment and surprisingly dynamic given the size of the organization.
good,Flexible Working Hours and supporting Managers. Tremendous work pressure. Career growth not clear. Monotonous job. Great place to work for freshers. Lots to learn.
good,"Company is good, however if any workplace is not good, for that management and HR over there are totally responsible for that. HR should directly converse with the employees,"
good,"Working daily  to reconcile services promised with available skills,  "
good,"IBM truly is a place where you can learn a lot of skills the company provides individuals many options to help grow at IBM."
good,"Better learning "
good,"Good for work place. Here I learned IT Asset Management work. Management Good, Culture also good. Audit Time is hardest part in the job time period."
good,"IBM is a nice company, it has friendly environment also. The good thing about this company it has a good training. Will be able to develop good communicating skills and leadership skill."
good,IBM Is a very rewarding place to work in. If you deliver what is expected of you then the growth in this company is pretty fast.IBM Encourages a good work life balance and also gives you a lot of flexibility.
good,"I can't say anything bad in IBM, because they've been in the industry for 100 years and more. Although the BPO industry is kinda stressful specially for those who are health conscious"
good,"As far salary concerned its not good here, work culture is also good, there is lot of politics in IBM with management and no years hike given to employees there."
good,"good place to know new stuff, Get time to learn new things. get change to work on P8 with Enterprise pooling, Also implement PowerVC for cloud. Work on different automation tools."
good,Growth of the design profession within the corporation has been rapid and educational for the enterprise. Growing pains are evident and turn over for designers with less than 5 years is high.
good,General administration duties within the department. Management very professional and helpful in training workers. Co-workers very pleasant and took care of staff on the skillseeker programme.
good,"IBM used to be excellent place to work at, but now with recent transformation ""Resource Actions"" or AKA layoffs are impacting the culture and morals."
good,My experience with IBM was very good and inspiring. sorry cant write share much about the company environment according to their policy of maintaining secrecy.
good,I learned a lot in my career with IBM.  We were always busy and always changing.  Learning quickly was a must.  Overtime was frequently required.  I loved my co-workers or I wouldn't have stayed so long.
good,"Telecommuted for the last ten years.  Usually worked 50 - 60 hour weeks.  The breadth of skills required to navigate through a complete report transition was always challenging.  Every client had their own views on metrics and tool sets used to develop the reports.  From contract reviews, stakeholder meetings, building consensus, accessing the data sources, defining data models for the database and ETL teams, writing business and technical requirements for the reports, unit and system testing.  "
good,IBM has a habit of bringing in management from other parts of the world. When they come in they make sweeping changes of mid level managers with out and review of the progress and accomplishments of what those managers have done to better the company.
good,ótima empresa para trabalhar mas que perdeu totalmente a cultura e a relação empresa empregado.
good,"Hohes Mass an selbständiger, eigenverantwortlicher Arbeit möglich. Aufgrund der Grösse und der zentralen US-Steuerung manchmal etwas ""träge"". Könnte mehr Leistungen und Angebote als reiner Lizenzverkauf anbieten und somit grössere Kundenbindung erreichen."
good,"Some really smart people solving important problems. But no ping pong tables, fuzz ball tables or beer in the fridge.  But I think its comming."
good,"Pay is good, a lot of opportunity to learn new things.  Work at home. Challenging work to do.  "
good,"Se trabajaba con total libertad dado que yo utilizaba el homeworking"
good,Company in transition. The overall goals of IBM are great but the journey to get there is proving to be a challenge
good,Its a very good organization.Where i joined here as a contract employee. All my co -workers are well matured and we enjoy through the day
good,Learned a lot about technologies as a technical representative for machines. Though the learning was new but never felt painful. Enjoyed every moment in IBM. Its work culture makes employees stick to the company for years. We see even those employees who retire from IBM as we normally see only in Government organisations.
good,"Para quem está querendo iniciar a sua jornada no mercado de trabalho, a IBM abre as suas portas. Grandes oportunidades de desenvolvimento."
good,"Ótima flexibilização da carga horária, o que permite um bom balanço entre vida pessoal e profissional."
good,"Pros:"
good,I worked with many good people and learned computer skills that I hadn't had. I cooperated well with my co-workers and management. The most difficult part of the job was time management and determining proper priorities within a high stress setting. The most enjoyable part was creating computer programs.
good,"A company that enables employee promotion with various areas of the business."
good,"The management is intent on getting rid of all of their Senior and skilled employees by lack of raises and ridiculous reviews. Any reason they can dream up, is another reason for not advancing. "
good,"Work life is quite busy and challenging being in banking sector and fun at the same time with good colleagues."
good,strictly depends on department where you work there are huge differences. There is department with 10 employees quitting every month and there are departments where you can work from home 4/5 days a week with no pressure. very unbalanced job roles
good,"No te quedaras aburrido, nunca.  Todos los dias hay muchos retos, y con esto muchísima oportunidad de aprendizaje."
good,"My wife and I both worked for IBM for 18 and 11 years respectively."
good,Exelente empresa ambiente de trabajo agusto buen horario y instalaciones buenas
good,IBM is a very good place to learn new technologies and implementation of it. Is a employee friendly place where one can work happily.
good,They have implemented GDF but they have not done the homework well. Different ticketing tools/connectivity methods and deviation from Industry standard process(ITIL) is causing inconvenience to employees.
good,"I enjoyed my time at IBM very much!  There were regular tasks that would be addressed daily and there were interesting challenges that would occur on a weekly basis. There was plenty of new technologies to learn including Cloud Storage Technology.  I enjoyed meeting interesting people both native to the state of NC and from elsewhere, like me.  "
good,"Lovely office in the heart of DC."
good,"Boa empresa para trabalhar, exige demais dos funcionários, muitos funcionários ficando doentes de tanto trabalhar. Possui um ambiente de trabalho bom e defasagem em desenvolvimento de capital humano."
good,Doesn't seem to have any direction for the company to work towards and outsourcing multiple positions to India to attempt to save money instead of making a better work environment.
good,"I have learned many thing good things in my tenure with IBM."
good,Empresa boa !mas sem plano de carreira até o presente momento.Estou a cinco anos e não teve nenhum colaborador que conseguiu nada mais que o dissídio salarial.
good,"Worked with the best of the best, consummate professionals and brilliant thought leaders.  My peers & management were well versed in current business and technology trends.  We were required to train at least 40 hrs per year with 24 of those hours being focused around process methods and tools which help keep us well informed."
good,Best job security but the job culture was very cold and conservative. job life balance was also not accommodating as well as flexible enough.
good,"IBM is the one of leading company internationally and working there is my pleasure. The team members, HR(s) and management team are very co-operative, Intelligent and hardworks too. It is an awsome place to work."
good,Always something new going on. Not always compatible with one another. The altenate work schedule is tough but makes it easy to have large blocks of time off.
good,my process is jet airways. there r so many process in that company. the hardest part of the company is leave when u need. but its a fun to work their. i miss IBM.
good,Ett globalt företag med stora möjligheter till karriärs utveckling
good,"Nice team and enjoying the work with co members of the team, helping each others, working on TAT close it was a memorable experience need to finish it on time only on the month end time."
good,"review calls"
good,"Take all tickets from techs from night shifts"
good,"giornate di 12 - 14 ore"
good,It can be very financially rewarding and has a very virtual flexible approach.   But it is very large with a top heavy bureaucracy.
good,"Depending on where you work it can be brutal or nice."
good,Nation's 5th largest bank with excellent employee health and insurance benefits. Greatest part was easy loan/installments plans available for its employees.
good,"I work with customers every day over phone or via email, solving problems or answering questions about their AIX systems.  "
good,"IBM is just what you would imagine a large company would be like.  Some positives, some negatives."
good,"Its good for learning."
good,One day my manager asked me to please come to the office on the week off as the staffing was less that day so I went to the office to save my manager from being scold by his manager and gave production hours of 12 hours.So I think that this was the productive event which I did for my manager as there was the requirement for more staffing.
good,"They employed many Japanese speaker people without computer knowledge. Five days working in a week included Saturday, Sunday and public holidays. Short lunch time and it is hard to manage last customer end of a day. I have to do it most of the time so I felt really"
good,"A very nice place to work. Although a bit haywire in operations. Every other details is based out of HO. have to follow up a lot. Management is pretty ok. Not up to the mark."
good,"Great company if you are interested in consulting exclusively.  The way that they are currently running the business, makes the road-warrior life bearable. "
good,"Corporate environment "
good,ok place to work if you can put up with the B.S. they dish out. 12 hour shifts get to be old after 15 years on nights
good,Empresa com ótimos benefícios e permite excelente aprendizado.
good,"Process wise management."
good,"Trabalho sempre corrido mas ótimo de trabalhar, sempre trabalho em grupo, com controle de SOS enviadas e recebidas no e-mail, e controle no Office. "
good,"A typical day can be a bit stressful due to high call volumes but, an interested and diligent employee could make the most of it."
good,Over several years this company has eliminated positions and heaped the workload on remaining employees. there is no consideration for the excessive workload and employees are rated low due to inability to complete all extra assigned tasks.
good,"Nice neat friendly atmosphere"
good,"A empresa tem seus altos e baixos como qualquer uma, porém a área na qual trabalhava não era a que eu queria seguir, por isso não me adaptei ao meu papel, porém não deixei de cumprir o que foi designado a mim."
good,"IBM provides very good benefits"
good,"Global company same as IBM India , It is small part of IBM India"
good,"Introduction to the company"
good,"Good company for work life balance, could be a bit cruel towards contractors. But they're willing to pay above market rates."
good,"Work Culture."
good,Its a fun loving place but also selfcentred and therefore there is a certain level of disconnect with the people around you.
good,"Rotina diária na gestão de processos, melhorias e aplicação de treinamentos. Aprendendo a lapidar tanto os colaboradores da empresa quanto a mim mesmo nos moldes pertinentes ao padrão da corporação. Amelhor parte é exatamente o contínuo desenvolvimento."
good,"IBM, being a globally recognized MNC and catering to myriad client oriented business, is focused on core work!"
good,I am not in the right group. Very little movement. People are nice and many good options to move around.
good,Learned to lead as technical leader. Very good co-workers but hardest part is getting new changes implemented. Most enjoyable part of job is flexibility.
good,"Hardest part is working on différent shifts (Night Shift)."
good,"Productive and Fun work place"
good,"Operates like a start up company, in Manhattan.  They have agile/scrum teams of 9 experts run by a Product Owner and a Scrum Master, doing web design, software development and some marketing and communications teams."
good,"Productive, need to meet daily targets."
good,"IBM is a big mammoth of a comapny, its easy to get lost in it. You can lead a comfortable work-life balance, depending on which line of work you are in."
good,"Great work place."
good,IBM is also one of the good competitor of having multiple projects where a person can learn and grow in different domains.
good,Like working there with great people. i had great experience working at ibm. Did a lot work with international customers. i have great experience with technical stuff...
good,"IBM gives independent accountability of engagements, client relationship, team management and overall engagement financials. It also nurtures a culture of bringing in the engagement and delivering it."
good,"From start to finish I am juggling many different responsibilities.  Between helping my managers with their calendar needs, to random people needing assistance, I transition from one to the next with determination.  People often know my name by reputation, so I am told.  I am helpful and somehow have the ""magic"" to get things done.  This is a constant in my office. It can be challenging when I have everything thrown at me at once, but I thrive on being busy.  It is both one of the hardest things, to do so much at once, but at the same time I enjoy it when I can cross one more thing off my list."
good,"Loading and unloading trucks"
good,"It would be different shift we work, logging in to the system opening the Console and monitoring the servers, which we have configured for our Project, then pulling up the daily reports of the team, sending it to the service delivery team. attending calls from the support team, informing them about the servers and issues that we monitor in our console. "

good,Handled many projects for a release.Got appreciation from clients for the success full completion of projects in time.
good,"At IBM job security was good. However, the processes are not stable. Management is poor. Learning is poor. Work culture is okay. Salary is less as per the industry standards. Growth is also very slow. Work pressure is always on the higher side."
good,"IBM Daksh, working for domestic voice process. Work for short period nothing much to say."
good,Uma ótima empresa para se desenvolver profissionalmente e aprender constantemente.
good,"* We can learn lot of things."
good,Through my different roles at IBM I was able to see the full product lifecycle.
good,"Si bien la empresa permite capacitarse en muchas areas, cuesta mucho lograr una promoción tanto en puesto como en salario haciendo que uno quede desactualizado a nivel mercado y por esto muy afectado con la inflación actual."
good,"IBM is a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company. Combining unparalleled experience, comprehensive capabilities across all industries and business functions, and extensive research on the world’s most successful companies, IBM collaborates with clients to help them become high-performance businesses and governments.Good management  with supportive co workers."
good,"Fun company and atmosphere. Sometimes doesn't seem that management cares as much as they should about morale of the employees, but I think it depends on the manager."
good,"Working in the call center did not create room for advancement, but the benefits were excellent."
good,"Learned How  MNC works."
good,"The work life balance is GREAT in that working from home is wonderful.   However, the day never ends - and the separation from work to life gets more and more blurred all of the time.   And the constant worry about getting 'axed' is draining."
good,"Typical day at work is meetings to fulfill you process and procedure documents, Working for a corporate company is always difficult because the head office is in another country or province,  the Management visibility is not so good when you are consider a remote site."
good,"The greater organization seems great.  I work for a newly acquired division, which is poorly managed and lacks a clear strategy."
good,Good work environment. Limited supervision. Twelve hours shifts (non-rotating). The most enjoyable part was my co-workers. 
good,"Checking newest e-mails, calendar appointments for that day. "
good,"relaxed, fun"
good,"IBM is an excellent company overall, however working for the company has changed very much through the years and job security is no longer. Jobs, Departments, etc are being resourced to other countries such as Brazil, and Canada."
good,"Lo contaré en la entrevista o cuando me pregunten personalmente.... No he estado mal en la empresa pero si en la consultora que me pagaba que no, lo hacía!"
good,"Co-workers were nice and welcoming, management was friendly and honored the open door policy."
good,"This was a great experience. However, the benefits and growth opportunities were very limited. J&J had multiple IT Departments and dealing with the different management styles in each it department was difficult. They need to bring their IT support totally in-house. Stop outsourcing..."
good,"Pros: Outstanding benefits. Work Life balance is good. Starting vacation, and time off is excellent."
good,IBM culture and training for 15 years.
good,"IBM is a global brand on its own, there are plenty opportunities for growth within the company if you enter as a grad or regular. We are encouraged to clearly identify our work/life balance and make it work so as to be happy employees. My direct managers are outstanding individuals with great leadership qualities. The most challenging part of my job is not the job itself, but rather the discomfort of being a contractor at my age . . . where I can afford a car and to buy property however I cant because financial institutions view my contract status as a risk, as do I. The best part of the job is Same Time; a software application developed by IBM and being exposed to many intelligent minds from different backgrounds. Meeting internationals from all over the globe and appreciating the purpose of procedure."
good,i am really impressed with IBM values which gave me right direction towards my goal.
good,"Over all company is good, but I want to relocate to Goa because of my personal reasons."
good,"I started at an off site building as basically the receptionist. I then went to patrol, confidential paper removal, loading dock, primary building receptionist, console operator and supervisor. I had ot obtain a secret clearance for this job."
good,"IBM is a fantastic company with a lot of history. The people are great and the Management is good. However, career advancement opportunities are limited as you progress to senior level roles."
good,Worked 12 hour days to insure all contract obligation were met.
good,"To pursue a highly challenging, continuous, knowledge & skill-developing career, this will expose me to the cutting – edge technologies, to be one among the best in System Administration and to give my best for the continuous organizational & individual Development."
good,I can tell you that it was all about corparate. I as an employee diden't matter I was always concerned about being laid off or as they called it A Resource Action. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the students that were in my classes.
good,Line management takes decisions from above.
good,If you like being micromanaged then this is the place to work. They go strictly by statistics/metrics and the people with the best metrics usually are the ones to advance.
good,Very forward looking. Excellent compensation and benefits.
good,"IBM obviously changed between when I joined them in 1978 and when I retired in 2018.  In recent years, the changes in the industry have been hard for IBM to keep up and they are probably not yet as nimble and adaptive to these changes as they need to be."
good,Productive and Learning experience. Project managers are helpful. Lots of option to learn new things. If you complete your internal certifications successfully there are very good opportunities to grow.
good,Strong values and process driven organization however at times becomes bureaucratic. Also HR not that effective as overall extremely manager driven systems ad processes so experiences hugely vary based on manager
good,When I started in at IBM I was advancing my career and salary quickly.  It came to a halt when they started the Lean activities.  It became just a job and people were no longer happy and always worried about job cuts.
good,"The overall great benefit is that you get to work from home.  However, if you come in on a contract basis you will not get any benefits and the wages are very low compared to the ever rising cost of living."
good,"Considero uma empresa de otima qualidade para desempenhar o profissionalismo, so precisa se atentar em relação aos gestores, falta de feedback"

good,"Long hours but enjoyable teams to work with."
good,"Company evolved to something I can't judge now. My experience there was very good, yet it was many years ago. Training was great and we had great contact with sales team. Something extremely important if you work for agency"
good,working from home  and office based work . Sometimes on site at the  client location. A diverse range of projects were on offer.Matrix management is the norm
good,Working environment was not too much stressful. Middle management staff was quite supportive. Excellent senior employees who were always ready to help new joinees. Got to learn a lot. Overall it was a good learning experience I got through dealing with UK clients over the call and email. Though Night shift was quite tiring and shift timings were not flexible for my process.
good,"Nice work life balance,Job satisfaction,was great to learn new things ,gave opportunity to create new reports for the leadership.also gave opportunity to create new frameworks"

good,"Good place to work and fun working with team,as a face of beginning in my carrier i learn a lot and had lot of fun and it help me to build my carrier."

good,"Bon environnement de travail, open space, bonne ambiance, missions stimulantes"
good,"They will rotate interns around departments depending on your supervisor manager, but the work turn around is quite high, be willing to learn on the spot and do everything to the best of your ability"
good,"It is unlikely that you will always be working on something that you like or that is completely within your wheelhouse, however, in my experience, they tried to find tasks that I was suited for. The rating on work-life balance was more about what I was willing to put in that it was a requirement from IBM, but the work culture can be fast-paced at times and there is the possibility to be moved around occasionally. Overall I have worked for IBM twice, I respect the company since it was a key player in starting many of the technologies the internet depends on. For people who know the history of computing IBM had a role in too many things to count. They also own RedHat, had and Softlayer which were also revolutionary companies each in their own right. The computer industry as a whole has benefitted from IBM's contributions over the years which just can't be dismissed."
good,"You get a chance to work on multiple projects, where you can learn new things and enhance your skills and capabilities.  There are several training within IBM, that can help to improve in terms of technically as well as professionally. You can also get a chance to explore different locations."

good,"ottimo ambiente di lavoro, molto flessibile e motivante"
good,Fine place to work.  Its downtown Tulsa so parking structures are few and far between.  You have to park a few blocks down and walk to and from to get to work.
good,"Being a technology leader, IBM spends a lot of time and resources on developing their people. Learning and development for every employee is encouraged"
good,"Confidential - Challenging work.  Great op-prem environment.  Work-life balance is ok.  Management is ok.   Hit and miss.  Great place to learn more, regardless of what you already know."
good,"The work place is good with relaxed atmosphere and culture"
good,"Initially, management was all about the numbers which put a strain on the team because of the added and unnecessary stress. Management changed and so did the culture on the team for the better. For the remainder of my time there I really enjoyed working with the team of highly skilled techs."
good,"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

good,"Lot of opportunities to excel our knowledge to learn new things , with diffrent traning sessions. In case of emergencies work from home is an option . workplace culture is convinient ."
good,"Such a nice learning environment to all."
good,"IBM in my role allows me to work mostly on my own with some direction. I usually handle emails first thing and get many requests for various reports. I monitor systems and look for areas of improvement and enhancement. I like being able to work on several projects at one time over various disciplines and capacities. I have worked on both Mainframe and open systems. I administer 4 open systems servers as well as help maintain 80+ LPARs on 13+ Mainframe machines. The management seem to be open to discussion and lead the way at a higher level and allow team leads to push their teams. The hardest part of the job is staying ahead of the game. It can be easy to find ourselves in a fire fight with various issues, while still having to meet deliverable dates and handle to incoming requests."
good,Great place to work. Good work life place. Great training and experience. Not many meetings daily. Great culture. Company keeps up with the latest technology.
good,Company is sales focused and driven.  Pressure is substantial and there is little tolerance for repeated misses on revenue goals.  Travel is a way of life.
good,"I like that working for IBM we had the freedom of working autonomously, you could go on doing what you are best at. Maybe because they were handling a new account I was consumed doing tasks that required lots of time to complete. Overall, it was okay, IB provided you with the resources to improve yourself."

good,It is nice and great place to work with. The team and management are friendly and helping in IBM. I gained experience in different work areas and with different people
good,"Lavorare in IBM significa lavorare in un ambiente stimolante, aperto e rivolto al futuro."
good,"I worked at IBM almost 10 years and found them to be a very good, highly ethical company.  They support diversity and encourage worklife balance.  Many IBMers work remote in order to reduce the need for corporate workspace."
good,The culture there is not what I expected and I've decided to move on with a company/position that is more to my liking. I would recommend them for someone who is just getting started but not for seasoned professionals
good,"Fast paced challenging environment with frequent change. Opportunity for movement within and across the company, especially if you are willing to relocate to any of the major IBM hubs."
good,Empresa Muito boa de se trabalhar deixa o colaborador livre para criar.
good,"career growth opportunities. learned handling clients, great team work, enhanced skills, challenging projects handling, very friendly atmosphere......."
good,"Worked in an outsourced position at State Street, so we were part of IBM but far removed from the full compliment of what the company had to offer.   As a team we were isolated from other IBM employees drastically."
good,"Empresa dinâmica, sempre se reinventando, alinhada com o mercado."
good,"The heart is there, but it's so big, and there are pockets of inefficiency that hold it back from being one of the very best companies to work for. There are still too many people working there who are just trying to fly under the radar instead of doing really great things. There is a chance this oldie, but a goodie, will pivot and be great -- but in the meantime, it can be very frustrating."
good,IBM was a great place to work and allowed me the opportunity to communicate with great people from different countries. Management was very cooperative when personal issues arose and allowed employees special working conditions. Being a team player was instilled while they encouraged us to grow on our own.
good,"Good work life balance but less salary, yearly appraisal. Good place to learn technology. If you are looking for high salary, this is not the place. Cheers"
good,Work culture is good. Lot of opportunity to learn new technologies. You can balance your personal and work life in this organisation. I love to recommend some one in this company

good,"IBM is a company that has managed to reinvent itself several times over the more than 100 years it as existed, and is going through another significant change.  If shaping and driving a business in a complex environment is your thing, then IBM might be for you.  The environment is political, and driven by you ability to advocate for yourself and/or your team.  Its a matrixed organization, so consensus is the key to success. Teams are spread all over the world, so expect to collaborate remotely most of the time."

good,"Insgesamt ein sehr loyales Unternehmen, mit vielen Vorteilen. Doch durch die Arbeitsplatz Auslagerungen nicht mehr das Unternehmen in welchen ich meine Lehre abgeschlossen habe."
good,While the job was good I found the job a little to repetitive and mundane to continue working here. The benefits that come along with the job are great.
good,"In this company, we need unparalleled creativity, teamwork, and tapping the potential needs of our customers. We are constantly making the impossible possible. My team is in various places, but every time we are in the project, it is so unified and  our goal is the same.  Every success comes from teamwork"

The job search portal and being reduced from a strong niche consultant to a 'maybe support at best' was extremely disheartening and my team dissolved within a month of my hire."

There are wonderful and very intelligent people and IBM and Watson Health but Watson Health lacks focus and people are leaving and shifting roles hoping to find new ways to make a difference in a company that is trying to do the right thing for healthcare. However they are slow to achieve anything the market or customers need and are beginning to lose ground in areas where they were once leaders."
good,"Management was great balance of learning by doing and and teaching the skill you need to lift roadblocks. The new office spaces that have been renovated are definitely a breath of fresh air.

good,"I have worked at my current role for 2 years and at IBM for 8 years. Working in Project Management means that you will never have two days that are the same. One has to constantly think on their feet, always be prepared as things change and demands are made at the drop of a hat."
good,"I was able to work from home, I also managed cross functional teams there were geographically dispersed on various project that I worked on."
good,"Most of IBM as a whole is quite a good company, unfortunately the small area I worked in had little/no room for growth, average salary and mediocre managers. The offices are very nice though! and co workers are fine, even with the above average turnover"
good,"A great place to build your skills. IBM is very supportive of continued learning and skill building. Unfortunately, very little room for advancement. Negotiate your starting salary HARD because increases are hard to come by."
good,"Working as local and remote tech support"
good,"I worked at IBM full-time"
good,"Learned accounts payable process, how to create customer relationship etc. Working with IBM was the most enjoyable part of my job. Learned remote transition and stabilizing the processes from different countries."

good,"V Quotient Consulting Services"
good,"* Quality work with good support from the peers."
good,"Great place to work, but absolutely numbers driven. You could have done a great job on your project, but utilization metrics far outweighed client satisfaction metrics."
good,It is very comfortable to manage both Personal and professional life while working in IBM.   One would always get an opportunity to learn new things and engage in new tasks that would enable one's prospectus with growing in career
good,"A empresa é boa mas carece de gestão competente, como tem muito apadrinhamento pessoas boas não são promovidas por meritocracia e isso é desestimulante."
good,"Bonne école"
good,Management oriented company. HR role is very minimal. Very less integrity at the workplace and it's a different culture to cope up with. Lots to learn if you can find yourself time to do it.
good,"Great company with huge networking opportunities, wide range of projects. Managers help you stretch into more advanced skills and roles. Department was pigeon-holed into content development, not much scope beyond that."

good,"Découverte du fonctionnement d'une grande entreprise comme IBM. Plusieurs travaux effectués dans plusieurs services notamment en Production (préparation,montage et configuration de serveurs)"
good,"IBM hires and fires. think before you join. They hire on a contract basis. Management is very poor. They don't think of the future of an employee. They just want numbers,"
good,I loved working at IBM. The staff and management have are supportive and professional. I never went to work feeling like it was a chore. The overall experience was good. I only left to pursue a more lucrative job to support my growing family.
good,"Ambiente muito agradável e competitivo. "
good,"IBM is a consistently changing work environment, in which share holder returns have taken more importance than loyalty to customers and employees - it is a good place to start, but long term employment can bet tricky in the global economy where is it more cost effective to hire 2 or 3 people outside the United States, that are less qualified, and produce less individually, but due to the the numbers create the illusion that the same amount of work is being preformed because the number of extra employees involved - this represents short term thinking on the part of IBM management, because as they reduce the employees in the United States, and other countries, to capitalize on short term gains, the big gains and the long term picture seems to elude them."
good,One of the top companies  of the world to make career. Work life balance and very competitive work environment.  Excellent company to upgrade your skills and make a difference
good,Offers great in-house education opportunities to all employees.  Diversity and inclusion are very important values of IBM. Progressive business methodologies are strongly encouraged.
good,"IBM provides the job security which is very difficult to get these days. The work culture is good and it is good company to start your career."

good,"Truly an IT company with extensive use of IT systems or tools in every aspects of work. They also provide a lot links to webinars, knowledge websites, information on emerging technologies and access to a whole heaps of technology information on ongoing basis to enable the staff to keep themselves abreast with the changes. "

good,Typical day includes sitting at a desk and working sometimes with others when issues arise. Great community. Job security is questionable.............
good,"I retired almost 3 years ago. When I left, the culture was already changing dramatically (Human resources where no longer the most important assets of the company; Client was no longer the most important belief of the company. It was all about revenue and profit as the top priority, regardless of the cost (Employees or customers). ). It feels like this culture will finish the company as we know it."
good,Work culture is just OK and at times we have to work hard to meet the deadlines. The hardest part of my job there is to attend some night shifts as i was working in a support project.
good,"A lot of opportunities to earn certifications and other training, however working from home has its pros and cons.  A typical day at work would be to build systems and install software and upgrades."
good,You whave an eight hour shift some departments give overtime. You learn about the mortgage industry. Most of the management are down to earth.  The work environment is laid back.  The Kadyn st enjoyable app art of the job are your coworkers and outside attorneys and staff that in some departments you come In contact with.
good,De aandeelhouders staan bij het bedrijf centraal evenals innovatie.

good,"- Friendly working environment"
good,NAME Has the Value in the market - gives respect to the employees.Not good hikes all the times.Job security. Multiple options for internal movement if required.
good,Working in a BPO was rewarding in terms of money but the odd working hours and long shifts were harming my health so I had to leave this wonderful organisation for the sake of my health.
good,"Good Brand to be associated with but lacks work-life balance. Remunerations are not the best in the industry too. "
good,"I worked at IBM full-time (Less than a year)"
good,My first 20 years were wonderful.  I loved my work.  Got several promotions including a management position. Worked on leading edge projects. The last 6 years saw a big change in management philosophy.  Job security became a big issue with several layoffs.
good,This was a perfect introductory start into my professional career and learned about how IBM interacts with local software developers to develop their applications
good,"In my years with IBM I had been working on the customers' site (Lucent Technology, AT&T, Maersk) and never had the opportunity to work directly at/with IBM."
good,"Extensive learning on the project, program management. Learning on the transformation and transition of the application and projects from different region and working with the clients directly with the challenge of getting the knowledge on their application and bringing into IBM fold"
good,"Your career experience will totally depend on the job, your age and your aspirations. IBM is working hard to be identified as a premier Cloud company with the power of Watson."
good,Good place to work at in Singapore. The people are friendly. Processes can be time consuming but helpful to understand. Overall a good place to work and build a career.
good,"My role as the Finance Admin is as a consultant to AT&T."
good,Best for highly niche programmer with high client demand
good,Offers very good opportunities for entry level positions. There are a lot of chances to promote. You can change team and position after 1 year (minimum) and there are a lot of career paths that you can choose. My experience IBM was a good one so I can only recommend it.
good,"For better or worse, IBM is always trying to reinvent itself. Annual team member and account shake ups have good intentions, but can sometimes be a detriment. IBM is one of the largest and most recognizable brands in the world and there are certainly advantages that come with that status."
good,"Great Place to work ...Great place to grow..."
good,"The culture at Seterus was not IBM’s culture. I was micromanaged, my incentive fluctuated and there was limited opportunities for growth.  Performance wasn’t rewarded."
good,"I worked there for many years and IBM treated its employees excellent up to 1993, when layoffs happened and then their full employment model went away. They have become non-caring, cut-throat and treat employees like a piece of meat."
good,"I've enjoyed my time with IBM.  Lots of opportunities for learning, skill development and career advancement.  Very conducive work from home environment."
good,"IBM Research is a good place to work, if you come in at the right position. It is a good start out job to get a feel of the industry. Many things to learn while being here. It is a good place to start a good career."

good,Was lucky to work with a talented team and many industry experts and also some cutting edge technology. Was encouraged to think outside the box which helped me a lot in my career.
good,"good day at work"
good,"There used to be a lot of fun in this role. You solved a multitude of issues. You learned a lot about the network security side of things, and you had really fun team mates. It's changed recently however. EVERY ONE is overworked, and working weekends are common place. There are far stricter rules in place so micromanagement is high at all levels. You MUST close a certain amount of cases in a certain period or you are likely to be RA'd."
good,"Changing of technology concepts are forcing new work streams to reorganize employee job security.  With many jobs being off-shored to other countries, work force in USA is being reduced on a quarterly basis, effecting employee morale."
good,"IBM is a good company to work with.IBM provides comprehensive application lifecycle services, from developing and testing through deployment and management. IBM research and development along with experienced specialists provide clients with the latest in automation and cognitive capabilities. IBM helps support your quest for flawless application performance at speed and scale."
good,This was a great experience to learn and grow in the IBM methodology. I have use the foundations and software principles at all of my future companies and jobs.
good,Worked on the IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad's. Worked in the preload department. I got to work with and test the new and unreleased ThinkPad's and the new Windows operating systems before the public.
good,"-Results driven company"
good,I had very good time at IBM by learning new tools and day by day challenging with new tickets. Had a very good experience with team members and very experience with internal and external users.
good,"Position listings are available, but unfortunately, there is no ""ladder"" or track plan that is available for any particular career path...only ways to become ""more senior"" in current skill sets.  There seems to be a great number of people who leave, then come back, through ""resource actions"" where the company could have saved money by simply matching skills to internal needs in the first place."
good,IBM is a great place to learn new things.  The vast types or organizations and roles gives employees the opportunity to get paid while they learn new things.
good,IBM is a process oriented company. We learn multiple processes in all the fields. In IBM we learn how to keep things documented which helps in learning even from our mistakes.
good,this place is good for ones who would not be ready to take up much hectic pressure and need some cool work at home. salary hike is bad and no policies ensure that it would be taken care at right time unless we ask for it.
good,Empresa oferece possibilidade de crescimento em diferentes áreas.
good,"It's a good company to work for. Your typical Big Box company. I love everyone that I have worked with, for the most part. Really do love the people here."
good,"IBM today is not the same as it was when I started in 1999.  When I started we had reggae as our hold music, a meeting room with nothing but beanbag chairs, and beer bash fridays."
good,A IBM é uma boa empresa para se trabalhar porem sempre a gestao independente do lugar bota sempre tudo a perder.
good,"Manufacturing with emphasis on time management, the quickly aging equipment needs to be replaced or the plant will not continue, it will stagnate. You feel expendable"

good,I was immersed in multiple technologies in a short time.
good,Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar porém não é muito clara com o plano de carreira dos funcionários.
good,"Work in groups, eat in groups. Not much independence. Friendly atmosphere. Worked sometimes until 12:00pm. Not much satisfaction working toward a product where you cannot see results."
good,"IBM is huge and you can get mired down in the complexity of a large company. They emphasis utilization which means covering a work week of 44 hours. Hard to advance, but good work mates."
good,IBM was a great place to start my career. I learned more there than all of my years in school however the pay was sub-par to most starting developers and the benefits were delayed for two years. I was able to work from home twice a month which was nice and also felt that the workplace was very friendly. Big issues come about if you do not find a project as you will be fired in a certain amount of time. Also there was a big issue when knowing that you bill a client 5 times as much as IBM pays you.
good,"Buena empresa."
good,Good work life Balance.
good,Agradável de trabalhar. É ambiente moderno e jovem.
good,"It was a good job while I was there, IBM was a little slow in getting into new age technology but I think they are probably there by now."

good,"First job and first company, Always very special and close to my heart. Love the people and management. Great place to work with and happy and proud to be a part of this organisation."
good,Excelente ambiente de trabalho com desafios constantes aprimorando desenvolvimento profissional.
good,"The IT department was contracted out to IBM.  The plus was that we got to keep our years of service and our vacation.  I worked from home five days a week because IBM did not want to pay for desk space at the client site."
good,"Its IBM, it is a great place to work.  The training and reward is all very positive and stable.  Great place to work and devlop skills for career advancement"

Tuve la oportunidad de viajar al extranjero por trabajo lo cual era muy positivo para una junior."
good,"great place to work.people are very supporting.motivates each other.Healthy competition."
good,Long standing company with strong values and ethics.  Great people and technology.  Get caught sometimes in analysis paralysis.  It's a big boat to turn around so things take time but they know what direction they're headed so need to focus on this.
good,"Challenging work with extremely talented and knowledgeable colleagues."
good,A company which everyone would like to work...management was so good. The company got acquired by Concentrix later after which employee satisfaction was increasing.
good,"My time at IBM was good not great, but I really felt like diversity was a strong suit.  I also felt like senior leadership was stellar. The overall business plan was excellent. As an employee I felt valued and respected.  The sales compensation plan was not bit convoluted, but overall the my experience was pretty good."
good,"IBM is a great place to work and the company's values are second to none. However, it is constantly in a state of transition. For the individual, that means your job could change in a moment's notice. A constantly changing environment is challenging and can be frustrating, especially when management is unsympathetic."
good,"Not a bad company to work for.  Depending on a role, managers allowed work from home.  Meetings were held via teleconferences and Sametime chats. Projects were expected to be delivered on time."
good,"Tem seus problemas burocráticos, mas é uma empresa legal"
good,As per mine advised it is good company for new learner and they are having vast number of learning tools where you can learn what ever you want technical thing you want and even now you can earn badges also.
good,I have been worked in IBM for 5 years. It is a good company. I have been working in different project. My core work is develop java applications. I enjoyed most of the time working here.
good,"You can work at IBM for 30 years and have several different careers.  That is the beauty of a large company, there are always opportunities to try new things.   I love the progressive and inclusive nature of IBM.  What we are doing in Watson Health makes me proud.  The culture varies dramatically by organization, but like any large company, sometimes it's hard to move quickly.   Work life balance is a problem.  The work and hours are very demanding. In some areas of the company (like GBS) there are high utilization targets.   "
good,"Productive and good environment "
good,Things tend to move along at glacial speeds. Grandstanding of projects internally which seemed odd. Company is decidedly skewed towards sales and not core engineering as can be seen if you break down the budget.

good,"I believe the poor management is my main reason to leave "
good,workplace is good you work on your own paste no one is putting pressure on you to finish your task. I pack machines in the box and wrap products and then scan them in the computer system and save it to a file and get the receiver to sign a copy for file. I like working here because it is a good environment its a clean warehouse and it has its slow and busy times.
good,"A typical day would usually start with a meeting.Then another meeting.  Then Feed back from your team.  After meeting, we would work Remedy Tickets. for about  3 hours.  Only had lunch for a half hour on most days.  Because you need to complet a certain amount of tickets.  Sometimes, we had to get feedback from customers so you had to call them for the their opinion on surveys."
good,Great team of marketing folks who love their jobs. Freedom to work from home and travel to host customer events. Very loyal customers and friendly staff.

good,IBM was a very good company to work for. The end client was AT&T which had a lot of budget problems. They were constantly asking us to take days off to save budget money
good,En IBM fomentan la cultura laboral en cuanto a pausas activas y socialización del trabajo con los compañeros.
good,Learning scope is waste.Nice Project. Flexible timings.I have good experience in IBM.Depends on project where you work. Policy's are messy  .Not easy to understand .every thing is process.
good,"Managed small teams of Subject Matter Experts in application architecture, and infrastructure disciplines across different countries to perform detailed analysis of applications with high hosting and support charge backs."
good,Surrounded by young professionals and thus giving a happy atmosphere. Quite supportive by the management on how to go ahead. Helps building the career
good,CEO did not have of vision of where she wanted to take the company of what the competitive landscape was doing. The result was poor business performance. The answer to making revenue targets was to layoff many people
good,"Good company to work for, projects coming in are good , there is a fair amount of work-life balance. Customers are handled by the account management in a fair manner and expectation with them from the company is fair."
good,"I worked at IBM full-time (More than 10 years)"
good,"Working for IBM was a a great addition to the resume, but not so much for the career.  Lots of hype without backing it up in the form of advancement, training, compensation or team work."
good,"Typical day at work is kind of fun when you have people driving through the same purpose of betterment. A great place to discover, inculcate & learn a lot of things apart from technology. The learning portal is open to all and that makes sky as the limit."
good,very good international exposure to multicultural environment and professional clients. accounts are big industries with huge market spreads so experience is valid.
good,"Work was extremely fast pace, I learned no matter how many years of quality work it does not matter in long run. Management was very unknowledgeable or technical in any way with the groups they managed. Hardest part of job was dead line and geeting other teams to react to problems. Most enjoyable part was the new technology we got to work with, but in summary they were very slow to listen to the technical leads and made decisions based on bottom line instead of customer first."
good,"Good company and many benifits "
good,IBM is a good place to work.  They provide plenty of ongoing education opportunities.  There is positive leadership and the management team is fair.  In my opinion the pay could be better.

good,Productive and fun working place with the agenda on quality and process. Learned nuances with respect to processes and its related stuff. Workplace culture is decent.
good,"I was given a ton of a control over my project which I absolutely loved. I worked with two other interns in a corner office and it was a ton of fun. I know that other interns got pretty garbage projects to work on though, one of which didn't do anything and still got paid. So, results may vary."
good,"IBM is very flexible for timings. Only you have to complete your assigned work. No in time or out time will be recorded."
good,"I started their in 2012 with the goal of becoming permanent which means job security, more pay, 401k, PTO, Sick Time, Vacation, etc. With that being said I worked hard to become the best. Worked hard to move to the department which hired you on permanent and I did just that. I met the expectations to the point I was bringing home bonuses! That was awesome. Each time there was an opportunity to become permanent I applied and was denied an interview. I had been working there for 3 years at the time. However there were reps that were working there for only 4 mos and who were not meeting good numbers got an fair interview and a permanent position. For that reason alone the job that I liked started to tear me down. That is why I say If surrounded by a team and management who cares about your advancement YOU'LL WIN if not YOU'LL LOSE!!!"
good,Good to work and like any other US MNC. there is diversity and respect. asking some one working there to give review will always be positive. not sure why this is being asked

Have to  re-invent yourself every 3 or 4 years and stay up on technology.  Training was very poor, when you get dated they would rather fire you and bring in fresh talent."
good,IBM es una de las empresas más completas para trabajar
good,"I have started my career with IBM. "
good,"The best managers I ever had, I had working at IBM. It was an enjoyable competitive job but we always had to worry about being laid off. I enjoyed that we had two meetings (huddles) a day to go over everyone in our groups work load to see who could help each other out."

A feladatok sokszínűek, változatosak voltak és tele voltak sokszor kihívásokkal."
good,Staff was very friendly and and it was fun to work there.  Easy to commute as they provide can facility.  It was just that night shifts were lill but sickening.
