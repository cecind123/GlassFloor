rating,review
bad,No a good place to work unless you lack motivation and really need a job.  Not a professional atmosphere and the pay is very low.  Management has favorites and lacks experience.  It felt like I was at romper room!
bad,"They don't post jobs.  Supervisors just promote ""friends"".  Do nothing for their employees.   Turnover rate is very high.    Bathroom breaks are even an issue."
bad,"ABSOLUTELY THE MOST AWFUL PLACE TO WORK!!!  They have such a HUGE turnover rate, because of the way hey treat their employees."
bad,"Management belittles employees and lies when you try the open door policy. Lots of harassment and very political culture. Hard work only pays off for some employees, very shady commission practices.  Sometimes the pay in sales can be good. Run, it's just not worth it"
bad,For a phone job it is not so bad. It is tough to do for a long time.
bad,"Typical day at work....clock in, sit down, log in and put on headphones.  Not allowed to have conversation with co-workers next to you.  Lunch, 45 min. Back to work.  Sit down, put on headphones and do not talk to anyone for several hours.  You are paid by the piece so you only get paid for applications that get processed.  Not enough work or main frame goes down?  Your loss on your pay check.  No advancement.  4 of the 6 people on my row had college degrees and are typing for a living.  Pay was less than $11 per hour.  It is hard to keep moral up I am sure, for the supervisors, with these kind of working conditions."
bad,"Some co-workers are great others are down right mean cruel and unethical. They will email and call you slurs as well as one female manager. The hours are late and one female manager gives favors for employees that can do personal things for her. The work environment is negative and morale very low. The pay is misrepresented sometimes. Breaks are not frequent, you will get wrote up if it takes you too long in the restroom. The same female manager really belittles employees and there is no effective open door policy for her behavior. One bad manager left and was replaced with another. If you keep to yourself and work through breaks and lunches, you can tolerate it for a while."
bad,"If you are looking for a company that is a highly charged political culture, has departmental infighting, and weak management, then this is the place for you!  "
bad,"Numerous employees, constantly on the phone, you had to receive & handle a quota on incoming calls or it would affect your pay, it was more like a revolving door. Very stressful."
bad,Not a particularly diverse company. To advance in this organization you have to be a family member of an executive.
bad,Very poor management and not much career advancement.  I worked at the corporate office and never once saw the CEO in 1.5 yrs.  The execs have their own personal chefs upstairs so they would never have to socialize with the common employee.
bad,"Management in upper levels could be"
bad,"While the non-IT departments seemed to have at least competent management, IT management from the top down were among the least competent group of individuals I've encountered in over 20 years in IT.  From an unwillingness to purchase adequate hardware to an inability to understand what SDLC even meant, they failed on every front.  While all development their is harshly Waterfall methodology, they tried to use words like Scrum and Stand-up to give some false sense of an Agile methodology.  Resources were frequently stripped from behind schedule projects, to work on non-essential projects, then the project managers were questioned about why they couldn't deliver.  "
bad,"arrive, sit, no time for go to the bathroom, never find a supervisor when needed. time to lunch, very short, customers 60 percent of the rime angry, not a good place to work."
bad,"During training the pay is 11.00, the matrix on continuing to make 11.00 is quite different. "
bad,"If you like to ""Learn by Fire"" without ANY direction, then this is the place for you!"
bad,"This is an easy part time job but it is pay by piece which is up and down every week. So as long as you are fine with a $200 check one week and $300 the next and $700 the next and $175 the next then by all means apply. Don't take this job if you need a stable part time income. People are super nice and management is as helpful as they can be. The company has no clue how to run efficiently. You will think up 20 questions within the first week of ""how come we don't do it like this, or how come we don't have this?""....get ready because they will not have answers. Also was told that the pay piece rate had not changed in over 5 years but how convenient when i start that they decide to change it up some for different accounts. I'm stuck here for now because not much else out there for part time and hours I need or pay i need but as soon as another door opens i will gladly walk away from this place."
bad,"This is a call center position with no advancement opportunities available. You make and receive calls for people who are applying for low-cost life insurance policies. You document information about their medical histories. No training is provided to help you understand medical conditions (even common ones) or medications so if you don't have a background or interest in medicine, the applicants can get very frustrated with you. There is a total breakdown in communication between the Omaha office and the McKinney, TX home office. If you have questions regarding the processes or guidelines with which you need to do your job, you cannot get a straight answer. What is expected of you changes regularly and the only way you know is that your call quality score is 0. You get paid by the completed application though, so if you're motivated you can make a lot of money."
bad,sitting down all day. extremely repetitive. pay is based on your effort. cafeteria is a big bonus. they sell food almost every day. some breakfast as well.
good,"everybody from the staff to the co workers were friendly, from what I saw. But don't have an allergic reaction to a medicine you are PRESCRIBED TO  because they will fire you if you don't have enough personal day."
good,"Great Insurance training ground."
good,"Easy customer service position, most people are freindley."
good,"The company is very reputable; however the audit manager was very unsteady and very hard to work for. After I left, there was a complete overhaul of the department starting from the top. I can only hope that this was beneficial the those still employed as auditors."
good,"As a person who has had 29 years of customer service, it was for me to not fully assist my customers to the best of my ability with nay and all their questions in under 4.5 min.  Especially when it came to something as serious as life insurance for the elderly, people who can barely read or write.  I felt I was doing them a terrible disservice by rushing them off the phone.  My calls where under 6 minutes, but their goal was 4.5 for all calls, so we agreed to part ways.  They are a pretty good company, and agreed  to give me a good referrence."
good,American Income life is a great place to work and have unlimited opportunities ot advance your career. Only con is that the work life balance is non existent. For a person who is willing to work 60-80 hours a week this is the place to be. Very fun place to work and for the most part you get to make your own schedule. Management is very hands on. The hardest part of the job is the hours
good,The salary should increase due to the overall job responsibility and the turnover is extremely high. The company seems to be hiring quantity not quality.
good,"They were good employers, late on getting work shirts, they're weren't any breaks for the overnight cleaning crew, and they wanted everything done in a certain way in a certain manor"
good,"I don’t want to right a review about this company. They don’t worth my time to right anything about them , this company doesn’t know how to take care of theirs employees, thank You."
good,Good starting place if you are fresh out of high school or college.  Very diversified with employees and different departments for lateral movements.  Ok
good,I work  through pro  staff  at  Torchmark. The company is okay. They really did not care to much  for there employee like most  job do. The supervisor was okay  there too. If you  every need to take off they  was  okay about. Just  be careful when  you  go through  Pro  staff  for a  job.
good,"These are just my individual expriences but this is a good place to start."
good,"Pay is below market, Management is OK. Benefits could need a boost. A decent place to start your career. Work/Life balance is good though."
good,"great work environment, benefits were excellent. Advancement was based on seniority and not merit."
good,"Management is clueless on managing people. They are more like trainers, promoted from doing a specific job well and they are not given the tools/training to be trained on managing the people and environment. "
good,"Work is pretty easy, but boring. The pay (pay-per-piece) is nice if you work hard. I know folks with much more difficult jobs getting paid less than I do. Benefits are great. "
good,"A typical day consists of juggling multiple high priority projects, meeting demanding deadlines, and working 9+ hours.  The management is understanding and tries to meet the employee needs, but upper exec management pushes for tight deadlines, which makes it impossible for middle-management to provide any slack.  Co-workers are great, and enjoyable to be around.  A lot of the times people stay stressed due to the deadlines and the short time lines that you are pressured to adhere to.  The most enjoyable part of the job are my peers."
good,a typical day at work clock in take my seat and start taking calls any where from 100 to 120 calls a day management for the most part was always good with helping you on the phone or with any problems
good,I learned a lot working customer service with Torchmark. I was able to learn great skills such as conflict resolution with customers and helping my fellow co workers to move forward in their jobs as well.
good,"Hard work was promoted, promoting Torchmark to potential candidates was easy and effortless."
good,"Having come into this company as a temp worker I have worked in different departments. Some have bad management and the job is hard and they treat you badly (data entry, QAC, customer service). Some have good managemt and the job is challenging but the people are good. There is opportunity to advance if you work hard and are skilled. And yes, nepotism runs rampant. Overall Torchmark is a good company. Not many places offer pensions these days."
good,"my years spent working at this company has been very rewarding, i would recommend this company to anyone who is up for a very challenging experience in helping customers."
good,"Torchmark was a good company. No micro managing, and pretty relaxing day to day. Supervisors don't really talk to you unless you initiate the conversation."
good,"100% management of your own book of business.  Ability to build manage and maintain strong, long last, business relationships.  Ability to develop professionally."
good,Torchmark is a great company to work for-management is great-the work is always interesting
good,"Wonderful co-workers, great pay, long hours, plenty short breaks, awesome work environment, amazing boss. The hours are great if you are looking for full time work. The pay period is bi-weekly. The checks are really worth the wait."
good,I have worked in several different call centers and this was by far the best. Management was professional and very nice and approachable at all times.
good,"Family atmosphere, challenging and many opportunities for advancement.  I love the employee appreciation activities that they plan."
good,Torchmark was a very fun environment as a workplace. The management was good and the workplace cultural was wonderful i couldn't ask for something more enjoyable than a work place like torchmark.
good,"The job may have been repetitive and mundane, but it was very easy money and the people that worked there where very friendly. Management wants you to succeed."
good,"A typical work day at TorchMark was talking with customers on the phone and verifying personal health information with them."
good,"Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,i love the job my supervisor is fun my co worker are a blast i relly enjoy working for this company they are understanding and willing to work with you and your schedule
good,I know this position pay by piece and it is way better than the start hourly pay which is 11 dollars an hour. At this position you can easily make 16.00-17.00 an hour if your work hard. If there is no work the time is adjusted by your regularly for that pay week. If you are consistent they know how much you earn hourly. Plus you can also work overtime time and make more money.
good,"this job helped me learn great phone etiquette. It was a very easy job, my training was great, I rarely had to ask management for help with a customer."
