rating,review
bad,The environment at this company is toxic.You will not be valued in your position. Management doesn't train. You will be set up for failure. Then reprimanded later on your performance.
bad,"That’s all I can say at the time the manager of the store had limited experience and many mental health issues that made her a nightmare to work for. Would not recommend this store to anyone if the salon manager and store manager are the same as when I worked there. No flexibility, no support from team, store was always a mess our own store leader killed small animals by neglect. Poor selection  of products and services also."
bad,"On a typical day, the job is okay but management feels they know it all and end up making everyone's job more difficult than it has to be when they can't even do their own job correctly. Don't ever make the mistake and go beyond what is asked of you because it will go unappreciated. They only care about sales and never about the employee's well being. Customers are very rude and racist. Communication from upper management needs a significant amount of improvement and has to learn how to take responsibility instead of pointing fingers."
bad,"Lot of bs with management u do more then u get paid 4 the manager thar now "
bad,Pet Hotel management just terrible. Racism. Management treat doggie day camp like employees are in prison. They are lazy. Make workers do their job while they are on their phone. Gossip. So much more.
bad,"The salon crew is young, unfriendly, and always seems annoyed! They never smile nor greet you and they are closed off from the store completely! Need a attitude makeover! Maybe new management?"
bad,Petsmart is a horrible place to work. The CEO of the company is just a big bully and the management is horrible. All they care about is pushing their rewards program and making sales. Employees are poorly trained and lack basic knowledge of animal care. Not to mention the animals are brought in in poor conditions.
bad,"I dont reccomend  working there, management is only interested in getting people to work for the least amount if money, if they don't like you they will look for and FIND a way to get you out !!!"
bad,"So i can't speak for the rest of the store, because i never worked that part. But what i do know is that no one should ever take their pets in for grooming. I have seen first hand that they treat the animals with little to no respect, often hurting them just to get the job done."
bad,"•doesn’t help you, just criticizes"
bad,"PetSmart acts as if they care about their animals in house, but unfortunately this is not the case. After working at 2 locations for over 2 years, I couldn't handle the emotional distress caused by constantly seeing animals for sale get sick/die or having animals returned for the same reason. The company does not allow enough staff or time to allow proper care for these poor critters."
bad,The employees are great to work with it’s the managers there rude they put a lot of pressure bout sales instead of the animals and petsmart is bout animals not Sales
bad,"Management lies, corporate not any help with obvious management problems. Targets older, loyal, responsible and honest employees. Management has it's own agenda, employees not an important part of that agenda"
bad,"There wasn't a set schedule, you could get off work at 9pm and have to be back at 3am, customers were meaner and more viscious than their pets. When First learning the register, I was insulted, screamed at, and spit on."
bad,"The management does NOT listen to advice employees give about their animals health. I told my manager that a baby guinea pig had pneumonia, i sent videos of the guinea pig to 3 different guinea breeders whom agreed the baby guinea pig indeed had pneumonia. He told me the guinea pig was fine, the next day the guinea pig was dead. The also had on the label for the mice “Male mice can be together, they can but only before puberty and IF they are from the same litter. I explained this to him yet nothing changed. I was always under extreme pressure and stress every time I work, I was treated as if I were less than dirt. They don’t schedule you within the hours you tell them you can work and theg also don’t schedule you the days you provide. In the 2 months I worked their FIVE employees left because of the management. I was told we are not allowed to tell customers that we do price-match with certain companies because they want the customers to have to pay their inflated prices. My work was strictly being a cashier yet they were understaffed(because of management)yet they would have me stocking and front-facing the ENTIRE STORE! I hated it their because they DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR ANIMALS! I also went into the cat room one night after I had front faced to tell the cats goodnight and give them some attention because volunteers only come twice a day.Well apparently that’s not allowed and I almost got fired for it, they NEVER told me that i couldn’t go in there. Since the cat room key was in the drawer at the register I believed there would be nothing wrong with it. If you actually"
bad,Unrealistic expectations coupled with ornery regional managers and stubborn/angry store managers lead to a very bad place to work. The managers would not listen to reason even when you definitely knew better. You got treated like you were dumb for asking questions.
bad,"Gave this company years of my life, worked a few different positions and locations and even at the corporate office only to realize that I was completely replaceable. I was taught and given the duties of the next promotion I was in order for, but never given the final walk to promote me and give me the pay raise I deserved. I was cussed at by management, shamed for taking sick time that I had PTO to cover, PTO I had earned. The best thing I got from this company was the title to be able to add to my resume."
bad,"the first time i started working there i loved every moment of it, after i got promoted and started working more and more, i noticed that the managers would not care about their employees. every time an employee under my leadership had a concern i tried my best to help them out. the managers would never help out, and would scold me for doing my job as a leader. I've seen more people come and go from this store more than any other job I've ever had. employees would create problems for each other for no reason. management would never listen to your concerns, also they would give appreciation to employees that do not commit to company standards. Managers would treat me badly, never trained me the correct way, neither ever helped me succeed in advancing or help me in my struggles. I would not recommend anyone to work there. it's a disgrace to the company. I bet the founder or the company would be sad how PetsMart went from family and pet values to not caring about their employees and just making profit. DO NOT WORK HERE!!"
bad,"HR supports managers over associates, allows retaliation and forces resignations. Store management is awful, favoritism is rampant. Constantly will insist on work outside job description and not compensate. Not promote from within those who are qualified, rather those with no experience."
bad,"The managers were awful and incredibly immature. A couple were okay but there was no confidentiality there, EVERYONE gossiped. They have no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to animal care and they couldn’t care less about the animals. They care about the money, not even the employees. HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK 10/10 would NOT recommend."
bad,"My experience with petsmart was extremely horrible due to the discrimination that I faced. I was held back professionally due to management only promoting their own kind and I’vei tried to take a stand my hours were shortened and then when I decided to take my leave, fired"
bad,"I worked for PetSmart for many years, worked my way up into management. Had full availability but soon came to realize the management team didn't support themselves and were incapable of taking care of their staff. My team of managers would say horrible things about the staff, as well as other managers behind their backs. Communication was always lacking."
bad,I have no words really. There was a bunch that happen started a year ago with the Human Resources. And from there well. Lets say. He wanted to say his part. And I didn't even spare my time. Or even get into it.it was not worth it. For me to explain or stand up for my self. It was after the fact how poorly I was treated.
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked in my life.  The only good part was getting to pet the customer's dogs - and the day I walked out the door.  Run like your hair is on fire.
bad,"No hours for employees, always blamed for not getting tasks done with little hours given. Many animals were not taken care of properly and no follow ups were issued to fix small animal deaths that ensued. Managers were very toxic in their demeanor as well talking down or belittling employees through various scenarios that life could bring up. Did not care about some employees mental states and some mental abuse occurred between a manager and employee as well. Also the higher up managers would take credit for work done around the store and not refer the people who did exceptional work properly. In closing, very lazy management, not enough hours or pay for cost of living (during my final weeks I was averaging $100 a week instead of the $600 I was when I first started), and  some signs of verbal/mental abuse if jobs were not done correctly."
bad,"This is a HORRIBLE place to work, the managers are ALL CHILDISH, they show favoritism, they don’t acknowledge your hard work, they expect you to do things way out of your position, they cut your hours even more when you don’t get enough hours, they complain about giving you more hours but they give the full timers double the hours, there’s no respect. I advise NO ONE to apply to Petsmart, especially the one in Pelham."
bad,Was horrible the managers all play head games. Was scheduled for part time 4hr stocking shifts. Was expected to get one pallet of merchandise worked in an hour but was getting written up for not finishing the truck. Truck would come in with 16 pallets and I was only scheduled for four hours
bad,"The grooming salon had the worst groomers. They are all extremely malicious, toxic, racist, sexist, and full of hatred towards every bather in the salon and even against each other. In the beginning they pretend to be good, friendly, people, but then it's like they flip a switch and suddenly you're in a grooming salon full of a bunch of rabid wolves trying to rip you apart for no reason other than jealousy and self hatred. The managers weren't any better because they just sat and watched you fight off the wolves and wouldn't take any of your complaints about them seriously. The employees there act like they are still in high school by gossiping about, tricking, manipulating, gaslighting, and harassing others. Whereas management would allow this to happen and would do their best to get you in trouble so that they could fire you in order to keep you quiet about the harmful work environment in the grooming salon. To make matters worse you are not paid nearly enough for the work they make you do (along with the work the groomers will push onto you so they don't have to do their own work) and yet you're expected to bare through it and meet their ridiculous sales quotas.They try to make it seem like the pay you are getting is okay by giving you a 25 cent raise AFTER A YEAR as if to say, ""See? we pay you well! you even got a raise! you're welcome now stop complaining."" So, do not work at this location if you want to keep your sanity because this place is a literal mad house full of crazies and horrible people who should not be allowed to live in this society.(Oh and the crazy groomers"
bad,Store manager tells teammates to do things she won't do herself. Such as taking care of some of the animals. Hours are inconsistent and they keep hiring people. Not worth my time so I quit for better paying and better hours.
bad,"Since the company changed ownership 5 years ago, the moral has gone down. It is no longer the place to work to gain valuable retail knowledge. On top of it, they treat their animals very poorly. Multiple animals would get sick in their care but the higher ups did not find it suitable to bring them to the vet due to the low cost of the animal. Grooming department needs to close. COuntless dogs either getting cut or hurt in their care."
bad,A typical day at work depends on where you are in the company and the management. But it was stressful and sometimes painful. Management didn't even care to listen to the employees as they knew they wouldn't stay long.
bad,A typical day of work would be getting yelled at by customers.  The blame game from Management.  Working hard gave you more responsibilities with no room for advancements.  Loved working with the animals and some customers.
bad,You can always find better and be more respected depending on the location you do go to people really didn’t get hours they deserve or wanted plus the people that was there longer got more hours
bad,"Don’t work for petsmart. Underpaid with terrible scheduling, horrible management, and they hire any job blow off the street. You make barely minimum wage."
bad,"Hours are inconsistent, poor management, not enough pay, retail is not a good environment, very demanding. Don't recommend it especially if you have a college degree"
bad,"Poor management, understaffed all the time, staff not treated with respect, low pay, inconsistent hours and days, managers played favors with staff, treated poorly"
bad,"Working at PetSmart was enjoyable in the beginning until management went downhill. Only one manager was amazing, however she alone could not create a good working atmosphere when all other managers would create drama or did not do any work themselves and just talked amongst themselves."
bad,"Do not work here if you care about animals! Management is terrible. Do not expect them to work around your availability, they will schedule you times you can’t work. If you want to work more than 12 hours a week don’t expect it from them. Management has no respect for employees. They all claim to care about animals but do not give them adequate living conditions and most wind up dead. Honestly the worst job I have ever had."
bad,"Very poor management, abuse/ neglect of animals, very great coworkers but a lot of unnecessary drama. Very little pay/ reward for all of the hard work associates put in."
bad,"Don't explain job description changes"
bad,They weren't friendly and they fired over a manager making a suspicious decision on a receipt return. The hours were randomly assigned any where from 8am-1pm or 5pm-10pm
bad,"I only worked at Petsmart for a short period of time , but I cannot say there was any sort of workplace culture. As a cashier the main duty is to process customer purchases, return items and process pet salon vouchers."
bad,"This company scams people. They over inflate the prices. The groomers treat the dogs badly. They do not care about their employees, their customers or the animals"
bad,"Sales was a very important part of working here, which could be very stressful at times.  Customers were very picky, there was no limit to how many dogs a day we would have to work on."
bad,"Store is a joke, they don't know how to give employees hours even if they've worked there a year. Never have a schedule on time, always last minute. Pay isn't the best. Honestly worst place I have ever worked at. They make you feel like you are nothing, they honestly do not care about employees that they hire. I've worked with a lot of people for a few months then they quit only to replaced a week later with someone else who doesn't last."
bad,"The place used to be about animals; now it’s not.     I worked here for 5.5yrs and wasn’t ever given a raise, numerous promised.    Didn’t multiple jobs(manager, cleaner, stocker, bather) and nothing to show for it.    This company was better when it was super pet.     Terrible management, WORSE district leaders, and equipment that fails constantly , oh we know the animals are sick, but we’re told to sell them still!"
bad,I don't know that all petsmarts are bad. However I do know the one in Manteca has managers who honestly don't care about the workers just about the money that goes in their pocket.
bad,"Work here if you"
bad,"Bad co-workers I was very uncomfortable,they made me feel lile I wasn't ment it I be there as a groomer like I was some joke ,I feel like I wasn't seen as an equal"
bad,"They don't really care about the safety of the animals. most coworkers were fine, just the company didn't have the right safety precautions and they paid workers unfairly. also, management harassed employees and scheduled people unfairly (i.e. same levels employees some having 10 hours some 40 hours)."
bad,PetSmart Grooming was the single worst job I've ever had. You have a bunch of suits trying to run a side of the business they have NO experience running. Rules and regulations in the salon make no sense but they will still push you to groom more and more and more and more and then you'll get in trouble for overtime or incidents. Management at both stores I've worked with was laughable at best.
bad,"Management makes employees feel as if they are bothering them or getting on their nerves. Does not care much about their employees only cares about the money. Management gossips a lot which keeps a lot of things going on in the salon and causes drama. Very very Poor management, would not recommend working here. This particular petsmart has went through 13 employees within the last year."
bad,They only care about the all mighty dollar. They dont care about there employee and try to push certian brands on customers. Never enough staff on the floor
bad,"Terrible experience, doesnt care about the pets or the employees, doesn't care about promoting women or people who pursue high education. I tried to utilize HR about a very bad management situation and no one cared. I wish I hadn't wasted 3 years of my life working here."
bad,"It’s not a terrible place but you definitely put up with a lot of junk when you work here. Animals before people so God forbid something happens to a human, they will not care at all."
bad,"poor management, i'm the best worker yet they give me 8 hours a week and im a student plus i have open availability. also the mangers play favorites. this job you can't live off."
bad,"This is a poor company to work for; they expect you to do so much but always have safely in the back of your mind. Management is very poor also they do not show compassion when you need to call out for a family emergency or you're just sick; they still have the nerve to ask if you're feeling better come on in. There is so much stress for the employees and managers only care about the next buck."
bad,"There are no morals in this store. They treat animals no better than merchandise that can be easily replaced if they die. "
bad,Petsmart was one of the worst places I have ever worked for. Very unprofessional and all they care about are making sales quotas and not about the employees or pet parents.
bad,"Management fires you if you question their animal care. I own many animals and am studying to be a vet, once I started working here I noticed that the reptile tanks were always dirty, the birds hardly ever had food and the small mamals had injuries. I tried cleaning the tanks but I was told not to worry about something that isnt my job and to just stay at the register. By the end of the month I was fired for ""refusing"" to clean the store. A few months later the manager was fired too."
bad,This place is ran like a Chinese sweat shop you take back to back calls all day the call flow is unrealistic for pet parents that have already been with us they don’t care about there employees at all they expect you to take calls all day and not get overwhelmed or burnt out and when you do it’s a sign of weakness they ask for feed back but don’t actually use it to better the center the hr is a snake the hiring manager is crazy and when you ask questions she don’t like she’ll take you in her office and intimidate you and tell you if you don’t do it her way you’ll loose your job over all this is the worst place to work
bad,"Crazy call flow, supervisors are always pulled to do other things all the time, hardly there to helping their teams,  Leads are Left to help everyone and over worked, and not paid for all they do, Managers are a joke and the blonde is a snake, the older lady can be very rude, very Unrealistic goals to meet, best employee all quit due to being stressed out or got fired and the ones still there don’t wanna be there,, QA is a mess,"
bad,"Worked here for 3 years. Sold alot of product for the company (selling big tanks). Was promised I would get a raise every 6 mo and got two .10 raises in 3 years. Management is horrible. Will treat employees unfairly/ discriminate against workers. If u have an issue, good luck. Employees do not respect each other."
bad,"I was bitten by dogs on a daily basis, whenever i needed to take a day off it would always be a big fuss, they constantly cut back my hours. I wasn't able to care for my son working 5 hours a day, so i had to quit. I would not recommend working here"
bad,The store manager is something else.. I've been a pretty loyal employee for roughly two years he talks down to me and treats me awful  sometimes I dont even want to go to work when he is there. He has denied me a higher paying position twice. First time he gave it to a new girl knowing full well I was interested and didn't even consider interviewing me. The second chance rolls around this time I get interviewed but it didn't matter since he told the employee he was interviewing he got the job without even giving me a chance. I'm currently looking for a new job because I am way underappreciated at this one.
bad,when i first started to work for pet smart it was a great place to work.  they cared about their employees and animals in their care.  after they sold it was only about money.  we were told if the vet bill exceeded the animals value (most were only ($9.99-$15.99) we had to have them euthanized.  they kept cutting hours and putting more and more work on the managers.  i would not recommend working for this company as it stands today.
bad,"The company is behind and backs up computer forms with multiple paper forms. Most of the time is spent trying to fill out the paperwork when it’s right in the computer.  None of the systems talk to each other so you have to go to several different places to fill out one form. "
bad,I enjoyed petsmart to an extent. But once the most recent assistant manager took over it just went down hill. Hours were cut because you werent her favorite. Or if they had no one scheduled for someones lunch time they would schedule someone who lived 30 minutes away to come in for an hour of work
bad,"The location I worked in was horrible. It's very understaffed, as a cashier I would be on the register by myself with lines that went to the back of the store. The Assistant manager was incompetent; he would schedule me for closings""literally"" every week until I left. Furthermore, he would forget to assign a opening cashier because he didn't know how to allot hours properly. Since we were understaffed customers were very irate and rude. This is because of the long lines and excessive waiting. Also, we left extremely late because the manager would schedule 3 people to close out a store that's about 15,000 square feet,( in other words a very big store with very little manpower.)"
bad,The company is money hungry and treats its employees like slaved.  Management is terrible and nothing is ever done about it.  They don’t pay enough and drastically cut your pay if you don’t sell enough in commission that week.
bad,"I have been a employee for the past year and 3/4 months. The store overall is fantastic. When I started last year, the management was absolutely perfect. I started February 2018. Since February 2018, many changes came around. Management changed. The whole store went down hill. By that, I mean, I can name up to 15+ employees that has left since February 2018 that have been there for either 6 months, 2 years, or up to 6 years because of the new management. The management is very unprofessional. Again, the store overall is fantastic, but management is awful; and unprofessional. And their customer service is awful.  This would NOT be a place I recommend to work. Also this place can no longer hold a staff. We lost 5 people in the salon back to back and could not hold a salon manager. We’ve went through 2 salon managers the past 4 months and we’ve went through 15+ people in retail the last year over the new management, if that tells you anything. This review is mainly for anyone looking for a job here. Just a warning. I’m not the person to leave a job and I wanted to make a career out of Petsmart. But along with 15+ employees that left this job because of management; I was one of them."
bad,"Management sucks, pay sucks. You are expected to do more things than any 1 person can actually do and dont get paid enough to do it. The company doesnt care about the employee or the customers or the pets...they only care about money and sales."
bad,I was employed as a bather- the grunt job of the salon- answered calls- gave dogs baths- cleaned kennels- did nail files- basically did all the work the groomers did not want to do - for $8 and hour while they made 50% commission on everything-was promised a chance to go to grooming school after a few months as a bather- NOT happening- worked all weekends- never missed any time- ultimately to be lied to - every time a position would open for groomer- someone else was hired from the outside-
bad,"Petsmart grooming is easily the worst work experience any groomer can go through. Sure, get your base training there and then leave. You are selling yourself short in the grooming industry if you continue to work for this company. They hire ill-equipt management and corporate doesn't care about your job or well-being at all. You will hit a wall with your skill level and will not advance personally or within the company. There are other places you can work that offer full benefits. Consider a vet. I work for a vet now making $1100-1500/week and have full health, dental, vision, and PTO, and weekends off. I only talk to clients briefly in the morning to discuss haircut and that's it. Front desk does all check in and check out and appointments/phone calls. Petsmart's service side is going under anyway. Leave and stop allowing this company to exploit your skilled labor."
bad,"the manager is the worst manager you will ever meet, she doesn't do her job but rather wanders around complaining all day. they do not take care of the animals what so ever and just lie to customers about the animals experience. animals are often taken to the vet for various reasons at the customers expense. as an employee you will be written up for not ""doing your job"" if you do things properly. they do not like if you ""take too long"" which actually means taking care of the animals in simple cases; providing water to the dogs or cleaning their cages if they have accidents in them. they also cut back the walk times for the dogs to go the washroom because they won't spend the time waiting and then lie to the customers. do not work here, there is so much animal abuse."
bad,"The management at the particular location I worked at was awful, they did not care about employee safety at all. The pay was low and the hours sucked but I knew that going into the role of a stocker at a pet store. The thing I was unprepared for was how cavalier the managers would be about employee safety. The final straw was when management insisted we unload a truck during a black out with handheld lanterns, I couldn't work in a place that disregarded employee safety to that extent, operating a pallet jack one handed is unsafe and operating a forklift in low visibility could get someone killed."
bad,"Management is horrendous. They bully and belittle their employees. I had the manager of my own department of pet care ask me how to do certain tasks. People coming in with ZERO experience would make more by the hour than me. Very cliquey environment. Staff gossips to other staff members and management, very unprofessional and it creates a hostile work environment. If you are a hard worker run away because your efforts won’t be rewarded, you will be picking up everyone else’s slack."
bad,"New management and current management are terrible. They Make you feel like you’re unable to do your job. They will pick you out personally. Hypocritical, unreasonable, and disrespectful and I will never return."
bad,"the newest store manager harassed me terribly after i left the job while i was pregnant, i almost needed a restraining order. he would be sure to tell everyone in the store to be awful to me because of made up things he told them."
bad,"Management seemed like they didn't know how to run the company nor did they listen to their employees. Instead of helping you better yourself and your associates, they would rather show you the door. Would not recommend working in this establishment to my worst enemy. Unfortunately, I could not leave willingly due to expenses."
bad,"If you like your manager just sitting around smoking 2 packs of cigarettes per shift, and not backing you. The. Petsmart is the perfect job for you!!!"
bad,"I worked stock in the morning, a very hard job. you had a very limited to complete your work, sometimes you had to come in at 3AM. Working as a teem was the only good part of the job."
bad,managers are scum  who do not care about the animals. half the associates all have intimacy   in the back and the dog trainer is a pedo LOL wouldn’t suggest working here unless you like rude managers and a hostile environment
bad,Don't ever work here. They do not give workers enough hours. Management is mean and nasty. The is a lot of favoritism. Worst job ever! Never work here.
bad,If you are a dog groomer and are looking for somewhere to work then please don’t work here. I love my job but this place is insane. The managers only care about the money and never about their groomers.
bad,I've worked at 2 stores and got the same treatment at both. I met my current boyfriend at the last store I was at and I ended up pregnant and all of a sudden they started getting abusive and degraded us. They threatened us the whole time and when I told the manager I wanted to quit she told me I wasnt allowed. I walked out. They never helped me with anything. I'm not trying a 3rd petsmart.
bad,I was a manager on duties and was held at gun point in the store. I was asked to step down because they thought I would not be able to handle the store after. I walked away after the insult. I was also asked to come back to work right away and nit take any days off. I was also blamed for the robbery. A court date fixed that.
bad,Poor management . They do not care for their employees. Training in the pet hotel is done by other employees. Harassment by senior leaders in a negative way. Never positive.   Have worked in several places as a kennel attendant and have never been in a poorly run place as this. Many injurys to employees with no regard to them. They always promote do the right thing ! What a crock! Had four injuries and never was asked once how I was doing. To many dogs in a small area and dog fights constantly. That's what happens when you put to many dogs in a small area for lengths of time. Also dogs that should not be put on cement floors and have to be there all day.  Employees also and can't sit down but we have a choice we can leave.
bad,"Terrible management. Terrible work culture. Over worked and underpaid. Upper management were all drama and never backed up their own mistakes. Upper management harassment and mood swings. No back up when department needed help. Flooding in grooming and employees were forced to continue to bathe dogs while standing in ankle deep water. Upper management would gossip to lower ranked employees about other employees and caused the employees who were being talked about much trouble. Drama ."
bad,expected to do EVERYTHING and when you cannot they fire you on trumped up accusations.   the place is a joke and there are no consequences and when you reprimand someone they take it out on the manager
bad,"I worked at PetSmart twice in my life, and both times it was the worst job I ever had. The management is always a terrible joke. Not only did one manager nit pick and complain about everything I did, and would tell me to do things I was already doing, but another one came at me for my private FB postings. PRIVATE. And didn't mention where I worked or any names. So why come at me about it? That's 2 bad managers. The third, is a little petulant child who yelled at me in front of customers because they didn't give me the proper training I needed and didn't know something. It was very real, and she was made to apologize, which she did with a sneer and walked out to smoke. They were understaffed but instead of hiring new people they had me working in 2 different departments simultaneously. I have an anxiety disorder and after a panic attack, they never checked on me, just sent my paychecks in the mail. The first time I worked there, I was being paid $1 less than my male coworkers and a female coworker put a death threat in my locker which management did nothing about. Can I mention anymore about how many bad managers they have??? There's a ""sick"" room in the back where neglected sick animals die. Wish I took pictures. Don't apply here, they also never worked with me and my hours as I have a lot of DR appts. Seemed like I could never tell them in time even if it was 2 weeks away. Just gave me attitude every time. The managers are like a clique of HS girls bullying others. Grow up. Not a nice place to work at all. And I did my BEST. I have a 2 year old to support, I tried my hardest"
bad,"They insult you on a constant basis, and when you make it know or go to management, they wont care, instead they write you up. They turn a blind eye to all the negativity done there. DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ITS EMPLOYEES!!"
bad,Management only cares about sales and not the health of animals. They swept animal deaths under the rug and  the cages are not big enough for any of the animals!
bad,"I worked in the grooming salon as a bather. the issue wasn't that it was fast paced because that didn't bother me. My salon manager never did their job and would constantly comment on everyone else when they weren't doing their jobs either. They would constantly swear at the dogs and comment on how much they hated them. Bathers were expected to have 8 dogs a day and answer the phone, do walk ins, and all the cleaning while the groomers just stood around and did nothing. Groomers weren't allowed to do walk ins even if the bathers were busy. All the groomers were stuck up and had preferences to what kind of dogs they were scheduled. Some times groomers would steal bathers tips even tho groomers made commission and bathers made next to nothing. The store ASM would come in the grooming salon to stand around and would get grossed out when a dog would even try to touch them. We had a new groomer that ended up hurting multiple dogs and still wasn't fired. when you complained to HR about a manager HR would go tell that manager who complain about them."
bad,"Head office has unrealistic expectations in regard to employee quoatas in the grooming salon, they also require all groomer trainees to sign an non-competition contract before they will train you as a groomer. Now, before I get into everything else if you want to become a Pet Groomer DO NOT GO TO PETSMART! The training PetSmart offers is extremely mediocre, and does not touch on nearly enough. If you want to learn to be a groomer nothing beats an apprenticeship at a quality salon! "
bad,I was treated like absolute garbage the whole time. Lots of discrimination and threatening my job being taken from me due to my mental disability. Constantly hostile work place.
bad,Very abused animals. Low hours low pay just no I don’t recommend anyone work at Petsmart ever. The discount sucks you get %50 off of low quality food and %15 off of good products
bad,"I thought at first working for PetSmart would be a good job while I finish my collage classes, but as soon as I started I realized that the management had some serious problems. If you work in petcare you have a list of jobs to do during your shift and if you had time after those jobs were done you helped with stock. While we would struggle getting our jobs done, helping customers, and doing stock the assistant store manager would be sitting in the office eating snacks and playing games on her phone! But would get mad if we went to back to get a drink of water. It’s very discouraging to always be told you did not do a good enough job at a task or not even get thanked for coming in on a day off or staying longer in a shift. This has got to be one of the worst job experiences I have ever had in my life and I would never recommend someone to ever work here ever."
bad,"It was awful. They seen to prefer management/employees that can not even manage themselves... And SL, ASL, and even basic key holders walk around with a bone to pick and definitely too much make-up. Just saying if you do the hard work there your face would wash off."
bad,The store manager is horrible lazy and never compliments you only if she likes you .She would find a way to get you fired .I was there for 13 years and when she came to be store manager everything went down hill. She went out of her way to get me fired.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at this company unless you are a student just trying to get through school. They will not treat you properly nor reward you for hard work. Constantly under pressure from management to perform without any type of motivation.
bad,"So Much shady stuff happens at Petsmart. They have no actual nutritional knowledge about pet food because nothing sold at Petsmart is premium dog food. "
bad,Not a good place to work.  Always looked down upon by management if you are unable to reach their unreasonable goals.  Never praised for accomplishing goals.
bad,"If you kiss up in this company, you'll go far. If you don't, forget it. You have to be a favorite to get any kind of good wage. "
bad,"I was hired on with the promise of being full time. That was almost a year ago, but instead they transferred someone behind my back at the last second before they made me full time, which still am not full time. No benefits even though they have me work crazy hours, some weeks I'm lucky to get over 30 hours, but usually always under 30. Even if you show how badly you want to advance, managers dont care unless its convenient for them (for example if someone quits). I am cross trained with everything in the store except management, so they except me to work even harder for less pay. Definitely not a job for the long run unless you can get into management, but even then... the AOL or lead associate complains all the time about how much pressure gets put on all the managers from the store manager. "
bad,"I worked at Petsmart for 7 months in the grooming salon. After 5 months I was evaluated to go to grooming academy (#1 reason I took the job) I busted my butt for 5 months to try and get into this school, due to the fact that all my bills were behind from only being part time. It was impossible to try and find a second job that would work around a COMPLETELY different schedule every week. So in November of 2018 I was told that I passed my evaluation, but that there were 8 people and only 7 spots in this particular class, and that since I was the last one to get hired, I was guaranteed a spot in the January class. I was fine with that, I understood. Once it was December, they told me the class got pushed back to February, again I’m fine with that, because I have a locked in spot... then January rolls around and they say it will be sometime in March. I’m frustrated but I still have my spot. Well now it’s been a few months since I’ve been evaluated and they want to evaluate me again. I agree, because I’m pretty confident I will pass..... I don’t. She failed me claiming I did not brush a dog out & I explained that I did, while she was talking to the salon leader instead of watching me to evaluate me fully. She said she would come back that following Wednesday and “give me another chance” so she comes back & I pass with ALL 100’s on EVERYTHING. So I’m convinced I’m in the clear & im packing my bags to ship out to academy. Well a few days later the same woman comes to evaluate another bather, that started in November AFTER I was first evaluated. Just to sum it up at this point, they"
bad,"Managers promote an environment of cut throat competition between team members. If you are not willing to be involved in petty gossip and back stabbing then you are an outcast and will become the target for their bad behavior. Managers are ruthless and every employee that enters their office comes out crying. Although they call it coaching it is cruel harassment of vulnerable people."
bad,My first day there no one knew that I was starting that day. The manager never told them and had no idea where to put me. I was never on the schedule. I'd get a call when to go in. When I called no one knew when I go in. Week later I got a call asking why I never showed up and that they dont need me anymore.
bad,Petsmart is stressful work place to work the management is terrible they do not  appreciate the work and time that you put in the company they always find a Reason to write you up for something you did or did not do it’s just a horrible place to work it and I wish I never work there  I don’t recommend no person to work or shop at Petsmart stores
bad,I'm sure there are plenty of stores that are great to work at. If you love animals you would love petsmart . You can work with lots of different kinds of animals.
bad,"Management would be more effective if they hired chimpanzees at half the cost. Didn't see a department manager for 4 hours on a 6 hour work day. No code for unprofessional language or scheduled breaks every 2 hours. Worked 8 days without taking a lunch. Lazy, inconsistent, uncaring, and incompetent."
bad,"I learned plenty working here, mostly that the managers dont care about their employees at all and when you have multiple people contact head office they do nothing still despite them breaking mutiple policies and procedures and endangering staff on a regular basis"
bad,"If i could give this job a -100 i would. I feel like garbage every time i go, i am NEVER treated with respect. I use to cry every single time i go, and now im just numb to it. They really dont care about you unless you are a happy person 24/7.i hope to god a person who thinks about working there thinks twice because you will not like your life. Please save yourself do NOT work here."
bad,The people who work here show that they do not truly care for the animals because the cleaning and feeding schedules are not followed properly leaving the animals without food and with soiled bedding. Then when you bring up these issues to a manager they get upset. I tried to help improve their methods but was only met with hostility. NEVER work here.
bad,"I applied for a certain position and they promise you things. After a week there they started changing things. All they do is lie to you and stab you in the back and talk behind your back. They make you do things you weren’t hired for and not comfortable with. Not only that, I was being harassed by the managers also. They don’t even care about there employees and even the customers."
bad,"Never respected and never acknowledged for work."
bad,I was one of the most successful managers in out district! But they wore me down with too many hours. not enough pay and no support! My numbers were the kind EVERY manager wanted to see!! You guys lost an amazing and dedicated manager!
bad,"That's right, you are unqualified to work for Petsmart if you smoke medical marijuana at home.  What a disgrace!  I hope nobody works for and encourages such foolish behavior on this company's part."
bad,"I was hired as someone who would transfer to animal care because I prefer working with animals, not people. Knowing full well I have anxiety, they stuck me in cashering instead. Not only that but they CUT my hours one week in and after I quit, they did not pay me my full hours I worked. The cherry on top was all the dead animal returns people brought to the counter demanding refunds on poor animals who didnt have a chance because of poor care at Petsmart. I will never support this company again. Shameful!"
bad,"Unless you like working TWO jobs to advance your life this is not the place for you."
bad,"Management has lack of communication, one supervisor screams at people, store manager doesn't help the situation at hand, orientation was not organized or suitable for new workers, no information was told about the job"
bad,"There was no way to find out my schedule in advance each week because the manager would write it on a piece of paper and post it on a bulletin board. Not only that, but she would schedule me outside my hours of availability, and purposely change the schedule last-minute so we didn't know when to show up. It's not bad working in the Pets Hotel when there are just a few dogs, but when you get more than 6 or 7, you see the nastiest things."
bad,Manager do absolutely nothing. The associates carry the company on their back. Safety within the work place is neglected and definitely not taken seriously in the petshotel.
bad,"PetSmart's mission is to ""...bring pet parents closer to their pets so they can live more fulfilled lives"" but they do not demonstrate this for the overworked staff. From their stocking team, to cashiers, to groomers to upper management, this company does not show compassion for the lives of the people they hire.  Many times, I had my hands tied behind my back with a team who lacked respect for their manager and targeted me for my lack of understanding for the company.  I was not given sufficient training.  As an employee from PetSmart, you can expect rude managers who are not empathetic to your life outside of work and the workplace culture is very immature.  From gossip to backtalk to blatant disrespect, it was hard to develop a positive culture."
bad,"Management does not have a clue what they are doing at all, the store a work with has ENTIRELY new staff so the turn over at my store has been close to, if not 100%.  They also hire more staff than are  needed  so nobody gets more than 2 shifts a week and they are not 8 hour shifts its either 5 or 6 hours if youre lucky. They are power controlling little freaks that need to realize they are managing a pet store not the president of the united states."
bad,"Minimal hours (managers will give favourites more regardless go work ethic). "
bad,"I completely regret working here. Disappointing and Discouraging and Disheartening. I found training at PetSmart did not prepare me to work at other grooming salons. Training at this particular location did not even prepare me to work at PetSmart. Applying here was difficult and time consuming, 3+ months including the background check. For some reason I wasn’t getting the all the emails, even though my email address was confirmed by me and accurate. Finally getting through hiring process the computer troubles continued and it was difficult for me to sign in and get started, taking even more time. Getting through that and on to the first day working, tools were not available for me to complete my computer training completely, ie a completely working computer, on the days I was scheduled to do my computer training, the completely working computer was double booked and I was pressured to rush through it anyway, using a computer that had no sound and not being able to listen or watch all the safety and training videos. Starting in the salon, tools were not available for me to do my job, ie a grooming table to work on, so poorly prepared they were for another groomer to work there. Even though they knew over 3 months ahead a new groomer was coming. I felt my own personal grooming tools were not safe as the drawers in my stand did not lock and I was never given a key. The work environment there is anything but calm. Completely chaotic. Toxic. As a new employee the on the job safety training is non existent and if you make any mistakes as a brand new employee they come down on you"
bad,"The grooming department was a joke, They did not care anything about their employees  Much less the co-workers who worked together. All they were was a bunch of fake people who did not like each other and they got away with a bunch of stuff."
bad,"A typical day at work for an apprentice stylist consists of completing full-service bathing appointments for 6-8 dogs (large breed, small breed, anything in between, which means washing, drying, brushing, cleaning ears, trimming or grinding nails, brushing teeth), answering phone calls, setting/cancelling/rescheduling appointments, helping walk-in customers with services such as nail trims, gland expression, ear cleaning/checking dogs in and out. The work itself is sometimes stressful but fine, but the environment is visibly unclean and sometimes tense due to disagreements between coworkers."
bad,"Very hard environment to be in. Store was completely understaffed, lacked every day processes as well as training from managers to regular associates."
bad,"The whole phone call can go right, you gave accurate information, connected with the pet parent and made a reservation but if you notate wrong, say your reservation instead of the reservation you'll be put in your place. They are so tough on the smallest things and will make you feel less than worthy of recognition for what you do right. I've gone home wanting to end my life because I give my all and week after week I'm being told everything I've done wrong and it's never anything that would stop a pet parent from being able to have their pet stay with Petsmart hotel or not want to come back. "
bad,"It may have been only the store I was employed at, however the management was terrible. I would not recommend this as a workplace. It is an unhealthy environment and by far worsened my mental health."
bad,This company was one of the worst companies i have personally ever worked for. There management was never there. The lack of care for the animals that entered the facility was extremely poor. They do not care about the animals what so ever. The staff is not educated enough to provide enough care for the animals they sale.
bad,I was a dog trainer they gave me less than 20 hours a week to work and I didn't make much money.  I also traveled really far for this job.  It was not fun and they didn't care about the animals just making money
bad,"Store manager was horrible to all staff, especially pregnant ones. He wouldn't allow them breaks, and did not care about their medical restrictions. He told a high volume groomer that because she was pregnant she would was now detrimental to the business so she had to either leave or transfer locations."
bad,"It’s a retail job with no work-life balance. I’m tired all the time. I don’t have regular days off, and no one cares to possibly make a regular schedule. Stay away."
bad,I’m not sure about other locations but Stockton location has horrible management. Even the employees were complaining about it. I’m glad I dodged a bullet and stayed at my current job.
bad,Loved what i did working with the animals but the company makes it horrible and will blind side you on anything they can they take advantage of their staff
bad,"terrible store management, no consequences for anyone’s actions even when safety was an issue, no support from the core management. terrible company overall. high turnover rate"
bad,I would not recommend working for Petsmart. THey do not promote from within instead they bring people in who do not know anything about pets and the pet care industry. The pay is also horrible and barely above minumum wage.  Also they keep people on who do not work and give them more hours
bad,Management doesn't care about the employees. They care about the business and nothing else. They take advantage of their workers and only care about the sales.
bad,"I was with the company for a full 9 years as a groomer. The first 5 years or so I really enjoyed it, until they got bought up and had new owners. Management is a constant revolving door. I got paid hardly anything and was treated very poorly along with all our other co workers from management. The grooming academy is a freaking joke now. Dogs are getting injured left and right because they rush people through it so the company can make more money. Also, they want groomers to sell a ridiculous amount of packages and addons, and dont forget emails and, answering phones AND  paperwork and reminder calls, stupid progress reports and hop, in and out, crazy rules they come up with every month.... idk how people stand it..."
bad,Petsmart as a company isn't terrible but the people they allowed to manage it was. the environment was hostile and there was always stress. Awful management! beware!
bad,"Only work here if you want the life sucked out of you management dosent really care about the well being of the animals as long as they hit their ""numbers"". Lots of dogs would be left in kennels for hrs before being let out for a ""walk"". And I don't care for the segregation of so called ""bully breeds"" totally unfair and unethical. They don't ask for fecal exams either so that leaves a lot of untreated dogs with worms in the facility, which if found they swoop your dog to banfield and you get charged an arm and a leg for treatment you didn't even authorize. Don't get me wrong I had great co-workers and some managers but for the most part I loathed PetSmart."
bad,"Jobs was very very very easy, management is poor, booby the the director is a snake in the grass and talks bad behind your back and is a goosip queen."
bad,"It's a job I loved working with the animals, and I still do. Petsmart has a lot of policies that I don't agree with, and that was one of my causes for leaving. The management are oblivious to everyday going ons, and don't hide showing blatant favoritism to certain employees. My co-workers were all awesome to work with, but the corporate greed and lack of care is why I left."
bad,They want you on board to help because a previous employee quit last minute due to management not stopping other girls from harassing you. They don't get in trouble for talking bad about customers or there dogs which makes it difficult to stay engaged. The hours are up and down. They let high school games continue in the store even managment snap chats constantly on there phones while under paid employees are breaking there backs.
bad,"terrible place to work in Fayetteville, worked 50 + hours a week and was asked to do it off the clock. the Rats were so bad we had to clear food off shelves, rats would run right out in front of people. CEL left dead hamsters in a box on the dock to hide her error of them getting out and caught in rat traps. ="
bad,"After bringing to the attention of the HR company of petsmart that i was being bullied and harrased by my store manager, along with not being provided a safe workplace that caused me direct heath issues, I was made to feel like I was the problem and was disrespectfully interrogated about concerns I had brougt up about my store manager. 2 weeks later out of the blue without any viable cause i was fired. They could not give me a reason. A complany as big as petsmart should NOT be turning on their employees and treating them like dirt for excersizing my RIGHT as an employee to utilize the open door policy and contacted my HR, as stated in the policy's and procedures. This is dispicable. I will never work for ptsmart again and will be ensuring as many people as possible know how terrible of a company petsmart really is."
bad,management was not very helpful with staff and didn't treat some of the customers very well  dealing with the animals was great but not worth the stress
bad,"upper management changes too often and then you are left trying to change work working patterns to try and be better suited for new management, it was always about proofing to the next guy that you  deserved the job you currently have"
bad,"Horrible place to work! And horrible for the pets in their care. Don't work there. These people don't give a rat's dropping about their employees, the pets and the work environment/safety. Petsmart kills (and mains/damages) pets!"
bad,"In the salon you aren't paid enough for the type of work. Also, the manager will cut your hours randomly. The manager doesn't follow your availability and she will yell at you if you aren't available enough."
bad,I was not paid enough for my work. I was not treated fairly by the people coming in with the morning shift. My manager was constantly yelling and angry for no good reason.
bad,"Would not recommend this job. Attended school part time while working part time, management was not very flexible with my school schedule unfortunately. I enjoyed working with the animals,yet I wish was given more training. Overall don't recommend."
bad,"Unless you like the cooperate structure, don't bother working at PetSmart. There are many private salons that can train you. The restrictions you are under and the pressure put on you, is not worth the people you work with, no matter how great they are."
bad,"Management unfortunately killed my experience here. They push policies that are not safe for pets, and push numbers over quality of each customer. Extremely stressful environment"
bad,PetSmart is only a nice place to work if you love animals. Seeing them come into the store was always exciting and provided the day with a little happiness. Other than that the location I worked at was awful. Very unorganized and very lazy management. There were little to no benefits and the pay was very low. Most PetSmarts are smaller stores meaning that one employee could do a little bit of everything and most times you did.
bad,Management is very poor and disorganized. Manager wasn’t around to help in our salon as much as she should have. I wish this job experience was less stressful.
bad,"Very bad job. Overnight you are by yourself which is not a good idea to begin with. If you need help you are pretty much on your own. I had gotten sick overnight and had called manager that was supposed to be on call to help but no response. So I left the store and then I was yelled at for leaving store. My manager Dave was not concerned for my health of being sick and didn't care that I was unable to reach anyone, although one other person was there with me she was swamped with work because the dish washer broke and water was all over floor so i did not want to bother her. Dave yelled at me because I left and apparently i set off alarm making police come. Dave cared more about the store than an employee."
bad,The lacking of staffing and nonexistent dog qualifications as a good fit often led to employee and dog injuries. They would put inexperienced staff with known aggressive dogs and the staff member would end up getting bit. They would also overbook appointments which led to the staff member having to rush and often the dog would end up injured.
bad,"Was discriminated against due to my age, and was not considered for any position to advance a career there.  They did not give the hours needed to support my family and myself. They are not a team work type environment. Everyone is for themselves. Unhealthy work place."
bad,Management only cares about making a profit and does not care about the health of the animals in the store. They are very callous when it comes to getting required tasks completed.
bad,The managers don't train you properly they just want you to get every thing done yesterday. Co-workers were great. Great staff discount. Enjoyed working with the animals.
bad,Petsmart isn't a good company to work for.  There isn't any deference in pay from the stocker to the cashier.  The working environment is chaotic and hostile.  There aren't any full time positions except for management.  No room for advancement as well.  Very poor pay.
bad,The management was awful! If you had an issue they would just pass it around from manager to manager and you would never get a solution to anything. The work is fast pace which is great but when you need help it is never there.
bad,"dont do it, do not recommend, run while you can. loved the coworkers, management was lacking. management was also very unprofessional. they allowed personal feelings influence the decisions on who got promotional or additional job training to advance."
bad,"I worked in the grooming salon. To be completely honest, a lot of against policy stuff happens back in the salon. Too many dogs and not enough time to dry them all. Dogs are left with the cage dryers on them for an hour or more at a time depending on the schedule. Dogs are tied and left to sit in the baths unattended, you're not allowed to turn down a nail trim so if you have four nail trims that dog could be sitting back in the bath tied up and wet for anywhere between 20-40 minutes depending on how fast you are with nail trims. The salon manager lets you have customers that you charge the minimum for, so that you can get the tip money under the table."
bad,"This company is a horrible place to work for. They treat their staff like garbage and work you so hard for next to no money. They promise you all this false info of moving up, but it never happens. They would rather hire outside the company. So they can train them the way they want you to work (like a robot)"
bad,"Awful company to work for. I have been an employee there for almost 8 years and I still do not make a decent hourly wage. As a salon employee, I do not think it is fair that if I do not commission out for the week that I do not see any of that money in my paycheck. Management is incompetent and you'll get different answers from everyone. Horrible company that does not care about its employees or the animals. Was a student so I was only only working part time hours, I wanted to switch to full time during the summer but was initially denied from pursuing that for reasons I still do not understand. With all the bad PR as of lately, if you are looking to become a groomer I recommend going somewhere else."
bad,An awful company to work for. If you are not willing to throw people under the bus to get ahead you will never get a head. They only care about management they do not care about their employees .
bad,Petsmart was worse than Petco for me. I found they didn't care very much about their employee's or the pet's coming into their salon. I feel they could focus on safety and how important their employee's are
bad,"Worst place ! "
bad,The reason I had left Petsmart was that the environment was to tense and unfair. I worked long hours with short breaks. I was also sent to the hospital and the management was giving me issues in paying for the hospital bill.
bad,this company sucks the life out of you do not under any circumstances work here it is full of little kids who are not capable of working a job let alone
bad,after being an loyal trust worthy employee for a certan amount of years you are maxed out on pay. and are expexted to go the extra mile for little conniption
bad,I worked for petsmart for almost 7 years and in total only got about 50 cents in raises as they are solely based on your managers decision. The pay is not great and overtime was mostly mandatory unless you had a really good reason to need to leave.
bad,Would not like to go into detail. Store manager where I worked was extremely rude. I was not paid enough to deal with what I had to. Wasn't worth it to me to stay there.
bad,Working at PetSmart was very stressful and there was a lack of advancement opportunities. I work there for year and constantly asked about being promoted to groomer and instead of telling me no I just got a lot of running around. They didn't offer me a lot of hours however other people came in and got the hours that I asked for. The company was not straightforward and they cost me a lot time and effort and I got nowhere in a year.
bad,"Stressful work environment. They tried to push so many dogs on the bathers, and once you finally finished all your scheduled dogs the manager at the time would make us wash the groomers dogs for them (without compensating us). Also the manager at the time would try and get me to take dogs without updated rabies information. Absolutely not... "
bad,"They have VERY POOR management, you are under paid, mistreated, talked about, put down in front of customers. There is more drama at this salon than 15 high schools combined. It is not worth it at all to work here. Worse job experience ever...other than the dogs."
bad,"This place is a joke. I was hired as a customer engagement leader and never received full training, thrown into the position and was continually harassed by the store manager. I was forced to talk to cashiers about email capture like it was the only thing that mattered. I honestly hate this place and I have been harassed by the store leader on multiple occasions with nothing being done by head office. The store manager is a gossip queen that tries to start issues with staff to entertain himself. Do not work at the north Whitby location!"
bad,"I did enjoy this just because of the dogs, but management would not cooperate with school schedule, supervisor was too busy flirting instead of helping the employees, it was very stressful, communication was horrible."
bad,i have never worked for a company that was so poorly run. the management is disappointing due to the fact that the focus mostly on there own means and no one elses
bad,The new manager at the Walpole location is not someone who works well with a team of individuals. There are plenty of locations in the area. I would consider another location before ever going to work for that woman. It's a toxic culture growing inside of the Walpole store. Along side the meal moths and maggots living in the pet food.
bad,"Management lacked compassion for pets and customers and employees. They hired the laziest of workers. Overworked, and underappreciated. Management in the Petshotel wouldn't even manage! They would sit in their office and ""work"" while everyone else was running all over trying to get things done in time."
bad,"I am writing on behalf of my daughter who works almost every day at PetSmart part-time. She is being harassed, lied to about her role and availability"
bad,I was harassed and not treated fairly. The management was the worst and did nothing to help. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone due to my experience
bad,Typically if your a cashier aside from zoning the first two aisles you can not leave the register. You work with many forms of payment and coupons. There is not much room for growth with the company with the exception of groomers and vet technicians. The hardest part of the job is hearing about customers with sick or special need pets.
bad,"Whatever you do.... do NOT work at Petsmart located in Virginia Beach. I was in the salon... got one day of training before they sent me off on my own expecting to know how to answer phone calls, schedule appointments, clip dogs nails. On my third day of work they had given me two pitbulls, a dog who had never been to the grooming salon before and a Great Dane. I had come home many nights crying to my boyfriend because of how poorly they had treated me in there. And when I needed help they just gave me weird faces and act like it was soooo easy for what I was doing. Speaking of which my manager was only there to watch me my first two days. I had told them I needed more training but recieved none and they expected way to much out of me. They had even told me that 7 people had already quit this position within the past two months. So I know this wasn’t my fault... anyways.. luckily I had taken some time off for Christmas and asked to be switched to a different part of the store cause I could just not handle it in the grooming salon. Anywho... I go into the Pet Care area.. and a cool person trains me but explains to me that he’s only been working there for not even a month and still doesn’t know everything. So I’m like .. great. Anyways... the first few days were fine because I was mainly just watching but then they set me off on my own. Meanwhile I have a customer coming up to me every two seconds asking a question I do not know the answer too. So I have to ask someone to come over and help me which they proceed to do resentfully. Then they expect me to know how to capture a bird"
bad,"As a Manager of the grooming salon, Talk to customers when upset about their doggie haircut or bath, booked appointments. did a monthly budget paperwork, made schedules for the employees."
bad,"The management promise ungiveable things.(hours, benefits, job security)"
bad,"The managers do not care about you at all. They will find ways to make the work life harder. The job is fast paced and can be very stressful, this can lead to not even being able to take breaks because of the strict time schedules and managers getting angry if you take longer than the expected slots given. Even if they overbooked your schedule they do not care."
bad,"Absolute disgusting behaviour of most staff and complete disgusting behaviour of their manager. So much harassment and mistreatment it's sickening. Even the store manager doesnt care at all if you're being bullied, harassed, or mistreated. It's All about the money.  You can even yell at your co-workers and tell someone to go **** themselves infront of the salon and customers and not get written up, just make sure you're pulling in that money, and you can treat anyone any way you want there!"
bad,Petsmart as a company is nothing like it used to be. I worked for the company for close to ten years when I was approached by the district manager and told I was a drain on the company and it's resources for not being able to meet the commission goals in the salon where I worked as a dog groomer. They care nothing for their employees and nothing for the animals they sell as pets and for any one interested to know the amount of dogs they push on the groomers makes it fairly unsafe for both dog and groomer in the salon as well. The bottom line is all they care about.
bad,"Poor pay, inconsistent hours, several hours of standing with feet and back pain with no break, rude and incompetent management, some difficult customers, sometimes noisy and stressful environment. Also hate the constant pressure to sell, collect donations, and email capture pressure for customers to give out emails for marketing purposes. Get paid peanuts to make the company richer. Corporate greed."
bad,taking calls from customers to set up boarding reservations.  poor management - no coaching to help you reach goals which can not be reached because other reps and hotel employees can delete what you do..
bad,"During my employment at the Lincoln CA store my mother had been struck by a train. while i was employed i was devastated by the accident and i was given 2 weeks for grievance which was non paid even though i was a full time employee. The 2 weeks i had was not nearly enough time to get organized... between family gatherings and funerals, it was a nightmare. After letting my management know that i cannot come back in 2 weeks but will come back a little time after everything had settled, the management decided to let me go but had stated i could come back after everything was completed (which was fine). When i tried to go back to a company, i spent YEARS with as a outstanding employee, i was deemed (non-hire-able). After months of asking to be rehired i had to call corporate to reverse the non-rehire status. when calling back to the Santa Cruz store i was told ""sorry, but your not hire-able, thanks bye""..... (WITHOUT EXPLANATION). i was once again devastated, knowing all the time i have spent with the company to be thrown out like garbage, I was a FANTASTIC employee. Just shows you how much the company cares about their employees... i loved my job. The store in Santa Cruz does not have an assistant manager with positions open, as a former employee i know the ends and outs and know what must be done, after a couple of days someone answered the phone and said there was no position. Poor customer service quality and a loss of a great Employee, thanks pet-smart for treating me with little respect as this whole outcome reflects on your overall scores."
bad,The work environment is despicable for the employees. Bad management.  Employees does not really care for the pets. Pet owners drop their pets thinking they will be taking care off but it is not the case.
bad,"Recommend not working there. It's not a good place, some of the managers are okay but only one isn't. She's very rude. Don't get paid enough for what they ask."
bad,no communication from shift to shift. employees set other employees up for trouble. My own manager would be vulgar and talk nasty about my other co-workers to employees under her. Anything confided in my manager regarding problems with other employees was not handled professionally. My manager would just go to the person I was complaining about and tell them I was complaining about them. Lots of hostility due to this. My manager finds anyway possible to avoid and talk to me now. very uncomfortable work place. Manager above my personal manager
bad,"Waiting for PetSmart to begin caring about their employees, especially since being sold, has been an exercise in futility. Wages cut, employment strain, and constant threat of termination on ALL levels just to name a few. The employees are amazing but the corporate level keeps everything stressful and uncertain."
bad,"one of the most awful places to work for I suggest that if you want to work for this company take a look at the management team and see what other employees have to say about their management, it felt like being in high school again with all the drama and everyone didnt work as a team to get tasks accomplished also some of the employees were 2 faced"
bad,"When I started it was a privately owned company that was fantastic to work for. Now Petsmart is a conglomerate that does not care about customers, associates, or pets. Everyone is just a dollar sign and nothing else."
bad,"Will mess u over and over no chances of higher opportunity, constantly lies so much drama and stress , watch what U do people will try and get u fired team members and managers poor poor job"
bad,"I have mixed feelings because I really enjoyed it the first two years and then the last year management ruined it for me. I am a firm believer that corporate shouldn't run grooming salons but they do and you're more of a machine than a person to them. I do think this is a great start for people who want to get into grooming but not forever. "
bad,"I have always enjoyed working with the pets and pet parents. I am a people person so it comes naturally. I have groomed since i was 16 yrs old, ive always been an animal lover"
bad,"Management is horrendous, and generally treat their employees a little bit better than cattle. Do not work here longer than necessary. You had to take your 15 minute breaks on time or you would get coached, same went for lunch breaks, clocking in and out on time, and giving more than a three week notice for any time off requests."
bad,"My managers called me names, made fun of customers, and didnnot care about any of the animals. We went through managers more than you should change your underwear.  It was insane how often we had new employees and managers bc they were so awful. Nobody was properly trained on animals and it was the main reason I decided to leave.  I was cross-trained on register, pet care, salon, and training and I made less than EVERYONE there."
bad,work you literally like a dog!!!!! Rude managers and DM's that could careless for your well being! I worked here for 3 years and I barely have the time to breathe!
bad,"When I started in 2011 I loved working for PetSmart, however in 2014 the company was bought out and overhauled everything. They brought in outside management that had no knowledge of the pet industry. The quality of the live animals declined due to the decreased budget. Employee hours were cut while unreasonable standards were implemented. Working there became a nightmare overnight."
bad,"Schedule is constantly rotating, you never know what kind of hours you're going to have or what days you will work."
bad,"The title says it all, they don't care about the animals and focus mainly on profit. They can care less about the staff and only focus on themselves. Management is terrible and incompetent."
bad,Managers like to play with your hrs  give you a impossible work list to get done in 4 hrs. Treat you very unfairly very underpaid and very hostel environment to work in
bad,This is the worst job ever! Never have i felt that i wasnt wanted by my employers. they do not treat you right. they want you to do extra work but you dont get paid for your time
bad,"The management here is completely uneducated, and was jealous of my degree in veterinary medicine. "
bad,"-Worked early mornings unloading truck and stocking shelves"
bad,"I love pets, I love customer care! Petsmart taught me that it didnt matter that I was nice or professional or efficient. I was just a cog in a wheel designed to enforce Groomers as the earners and bathers as a slave labor."
bad,NA.... This is not somewhere I recommend. that is why I am looking to work elsewhere. not a family friendly store. Not for the people. I can not give a good review.
bad,"hard work, dedication, attitudes, no room for growth, management is on the level of if they ""like"" you, you will have a job otherwise you wont. Pay is ok!"
bad,"not very proffessional groomers to help you advance in your career, not to mention dealing with store managers who know nothing about grooming pets..."
bad,"The worst job I've ever had, with the rudest managers. terrible hours management would never work with availability and would get angry when i wouldn't be able to work due to college when informed many times schedule and class times."
bad,No matter how much you do it is never enough. They will call you in every day of the week. I have worked 13 hour days because coworkers refused to come in. It's very unprofessional and dramatic. They don't care for the animals. The turtles are in horrible shape and the company only cares about sales. They don't care for the animals
bad,Very low pay and low raises.  The Petsmart Distribution Ennis Texas location does not care about its employees or its new hires. They require physical tests to be passed for employment that the management themselves are clearly too fat to ever pass.  They will waste your time and not care one bit.  Starts out at 12 per hour and with in a year you can only make 12.50 per hour...
bad,"Many people quit from here frequently due to poor management and over working. Would not recommend working here at all, find another place to work it is absolutely not rewarding at all."
bad,"The Petsmart I worked at was terrible. Worked 2 days a week, 3 hours a day. The managers were terrible. Every time they would hire someone new, they got more hours than I did. The only thing I miss about working there was seeing the precious animals. I don't even shop there anymore."
bad,Work schedule was constantly changed.  Groomers worked against bathers not appreciating their hard work at all.  Often went to upper management with lies.  The protocol safety of the dogs was not always followed and jeopardized their well being
bad,"this job doesn't pay enough, and also does not provide enough hours to sustain bills. they also have no idea how to manage their employees, and work is constantly dumped on the better employees because they actually do their jobs, additionally those people feel wayyyyyy more stressed and obligated to do all of said work because the animals dont deserve to suffer because of negligent coworkers who could care less that they have a job, let alone a job that makes them responsible for animals lives. Dont work here unless you are interested and capable of taking care of animals, and have also 3 other jobs to make this one worth it."
bad,In management you are expected to meet metrics in the store that is not always in your control. Company is constantly changing how you can make a bonus and never gives you the correct answer. Not enough training for associates.  The monthly training is a joke because they make you watch a 2-5 minute video and nobody can remember what they watched the following week.  Too many pt workers for them to care.  Very stressful and not as fun as it looks!
bad,"Do not recommend working here. Impolite staff, impolite customers, no advancement, no training in different departments despite multiple requests and promises."
bad,"Everyone calls in so the people that are a good workers are the one that got to stay and work the overtime, but then they try to make it where you don't get the over time, by making you take longer lunches or have a day off, or something. They will not work with you on the days you need off so it is hard to be able to have a life with friends and family."
bad,This company expects far too much from each manager and employee with very little pay.  There is no assistance with any problems and it is highly stressful.
bad,High school all over again. Management plays favorites and training sucks. You'll get hired for one thing and find yourself doing everything but that. They'll cut your hours if your'e not down with their crew. Excessive workload for barely more than minimum wage. By far the WORST job I ever had.
bad,Not an easy group of people to get along with. Not very understanding. Hated coming into work because I was pretty much outcasted. It was like a high school type popular kids vibe.
bad,I didn't shop at PetSmart before I worked there and not even during. It is the worst company to work for. Most of the workers (in the hotel!) dont even like dogs.
bad,"As the title states, your assistant store leader, and store manager will get to sit in the office comfortable in AC all day, where as you as a floor manager will be used, and abused.  You will never to able to achieve pet smarts goals, and the goals are always changing.  Every couple of months your store will have a meeting to talk about some new initiative the company is taking, and it's always in a bad direction."
bad,I worked for this company for almost 5 years and there is absolutely no room for growth and advancement within the company. Too much favoritism and policies and procedures were not followed as they should have been. Management shows no concern for their associates. You are just a number when you work for this company!
bad,terrible place to work  only gives hours to there buddies they tell you one thing in interview then use you when need  you schedules vary so much cant really plan stuff  don't do it !!
bad,"I have had four jobs and PetSmart was by far the worst. Terrible management, received almost no training, treated terribly. I can't stand this place. I worked as a custodian, cashier and pet care specialist in the hotel. I also did some stocking shifts. The only position that I didn't loathe was stocking. There is also no HR?? What is that about??"
bad,Just dont do it. There is not much more to say. They take advantage of employees if they think they are dumb enough to fall for it. They have no management just the titles. Worst situation i have ever fallen into.
bad,"The new management would rather destroy lives and force associates out of their jobs rather than identify problems and work on solutions.  They fire anyone for any reason, so they can bring in their friends to take over the positions with no experience."
bad,"I was going to be considered for a promotion, but I blew it.  Apparently I was not suppose to tell the truth and instead lie to the panel of people interviewing me.  I worked as hard as I could, and when I was told I was no longer considered for the management position, my hours dropped."
bad,"PetSmart does not care about its employees, and routinely sets its management teams up for failure which translates to poor treatment of associates. Hours are often cut. Turnover rates are high. Scheduling issues are frequent. Management abuses the power of their positions. Working with animals on a daily basis is fun, but the culture the company has manifested makes this a depressing place to work."
bad,Overall the company is not people oriented company. Does not take care of associates or clients fairly. The hardest part of the job was hearing dogs barking all the time.
bad,"Working at petsmart was fun until new management took over. I personally had to file three complaints against a manager who threatened me numerous times, but I still had to continue to work under her for two months until they finally let her go. They don't care about their employees, only about making money. I was one of their best employees but I was forced to leave when things got unbearable. Do not work here."
bad,"I primarily clean habitats, have very few hours, very little one on one training. when I ask questions I sometimes get reaction as if they are to busy to help with my question or just do not care. Very frustrating at times."
bad,"I learned the proper care of a wide variety of small animals, birds, fish and the higher management is not willing to put forth the funds to keep these animals healthy and happy."
bad,"Awful management, constantly asking what you are doing even if you were just told to do a task and are doing it. Very demeaning and aggressive. Even asks what you are doing when you go to the bathroom for 60 seconds. Expected to tell everyone where you are or plan to go in the store at all times. Pay is low. You have to deal with nasty people like any retail job. You clean up a lot of dog excrement daily because owners just leave it in the middle of the store and expect you to clean up after their own dogs. Get guilt tripped if you happen to call in sick. NOT recommended."
bad,"Not such a great place to work if you have bills to pay. boring work, poorly educated staff, poor management, inconsistent hours, no accountability, place sucks."
bad,I worked at petsmart in nashua only for a month because I was bullied into quitting. One of the girls told me I wouldn't last a month. They sent me my last two checks almost A YEAR after I quit so I couldn't even cash them. When I called they said they would take care of it and nothing has been done!!!
bad,"Petsmart is a typical pet store that brands itself as a pet-care retail experience where the staff and managers are knowledgeable and really want to help your pets."
bad,"Management is a bunch of kids with no work ethic or 40 something year olds with no life. They pay you minimum wage, the raises are a joke. You bust your butt and they expect more and more. Even for a teenager for a first job...you are better off ANYWHERE else. I worked as a cashier and although my customer reviews were glowing...never one complaint, management constantly gave me a hard time because I would take time to grab a coupon or ring up a customer's order in two orders to save the customer money. Petsmart is all about the almighty dollar. They care not about their customers but the upper management bonuses. With the profit this company makes they could offer more incentives to their loyal customers and employees."
bad,"As a former employee for 5 yrs, this company is the worst and management is a complete joke. They are loosing business to sites like Chewy and Amazon."
bad,A typical workday proceeded in picking up the slack of other associates not doing their part. I learned that favoritism is not easy to work with. Some management was good where others were bad. Workplace culture was judgmental and not very nice. The hardest part of thejob was dealing with some of the other associates and managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers. I loved my regulars and enjoyed helping new customers.
bad,PetSmart is not a good company to work for. Upper management doesn't care about people. The attitude is we are all replaceable. I wanted to go back to school and was immediately demoted and pay was cut. I put my notice in a day later.
bad,"If you truly love animals and want to help the in store pets the best you can, then this is the place to be, otherwise its stressful and heart breaking to be a petsmart employee."
bad,Managers are not helpful. Proper tools to succeed are not given. Many animals are sick and end up dying. Working for a corporation is never easy because there are so many people. Most enjoyed part of the job was interacting with the animals.
bad,Manager is very rude and spitefull.  Employees are only allowed to work part time and have access to healthcare that is much more expensive than it needs to be.
bad,"My particular location was ridiculous. We had to set up the store in 3 weeks and the entire time my manager just barked at everyone. I was given very little training on how to handle the animals and no product knowledge. I was then laid off a day before my 3 months were up due to me having been very vocal about how the animals were being mistreated. Oh and sitting while I was fixing a display on the bottom shelf (so for being ""lazy""). I know this sounds like a person just being really bitter but honestly I have worked a lot of places and have never been so disrespected as a human being. The staff turn over was every couple weeks which is pretty sad."
bad,"I loved the customers and all the animals, but the management was awful and so was the building. Found dead rats, and black mold everywhere. Not to mention the creepy managers that stare at you butt all day. No thanks."
bad,"Would not recommend working for this location or the Waco location.  Management is poor.  Store manager allows other managers to treat the associates bad.  There is supposed to be an open door policy but if you do use don't be expecting anything.  Most of the time nothing gets done.  There is no team work.  Even the district managers don't seem to care, you can talk to them and again nothing gets done."
bad,"The past of this location was amazing while I worked there, but since the management moved on to better things the store has gone greatly down hill."
bad,"I worked for them for 6 years and it is hard to find anything redeeming about this company! They micro manage everything, to point where you cannot even do your job. Management is not supportive of there employees. I thought it was just the store I worked at-nope! I went to 3 different locations in the company and had to deal with the same problems at each one."
bad,I worked for PetSmart for 4 years and transferred to the coporate office because I thought this would advance my career. I found it to be complacent and after making a minor error they placed me on suspension. I never had the opportunity to defend myself or try to make it up to the company. I felt betrayed and left the company.
bad,"Terrible place to work they purposely do part time only so they can get away with not having to pay for employee health insurance. Unreasonable expectations on trucks. For such a large company you would think they could treat their workers better, but the corruption is out of control. I do not recommend working here its is a thankless job and management is backstabbing. Only the dog trainers are really awarded with anything like paid trips out of town. Just don't work there if you have any respect for yourself."
bad,I loved working with the animals not the staff. Very disrespectful and not a safe environment for staff or pets. I didn't appreciate being used for my skills but kicked to the curb when I was injured on the job! Managers don't follow P&P but expect us to listen to there critiqued  authority and threaten us. I did like some of the staff that treated me with respect but not a lot of them. Seen a lot of staff come and go. Hire you for a specific job but want you to fill in for 4 other people who call out or quit.
bad,"The management was terrible, however, it was nice working with dogs. The pay is awful and you don't receive raises. At most as a pet hotel associate, you'll get 10 cents a year. Manual labor type of job and can be strenuous at times."
bad,"Things were good until the new owners came.  You basically get screamed at all day, and there is always more work. You are never appreciated for doing a good job, and frankly busting your butt means nothing.  They want you to do a full pallet of hundreds of cat cans in less then a hour, you end up doing at least 7 pallets by your self, add this every day.  It kills your body. And if you slack one day you are yelled at, it gets"
bad,Graditude and sheer joy turns into frantic scramble within a few months to complete tasks of previously laid off co-workers. Constant phone calls and increasing amount of tasks. Upper and Middle mgmt and new team leads use threatening tactics and obscure new review measurements.  Difficult and rude co-workers are rewarded and allowed to continue to be abusive.
bad,"Most coworkers were amazing, but the store manager runs the location like a police state. She yells at employees and Ninth Life volunteers on the sales floor in front of customers."
bad,"I worked for this company for a good amount of time. In my time there I witnessed dogs( being whipped, punched, kicked, hurt. It was awful. No one cared that a dog would be sitting in there own feces or urine all day. I would come in for my shift and almost a good percentage of dogs would not have water. I stayed because I felt I was one of very little that cared about these animals. When corporate came in, that's when management cared. I was called slow, stupid, I came in on being talked about behind my back and management and seniors would just blow it off and laugh. Camp was a nightmare. You were by yourself because all the seniors cared about was sitting in the office being on facebook and stuffing their faces with food. It was a heirarchy. If you were new you were in camp for over 5 hours and the seniors would always be mad at you if they actually had to come out of the office and do their job. The Petshotel manager only cares about drama and if you get on her bad side she'll take it on on you through your schedule and dock hours all the while saying petsmart won't let her give any out. Do not work here if you have a passion for animals. Kennel experience is great, but this place is a prison for dogs."
bad,"the job is typical retail ... usual ups and downs."
bad,"Takes forever to advance with this company, and they have the mentality of burning through employees and management with no care at all of anyone but themselves."
bad,"Worked at Mattoon, Il.  Store management there is a JOKE!!!  Regional management is also a JOKE!!!  Sick animals were not properly cared for and medication not given."
bad,I for myself just didn't like the hours 3 am to 11 am that's just not who I am.other than that I have no complaints about petsmart
bad,It wasn't a great job. Working here was stressful. The best thing here was all the different animals. Thought I did learn a lot about the animals.
bad,"I have worked for multiple petsmarts and this is the worst. They have the worst management and some of the most rude customers. I left this store due to management alone. "
bad,"Perform a supervisor walk to make sure all the pets had water and appeared healthy. Assign work for the associates, while maintaining an organized front desk. Performing four-day confirmation calls and arrival packages."
bad,good for people that dont want a life outside of work too much multi tasking not enough atention to details a reaily hard place to work
bad,"As a vet tech for 10 years, I was beyond disgusted over the care given to animals in their store. We had yellow fungus outbreaks on bearded dragons, the stores policy for keeping it from spreading was pitiful and not trained to staff. We had goldfish feeders that were dropping by the minute on the floor but the manager tried to say that it was NORMAL.. one morning there was 112 feeders dead. Explain that to customers! "
bad,"No matter how many applications you send, they don't bother calling. Why bother wasting my time and yours. They post so many jobs , for what , obviously they go through a lot of people."
bad,they work you like slaves and fire anyone who don't like buy saying they cheated. They cut hours for day shift then give weekends overtime
bad,"If there was an option for zero stars I would definitely put it. First off when I applied at PetSmart, I applied for the cashier position. I was trained on the register for one day and never went back on, they moved me to the grooming salon as a dog bather. I was told that way I can get more hours. This was all a lie! I was given 25 hours a week which barley paid my car payment."
bad,"The salon Manager at Petsmart was great. Very concerned about groomer's well-being. Original Store Manager was great. "
bad,The Associates are very friendly and helpful! There Are a few managers who are fun to work with. The store enviroment  is very clean and kept up by the team.
bad,Working for petsmart has not what it's cracked up to be. Not my ideal job. Was just a temporary fix that has become an eye sore. Honestly would not recommend anyone working for them
bad,"I go in at 3 am to unload and work the truck. You have a 20 footprint truck with 2 or 3 guys. Management expects the truck to be done by the 2 or 3 guys that are there (because there are times that people call in) to finish the truck, put all the back stock back nice and organize, face all the shelves, throw the trash, sweep the entire store, re-stage all drops in a 5 hour period. There are days that it is possible because everyone shows up, and the truck is not that big. Management is a micro managing guy that does not appreciate what is done. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I clock out to go home. Another thing is that you practically have to beg for a 10 cent raise."
bad,"I worked here for a month and quit for many reasons. A typical day here would be taking walk-ins non stop when you have 4 dogs you have to work on, constantly answering phone calls, constantly being peed on and pooped on, scratched, nipped at, etc. On top of it, I was very poorly trained by my manager who is new. Went and certified me as a groomer assistant without giving me an assessment. She just needed an assistant very badly so she did what she had to at any means I guess. Never was to be seen. She would miss days and go on vacation and leave my co workers to somewhat help me and train me without even knowing they were supposed to do that. Also caught my co worker stealing from the company my 3rd week there just about. Lastly, I was promised $9.50/hour starting pay and got $9.25 instead. When I told my manager that that is incorrect I was told that it's ""only 25 cents less not that big of a deal."" Very unprofessional company. Or maybe just this location. I dont know. the pressure was too much."
bad,"I have never worked for a more passive aggressive company in all my existence. Starting from the management down, the company constantly was making scheduling changes two and three times a week, sometimes multiple times in a single day. There are other times, when there are huge gaps in the schedule where there is no coverage, and you are expected to cover the gap. This really plays havoc for those of us needing babysitters. "
bad,"It was a great learning experience, I wished they would of worked with my school schedule. I welcomed the new challenges that were expected from me."
bad,terrible place to work. Enjoyed working with animals because I am a pet lover. But the atmosphere with my coworkers was horrible. I was always overworked for little pay.
bad,If you are not looking to make money and have your hours cut then this is the place to go. Very unorganized and you only get about 21 hours to work if you are lucky. There is no team work.
bad,"The employees that work for this company were primarily high school students who had no understanding of responsibility, showing up for scheduled shifts, and actually working.  Management was also young and had problems comprehending what and how to do their jobs."
bad,no where to go you get stuck at the same spot same pay no way to move up in the company without being there your whole life.managers are very stingy and greedy
bad,Very little employees get 40 hours a week. Not a great job for long term. Best part of the job is my coworkers. My typical day was consumer service.
bad,"worse job ever! Management is horrible, everything said during interview was a lie just to get you in, no consideration for employees. PetHotel gets neglected during the day, very nasty. I would never put my dog there, work there again or shop there"
bad,"A typical day involves morning paperwork, checking emails, breaking down trucks.  Also managing staff when store opens daily."
bad,horrible horrible place to work. If you don't want to feel like a person and just part of the system then work here I don't really know what else to say except i will never set foot in another petsmart as long as I live
bad,"I hate absolutely hated working at Petsmart. The people who came in were rude. My manager thought she was the best thing God made. She's not. Very rude managers!!!! Do NOT recommend applying at the Waite Park, MN location, unless you wanna work for rude people."
bad,when I first started there it was awesome but after I have been there for a while they desided that I was not part of there clickes and they do not care about there emploryees or there any of there animales
bad,"I worked there for 2 months in the grooming salon as a bather. The girls I worked with we're absolutely horrible. They made up lies about me to management to try and get me fired saying I was taking four to five breaks a day when I was barely getting one because I was so over scheduled. I had Absolutely no training and when I had a difficult dog the manager would just stand and stare at me as though I was incompetent! She even told me that she was upset she had to close with me because she hated me. How nice of her! "
bad,My hours for Petsmart weren't to bad. I also didn't mind the work I did and the customers I dealt with. The management is not right though. I got very sick with mono and provided doctors notes for everyday I missed. I ended up getting written up for missing to many days. This caused me to not be able to transfer to a closer location to where I lived at the time. So I was driving an hour to work and an hour home from work everyday I worked.
bad,"This store is the typical drama filled retail store where all associates including management consistently talk about one another in a negative way behind closed doors yet work side by side next to them. I am very happy that i no longer work for PetSmart of Elk Grove California. I enjoyed a few employees there but the overall work schedule is way to demanding and hours are not allocated correctly per what is needed to get done. Management is forced to call in employees on days off to help finish previous days work while falling behind on policy procedure and safety because of the rush feeling you get. Bonuses are calculated based on hours yet they do not give stores the help they need. Overall as a company PetSmart is not making ""smart"" decisions and i feel after the lawsuit that is pending i hope to see better changes for their employees for the future."
bad,"I got injured on the job.  Had some idiot throw a 20-gallon glass fish tank away in a black trashbag, which i was unaware of, and the fish tank shattered over my head.  A few days later i was forced to work alone from opening to close unloading a 35-pallet truck and i quit that night."
bad,"The management was horrible, all the salon workers talked about each other behind everyone's backs, the groomers mistreated the dogs daily, I felt like I was back in Junior High school with all of the petty fights going on around me, the salon manager played favorites sending other, less qualified bathers to grooming academy before me, a complete nightmare.  I won't even go into this store to shop anymore."
bad,"To be honest i would not have given this place any stars.  It was an awful experience from start to end.  Here are some of the things i endured and observed whilst working here, bullying, drug and alcohol use, small animals left to die, management constantly breaking the rules, little to no support from management, very high staff turnover.  I guess thats why they pay minimum wage."
bad,Management is horrible. they do what ever they want and refuse to work with you. You get punished if you call off by getting your hours drastically cut. Promotions only happen if you are friends with the management. Don't make friends there.
bad,it was not a good experience. harsh bosses and unbearable hours
bad,"I would come in check the book and see how many dogs are there for the day. Then I would go to the back and see the dogs and do the largest first since they would take longest. When I worked they're the couldn't keep and went throw 5 of them. One of the made some lies about me to the store manger. Everyone was friendly, but no one would help each other when it was busy. The hardest part of the job was doing most of the work myself with out help."
bad,High turnover. pay is good. very hot inside during the summer. around 90. You have to make rate which was the toughest. its fine to work here but you will work hard. if you dont make rate your terminated.
bad,"Poor communication skills amongst the management"
bad,The management and corporate is ridiculous. Terrible place to work and the customers are no better
bad,"The managers have their favorites , they don't know how to handle any situations and expect for you to do everything that they ask even if it isn't part of your job description . no room for advancement because the managers already choose who they want to go regardless if your a harder worker or been there longer . Seems to be very sexist too because all the managers seem to be females with no experience."
bad,"I enjoy working there for the most part. Certain flaws in management make it hard to work there at times. Good pay if you are a college student looking for extra cash, but is not easy to advance. The hardest part of the job is trying to convince people they are not properly set up for an animal they would like to purchase. The most enjoyable part of the job has been meeting several of my best friends there."
bad,I was excited to work here at the beginning and that soon changed when I really got into the work. The company doesn't have the best practices and not willing to new ideas of doing things. The store that I worked in would not work as a team it was more of a one for all type of store. I did not like how I had to throw away product that did not have anything wrong with it. It didn't sit well with me knowing that we had rescue animals come into the store but we could not give them a better life. Hardest thing about this company is what they stand for and not seeing that I could move up. It was based upon how long you had been at the company and four people that I worked with had stepped down from their roles to take another one.
bad,they only promote laziness. one of the worst companies i have worked for and would not suggest this company to any one looking for a job.
bad,"Its been my dream for years to attend grooming school, and I am in school now, but before it came to this petsmart hired me as a bather with the intentions of sending me to grooming school after a 60 day probationary period as a bather (standard practice)."
bad,"constant mgr. turnover, broken promises. Employee turnover. hardest part taking care of the animals kept caged up all there life. Most enjoyable was seeing all dogs."
bad,"Co-workers were fun to work with but management was petty and lazy. Worked for over a year and was given no raise in hourly wage. Hours fluctuated so much from 10 to 25 hours it was impossible to get used to a schedule. Management was often hiding away in their office, or leaving shifts early, while passing responsibilities onto others. Was offered promotion multiple times only to have some reason why it couldn't be done or not brought up again. Co-worker injured on job and management tried to claim it was a previous condition so as to not pay workman compensation. Also, made co-worker come back to work while waiting for doctors results. But, most of the staff was friendly, working with animals was a pleasure and work was easy."
bad,Did not enjoy going to work. they had rude management who was rude to employes they didn't like they had their favorartes and showed it and they told me before I quit that my job is more important then my family. that is the reason I left.
bad,"PetSmart is a fun place to work but not logical if you are seeking a way up the ladder of success. You become a manager by working there the longest, not by your hard work and dedication. There is a lot of drama within the store, most of the employees are female and love to rat each other out to give themselves job security, even some of the managers participate. Management is unwilling to cooperate with your needs both financially and regarding your personal life. They don't care if you're a married mother of 12, regardless of your situation they will not help you out. Every day is a different start time and you will often, if not always, leave at 10-10:30 at night and then be expected to come in at 8 or 9 am the next morning. Sometimes they even have you come in at 2am. The pay is pathetic and they hardly give you any hours, you're lucky if you get 25 hours a week. PetSmart is a great place to work if you're fresh out of High School and live with your parents. But if you are an adult with a family to support you will not be able to make ends meet working for this company. "
bad,dont care about you will fire you no job security at all. no matter how hard you work they dont care !! work harder or get fired. there point system is stupid . i hate that place and need to find a new job ASAP !!!!!!!
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Corporate mindless drones at their best. RReally have to love animals to work there, I dont see any other reason why you would."
bad,"Hired as Lead Cashier! Job description vague... Not only did cashier duties when extremely busy but also expected to answer phones while checking and directing calls to other areas of store, assist customers, and stock boxes left at front of store. Had to take on front end manager duties also with no pay increase. Management unreasonable about scheduling. Management no where to be found when needed. Was told to just say he was at lunch when he was asked for by name. "
bad,I love the company but i dislike the way management ran the store i think is very unprofessional. 
bad,"Management was rude, and prejudice. I would not go back there."
bad,"Typical work day coming into to work unload truck, help work truck in a timely manner the best thing about the job is the pets"
bad,"Hours: I was first given about 30 hours a week, then suddenly, without notice was cut down to 3 a week (and having to drive 30 miles to and from work). When asking my manager why my hours were cut, they stated there was no work."
bad,"If you care about pets, you will find kindred souls. However, I have never worked in a place where women are so discriminated against. Sr Leaders love the young, skinny girls and can't see past their own egos. A very white male company. the New CEO Is a stiff. Lost our CFO this year and he was the foundation. Not sure that PetSmart is headed in a good direction."
bad,"The worst company to work for. During my time with this company I have witnessed sexual harassment, racial discrimination, bullying, verbal abuse, mental abuse, animal cruelty, illegal business practices and retaliation to employees that speak out. They do not staff correctly and abuse the workers who have a hard time covering the work load of 3 people, but it's okay because we mostly hire temps so we can replace them at will. Avoid this company if you can."
bad,"customers, grooming, stocking shelves, alright job but bad company"
bad,It would stay busy but the managers could of been a bit on the mean side when it came to certain things which it then made it hard to work with them
bad,Mornings and afternoons are busy the most through weekdays. I learned more about dog behavior and observations. I learned to interact with customers and provide good customer services by assisting pet parents at front desk. Giving good service to pets and providing good pet care.
bad,Everybody gets fired for stupid stuff . To many hours long shifts not a place to retire at
bad,management is awful and pay is sub-par. you will not enjoy one day of working here
bad,Rude/Horrible/Mean doesnt even begin to describe my work experience with the petsmart management.
bad,"The job itself was fun to do, but the management was terrible and treated their employees wrongly."
bad,"This company is a hot mess, they hire new managers every 6 months and it's a revolving door!"
bad,"The store was full of drama, the management team were picking on their subordinates. Everyday I would come in to find one of the other employees, my friends, upset about the latest attack. The management team would gloat about ganging up on the employees, and prepare attacks for next time."
bad,Dont work for petsmart
bad,"Management plays favorites and its usually the associates that kiss a** instead of actually working it’s very frustrating. The people who work hard get the least amount of respect and while the ones that kiss a** will get the praise. It’s the most annoying when they rely on just 2 people to do everything in one shift. They would rather overwork you instead of getting the right amount of people to do the work."
bad,"When I first started working there, I didn’t understand why everyone was like you’ll get tired of it quick, then it hit me. Management will sell you a dream, tell you you’ll get all these hours, and then just go back on their word. "
bad,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible experience working for this place, most of the staff and the groomers were amazing. Awful mean lazy managers that don't train properly then blame you if something goes wrong to cover their own blanks. Promised full-time hours but only got 14 hours a week or less, I was punished and demoted when I gave part-time availability (20 hours a week) although on average I had been getting 12 hours. The managers expect you to be available for 40 hours when they only want to give you 8. They allow anyone to go anywhere and do anything but when the head office comes in and finds out they scramble and blamed the employee for there mistake. I was new and did not know that I could not do these things, I was not trained. The managers are by far the laziest people I have ever seen, they sit in there office sometimes bringing friends in with them to sit and talk. When there is an issue they did not want to deal with the customer so often went to hide in the office and make someone else deal with it. If you read to the end of this good job now I am serious run from this company and place and never look back."
bad,"When I worked at PetSmart, my coworkers would consistently gossip about customers and other coworkers when they weren't around. While my more senior coworkers were allowed to do as they desired (listen to music while bathing a dog, leaving dogs on the table while taking calls, refusing to take calls altogether), I, as a new employee, was thrown under the bus for it. There were a few good apples in the place, but for the most part, I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible."
bad,"I worked as a pet stylist for 5 years, while being the salon manager for the last 6 months of employment. In 5 years of working I had only earned a TOTAL of $.60 raise. That being until I took the salon lead position. The work is stressful, employees are not treated fairly and are expected to work outside of their comfort zones. They are given unrealistic goals. District manager is passive aggressive and all around a bully. Pay checks are often messed up resulting in employees being under paid (on commission based employees). I legit have PTSD from working here. I've NEVER been so mistreated by management in my life, I had spent numerous times crying either at work or at home due to my job & the pressure (not support) of management. Pet Parents are allowed to come into the store yelling and swearing at employees, every employee is EXPECTED to take this abuse without refusal of service. This company is MONEY HUNGRY & does NOT care about it's employees."
bad,"constantly asked to work days I wasn't scheduled  "
bad,The manager disregarded to tell me I was seasonal when he hired me. Then nicely hired me as the cleaner 2 days later found a replacement and told me very last minute/ day the new one came in. Petsmart regina east end poor poor staff communication and horrible managing.
bad,Company is driven on puppy guides and sales. if you don't meet the quota the you will be written up. Its not about the customer anymore its about numbers which is very sad.
bad,This job is for children. If you’re an adult don’t expect to get paid well or treated with any respect. Raises and benefits there are an absolute joke. You’re stupid if you’re 30+ years old and still working there. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a real job.That is all.
bad,"The managers at my location seemed far more interested in squabbling with one another than actually getting any work done.  I also felt that they did not value me as an employee, and too often they ask employees to do more work than they can reasonably handle.  I was frequently overbooked in the salon, and I was usually not allowed to block off spots for when I got scheduled too many big or difficult dogs.  When I worked in the PetsHotel I got forced into a 17 hour shift when the overnight cleaner did not show up, against protocol which states that I should've only had to do half of that shift.  I couldn't take a lunch break, either, as I was the only employee in the store, and I hadn't gotten any breaks so far that day, so I hadn't eaten since before I left for work.  After leaving at 6am they still expected me to come in that afternoon for another scheduled shift, which I told them I would NOT be doing, and they were upset with me.  I can count on one hand the number of times I got my scheduled lunch break in the two months I worked at the hotel, and things were only slightly better in the grooming salon.  15 minute breaks don't even exist.  They are HIDEOUSLY understaffed, the turnover rate is extremely high, and the hotel has maybe 30% of the staff it needs to run comfortably at the volume that it does.  Their idea of employee appreciation is allowing us to wear sports jerseys to work a couple of times a year and sometimes buying us cheap ice cream cups from the grocery store.  I felt that I should have been a valuable employee, since I was the only one trained and certified"
bad,"This is absolutely the worst work environment. They continuously hire childish, abusive managers. I would never work here again. The amount of drama I've had to put up with is ridiculous."
bad,"Started off bottom of ladder and worked my way into management."
bad,"The biggest pros to working in the hotel is the opportunity to see, care for and educate yourself and pet parents on the variety of animal care during their stay.There's little room for advances. Pay will stay very stagnant and staff is very underpaid. Management has huge favoritism that is very similar to high school drama. The facility is extremely understaffed causing 1-2 people to walk/feed over 90 dogs by themselves in a short span. Management blames higher management that they won't staff more so they can get bonuses. Management gloats about their higher pay but is rarely even their, even at big supporting events. There is a 'care' line to call but it always gets hushed down the line and the hotel manager to take care of it so it doesn't go to upper management and then the employees always get reprimanded for calling. The manager would rather put multiple animals in danger rather then sticking to policy to appease a single pet parent. Fellow employees are very snarky and would leave or ignore duties they didn't want to do to other employees even in serious matters. You are constantly told not to go over 40 hours but are being called and thrown around a schedule all the time. You never have a consistent schedule as it changes weekly."
bad,"If you like being bullied this is the place for you. Favoritism amongst leaders makes this one of the most unfair work places in history. Youd be better off paying to go to grooming school than deal with this companies system. Dog safety doesn't matter, just money. You will have managment question your mental health in disrespectful ways and they will threaten to cut your hours. Dont bother wasting your life on them. Go where you will be valued as a team member and not just a replaceable number."
bad,"It was a great place starting off! My store director was phenomenal, but lower management was horrendous. I had a specific availiability. I was CONSTANTLY scheduled outside of my availiability. "
bad,"The grooming salon was where I shined. For some reason I was demoted and placed at the register. I did so with a smile and professionalism. I was never taken seriously for opportunities to grow. I really wanted to become a groomer. Which you had to go to Jacksonville, NC to train. I never got the opportunity bc I gave my 2 weeks."
bad,"Never more than 5 hour shifts to part time workers, but make us come in more than needed instead of just a few 8 hour days. So much work to get done on top of helping customers and most of the time I was taking care of the entire pet care department AND helping customers with animals by myself."
bad,Not a great company in all a lot of shadyness..does not meet up with company standard falling firing someone after a complaint was mad they didnt care
bad,Honestly there was one manager that tried to make everyone's lives miserable but that was nothing compared to watching animals being neglected (and managers refusing to do much about it until the animal died). They're heartless and cruel. Regret every applying.
bad,"First day? Yea they don’t care. Just get in there and learn on the job. Oh and you only have your 4-5 hour shift to learn it. And don’t mess up because there are things around that could hurt the animals! Next day? They give you a big speech about making sure you follow policy and procedure. Except, some of the procedures are set up for older stores, and don’t work in newer ones. What takes 10 minutes in an old store takes an hour in the new one. But don’t worry! After a while you’ll figure it out! "
bad,"Abhorrent company, do not work here if you want to keep your sanity."
bad,"I have never worked anywhere as hostile as a PetSmart. In grooming you had close to no time for breaks and if you didn't take one you manager would write one in for you. If there was a problem you could never speak with managers in fear of being pulled from your work environment to be talked to ""privately"" by two to three managers at a time. The only way you can get through is by calling help lines, and even then, corporate received these calls and does nothing to care for or help its employees. After these events most all who have tried are bullied into quitting or just get their hours cut until they have none. PetSmart will almost never tell you directly you're getting fired or being let go. It's happened to a lot of co-workers I used to have."
bad,"Petsmart would be a better place to work at if they didn't sell animals at all. They treat their animals worse than the employees. Small overcrowded cages in the back and every morning I would take out dead hamster because they would kill each other due to small cages. Management only really cares about numbers, not much job opportunities"
bad,"This used to be a good place to work at. However, current management has personal intentions in mind rather than the overall business. There is favoritism among leadership and if you are not in the good graces you have to work even harder to just maintain a neutral status. The goals set can be very difficult to meet. Even if goals are met you are told that you can do better."
bad,"It’s fun to work there, but if you aren’t into the drama and gossip they will make you apart of it. Managers hang with associates when they aren’t supposed to. Favoritism and retaliation happens way too often. Thank you but no thank you."
bad,Hostile work environment. Rude and unfair management. Select staff are mean to the animals. Dirty and crowded work environment. It’s a dog eat dog place and I do not recommend working there.
bad,Terrible management. The pay is bad and the employees are unfriendly. No one shows you what to do. You are always having to ask what to do next. And managers just don't care if you learn any new skills.
bad,Bad management. Say they help with tuition but only a degree they appove of. No help taking care of groomers tools. All comes out of groomers pocket which costs a lot as is and with the cost of living its too much.
bad,"Seems like most locations are managed horribly. Employees are worked to the bone or cast aside if you do not meet their ever increasing demands. Horrible safety as employees are instructed to use the forklift without license asking as they are supervised (in my case by someone who has never touched a lift). A toxic environment with an extremely high turnover, don’t let the allure of working with animals trick you."
bad,Worked at the Bowling Green location and it was a joke to say the least. Nothing but college kids working and no structure. And the management was pathetic.
bad,"The management is nice, in the very beginning. After awhile they were rude and extremely unprofessional"
bad,"My experience was a joke. My “training” of which most was not completed, consisted of sitting in a room by myself watching outdated videos. My store manager never took the time to properly train me and a year in she fired me for lack of productivity."
bad,Petdumb DC is absolutely the worst place I've ever worked for. It's so bad I quit w/o any notice. Best decision I ever made in my life!!! I would rather pick up cans alongside the road than work here!!
bad,"SUCKED . Management was rude !!!"
bad,If I could give no stars I would. Do not waste your time or your energy working for this soul sucking company. I worked at the corporate office for 4 months. 3 days after I told my boss I was pregnant they terminated my contract.
bad,"First coming into the business it was a family friendly environment then their was constant change in management where they were unsure on what they wanted for business which makes it extremely complicated for almost every employee current management has no people skills, no respect for employees and don't let you leave at your scheduled its so uncomfortable because you feel like your being bullied and fear if you defend yourself it leads to termination they want you to do 5 people's job for the same pay I wish something would be done about it"
bad,It was an unsafe and unclean workplace with unprofessional and unrealistic expectations. It wasn’t ideal to work here it is absolutely a Segway job with no future.
bad,Let's cut to the chase. You only work here because you really enjoy pets. If you know nothing of pets. DO NOT WORK HERE! They say the most important thing is treating the pet parents with respect. Which that's easy... No brainer! They promise to teach you about the products. They teach you nothing! You have to figure it out on your own. Some of the manager's need to stop messing around with their employees and disrespecting them and actually treat them nice if they want the same in return.
bad,"The particular PetSmart I worked at had very poor management, very low care for the pets. Staff was not concerned with sick animals or showed any care for them. "
bad,"Very stressful work day, strict management, I learned that I hate retail. Some friendly people, but very few. Hardest part is being stuck on register all shift long. Only good part was the few friends I made."
bad,"Loving animals, I thought working at Petsmart would be a great idea. That, however, was probably the worst idea. "
bad,"Petsmart does not care about the well being of their animals nor their employees. There is little respect for the care that goes into the day-to-day of keeping the animals healthy. They don't give you any time to give the animals proper attention. They don't educate you enough to properly care for the animals. All they care about is that you harass the customers enough until they feel obligated to buy something. They neglect to train their employees correctly and show zero interest in the struggle to complete everything (except for gossiping about you if you make any sort of mistake).  They ask too much for the time that's given. Their wages are sad and the hours are even worse. They'll overwhelm you with unusual and long shifts one week and then cut you down to nothing the next. Don't waste your time, this job will just diminish your self esteem and hope for humanity."
bad,"Poor upper management, quality of work day/expectations were ridiculous, horrible ethics, internal favoritism, employees who live together work in the same store"
bad,"Petsmarts is not a heathy environment to work "
bad,"While working at PetSmart, I was belittled as an employee and blamed for management mistakes. I was also expected to do my own job as well as pick up the slack of others. I was injured on the job twice and never received any sort of compensation and was expected to lift dogs upwards of 100 lbs by myself."
bad,"I guess it is understandable that there is going to be a lot of drama in the grooming salons because there's just a bunch of GIRLS, but when your managers are the ones that start it and worsen it, it's just ridiculous. I have worked at THREE salons and ALL of the managers were terrible. All three were petty and bullies. The managers outside of the salon are equally as terrible. Just completely disrespectful. I've seen a manager be so disrespectful to an employee they quit on the spot, then bad mouthed them to the other employees. It's like you have to fight to not be walked all over. Higher ups don't care about you either. You can go to HR about bulling, or anything serious for that matter, and nothing will be done. You can have these managers straight up sexually harass people, curse you out, break a serious policy on camera, ALL with witnesses, and nothing will be done. This company really does not care about you. They will just throw you under the bus and then ask why you can't work after being run over."
bad,"Over the course of a year I have tried to call in three times and still had to come in because ""there was no one to cover my shift"". I started off in Pet Care, and cross trained in the salon as a bather, we've had at least two bathers up and quit right before their shift and they took me away from my shift in Pet Care and had me take over the dogs in the salon. The work environment is stressful especially in the salon. Managers expect too much from their employees, and give little support. The managers care more about their customers than their employees - they'll back up the screaming customers and throw the employees under the bus. In the salon it is very difficult to ask for any days off, you have to do it 8 weeks in advance and even then it's still iffy that you can get those days off. Salon manager doesn't help the bather by taking walk-in appointments when the bather is fully booked and manager has nothing to do. The salon manager is paid hourly, same as the bathers, and groomers are paid by the dog, so they can't do walk-ins. The manager would rather sit on her phone than take walk-in appointments, while the bather is working on dogs and has to put those dogs away just to help those customers. Groomers in the salon pick favorites and will treat new bathers like idiots until they start to get the hang of things and even then they will treat them the same. It's like high school."
bad,"Washington location is purposely undermanned to save hours, so that management makes labor bonus. "
bad,"I worked at PetSmart in Merrillville, IN for almost 2 years and here was my experience. "
bad,"Petsmart has really changed over the years. Unless if you have it good with your bosses and have a mean attitude you aren't to fit in. Co-workers gossip, aren't friendly (even to customers), and have sexually harassed along with made the environment uncomfortable for other workers. It doesn't matter if you are a good worker or not either, you don't get promoted/crossed trained unless co-workers and bosses like you as a person over work ethics. The discount is low for a store that is expensive to shop in. Bosses also constantly remind you how replaceable you are if you don't meet their expectations. Good place to shop only for their wide variety of available products. Not a good place to work at all."
bad,This is the job you go in thinking that you love animals and the people who are associated with them. False not only did i see horrible things i wont begin to review...but the way people are treated wasnt well. Not to mention the pay wasnt enough for me.
bad,"Management is terrible here, very high turnover rate for the Milford store. They play favorites with their employees and look at them as disposable commodities. You will get bullied out, if the right people want you out. The head manager treats women like they are second class and stupid. The salon is the worst, there is a pecking order and its terribly managed. If you want to be a groomer, find a different Petsmart or another program."
bad,"A typical day included the same tedious routines that never change, even as someone who was new to the job was expected to do it perfectly. I never went through training here either. Management here was awful, they played favorites and if you did not kiss up to them, you aren't going to last very long here. However, you get to meet some pretty cool people, as well as some very strange ones via the clientele. The workplace is very disorganized and that was the hardest part to this job in all honesty."
bad,At the beginning of my time at Petsmart i enjoyed working but worked very hard which is ok.  By the time i left Petsmart my manager had switched and it was one of the worst choices that Petsmart could have made.  The business center manager was not only a terrible person but one of the worst managers i have ever worked for!!
bad,I feel that it's very nice of place to work . I would not say that the management are all very good. I love the pets and the customers that come in to the store every day.
bad,"Do not work here. The hedge fund group is incapable of running a business, sacrifices everything just to make a buck. Worthless upper management. No leadership at all at the corporate level, which shows in their lack of direction."
bad,It's cut throat and sales driven. You aren't treated like a person and the expectations are disgustingly high. If I didn't need a job so badly I'd leave
bad,"This company was not a good company to work for. A typical day at work was generally slow, until the weekend hit and business was busier than usual. What I learned there was how to provide good customer service to all people; establish friendly relations with regular customers who came in every week, help others when help was needed, and that a customers day could be brightened with a smile. Management was awful, unorganized, and constantly treated customers and lower level employees with disrespect. Workplace culture had its hits and misses. Many employees I worked with when I arrived were there and the place was fun, but then the stress and unfair treatment from management was starting to take a toll, and people began to leave. The hardest part of the job was the low pay given to some employees, while new ones with less experience were hired with higher pay. The most enjoyable part of the job were the animals that customers brought in to show off and every employee got to be around these pets and it made days better."
bad,In any big company you are easily replaceable to them. Petsmart treated me like trash I was hired and told oh you'll get 20+ hours a week but the moment you request time off say hello to 9 hours a week and those are 2 4.5 hour days of closing on the weekend absolutely ridiculous
bad,The managers would get together and talk down on others...it was like high school all over. Not a place to grow or make money. Not a place for me nor people who couldn't care less about their employees.
bad,PetSmart is an awful place to work. They do not train their employees nor will they work with you to succeed. They have horrible benefits as well. The few employees that do work there were always nice.
bad,"Not a good place to work at if you're looking for a long-term job. The turnover rate at the Bethel location is extremely high (around 6 months average). The management is extremely poor and lazy, they do not care about their employees. There is no room for advancement in this company unless you are great at brown-nosing or sucking up to the boss."
bad,"If you can, don't get a job there.  Management is horrible, they expect more out of you than you can give. Poor  management."
bad,"Only thing good about Petsmart is the money. Management is terrible, they barely let you take care of the animals, they made me work 7 days a week from open to close."
bad,Impossible to get full time. You can work 50 hours and only get paid for 34. They always stiff you on bonuses and OT. The lower associates always call in or quit mid shift. Everyone is lazy. And it always smells.
bad,"When working at Petsmart that is what you need to expect will happen. They don't care about you or plans you have made, I was called in 3 times while I was on vacation. There are always employees calling out, the store cannot go one week where all of the employees show up. Working for this company is the worst mistake that I have ever made. Managers don't communicate with each other or staff, and when they do they micromanage."
bad,"I really am not one to bash places on public media sites, so I am not going to go into it, all I'm going to say is they could treat the employees' better there and management should not get their act together otherwise they will keep losing the amount of employees' like they are."
bad,"They treat their employees like dirt. I've watched managers text message each other on the Floor to laugh about an employee. Ive seen management try to sabatoge a person's job because they didn't like them. I've watched managers avoid answering a page because they didn't want to be near the till. I've seen the store manager refuse to meet with customers. This company use to be about pets and owners and now they are all about money. They get the employees to work they're butts off and then give the store manager a bonus because the numbers went up. Oh, but at least the employees get a Care Card for their free can of soda (Really?!). This place is just slowly dying out. No room to grow, no support, horrible training. Bottom line... The place is a joke ."
bad,"You are always treated as an outsider at Petsmart. You can't trust anyone there. All I did was sit around, talk to nobody, and pet dogs when I didn't have a bath to give."
bad,to be honest i love the animals i got to work with the pet parents are wonderful but the employees were not friendly at all they are very judgmental they talk very bad about each other i went to work and not pay attention to what anyone had to say but it gets to you when its an everyday things its just lots of bulling! it just make you not even want to go to work at all
bad,"If you want to advance, forget it, if you are a trainer dont expect to use your own ideas or even to be able to help clients with behavior problems because you will actually be written up if you stray one inch from their curriculum, which isn't the best. You're turned loose on the public after 2 short weeks of ""training"" which is nothing but watching somebody teach lessons and reading the book and taking a test a 4th grader could pass. You're extremely terribly pressured to sell classes even though they will chain you to a cash register or send you to go stock a section at the back of the store. Management doesn't care if what they have you do keeps you from selling classes, they'll write you up and yell at you if you dont meet sales goals. NOT a good place to work if you want to get into dog training."
bad,"I really enjoyed my job as a groomer at petsmart. My co-workers were fantastic and even the management was great. Then some of the managers got transferred and then it was downhill from there. He started accusing me of all different things, and I felt as if he was trying to get me to quit. Then i injured my back really bad and was off (with Dr. notes) because I couldn't lift or bend or do anything at all really. Well, when I came back to work (even though I shouldn't have because I was still in a lot of pain) my manager wrote me up and told me that if I took one more day off for the entire year, mind you that it was only March, that I would be fired. Of course, being so angry with the whole situation, I started crying. His words to me were ""go take a 15 minute and 'pull yourself together"" And that was when I knew my ""career"" at petsmart had ended because there was no way I could work underneath someone who enjoyed having that much power, and abused his power as well. Not only did he abuse his power, but if someone dare go above him to talk to the district manager about how he treats his employees unfairly, then you would definitely be getting a write up as soon as he found out."
bad,A typical day would be cleaning animal cages and maintains them. Blocking and facing and answering pet parent questions.
bad,"A typical day at this job included working with many different people and animals. To be successful at this job multitasking was a MUST. Also, working closely with management as well as other team members. The hardest part of this job was that we were constantly under staffed, causing me to have to take on many tasks at once, coming in early and staying late. This job did have it's rewards, working with animals sometimes required a great amount of patience, and this is something I definitely took with me when I left."
bad,"Petsmart is an extremely difficult company to work for. They used to be a more people, and employee focused company, but now they are turning into a corporate machine. Their employees no longer matter to them. They are expendable. It is a thankless job with little to no room for advancement, and even less gratitude or appreciation from your superiors for a job well done. If you are looking for a job, I would suggest you look somewhere else. Especially if you have young children. They are extremely insensitive when it comes to daycare or health issues relating to your children."
bad,cramped work space - no scheduling system in place - you won't know your schedule for the following week until the Wed. before - inconsistent communication - lack of experience in the call center arena from upper management - chaos is standard
bad,"Dont complain or else! District manager teaches you how to terminate employees within the HR guidlines. They teach managers how to ""coach out employees"". HR from the corporate office will not help you as I have been on many conference calls on how to terminate employees within hr guidlines. I could not play there game and make the employees life a game so I am leaving this place. Discriminating company . The words and ways of this company are headed in the wrong morale direction."
bad,"At this job I went above and beyond what my job title consisted of, unfortunately management at this company does not notice this, they see the animals that are being sold as pets as stock. Illness and treatment of it with the critterswas based on their ""cost"" of animal originally and price of treatment, not on life or what is right. The most enjoyable part of this job was the care, setting up for and experiencing the animals and those customers who values their lives as well. Most coworkers were friendly and personable, but hiring of employees has no basis on if they have any experience, knowledge or even own a pet, which usually lead to myself doing several peoples jobs at once."
bad,"This is a company you want to avoid at all cost. Imagine a company where ex cons set the rule and promotions and benefits based on mob rule. That's Petsmart. Management bullied employess they didnt like. And promoted folks that they did. Like based , not on work proformance but your willingness to harrass other employees they didnt like. Often the worse employees are promoted. Warning Warning Warning"
bad,"This was a horrible place to work, management made up lies about their employees, the store manager erased overtime hours off the roster, and since he deleted it, there was no way of proving that I worked those hours. gave me horrible hours away from my family and didnt treat me properly. didnt give me any lunches"
bad,"You may work anywhere from 2.5 hours to 8 hours a day. It changes every week, the days you work and hours you work. You may work at 5am til noon or 6pm to 10pm (they probably won't let you stay til 10, so you won't get your full hours in). They are supposed to give you at least 3 hours, but if they are low on store hours because their store isn't selling enough, then they'll say ""You can cut out early,"" and they'll get mad if you say that want all your hours and cut your hours even more next week. I have only had 6 hours for a whole week, one day a week, for months!!! Called the district manager and he doesn't care. Only managers get FT hours."
bad,The best part of the job was being able to work with animals.
bad,"rules were made by corporate people that werent even there to see how it functions. They cut down the employees to bare minimum in hotel but, still had at least 100 dogs to take care of everyday. Dogs would sit in own feces and get giardia because we didnt have enough employees to take care of everything. I got a 10 cent raise for a year but my workload more than tripled because of the cut backs. I had to call corporate multiple times. and it would only change for a few days. I worked over 35 hours most of the time but was labeled part time so they wouldnt have to pay benefits..they would cut my hours to 34 every couple weeks in order to keep me part time status. I never had time to spend with my kids. They didnt care either. I had to work ever thanksgiving day and christmas day. The only good thing is they almost never fire you. People have come to work drunk and scaring customers and not gotten in trouble."
bad,"I was a manager for this company for four years until they decided to ""clean house"" of all the management staff because they didn't like the way the old Store Manager handled business. If they want you gone, whether you deserve it or not they will find a way. Their pay is low and their coaching is weak. There was never enough positive coachings, only negative."
bad,"A typical day working as a dog groomer at petsmart was extremely stressful. In the three years I worked there, my feet and back have been wrecked, as sitting down for even a moment is actively discouraged or even punishable, if you even have the time to sit. While I did learn how to groom dogs while there, the vast majority of perfecting my skills happened off site on my own dollar. The management was inconsistent and unprofessional, very much the type to believe throwing a pizza part was just the ticket to solve any and all employee distress issues. Management played favorites with scheduling, giving preferred hours and consistent weekends off to employees the managers were friends with, and all closing and weekend shifts to the rest. "
bad,"The worst place I have worked at. Management specifically head is horrific. No opportunity for advancement. Didn’t receive vacation pay upon leaving. Not worth the money for the risk of injury everyday. Only worth it to see the dogs. The atmosphere is miserable. Worker morale always low. Forces you to perform tasks you do not want to do for fear of safety. Turnover rate is insane. As I was first hired the last crew was just leaving, telling me to GET OUT."
bad,I was told i couldnt work if i had any restrictions while pregnant. And made me continue to work on dogs over my weight restrictions set by my doctor. Was one of two pregnant women in the area. Neither of us hd our restrictions respected and were both told that our restrictions were invalid. Then was told that i couldnt grokm bc i would be going on for leave. Even after i had told them i was an experienced groomer.
bad,"The expectations are extremely high, but the culture sucks. The head of management is too emotional at times. The company worked you to the bone. They expect managers to do everything. They have only one cashier, they expect the managers to ring registers, do projects, resolve grooming issues, helping every customer one at a time, sales coach, and resolve associates, and customers issues.  The district manager is very mean,  he is micro manage all the stores, he speaks to people with no respect, and he is not friendly. He practice favoritism, if he doesn't like you, he will target you. I have been in retail for a very long time and I have never seen that culture before."
bad,"Worst place to work at, the pay was good but working there i always found myself being mad, and I’m not a mad person. Being on the shipping dock you need trailers to load your task and no trailers. Horrible management and hr sucks"
bad,They change your hours based on whom your friends with. Always end up being bullied or only one person doing all the cleaning  the lack of care for animals in the back room is disgraceful. And if you tell management nothing gets done
bad,"Management would let personal life interfere with the work environment creating a hostile environment. The pay is competitive, so the last person that got hired on gets more than everyone else."
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers and thoroughly loved working with new animals however, management and their lack of respect or accountability was terrible. I won’t recommend to anybody."
bad,Very poor management and treatment of employees. They are more about the bottom line than the pets in their care. Employees are forced to work in a stressful competitive environment that creates animosity and unsafe working conditions.
bad,Managers will talk badly about coworkers in front of customers and people who do not need to hear it. If you have emergencies they are petty about you having to leave or call out.
bad,Management at the North Whitby store is probably the worst I've ever come by at a PetSmart. Don't get me wrong there are great people who work at PetSmart but at this location that's unfortunately not the case for managment. Management will belittle you and I don't think they have any concept of constructive criticism or people skills. They are also hypocritical in terms of taking days off. It doesn't seem like they genuinely care for their employees at all and it hasn't improved from the time that I've been here. So be aware of this if you apply for a job here because I have never been treated this poorly at a job before.
bad,"Awful management and team"
bad,"they put WAY too many dogs into a play room, and leave you in there alone without help for 4 , sometimes 5 hours at a time. Like a lot of corporate companies, they''ll give you 'part-time' status, but ask you to work 32 hours per week, keeping you just under the amount needed for benefits"
bad,This is the worst retail job I've ever had. Toxic work environment with no regard for the animals. Advancement is based on popularity over work ethic.
bad,"Manager can't keep people because the working conditions are poor. Constant turnover.  No incentive to do any better.  You're slapped into a job with very little training.  Specific positions are required to do corporate training - employees are told to stop doing the training in order to help in other areas (eg stocking shelves, ringing at register).  Poor pay, manager trying to make numbers to benefit his/herself.  Assistant store manager very bad at job - numerous times found locked in office sleeping at desk (the main office had a glass pane in the door).   Asst. manager showed favoritism, picked on employees that he/she thought they could bully, would be missing (would go outside of building) wouldn't answer pages or calls.  Numerous complaints to corporate HR from a wide range of employees resulted in no improvement.  Store manager and Asst. Store manager would make promises to employees that would never materialize.  Told you are hired to do a specific job and once you are hired you are doing something else.  The only thing that made this job enjoyable are a few decent employees."
bad,"The organization is basically run out of the US with Canada playing a tactical role with limited autonomy ... Buyers are more administratively focused, Finance is basically a bench-marking exercise and Management is reactive vs. strategic. The culture is very challenging as each function operates in a silo and is very protective of their functional work and the individuals that work within their department.The siloed nature of the departments and rigid top-down management, makes project work/collaboration/accountability/improvements difficult to obtain. Individuals are micro managed and decisions are seemingly knee jerk and not very well communicated. Although there are some very nice people that work within the organization, it is a frustrating office to be a part of. I did my best to influence the culture several times while there, but ultimately failed as I could not create enough influence / did not have enough clout. I was never recognized once for my over-and-above efforts - was actually punished. Ultimately, I ended up becoming emotionally exhausted from my commitment to drive appropriate business/cultural change. Don't let #lifeatpetsmart fool you ... its propaganda!"
bad,Petsmart did not give groomers any say in how they were scheduled dogs and would often allow severe overbooking which would cause a lack of quality in our grooms. full availability was required and time off requests were often denied.  They also would take promotional pricing out of the groomers pay
bad,"This company puts on a lot of good charity and friendly attitude but when it comes down to it they are all about the money in the end."
bad,Management is awful. No one follows rules. Promises were made to make me a groomer and it never happened. People were rude and unprofessional. Manager was rude and unprofessional. They do not care about the pets just the money. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. They paid me way less than what I am making now and I am doing the same exact thing
bad,"I worked in the salon as a dog bather and was on my way to be sent to schooling to become a groomer. The salon manager was never in the salon. I was trained by other groomers and not managers. I would constantly get over booked and would have to rush through customers pets and not do the best I could. Petsmart never turned away pets even after they showed signs of aggression or even after bitting a groomer. I had a pitt bull lunge at me when trying to put it in the cage. Had both a full grown husky and german Sheppard lunge at me and almost bit me while washing and drying. Their biggest mistake is the glass windows up front. Pet parents sit up there waving at their pets making it impossible to complete the groom. My last dog was a chihuahua. It was perfectly calm in the back with its bath and dry but as soon as we came up front to do its nails it flilped out after seeing its mom. It bit me 3 times before another girl came to hold it for me. Even with her holding it it still managed to bite me, but this time wouldn't let go of my hand. So I swatted at it to get it off my hand. Even though the pet parent apologized for its pets behavior I was still fired. Was a blessing in disguise. Too stressful for the pay."
bad,"If you are looking for a place that has condescending managers who do not care about you or the animals they sell you have the right place. Management will write you up for calling out/going home sick because it affects your attendance. You tend to get days off that are requested, but other than that they don't care. They will sell anything to any customer if they really want it regardless of how they'll take care of it, even though per policy we are not supposed to. We are supposed to walk customers through everything they are supposed to need for an animal and make sure they actually get it and that they are getting these animals as pets not food or to set them free. However, if they want it we are required to sell it. For example, if a customer wants a mouse to feed to a snake we have to sell it even if they tell us what its for and do not want the frozen we offer. Management will ignore you and when you ask them questions they talk down to you and act as if you are too stupid to do the job you were hired to do. They will not give you a full time position unless you kiss their butts, so most full time positions are given to those who do not deserve it. They will make you stay over without asking because they expect it of you. They do not help even when you are swamped by yourself, but still expect everything to be done on time. When tasks are not completed in a timely fashion under these circumstances they verbally reprimand you.  I will say that I do LOVE my coworkers, they are great and make work somewhat bearable, but would not recommend working here."
bad,"I think the reason it was not enjoyable was possibly just the location I was located at. I applied for the grooming saloon. When they called me for the job they said because my friend was employed in their saloon they did not want us together, they proceeded to offer me a job in pet care and I said yes. When I arrived for the interview I was now told I was going to be a cashier. I accepted it thinking there would be an opportunity to advance somewhere. Many things were just not quite right, for example they needed me full time but refused to give me full time due to not wanting me to have benefits, I was worked 39.5 hours a week. Which in my area is .5 under full time. We are a corporate owned store. So as employees which is in a training video, we have the right to call corporate at anytime we deemed appropriate. In fact the training video encouraged us to do so if we had found something, that the mangers ignored. Well there were two times were two people wanted to contact corporate and told the managers. It was handled unprofessional and resulted in the mangers telling the employees they should not do that, even going so far to lecture one of them. For me personally I left due to the multiple other personal things happening in life at the moment that took away from me being able to work the hours I was given. However, I do know they recently employed a new manager in the grooming saloon who's managed to clear the house within only a few months if that. I think this pet smart location in particular is unprofessional, and inconsiderate to their employees. Also a note I want"
bad,They demanded alot out of one person it was draining. The ever changing policy made it a unhealthy environment for the pets. If you have a great passion for animals I do not recommend.
bad,The management never knew what they were doing. It was always unorganized customers complained it was so messy we were always behind and went through several store managers .
bad,I worked at Petsmart Dc38 for 4 years. Always told I did a great job but overlooked for awards and advancement.  Management changes makes it impossible to be recognized because they don't know the good worker from the slackers. Raises 50 cent or less annually. Pay is very average unless you plan on working 70 hrs a week.
bad,"you are expected to work non stop, phone ringing off the hook, stressed dogs, walk in services out way dogs with appointment.  Every time a walk in service comes in a dog with appointment gets put away,  sometimes 5-10.  Each time stresses dog and groomer out.  No respect is given to employees.  "
bad,this job is very taxing and you're treated horribly for little pay and expected to bend over backwards for management. was understaffed for the whole 3 years I was an employee and there is absolutely no benefit for busting your hind end for management/coworkers as there is no incentives. the only reason I stayed for so long was my manager's flexibility with my schedule through college. about to graduate and I can't wait to get the heck out of this place.
bad,"Unfortunately Petsmart does not value its employees. Employees are treated as disposable and there is very little, relatively none at all, value for work/life balance, religious beliefs and the like. There is constant discord and management feels as if they can make any decision they choose without respect to the company handbook/policy. In fact, they will literally develop a new policy that contradicts a previous policy if it serves someone's individual purpose. EEO violations occur daily in its environment. Not recommended at all!"
bad,"It usually starts off with management. Very biased towards certain employees. Not very friendly nor collaborative when it is said that it is a team-oriented work environment. It is basically a sink or swim type of environment. Training is very minimal and does not train properly so you learn things as you go, which is not the best way to introduce employees who are new to taking care of pets professionally. Hours were cut despite the open availability."
bad,I would not refer anyone to work at petsmart they do not treat everyone equally an they have a tremendous turnover rate I worked at petsmart distribution for a little over seven years this is by far the worst company I have ever worked for
bad,Worst place to work low pay and low hours rude coustmer and stupid managers  they didnt know how to treat there works over worked and underappricated.
bad,Promised I would get 25 plus hours a week so I could leave my old job that was paying my Bill's and she gives me 20 ok whatever I can live still now I'm down to 8 hours a week.... manager refuses to talk to me about hours and avoids me shows blatant favoritism to another employee her and several shift leads give constant attitude to me and other employees petcare associates do nothing the store is always a gross mess I try to clean up every week when im actually on the floor but they'd rather have someone trot around the store at a turtles place doing nothing. Have also had other employees make fun of me for no reason and I cant seem to find the hr number in the breakroom hmmm
bad,Poor place to work because of the managements bad expectations of boxes per hour. There just wasnt enough time to finish the work n they fire you if you dont meet their expectations. I think that is discrimination and illegal.
bad,"i was hired to petsmart with the understanding that i would be eligible for advancements and other oprotunities as my term with the company grew."
bad,Higher level management would not provide ample supplies or training for employees or lower level managers. No communication between higher and lower managers.
bad,"I would never consider shopping at Petsmart or Chewy again, let alone work there.  They put forth an image of knowledge and engagement, but cut hours so badly that goal is beyond unattainable.  The staff is miserable and behavior reflects that.  I wouldn't trust an answer from a staff member on just about anything-- the training on products on the sales floor consists of a video guide to a single line of products 1x per month.  The video is under 5 minutes long and is often missed by key staff members.  "
bad,"Pay is unfair, management can be unfair, pet vendors are cruel, don’t pay enough for the amount of work they make you do. Make inexperienced people take care and give medicine to animals."
bad,"Don’t waste your time because you WILL end up leaving. The Store Leaders that have these positions aren’t leaders. They will sit in their offices and not help the employees in the floor. If you are a male they will make you do all the heavy lifting and dirty work. They claim to have a open door policy, but it’s used against you. Anyone that is a threat to their position they will find a way to get you out of the door. I spent a lot of time at the company and loved everyone there, but be careful of the clicks cause all it takes is two people to not like you and all they need to do is call Associate Relations aka CareSmart and complain and you WILL be written up no questions asked. The Florida area is a mess with incompetent managers who don’t know how to run a business or treat people with respect. Run Run Run!!! It’s so bad that other lower lever employees were offered the same job and they wouldn’t accept it because they knew they would be used as a pawn."
bad,"Horrible place to work.  If you don't quit, you will be fired.  The turnover rate is unbelievable, and is the direct result of poor management.  If they were fair or cared about their employees, it would be ok.  Favoritism and 3rd grade playground rules apply."
bad,"terrible management"
bad,"Horrible management never work there they treat their employees badly they treat each other terrible. their manager has no clue what they are doing, there is no support"
bad,"management and district leaders are not supportive, they are one sided, always changing rules and policies, company is now all about the money with the new owners when it used to be about the pets and saving lives."
bad,"I had high hopes coming into the company. They paid training to become a groomer. I love the job, but the management is terrible. Issues get swept under the rug. No flexibility or compassion for their employees."
bad,Lying Management.  You have to sleep your way to the top.  Makes you do jobs below your pay grade   Management is a joke.  Managers a mostly fresh out of school with no real world experience. Promotions are based on who hangs out with who outside of work.
bad,"Drive sales, operations and brand standards across 14-20 stores. Work with Store leaders to help them set goals and plans to achieve sales. Staff district with leaders. Lead teams when opening up new stores. Communicate effectively with team our vision , mission and strategy . Challenging enviroment and fast paced work life. Opportunity to develop many leaders and help pet parents."
bad,"It was like being in school all over again. No matter how good you are it was never enough. Very unprofessional managers, managers that didn't know how to do their job. Very obvious favoritism,  same handful of ppl cross trained on numerous positions over more qualified people. No chance to go to other positions, departments or shifts unless you were a favorite. Open door policy a joke. Insurance was horrible,  never paid for anything. They don't care about employees,  everyone is replaceable and they do it frequently. And they have made it almost impossible to get the monthly bonus. They keep raising the numbers you need to hit."
bad,Expected to worked every weekend and holiday (no matter what agreed on during hiring). Worst management ever seen. Extremely cut throat. Work through breaks. Unsafe work environment. They will push you until you break. Also any personal equipment is open for anyone to use and break without and repercussions.
bad,Most of the time there's too many chiefs. And what ever you do don't get sick and go on medical leave. Dead lines are not good when doctors are slow .not happy.
bad,"Worst job I have ever worked, rude store manager, animals were not taken care of very well, everything in the backroom where the animals cages were cleaned was filthy and smelled terrible and it was so stressful i came home every night crying."
bad,Dangerous and quick paced. You don't receive benefits as a pet bather. The salon is small so there is hardly any room to move around in. Not a great choice.
bad,"A typical day at work as a bather at PetSmart was often as simple as coming in and beginning your work on a dog. While the Dogs helped keep your job exciting and fresh as every day was never the same, the co-workers were very harsh and irritable. While not speaking for all PetSmart's the one I went to often was caught up in drama and bullying that wasn't proper of any work environment. Management even allowed the other employees to come to a store meeting drunk and berate me on my performance. I was often thrown all the dogs the groomers didn't want to do leaving me with over the amount I was capable of finishing in an orderly manner, thus stressing the dogs and owners. Management wasn't really there over my short time there as  I couldn't continue in a toxic and stressful environment. My health issues were ignored when brought to light even though they affected my performance. Work problems included, placing more than the state allowed two kennel dryers on kennels to dry dogs, (up to seven), drinking during work hours, harming dogs, ignoring health issues, and even management discussing shooting an endangered bird after hours that had broken into the store. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to work with dogs and making the customers so happy when they got to see their pet shine at the end of the day."
bad,"Too many changes went on their. No rules they make them up as they go. They do not care about their employees all that they care about is making the quota for the day, and or shift. When you leave or get fired they blacklist you from never being able to return. Policy sucks, I would never recommend anyone working their."
bad,"A good work place really depends on the people that surround you and good management is what makes or breaks associates. This has been the worse management I have ever experienced and I have no idea how almost all the managers at my store were hired. They are all incompetent, show clear favoritism, and don't do anything except give excuses that seem extremely dismissive when you come with complaints. The company says they have an open door policy but all it seemed like to me was just a door for them to shut you out if they don't like you anymore. I went to them with reasonable complaints such as schedules not being placed out in time (only 2 days before the next week when they're supposed to be 2 WEEKS in advance), horrible scheduling where there would be only 2 associates working in the entire store, needing help in pet care, etc. Except they twisted my feelings to make it seem like I'm only feeling this way because I was going through some personal trauma (like my grandfather passing and getting my car broken in to). However a few months have passed and I still feel the same so it's most definitely not because of that..."
bad,"I worked here for two years. It started out great and then, after we were bought out, we reorganized the company. Things went downhill after that. Management no longer cares about the well-being of the animals. Money is what's important. I left after they hired a Jersey Shore reject that acted like a teenager AS THE GENERAL MANAGER! Four people left in two weeks because they couldn't stand the atmosphere."
bad,Great place to work if you like animals but manegment was lacking. Everybody kind of did there own thing. Nobody directed you and some employees were held to a lesser standard then others.
bad,"no opportunity for advancement, work goes unnoticed unless you are under production at any given time, has been implied several times that HQ & management saw us as a number, hard labor with turnover rate at 90%  worked there a year and saw 24 employees quit or not make production and got fired....i counted."
bad,"I worked as a store leader for petsmart for 6 years.  Over that time, I saw the company flourish, being a company that cared about its associates and manager's, to a penny pinching, greedy company that keeps trimming the workforce and asking everyone in the building to do more with less.  It wasn't uncommon to have 22-25 people in 1 petsmart building. Now you're lucky if you have 18.  You only get 4 managers and a salon manager.  The rest are part timers that only get 5-15 hours a week!  If you open a new store....good luck with that because you'll be on an extremely short leash trying to train your staff.  They will expect a part timer making slightly above minimum wage to do 30 hours worth of work in the 5-15 hours they're given.  For 2 years they've talked about task reduction and less paperwork....has that come true? Of course not! Quite the opposite.  They seem to add a new form, chart or task daily.  They love to say ""don't see this as one more thing "", but that's EXACTLY what it is! And the priority is supposed to be customer service??? If you want to be overwhelmed beyond your limit, Petsmart is the job for you!"
bad,"I felt unappreciated regardless of the effort I constantly put in and the management was on a favoring scale of who sold the most this or that. The hours were so inconsistent, as one week I would work 25 hours and the next I would be cut down to 13. I would legit be told that whoever sold the most Chance & Luckies would get the most hours or would get dibs on the shifts. At some point I was no longer allowed to socialize the animals unless a customer was sincerely interested in purchasing a pet. If I tried to take them out for people to simply play with or get an experience to handle a snake for the first time I would be scolded or the animal would be so un-socialized that it would be aggressive or defensively hiss. It became all about money and no longer about the pets and it was the most disappointing job I think I'll ever have. They didn't allow us any employee interaction either. We had to stay completely separate from each other while preaching about team work."
bad,I received poor training as an Overnight Petshotel specialist and as a result was fired with no prior warnings or write-ups that indicated I was doing anything wrong. No job security at all with Petsmart!
bad,Not many hours given to part time employees. No room to get promoted to other positions within the company.
bad,"I learned to groom at petsmart at the beginning it was not bad. But as it has been stated. Management is not good. A lot of turn over, favoritism for sure. So when there was ever an issue with the favor co worker you where wrong. Even though it was the co worker. The open door policy was not good. It always turns and bites you. Had to deal with many work harassment issues that never got deal with. The stress I had o deal with was not worth working there."
bad,"A typical day starts off with a brief morning meeting followed up with stretches. From then on out you're expected to meet your goals. People who are dubbed as good workers take shortcuts making it difficult for newcomers (i.e. not removing empty pallets, hiding damaged goods). They do give you a learning curve when you first start out to help your numbers. "
bad,"I have been working there since 2010. Management at store is a disaster, lots of decisions based on favoritism. Mild sexism coming from upper level management, who are ALL male now. Quality of store/customer service/employee benefits/etc. has declined rapidly. Do not work at Petsmart!! Especially in the Portland/Tigard area."
bad,"i learned how to be a dedicated hardworking manager who was in charge of 40 or more associates. opened the store, controlled inventory, profit and loss"
bad,"When I first started I was ecstatic working with animals has always been my dream job. I've been with this company 4yrs and counting and some days I just want to break everything and quit the only reason I stay is because they pay me just enough to keep coming back."
bad,"If you absolutely love animals and are capable of putting up with unprofessional, rude, and generally uneducated management then this is the job for you. Not one person I was working with said they were happy with their job. One exception was of one of my managers who was able to get away with being completely lazy: texting more often than working. This may only apply to the store I was working at but the management idea applies to many others. I was ""kicked out"" of one store for asking for a raise (to stock associate base wage) to compensate for the fact that I was hired as a cashier and was frequently scheduled to stock, at hours outside of my posted availability. I was more than willing to help out and expressed this desire to excel, but after being lied to about base wage rates I simply felt used. This was confirmed by multiple managers and by HR, however, nothing was ever done to correct it which led to my bold action of asking for the raise. The Manager that ""kicked"" me out was eventually fired for various racially charged exclamations in front of a racially and ethnically diverse group of associates AND CUSTOMERS. The last straw, which added to a metaphorical bale already too heavy to carry, was hearing my manager openly brag, in front of many customers and myself, about how poorly she treated customers. She is still employed and has not been reprimanded in any way. I take pride in my work and consider my efforts and accomplishments as an extension of my person, this company turned into a poison for me. I do not wish to ""bash"" the company as a whole; I am not necessarily"
bad,These types of stores do not look for intelligent skilled people. They want people to be drones with no accountability.
bad,"Nice workers, not so nice management. I loved this company but had to leave due to environment."
bad,if you like working with animals its fun but the company hires not so nice people
bad,"Very bad company, bad management but good co-worker. "
bad,This company was draining expecting Supervisors under salary to work well over there expected 40 hour week. Pay was not enough for Supervisor. You can be let go because a person of management does not like you or your style. The Upper management team has no loyalty to their lower management team. their motto is perception is reality when this is not always the case. The culture is cut throat and things are only done 1 way.
bad,They are never satisfied with the work you do. They are constantly changing the production standards.
bad,"At work as a cashier I would help customers find products, answer questions, answer the phone, and complete transactions. I learned how to operate a cash register and a lot of helpful information for pet help and care. "
bad,Management is horrible and the other people there are not too far behind them.
bad,"managers are flat out horrible, worst company i've ever worked for"
bad,"The corporate employees are a joke. They are absolutely full of themselves. Certain corporate employees made it a point to insult & attack me when visiting the store that I worked for because I had worked for their competition prior to working for them. The store manager would go into a frantic panic and demand everyone around right before the corporate employees were due to stop by. It was ridiculous. The store should have been kept up on a regular basis instead of only when corporate was coming by. The small animals and birds come from large breeding facilities (think puppy mills, only for other pets)."
bad,"I worked as a 2nd shift Orderfill for about three months through a temp agency. I was a great worker. Never missed work, never late and always made above and beyond the 95% rate score. One day we had an all associate meeting (all the associates of a shift get together) and they posted their turnover. That month like every other month since i had been hired on there were over 30 employees let go in one way or another. I raised my hand and politely asked the AGM what the primary cause was and what the were doing to counteract the high turnover rate. I got half an answer stating that they try to do exit interviews but they dont know. After that i let it go. I worked about a week more before i received a call from my temp agency saying petsmart was terminating my contract for negative behavior during an AA meeting. I would not recommend this company at all and would adivse anyone looking for a stable job/career to stay away."
bad,"Management was rude, and would not listen to associate issues. Customers were nice, but we were under staffed."
bad,"I first applied to Petsmart back in 2005, but wasn't hired because even though they liked me they hadn't made enough sales so that store couldn't hire me. A couple years later I worked at PetCo until I moved and had to quit. In 2008 I applied to Petsmart again as an experienced bather/brusher for their grooming salon. I told them upon hiring that I did not want to go through their grooming program. I knew other people who had worked in grooming at Petsmart and I had no interest in becoming a groomer for them."
bad,"Started off great! Worked hard and got recognized for it and earned a promotion. Then It went downhill fast. HAD to sell so many puppy coupon books a week or else, HAD to push the donation stuffed animals down EVERY CUSTOMERS THROATS, HAD to sell so many training classes a week. If not, corporate would come down on the store with an axe. Made me feel like a greasy used car salesman because every time I saw someone with a puppy, I would rush to try to push all this stuff on them so I didn't get in trouble or lose my job."
bad,"PetSmart only cares about profit. Even though products and services most often sell themselves, employees will be written up and potentially terminated for not meeting unreachable sales goals. This goes for any location, even if they are the number one store in the district. PetSmart cuts labor at any opportunity with no care for employees' need to provide for themselves and others."
bad,"I can't go into all the details about how awful my experience was at PetSmart. It would take years to explain it all."
bad,The stores are setup to reward people that are in good with the DM and will ignore policies and procedures if it benefits the bottom line numbers. Nothing can be said to leaders about issues without backlash.
bad,There was poor management and it made most employees dread coming to work. I used to love going to work and interacting with the customers and pets but things changed quickly.
bad,"My experience working with PetSmart had its ups and downs like any job would but the management I found, beside a handful of decent managers, were only concerned about getting numbers up and beating other stores rather than taking the time to hear their employees concerns and take notice of their health and welfare. You can try and try and try but it’s never good enough and they just want more."
bad,The hanford petsmart has the worst management. Favoritism and discrimination is strong in this store. if you dont conform to the box they want they are quick to get rid of people. Be careful if you decided to last long term..
bad,"I worked there for a little over 2 months and hated every minute of it. You're sandwiched in at non-private desks just inches away from someone else. No assigned seating. Loud because of coworkers and dogs barking. So disorganized as far as how to even establish a call flow, hence, their 2 types of teams (incentive and non-incentive). Every week you get a QA score & if you mess up on one little unimportant thing such as an unnecessary note, they score you low. Makes it so stressful. All computers were a joke - slow & glitchy. People stole my food out of the fridges. Bunch of young, immature loud coworkers. What could have been and easy and laid-back job was a nightmare. I was so happy to quit."
bad,"I have worked many part time jobs but this one is by far the worst ran company I have ever seen. The management is so all over the place, the stocking is extremely unorganized and all the animals are poorly cared for. Honestly I believe the whole entire Petsmart company should be shut down."
bad,They are understaffed and force you to basically run the store if you’ve been there long enough. Doing cashier and pet care because nobody came in is typical and management would disappear into the back and count money. Terrible management. Coworkers were okay. Discount was okay.
bad,"Manager is the most discriminating, self-centered, egotistical person I have ever worked with, who, himself does not even know how to do most of the work in the store. When I was training I had to close by myself and he knew nothing about what to do when i asked him. He does not care about employees or animals and I have seen him yell and shout at customers. after several HR complaints with no change I quit."
bad,I worked under the area Dog Trainer and was part time. I was told initially that I would be mostly selling/teaching classes with a little time on the register.  That was completely false. I was mostly on register with very few hours to sell and only 1 hour a week to train. Even with my “training time” I was still expected to be on call with the register. Management was also VERY hostile. My advice would be do the training to become a trainer teach 1 class then quit. That’s the only benefit to this job.
bad,"Overall...absolutely awful company. Poor management, no standards, no concern for the wellbeing of employees. Ridiculously high turn over and they will hire anyone."
bad,"The only up side to this company are the benefits. However the hours suck and management rarely stands behind their groomers. The ""academy"" they send their groomers too is way under par and they then require you to stay for 2 years to earn it off. I believe they appraise this as worth 8k to 10k . Which is ridiculous. Save your time and go to a proper grooming school.  The pay is within reason but they push numbers over quality. Groomers there are looked at as a joke in the grooming world."
bad,"The Petsmart in Lone Tree is absolute garbage to work at.  Definitely not worth your pay or benefits.  All the departments are constantly at war with each other.  All management are scheming or don't have the cahones to do their job right.  They over schedule their part timers also.  Especially the hotel.  It's like game of thrones in there. Like with all the toxicity in there are the dogs even being cared for?  They treat their employees so unfairly just to keep their ""image"" intact.  Really. Do not even try Lone Tree, Co.  Corporate even hates that store and everything in it."
bad,"Very unfriendly to older women.  Good place for attractive younger women  but very hostile to women 40 plus.  They would do everything in their power to get you fired or get you to quit.  Didn't matter how valuable you contributions to the work place were.  I knew many older women who were targeted.  HR would take no action even though they were aware of the situation.  They would acknowledge what was happening but said they would take no action as they needed a good working relationship with district manager.  Managers would often ridicule customers.  Bad, bad, place"
bad,"Management is useless and the salon is run by a bunch of  children. Most groomers mishandle and mistreat the dogs. It is very crowded which doesnt help prevent conflicts between the dogs. I saw many dogs mishandled and sometimes teased/baited because it's ""funny"", along with many accidents resulting in the need for vet care. Negligence!!!"
bad,petsmart was okay to work for but the managers made it terrible. they didn't back you up with customers where in wrong. and never wanted to help when we needed it.
bad,"I love dogs!  So working in the hotel here was great for that reason. Sadly, that’s the only positive about this location. There’s zero opportunity for a raise, or advancement ever. As they routinely will bring in a stranger for a new job instead of advancing a qualified employee that’s worked internally for years. There are rules here like all jobs, and they are more than loosely followed. I wouldn’t trust my own pet at this hotel and that’s pretty scary considering I worked here. If your dog has high energy that dog will be considered a nuisance and stay in a cage all day instead of playing in day camp. Employees abuse water bottles because they are lazy and play on their phones instead of interacting with the pups. Dog fights happen way too often because actual aggressive dogs are never punished or banned like they should be. Management has noooo idea how to do anything competent besides make the schedule.. and they even routinely mess that up somehow. The employees that work hard get taken advantage of and are asked to “do more,” while the lazy kids just get ignored and get away with being lazy. Management often hires their outside of work friends and then they all stand in the lobby most of their shift talking about their weekend while others are sweating in the back getting things done. Sorry... there’s just nothing great I can say about this Petsmart and especially the hotel in the store."
bad,I worked for this company for 10 years. The first seven were great. Once it went private the leadership and culture deteriorated to the point where it became a horrible place to work and I dreaded every day.
bad,There were daily conference calls with the market. If the store didn't make training sales the manager who might not have worked the day before was called out and basically embarrassed in front of the other management over the phone. The workplace culture was not as it seemed and not friendly! If they wanted to address an issue with managers they should learn to provide information or concerns on an individual basis. Not by embarrassing employees over phone. Not an inclusive environment!
bad,thought id like this job but i got harrassed for 2 years by one person and nothing ever actually got done with any of my complaints. i didnt feel valued
bad,"A typical day at work is hectic. There is no communication about what was done by the previous shift, there is only a checklist of tasks that is not approved by HR and most days you have to pick up the slack that others left you with, leaving you with less time to do your own job. The management is barely trained and expected to do everything correctly right off the bat, leaving a lot of miscommunication. There is so much drama it is unbelievable, you can't even trust managers to keep conversations confidential. If you file an HR report for some reason, 1. everybody will find out if you tell a single manager in confidence, and 2. HR won't take you seriously and do the bare minimum to help you. Lord help you if you are ever harassed by a manager because nothing will be done about it and the only escape from it is quitting. The hardest part of the job is remaining level-headed and professional while managers and other employees give you major attitude over nothing at all. On a positive note, you learn a lot from working there, you do research, you learn from other employees as well as customers and sometimes they know more than you do about certain subjects. You'll look forward to seeing your regular customers and chatting with them about the health of whatever animal(s) they own. Do your best to learn their names, that way they feel like its a more personal encounter when they come in, it makes them feel at home."
bad,The hardest part of my job was to see people abusing dogs in the two locations I work at. Manager not doing their job in taking care of costumers. Hiring couple to work in the same environment causing problems at work.
bad,"This used to be a positive nice place to work and I would have recommended it to anyone.  Over the last year that has drastically changed.  In fact there are a lot of people at the call center (pets hotel) that have been fired, quit or are currently seeking other employment.  The turnover is tremendous so therefore they are frequently hiring.  So many people are on ""warnings"" for one reason or another.  Overall it has become a very negative place to work and as a current employee (looking for other employment) I highly recommend looking for employment somewhere else.  The management is poor overall.  They cant make up their minds (probably due to lack of experience and incompetence) as to how to run the call center..so everything is CONSTANTLY changing.  Overall poor communication.  The ""quality"" dept (they monitor your calls) is the WORST I have ever experienced and the training dept is lacking too.  Systems are obsolete. They also add responsibilities with no increase in pay. Goals/metrics are unrealistic and makes the job quite stressful..which is ridiculous.  We are making reservations for a pet to board at one of their ""hotels"". You would think it would be a relaxed environment as it should be.  Nope.  Sadly, I could go on and on..bottom line: look elsewhere unless you are desperate and then still continue to look."
bad,"Might be fine if you’re just part-time because I didn’t mind the job as a bather, although you are getting paid min. wage for a job that deserves WAY MORE than that. Academy was a nice experience. But working as a full time groomer, again at min. wage until you’re done your 200 dogs (which is so little for how hard this job is), was stressful to the point where it affected me outside of the workplace and nobody in management had any solution for me after trying to go on a short leave and asking to transfer stores. I did not feel like I received enough training and supervision when I was working as a brand new groomer. I worked a couple months without a salon manager to guide me during my 200 dogs and had to teach many things to myself. When a manager finally did start working in the salon, I felt too pressured to know the things I couldn’t teach myself, and I was behind where I should have been at my point in the transition (from groomer trainee to SIT I think?), so it was time to go up in # of dogs per day but I honestly wasn’t ready. Speed or skill wise. I really didn’t know what the solution was, however I wanted to extend my options. However, when I requested the store transfer,  I was told the job would be stressful at any location. Didn’t want to break my contract but couldn’t bare to go to work anymore. I have never experienced major anxiety before this job and I went to counselling to try to get over the anxiety, because it was definitely situational. After two sessions with two different counsellors, they basically told me they had heard the same things being said about"
bad,"The rest of the leaders @ this location would not back me up with any problems with the salon staff. Most of the girls were aloud to do what they wanted. Sitting on their grooming tables, texting any time they wanted. Hands on pet was something that was rarely followed which meant they didn’t have control over the dog on their table, but the other leaders wouldn’t back me up"
bad,"If you aren't someone important IE a manager, groomer, or trainer then don't expect anything out of your job here. The managers generally don't care about your well being either. I was having trouble breathing while helping set up the new store where I live and it was evident too. Yet the manager walked up and basically demanded I work harder and faster or leave."
bad,I left to find an organization that actually have the best interests of the clients and their pets in mind. I desired to be in an environment that made sure to invest time in quality trainers and recognizes professional certifications as a requirement to work with the public.
bad,they dont provide appropriate training and expect lower level management to train store manager that has 0 knowledge on the store or day to day operations
bad,"please don't work here. management sucks, they don't care about their employees or their animals AT ALL. all petsmart cares about is making more money."
bad,"Not only are the production expectations ridiculously high, the new hire turnaround is jaw dropping. Not to mention, the new hires that were making more than me to start, after my fourth year of employment, when they raised the base pay to try and stay competitive with the businesses in the surrounding area. The problems that existed before I started working there were exactly the same as when I left 4 1/2 years later. I was constantly berated by and written up by managment for these problems. By far, the worst place I've ever worked and I was a package handler at FedEx ground during the holiday season."
bad,"When I say location will affect your happiness I mean it! Certain managers at certain locations will either bring you up or tear you to shreds. "
bad,"I did not have support from any of the managers at my store when I left, they bullied their employees, they catered tot he bad/difficult ones to try and keep them happy, and completely ""beat up"" the good ones, don't care about the morale at all"
bad,"PetSmart the company is under quite a bit of fire lately due to bad groomers being careless with the dogs under their care, and the good groomers are not paid a sufficient wage, good enough healthcare or ideal hours to want to stay."
bad,"Very stressful place to work. Management is horrible. They tell you one thing, but do the complete opposite. They don't care about the animals either."
bad,"Managers were horrible and petty, terrible at communicating with the rest of staff. Favored specific coworkers and never gave opportunities for advandcement"
bad,The girls are extremely catty and unmotivated to work. Every person in that grooming salon complains about everything and always made inappropriate comments about the animals to no exceptions of customers being present. Employees are rude and act as if them selves are more superior then customers. Management encourages behavior. Won’t cut cats nails because of personal dislike of cats.
bad,"not a recommendation for this company, the focus is not on the animals..  it’s focused on sales and they get their small animals from animal farms and they are normally sick when they arrive "
bad,"Working at Petsmart was easily the worst job I've ever had. I had to care for sick and dying animals, and management was more worried about the company's bottom dollar than actually caring for the creatures they were supposed to sell."
bad,Worst five weeks of my life. The minute the new manager walked in the door so negative I knew it was going to be bad. I put my resignation in at five weeks of him taking over that pet smart.
bad,"Its a bad to place to work at, they run you ragged for most of the day. The managers don't have your back at all when a customer is attacking you. Communication is not key what so ever, the animals don't get taken care of as to what they are suppose to be."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of greeting pet parents and making sure they are attended to. I learned a lot from Petsmart, started as a cashier and was able to move my way up to a management position. I think Petsmart would be a good fit for a personable employee who enjoys talking to people."
bad,This was my dream job and the store I was located at ruined that for me. I have a passion for animals but the coworkers and all management but 1 were terrible people. Very rude only cared about money not the employees or the animals. Caused multiple people to be hospitalized or physically sick because of the stress to bring in more money even though we could not force customers to buy products.
bad,"This company would be a good place to work for , there need to be a change in management. The worker do not have anyone that will support them at all there is no fairness for employee at all. My time there it was a big turn over and I think this company need to be research and find out what is going on, they are getting rid of good worker people."
bad,"It sucks. I liked working with animals but it's your typical huge corporation tomfoolery constantly. They don't care about their people on the store level, the higher ups are only concerned with making their meaningless metrics look better for their region, regardless of what ridiculous hoops it makes the store jump through."
bad,I was left outside 6 times at least once a month by the manger they would never tell you if they were coming in later and i was supposed be there ealry like 5 to 6 am to clean and unload trucks and was left outside in cold and rain once because of lack and care of them
bad,"The thing that made this a stressful place to work was the very unbalanced workforce. There were more people employed as supervisors than any other position, making it hard for them to do their job as they were constantly in the back assisting the small numbers of associates."
bad,"Love for animals is used to take advantage of you. "
bad,"The company itself is great and the higher ups have been nothing but nice when I've met them. However, the store level management was terrible. The tore leader would constantly hide on other managers so they couldn't go on break or send anyone because of lack of coverage. She constantly lied to peoples faces about things going on and refused to listen to real problems within the store. There were multiple rumors started by her and she constantly tried to start drama. For example, trying to set up a married women (whom she knew was married) with her friends. She was the sole reason I left an other wise great job."
bad,I am very unhappy with how I was treated here. The facility is run by a computer simulation that is almost impossible to make rate at. A very bad place to work at.
bad,The store manager is very vindictive and does not like to help her employees in anyway. She will like you one day and the next not and will go out of the way to get people in trouble that don't deserve it.
bad,"New ownership is terrible.. They expect the impossible, which is why they are always short-staffed. More and more good employees are leaving due to ridiculous demands, and incompetence at the corporate level. If you  like to be micromanaged by people who have no clue what they are doing, then this is the place to be."
bad,"the managers have their priorities wrong and they choose favourites which is stupid, give bad hours. this place reminds me of high school "
bad,"When I worked here I became easily frustrated, and exhausted due to pain in back, and long hours due to having to work on multiple dogs(varies sizes/weight) in a very limited time. Mentioning there were/are a major shortage of employee's at both salon's I worked for making it very difficult to focus on my dog's and pet parent's. I consistently had to put down my dog's to answer phones and book appointments. This made it impossible to stay on a safe,an successful track!"
bad,"Director only cares about and listens to what management says, if management doesn't care it doesn't happen. "
bad,Worse place I ever worked. Management was Aweful a lot of favoritism. Never get enough hours and absolutely no stability..... Took me over a year to learn the hard way....pass this place on by
bad,"A typical day at my store was filled with threats and drama that ensued as a result of management. co-workers would steal your equipment, steal your appointments (which means you made less money), sometimes you were not given a lunch, but working with pet parents could be rewarding."
bad,"Easy to advance if you work like a dog. But you either crash and burn out in 6 months, or you get sucked in for years. Stay out of management, or your social life will disappear. And the pay is a joke."
bad,"My co-workers are very lazy, they don't clean up after themselves, they do not work together or help each other out.  The only possibility for advancement is if the store manager likes you, it doesn't matter if you are a hard worker or not.  They think everyone is replaceable.  In the last 2 months all of our manager left except the store manager but the district manager doesn't think there is a problem.  The best part of my job is the dogs, that is the only reason I haven't quit.  It has gone downhill so much so fast that I am now looking for something else.  Do not work here, you will be miserable unless you are a brown noser."
bad,"This position has potential to be good. If you like janitorial work, then this position is for you. A typical night (may vary slightly) is cleaning up poo, dumping buckets of dog poo cleaning drains in the kennels, washing dishes, laundry, cleaning kennels, bathing area, kitchen, and the whole hotel. You are essentially cleaning up after the day shifters. If you have a bad back or past injuries, this isn't for you. "
bad,"Pet Smart is a very difficult company to work for. There are countless policies and procedures that frequently change without notice. What is acceptable one day is unacceptable the next and punishment is swift. "
bad,"A typical day at work would include : sweeping the adoption area, restocking the food/water and litter for cats, cleaning and changing litter boxes, cleaning cat/dog cages, promoting adoptions and generating sales transactions, feeding and caring for all pets, handling and interacting with pets and customers, advising customers on products and services, operating a forklift to move store product, stocking product on shelves and daily maintenance of the back room area."
bad,All they care about is numbers and then when you have an accident to keep up with their unrealistic goals they let you go.  They don't give you good raises if you even get a raise.  If you question anything there or make suggestions they try to turn it around any say you are complaining.
bad,"Stocked early mornings, work hard, nothing is ever good enough horrible management, went through about 3 or 4 supervisors for stocking crew.  They try different ideas and they don't work, love to complain though about anything.  If you want to work here just get some experience and move on."
bad,"Extremely mismanaged, unable to move up in ranks or pay grade,"
bad,Work environment is very hostile. The opportunities for advancement are terrible. The management is not reasonable at all.
bad,"I was blamed for something that was beyond my control! The Salon is very nasty, from the groomer to the kennels. I have witness Groomers not cleaning their tools between animals. They do not clean kennels after each animal. Also the new store manager is so unfriendly and rude. I would never spend money in that store. Also I have notice that groomers are very rough with the dogs they groom. I have also witness a groomer pluck ear hear from a dog that had ear infection. It was so awful that I had to go hide in the break room so I could cry. The manager told her to not do it and she did it anyways. I have seen them drop animals. Also they do not clean the bathing area well either. Witness tons dirt,hair and soap scum built up on the bathing areas. I am serious this was the worst job I ever had ! I will never set foot into another Pet Smart . Also google petsmart in General and many people have lost their Fur Children from them not cleaning at all their stores!"
bad,"I was a groomer for them for 4 years. It started out really good and I was eager to get better. Then I realized that once I got to doing 6-7 dogs a day comfortably, I was stuck there with no room to really grow or get better. The only thing you can do after you cap your dog amount is to become a salon manager. Which, I heard, used to be a good step up but they've actually increased the workload on salon managers a ton! You'd be losing money being one! "
bad,"all violation no matter how small where terminal so a typical work day got stressful"
bad,all of the workers are treated as slaves and you can get fired at any second for anything
bad,"The focus is not on the pet, its on the almighty dollar. Your at the mercy of whether your DM likes you or not; pay is not by experience, its by as little as they can get away paying you; insurance benefits are expensive and terrible; there is NO PROTECTION from harassment or abuse by the DM and HR departments. Run away from this company and run fast!"
bad,"I was with Petsmart for some years and been to multiple locations, but Norcross and the management there , is a complete no go. Dogs and customers were pretty sweet and diverse. I did love my job and working with the pups, no matter how stressful. I just couldn’t take the lack of opportunities this store provides."
bad,"i bought a dog and he had aids and  we tried it and he gave me aids. my wife shelby has big boobies and the dog ate them.One day when I came home from work I couldn't find either of them. I suspected they went for a ""walk"" but dave the dog was going down on shelby. All in all Petsmart is pretty cool."
bad,"Store manager for over 12 years  and when they want you gone , SSG backs DM to back you into a corner    Longevity and higher paying managers have been let go due to costs  however you are made to resign because of the pressure and hostile work conditions   In store staff in limited so as salary, you have no choice but to work over 50 plus hours"
bad,"This company is absolute garbage. Animals are constantly being mistreated, and half show up dead on the truck, despite ""Vet Certification.""  Bedding for small animals has switched to wood shavings to ""save money,"" which was called by corporate, despite it being known to cause respiratory failure. Care guides are terribly misinformed and habitat kits are useless because they advertise animals as toys instead of breathing creatures. Employees generally know nothing about keeping anything besides a dog or cat."
bad,"I only work in the hotel so I can only speak for it, but from my experience the scheduling is terrible. You are expected to work any day of the week, especially holidays. They will ask you what your hour and shift preference is, but ignore it during the holidays. Unless you are a senior, you will have no say in what dogs are allowed in a camp. You cannot ask associates to do things for you, and you will not be told pieces of key information, to the point where some of these points can result in you getting fired if violated. The job itself is about what is to be expected. Watch over the dogs, keep them clean, fed, watered, and entertained as possible. A fairly enjoyable job, but the Management and especially corporate make it a extremely unfriendly and stressful work environment."
bad,"I was told that I was fired for stealing grooming services. I was the salon manager and the dog's groomer, it was my own dog that I groomed on the clock and I used my discount to pay for it. Tell me, how is that stealing? If your store manager doesn't like you, they will find a way to get rid of you, whether it's a legitimate reason or not. I had worked for PetSmart for 12 years and they fired me for a fabrication. Shame on this company"
bad,"Needed to take some time off due to stress, was going through a hard time in my personal life and the role was stressful as well. When I returned with my doctor's request I was fired."
bad,They lie to pet parents. Dogs are not well cared for and are not kept as safe as they should be. Employees and dogs are at risk. They treat the employees like trash and it is not right. I would not take my dog there or work for them ever again or tell anyone else to. I wish I could tell all the pet parents what really goes on in the hotel. Some of them have really great dogs that deserve so much better. The pet parents also deserve to know that their dogs don’t always get what they pay for. Play times or camp times just get cut short or completely skipped when we are short staffed and yet the pet parents still pay and aren’t told. It’s wrong and I’m so sorry for ever working for them.
bad,Some of the Management teams don't know what they are doing. H.R don't keep your confidential private when talking to them or uppers management.  I was excited until I found out that it was not for me.
bad,The new owner that took over ran PetSmart like a corporation. Taking hours and adding less staff. Creating a dangerous environment for the dogs under our care. It has been years so it could be different but this really ruined a fun place to work.
bad,I would not recommend my position at Petsmart unless you are able to get at least 19/hr. The job is too stressful and the culture needs some serious work. corporate honestly does not know the full duties of their various management positions. Workers are routinely thrown to other departments that they were not originally hired for. People constantly are late or call of to seemingly no repercussions.
bad,"Typical environment of working for a company struggling to keep its head above water. Cutting hours every week yet piling on additional micro-managing tasks. The good management staff are constantly jumping ship for stable jobs, the bad are allowed to stick around because the company knows they can't keep good ones. Massive turnover of management and employees due to sour environment and constant hour cutting. "
bad,"People quit people, not jobs applies here. The job and co-workers are great. the benefits are good even if the pay is slightly low. What makes this place bad to work for is the GM. The GM is a bully and loves to throw their weight around. I have witnessed the GM belittling associates publicly, very unprofessional attitude."
bad,"The Hilliard petsmart has negative energy in there. No one seems to really want to work there, more play and no work. They play favorites there and if you are not a favorite then you get ignored and treated poorly. All they do is gossip about others all the time. The general manager is oblivious to everything going on and can be a jerk to the workers who do the most work and baby the lazy favorites. Some people make up non-sense just to try to sell an animal and don't really give the honest truth about how to care for animals or fish. All managers except the assistant manager are lazy and don't deserve their position of power. Horrible place to work and I don't recommend that location unless you love drama and negativity."
bad,"The store manager at this location cares about himself only."
bad,The co-workers suck. Its not worth the hard work and back pain. No one showed me a lot of things I kinda just had to figure it out for myself. No one told me about the break room until after more than a month of me being there. No one told me about how many breaks you can take or at what point you get a lunch. People take advantage of me having me do their dogs when I have dogs of my own. Theyve literally rescheduled mine so that I could do theirs
bad,"I went from being a dog trainer to a cashier because the trainer who trained me was a pompous jerk who didn’t know squat about people and how to treat them.   "
bad,"Cliche's, informal hierachy, and managers that no little to nothing at all about running a brick-and-morter, absolute failure of a business unit. Horrible!!!!"
bad,was uninviting and a bad place for different ideas the culture was still and a place for people to just stay and rot. was the worst place I have ever worked
bad,"The culture is terrible, people are constantly fighting. Corporate turnover is 30+% in a years time. Management has no idea what they're doing but pretend like they do. The people who work there are very nice but it can't make up for the poor management at all. The management team does not take complaints very seriously and will protect themselves over anything else."
bad,They do not care about their employees.To them their employes are just a number. No matter how long u have worked their they will fire u as quickly and for the stupidest reasons and they would to an employye who hasnt reached their 90 days.
bad,"I was told I would become a fulltimer after a month or two and was still receiving around 15 hours a week, while favored employees received more. It's full of cliques."
bad,I loved it but they said I wasn't fast enough. I worked in the groomer section. My boss wasn't very nice at all too me. I was really trying my best. Did real good bathing them and drying them..
bad,"I worked at PetsHotel (PetSmart) for over a year and my experience is horrible. There is strong favoritism and a ton of work if you are just a regular associate. Seniors (supervisors) are super lazy they don't even wanna get their hands dirty. They also treat dogs and cats poorly like they don't clean their room when there is pet waste lying around for hours in the rooms. "
bad,"It’s really hard to pick what to focus on in this review. I started this job extremely excited to be working hands on as a bather. I’ve always wanted to work with animals in any way and this seemed the perfect opportunity to get some experience. Things started great everyone was welcoming for the most part and the managers seemed overly eager to get me started. Everything was good until after Christmas surprisingly. I didn’t mind the holiday season because it was busy and I had things to do. I think I should mention there was really one other bather because the guy who got hired around the same time as me would continually be a no call no show. I started to notice that I was the only bather cleaning properly and cleaning all the cages every chance I got. I brought this to the managers attention more than once and nothing ever got done. I was just told that they would have a meeting soon. (Shocker they never did) then they hired back the guy who was a no call no show even though he only had one day a week just so they could claim they had enough bathers. The other female bather is supposed to be going to academy soon and I do not believe she should because she doesn’t do anything. A lot of misconduct being over looked. Recently they rehired a groomer who when she was asked to leave in the past cursed out the entire store. I believe she was rehired just because the store manager wanted to maintain a friendship and because they were desperate for a groomer. Instead of hiring new and good employees they decided to hire someone who was known for hurting dogs. "
bad,"PetSmart expects you to do the work of three people, but don't want to pay you more for it.  The company is so cheap that they refuse to give the store enough hours to have an appropriate amount of people working. Most days I didn't get my 15 minute breaks because we were understaffed and extremely busy. We would get in trouble for not completing certain tasks when we don't have the staff to be able to complete all of the tasks. Management would be incredibly hypocritical about the way talking to guests, getting tasks done, a few would just sit in the office or the desk and not help and then complain that things weren't done. Management would tell me to go to them with any issues or tell them if something is bothering you, but when you do they complain about you coming to them and they don't do anything about it.  Most of the faucets in the hotel leaked, hoses had holes, mop buckets with wheels stuck so they wouldn't roll, locks broken, tiles broken, lack of necessary items to get the job done efficiently.  The company says safety is important.... ya right, if they cared they would replace faucets, tiles, hoses, mop buckets, rabies pole, etc. This company only cares about profit. We weren't able to fit any more dogs during the holidays, but corporate made us take dogs in that didn't have rooms so they could take more money....  So many things messed up with this company and they wonder why they have crazy high turn over rate. The best part of the job was meeting cute dogs and cats and meeting nice people."
bad,"Fun environment for animal lovers, lear mining about all animals, nutrition, care giving and training. Long hours and weekends a must. Paid time off with advanced notice"
bad,"When I started, I was amazed at how supportive Petsmart was and how quickly I was booted up to a grooming position. I will always be thankful for the training I received there. I can get a job practically anywhere as a groomer. HOWEVER. In the short amount of time I was there (a year and a half), they went from being supportive to not caring at all about the employees. After all of the incidents happening with dogs dying and being injured, the employees became the enemy. Any little thing could get you in trouble and fired. We had a salon-wide meeting where they told us to consider that meeting our first verbal warning. Afterwards, any problems would automatically be a write up or go to HR and we were specifically told that HR loves to fire groomers on the spot. Petsmart thinks the customer is always right. ALWAYS. I was literally told that it didn't matter if I was being cursed at, threatened, whatever, that I had to bend over and take it. Some not so nice words were said in those meetings. Petsmart thinks they're doing everything they can to fix their problems, but everyone I know wants to leave as soon as their contracts are up."
bad,"Working closely with the animals is very enjoyable. Management does not care about employees. They are not supportive, and do not acknowledge anything positive. They only focus on what you do wrong or need to improve on."
bad,Not everyone puts in equal effort. I voice my opinion on things and it just gets tossed aside. The store manager is a good manager but not a good leader. He talks bad about employees behind there back or sometimes to their face. You’re job description is a lot more than what you apply for. I do have pros and cons for all managers so it’s not all negative just mostly negative.
bad,"I love being a petstylist, there's nothing I love more than working with animals! I have never felt more connected within a job than I have when I am working with dogs. However I don't think Petsmart was the best choice for me. I do love how they provide you with all the education, training, and the tools, but I think their sincerity is severely lacking. There's a huge disconnect between management and stylists, as well as an even bigger disconnect between Pet parents, groomers, and management. It used to be a great company to work for, however, I feel the corporate side has definitely gotten the best of them. They ask for quite a tremendous amount of work in such a short 8 hours with very unrealistic expectations;  and for that, the reward is pretty much non existent and this time. Its definitely taken away the quality time I would much rather like to spend with each pet parent where I can really build that bond and make a life time connection with their little furry friend. Petsmart needs to get it together."
bad,"Cut throat place to work!!!! Was terminated for minor incident by persons in another state over the phone. No former problems first incident no warning, with no opportunity to defend self. Have seen posting for same position several times online!!!"
bad,"I hated working here. I am good at my job and had 8 years experience. Management would not let me fully manage my area and had differences of opinion and mine or anyone else's opinion mattered, Management dis not have my back, they expected too much of one person, they need to let the employee make decision on how they work best and not tell them they have to do it this way because this is what works best for everyone else here. The store had cliques of people like it was high School. Not everyone, even if they were qualified to do the job was welcome. Management is mean on a personal level and having nothing tondo with the job."
bad,"7 years ago, when I first started at PetSmart, it was a great place to work.  Over the last few years, with all the changes to the company, it has become a nightmare.  The management no longer seems to care about employees, and in some cases, even what is best for the animals in our care.  All they care about is money, and the environment/ workplace culture definitely reflects that."
bad,"Petsmart is a horrible company to work with, the managers are all negative and miserable and the workers just talk bad about others behind their backs.."
bad,It was a great place to work but the management was awful and they always wanted you to push things down peoples throats or get wright in up and yelled at.
bad,"Feel sorry for the owner of this company! Management have customers free store items all the time that would have normally costed  over $100. "
bad,It's sad to see petsmart become a company that only cares about the money. You are constantly pushed to do more dogs to make them more money. It's not about the grooming skills you have or what the dog looks like. It's a shame 6 years ago petsmart was a great company to work for then they sold out and became a greedy corporation
bad,Cutthroat culture in an environment that shouldn't be. It's a complicated business model to learn & HR & the DM's are just looking for reasons to fire you after a year or so.
bad,It is a poor company to work for. The upper management does not care about their employees nor the years of dedicated service. It is not a fun place to work.
bad,"Often understaffed"
bad,"I love PetSmart, its wonderful and super fun. "
bad,"Since going private very poor job security or leadership. Company is not customer friendly anymore, and has been raising prices without regard for the consumer."
bad,"I was a bather, and I was practically a doormat. No one helped me, and they over-loaded me with dogs daily (giving me 6 or 7 dogs plus every walk in), even when other bathers were available. I tried to talk to salon manager, and I got ignored... Completely. No eye contact, no acknowledgement whatsoever."
bad,laboring work carrying heavy objects and using alot of different tools to preform job tasks. I liked the work just not the way it was ran the union was horrible when they did layoffs the laid off some hard working higher paid senior workers who have been their 50 60 years with no call back dates and the union we paid dues to did nothing to stop it.
bad,it was a decent work environment but i found the overall experience little lacking and it wasn't very interesting day to day
bad,I have put in four good years to this company and I went on maturnity leave of absent( short term disability) which was a benifit they carried  and when I was ready to come back the manager said i couldnt and was a no rehire and with out and answer why.  still to this day it sickens me that a supervisor can do that. when I have been a solid employee.
bad,"Not a fun place, management was very poor and tried to get you fired for anything. Hardest part of the job was working there. Most enjoyable was there wasn't one."
bad,"there are too many inconsistencies and working as a stocker i don't nearly get paid as much as i should. my co-workers i worked with directly dragged their feet and management did nothing to improve this. i feel like i was always picking up someone else's slack and or mess. the hardest part of the job is not going crazy. i am something like a perfectionist and i worked with two messy guys, so it was hard to enjoy what i was doing, even though i always got my work done. i learned the ins and outs about freight and what the job title entails. i also learned what kind of job i want to have. the most enjoyable part of the job was merely interacting with the pets and the pet parents and their children."
bad,The company does not value diversity or proper management. The some stores are ran like unions with limited advancement. They are based on merit not quality or work ethic
bad,The company need work in spreading equal opportunity to everyone that works for the company.
bad,"I enjoyed being a pet care manager and the ability to care for animals and provide the best customer service and problem solving skills to my customers. The filter system used for water quality of the aquariums was complex and challenged my background in pumps, filtration and water quality while building my understanding of these systems. The co-workers were excellent to train and truly wanted to help others with their pets. The management, however, was non existent and unprofessional especially as the chain got higher. This ultimately led to the pursuit of another career."
bad,"Management was unresponsive, stuck in old ways. Poor structure and lack of customer focus."
bad,"managers here steal, there are about 7 different ""managers"" running around, all act high and mighty and you have to clean up dog fecal matter and juices."
bad,This is a first job kind of place and I mean no disrespect. But as an adult making 10 dollars an hour and the labor is hard makes the job not worth it. You are yanked around by dogs all day but you are always loving on them all day too so take the good with the bad.
bad,"For the amount of work done as a bather, $9 is not enough to compensate for the stress, overwork, physical exhaustion, and danger the job has. But i would have to say walk in claw grindings/clipping was the worst part because it messes up the whole schedule when you get a difficult dog that should only be handled by a vet (which was often). "
bad,"Worked for 3 years for this company in two different states. Store Mangers are your best friend. The lead mangers dont punish employees who are lazy, or don't use those who want to work in the right department thats needed. Example: Cashier just rings customers and stands in the front but the Pet Care who needs to care for small animals and pet parents that come in is always busy cleaning or helping in every way. They simple dont appericate those who want to help hence why I left. Only stayed because I love seeing pet parents come back with their pets and me remembering their pets name and life story if they shared."
bad,I can't say enough bad things about this location. Just... beware any job where most of the people are only there because they do not work well with humans.
bad,"Favoritism was the main culprit of the problem. Besides pretending they care about pets, they lacked poor management and would let some people get away with a lot of things; other employees would be written up for the most ridiculous things. "
bad,"I worked in the salon and they would regularly take animals without rabies vaccines. The store manager knew and did nothing to resolve the issue. It was unsafe in there so I asked to be transferred to a different location in the store."
bad,"When I started working at Petsmart I was a professional dog bather, as a dog bather you make close to minimum wage whereas at places like petco you make 40-50% commission on every dog you do PLUS an hourly pay (basically you can work really hard and not get the money you deserve that day). tips are of course nice but not a guarantee. Also what they don't tell you in the job interview is that once you take the job you are signing a online paper that says when you leave, (whether they fire you or you leave on your own terms), you can not go to a ""competing"" place to work for 6 months after you leave in a 30 mile radius of that store. That is with ALL positions at Petsmart in the salon and as a trainer. Also my goal as a bather was to work up and take advantage of the schooling they offered to become a dog groomer but I suggest to others to not take that offer because if you ever wanted to leave you can't go anywhere for 6 months and also they make you sign another contract saying that you have to stay with the company for 3 YEARS and if you quit OR they fire you, you owe them over $5,000."
bad,I was hired on being told that I would have gotten to go to the grooming academy by January of 2019 every time it would get close to a time they said I would be going to the grooming academy they would tell me I can’t go to that one I will have to go to the next one.. there wasn’t enough advancement in pay I was only making ends meet because I was living with someone else who covered the bills
bad,"There are no opportunities to advance to full time, no holiday pay or paid time off for part time workers. Animals are poorly cared for with cages too small and with terrible ventilation. All they care about is putting dollars in the big man's pocket."
bad,Management at this store was not the best.  Employees were spoken to poorly and the moral was not great during the time I was employed there.  I hope they have improved as it was very discouraging at the time.
bad,"Poor pay. Your pay won't go up if they increase the stores starting pay"
bad,"Horrible place to work. Girls are very catty and like to cause drama, management does nothing to stop it. Have seen a girl countless times crank on a dogs leg when it won’t cooperate, yet management does nothing. Was fired for calling in too many times while I have a dying brother going in and out of the hospital, management doesn’t care about their employees or the animals in their care. It’s all about making money and meeting quotas. Very pushy and stressful trying to keep up with quotas... I don’t recommend this job to anyone in the Windsor area."
bad,My experience was not a god one working for petsmart. The managers are very terrible to their employees and do not help what so every at the store i worked at. loved the animals and the customers but the managers drive everyone who cares away. would not recommend working here unless its an absolute must.
bad,"PetsHotel manager allows dogs to be sprayed in the face with vinegar and choke on collars until blood comes out dogs mouth without notifying owners."
bad,"Hated working here dogs for injuries all the time"
bad,Left job due to family emergency out of state.  I had to pack up and leave in one weekend.  I was never mailed my last check after repeated requests for them to do so.  I flew down to pick it up and by that time it had expired.  I was unable to cash it and they have refused to provide a new one.  I would never recommend anyone work at this establishment!  They steal from employees!!
bad,"The way they treat animals is disgusting. At my location, the management was all over the place so a lot got mixed up with employees. I wouldn't suggest it for ANYONE EVER."
bad,They do not follow their mission. They make it a big deal to memorize it but its for reciting purposes only. They dont treat pets with the best care. If you knew what went on behind the doors you would not actually board your pets.They don't treat their employees with respect.They promote within even if that person isn't fit for the job. Management is either aloof or micro managing you.
bad,"I started at PetSmart as a cashier. I really enjoyed my job, and had the confidence to do it good and get things done on time and answer any and all questions to the best of my ability. I really liked my managers and everyone seemed super nice, in the beginning... I eventually got into petcare, which of course made my hours go up. Everything was going great, and the weekly pay checks were awesome. Me loving to work, started to think of all the things I could do to up my hours even more. So I asked the store manager what I could do. When I was hired, she told me the more stuff I could do the more hours I could get. She then put me in grooming as a bather. And that.. is where everything went downhill. Me being very confident in my ability to adapt to any job, was met with hate and high school drama the moment I walked into that grooming salon. During my job out on the floor, I barely interacted with the groomers so I really wasn’t  prepared for how they were when I was then completely ripped out of pet care and put into grooming every single day. Which is not what I wanted(I was hoping to do bathing twice a week, and petcare the rest because I was one of only 3 people that could properly do petcare). I was then doing bathing five times a week. After two weeks, I already knew I didn’t want to do bathing anymore. I went to my store manager and she told me to ignore their behavior and that it wasn’t worth reacting to aka I was completely shut down instead of her actually going and fixing the situation. This would continue every other week of me telling her I couldn’t handle their"
bad,management is terrible. Mean. Judgmental. Obvious bias and lack of professionalism. 10/10 would NOT recommend this job to anyone. PetSmart also sells terrible food
bad,"I only worked here for 8 months but it was enough time to mess me up mentally and emotionally."
bad,Petsmart does not care for their employees. If you have a family they will suffer because you will never be home. Petsmart demands you work all holidays nights weekends. They will not work with you on your schedule. Only management gets to have nights weekends and holidays off. Petsmart does not compliment their employees when they have done a good job they just point out what your doing wrong all the time. I worked there for 4 years and the only reason I stayed that long is because the other groomers I worked with. This job is good for single people with no family.
bad,This job is very stressful and lacks teamwork.  Always gaps in the schedule and short staffed. More about the money than about the animals. Would not recommend.
bad,I worked at petsmart for over 5 years and left due to management. Its true management makes or breaks the team. They allow awful belittling humans to run their stores and groomers to be complete functioning alcholics on shift. But to each their own. Its shitsmart for a reason.
bad,"The work itself isn't that stressful or strenuous, but the poor management means you end up having to do more than your fair share of work without any real consequences for pushing work off on to others."
bad,Decent place to work but the lifting was too heavy. I didn't like the weekend shift because I had to get up super early. It wasn't convenient for me at all.
bad,"I worked as an early morning associate.  The hours were very limited.  I only worked 4 hours a day for less than 4 days a week.  I was seeking full time employment, but they were even trying to reduce those hours."
bad,"Most of my staff was overly passive aggressive (come on, we are adults), shady, & overall childlike. I ended up QUITTING over the phone because the STORE MANAGER could not be direct with me about an issue & kept beating around the bush. If I wanted to deal with immature people, I’d go sit around a bunch of children. Poor management. A lot of the staff needs coaching on how to deal with people in the workplace."
bad,"I have many mixed feelings about this company, they aren't very friendly towards there employees, pay is awful and management at the store level is awful as well as the higher up managers as well.  very disappointed with how petsmart turned out after they got bought out."
bad,"My last job at PetSmart was as a Night Pet Care Specialist.  What this mainly meant is that I cleaned up the play rooms and kennels for the doggy day camp and boarding.  We were over worked, understaffed and poorly managed.  It got to be a very stressful job because you never knew if you would have someone to work with that night or not."
bad,"I worked at two locations and the first one I worked at was a 6/10 stars BUT this location was, by far, my worst job ever.  I left crying daily from actual managers bullying - and I am TOUGH.  Its hard to upset me ever.  The management is awful, the turnover rate is miserable too. I never knew any of my co workers names because they would quit immediately. They've since replaced the manager I worked with but the friends who do still work there say it's gotten worse."
bad,"Long days, not a ton of foot traffic."
bad,Lack of enthusiastic managers; unethical treatment of the animals in their care; favoritism and seniority plays a huge part in hours given each week; poor training regimens
bad,"I was so excited to get this job, even though I was leaving something else that was paying better. I got hired and immediately after I got hired store management changed. I liked both managers and assistant managers I met. I had to do testing on the computer before I could go on the floor. I went in twice to do this and both times the program froze and they sent me home. I was told I would get a call when the program was working correctly again.. apparently it was a store wide issue. Two weeks came and went and I didn't receive any phone calls. I called the store and they said it wasn't up and running yet. I found another job and was able to start that before they got the program up and running. Waste of time. Now I don't even go here to shop."
bad,"Did not enjoy my time here, the pets and my coworkers were always a god send but the management is a joke. If you are a student they treat you horribly and if this is your first job they will try and take advantage of you around every corner. For example they would always ask someone to stay until 3am and then expecting them to be back at 6am that's just not right."
bad,"-As a stock/receiver and occasional cashier. A typical day at work was interaction with customers, handling different forms of payment, and working in receiving was a job that depended on speed, efficiency, and order."
bad,Management was really bad.  A handful of them were fired for stealing.  The job itself was empty.  I mainly worked as a stocker so I worked alone in the back of the store.
bad,Loved working here at the very beginning then the company started showing its true colors MONEY over the pets WELL BEING. Not a company I wanted to represent.
bad,"Store leader's only motivation is his bonus. You either help him or hinder him with that and you are treated accordingly. He will harass you if you get hurt and go on WBC. Salon leader is more interested in talking about drama in her personal life than actually doing her job and breaks so many safety rules it's crazy. She has been hurt more than any other employee at this location. As a manager she is required to work 36+ hours per week and she has never averaged more than 32hrs. "
bad,"If you work at Petsmart and notice someone isn’t doing their job then keep it to yourself. There is an open door policy but they do not enforce it. Petsmart has a clique, and they will try and go after you with everything they got, it would be ok to deal with except 2 of the clique members are managers. They will pin things on you, blame you for mistakes, belittle you, undermine you, and create conflict with you outside of work, stand around in groups talking about you then when you go over they disperse, consistently glare at you and ignore you. If it wasn’t for the people working there Petsmart would be a great place to work, but unfortunately that’s not the case. You usually are told you can take your breaks but then when you ask they say not right now and then when the time comes around for you to take your break it’s to late. So usually you just get a lunch unless you really annoy them for your breaks and then you have to hear them complain about how your putting them in a bind.  If you love animals don’t work here, I can’t say anything else but that. You are allowed to say no to the sale of animals but if you do that here you get treated poorly because they are all about sales. Lastly most of the manager are to overwhelmed and stressed out to even do a good job at work, but they all think they are gods. Petsmart is just an awful place to work at and if you want to keep your mental stableness then I suggest you stay far far away."
bad,I love working with animals and my fellow associates. Management however is incredibly unproductive and scattered. There are too many managers and ‘associates leads’ and communication between them is non existent. Communication between departments is poor as well which leads to many issues with customers. Management fails to staff  to meet the needs of the store and  doubles your work load to compensate for the lack of staffing rather  than take responsibility.
bad,"I worked at petsmart over the summer. I feel like I was robbed of my training because my trainer had multiple people so everytime I needed help, I had to wait when I could of been working. The trainer was good when I had him. He did his job but I felt like I would have succeeded better with one on one training.  I didn’t like my supervisor because he would talk to me crazy. He didn’t have people skills. Its kind of hard to keep a positive attitude all night when he nit picks and won’t let me do what I came to do. The manager it’s a sociable person either. He doesn’t speak to anyone. I never worked a job where the management team doesn’t acknowledge their associates especially when they are new. I knew if I continued to work there that I would end of getting fired so I quit to save the hassle. The pay is decent on paper but when you actually start working you’ll see that it’s not worth it."
bad,Loved the job..hated the management..very hard work..zero recognition..horrible pay..very discom obulated. I called corporate for help..recieved nothing.
bad,"They tell you to clean as you go, but if you don't hit those numbers, you better just start leaving slots even more messy than you found them or else! If you are not 20-something and fit, forget it. In any case, apply only if you can stand taking 0 pride in your work, every day, all 10-12 hours."
bad,The previous store I worked in was ok there was structure and a solid crew of people working there . I was asked if I was interested in a position in another so I took thinking it would be an opportunity for advancement boy was I wrong . The manager was clueless . I started with Petsmart in 2007 and never thought it could get as bad as this store was one feared with mice and rats . Most of all idiotic management !
bad,Not the best how ever the grass isnt always greener on the other side. Managers are bad and expect to much. You can make good friendships though if thats what youre looking for
bad,"First of all petsmart is by far the worst job I’ve had. The management only cares about management, they can do no wrong in the head managers eyes.  When I got hired the hiring manager said that they didn’t believe in the  hierarchy everyone is equal , But every time something goes wrong they say the  I’m above you. They schedule you based on how they like you. the head manager calls people in for hour long  “meetings”  and when we get busy he gets mad at everybody else because we are “short staffed” and getting bad surveys."
bad,Columbus oh groveprt dc was terrible they work you like a slave very heavy lifting at a fast pace i walked out during my shift some guys been there 15-20 years and was doing the same thing i was doing never advanced but all upper management was less then 8 years they dont promote within they are constantly over your back making sure you go faster and produce more orders like a overseer
bad,Petsmarts constant need to micromanage everything sucks the soul out of all their grooming salons.  Resistance is futile.  Take a look into the average salon.  A bunch of puppets on a string who aren't even allowed to have a DRINK AT THEIR TABLE.
bad,"relatively slow paced and not very much pressure. Handling animals was the most enjoyable part, but the hardest was the allergies. Learned to communicate and work well in a team based environment."
bad,They hire in District management and above. Awful onboarding training. No follow up from HR or DL's. Complex and archaic point of sale system and good luck navigating their ancient corporate intranet.
bad,Workday will last 10 to 12 hours and you ensure compliance and meeting daily goals established. Associates and customers are great and are awesome to work for. There is truly a lack of connection between leadership and associate.
bad,It was a very difficult place to advance.  What one does for another does not always apply to the next.  I loved working with the animals and collaborating with the clientele.
bad,"I cleaned dirty animal caged and medicated sick animals in the morning. In the morning around 9am customers came in, I had to advise them about the best pet based on a few different things. The store manager I had was pretty good, not great. The supervisors were not good. The supervisor of the petcare department was especially worthless. There really was not much of a culture. Hardest part of the job was the incompetent supervisors. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk with and work with pet parents and their pets."
bad,"management constantly changing and they don't care about their long term employees, management is unprofessional and treats employees like trash. constantly hires unfit people to work with animals with little to no proper training."
bad,"You work with great people and awesome leaders. Its really laid back and fun. If the pay was better I would of stayed. The store manager had favorites, that’s the only problem I had. And treated the non favorites disrespectfully."
bad,Compensation and benefits are great but no work/life balance. Technology is not up to date. Culture/metrics/vision constantly changing. Schedule fluctuates weekly.
bad,"For the most part, the people encountered were amicable and easy to work with, but hours continued to get cut despite us desperately needing more people. It was a constant revolving door in regards to the turn over rate, we had to constantly train new people because the entry wage was absolutely not enough for the emotionally and physically draining job. "
bad,"Management was terrible, as well as petty. Constantly going behind employees backs and not listening to scheduleing requests, was never enough staff scheduled."
bad,"A great place to work if you are saving up. The people at the Aliso store expect more than too much and tend to forget how to say ""Thank you"" rather than ""But you didn't do this"". Even after I skipped my break and was puffing up from the cleaning chemicals. They also will forget to give you days off if you ask. Keep reminding them."
bad,"Leaders have no respect for employees, do as little work as humanly possible and clearly show favoritism towards their friends. You will either skate by because you know how to kiss one of the leader's a** or you'll work yourself to death with zero appreciation. What Petsmart stands for and what they do is great, but the people that are in charge only care about the numbers and nothing else."
bad,"petsmart was a good place to work until they got new management. they don't take care of the workers that do their job, only the ones that slack off and cause problems for others. management does not support you for anything."
bad,"Bad, Gm doesn't even show up for work and blames others when his job/ work load is not done. District manager writes up new employees for not being responsible for a piece of equipment that has no traing coarse for and noone to train on it. Everybody is micro managed because they hire the cheapest work force."
bad,Favoritism is a key role in this company. Learned that you can show up everyday and never be late and still get fired!! Management is horrible if they don't like you they look for a reason to fire you. Stay out of inbound!!! Hardest part about the job was lifting the heavy boxes continuously for 10hrs. Most enjoyable part about the job is break time.
bad,"Alright store 0147 is a disaster in the hotel!!! The main manager chooses her favorites so the same five people are out of a playroom which is NOT far to the rest of the staff. She is condescending to the rest of the staff as well. I've had customers wonder why someone is always in a room and I've just had to shrug and change the subject. It bothers me how they're supposed to train associates up front after a few months of working in the pet hotel, however, there are 3-4 associates that have yet to even get out of a playroom for more than their 15 or their half hour lunch. Also some of their staff will look to others to figure out what they should do (which normally would be fine) but then complain to a supervisor or manager that the person they looked to was being bossy or rude. Also a few associates are extremely lazy about the work in the hotel; like the cleaning. Or they don't pay attention in the playrooms. They just stand in the playroom, twirling leads in their hands, leaning against the walls or practically ignoring the dogs (even if they're doing something they shouldn't like eating another pups poo or humping another dog). The only thing that seems to phase them, is when a dog starts getting snappy. "
bad,"Honestly this is THE worse company I have ever worked for!"
bad,"I don't like to talk negative of any company, but this part of the company needs a dramatic overhaul before it fails."
bad,"Come into usually 7 dogs a day, Answer phones, wash, clip nails, cut hair, customer service etc."
bad,"the managers are never around, they dont care about there employees, and that place is a revolving door"
bad,"I have worked for Petsmart DC for 2 years now. The work conditions are horrible. The management team is anything but helpful, and when they get a supervisor who is decent they corrupt them and bully them. The production expectations are constantly changing and the bar is almost set to be unable to succeed. They constantly change their procedures and expectations and hold you accountable to changes immediately without any time to adjust. Management spends more time in meetings than on the floor, and as far as the upper management GM, AGM etc are never around. There is a favoritism roll in the company, if you want to be treated good then hope you can get on first shift other wise expect to work your a** off and hope you succeed with little guidance or coaching. Trainers are horrible, that is just a blow off position. Basically everyone knows someone who has been fired from Petsmart DC and they are scraping the bottom of the barrel in looking for potential employees. I have a family to support which is the ONLY reason why I am still with this company and I am currently seeking other opportunities as I myself have not been meeting quota recently, might I add in the past 2 years i have been with the company I have never missed my quota until they started implementing their new changes."
bad,"fast paced, enjoyed job, hard work but better than going to gym"
bad,You need to make sure you dont give up having a personal life for them. things change alot so dont get comfortable. higher management is not with you they go against you.
bad,"Working here was not only severely stressful trying to make sure that customers were satisfied, but it was severely frustrating having to deal with some of the staff and management. It’s hard to get hours as a part-time worker, you be lucky to even get between 10-20 hours per week."
bad,This was a nice place to work it's just it's kind of like a Shooting Gallery and having an employee to tell you one thing and then GM tell you another that is not okay. there needs to be more Consistency.
bad,"The work was absolutely wonderful, and I was given much access to the animals and their care. I made some good work frends, and became a confidant to one in particular. We were promoted together, and worked closely to fix some problems left by our predecessors. But one day they told me that they and an associate were involved in extra-relationship activities, in the store and on the clock. The friend was a fairly threatening presence, and I was too afraid to say anything for a few months. In this time, the friend told me more and more of what they did with this other person, and even unabashedly leaving for lunch together only for the one still working to come back with hickies. They started slacking around at work, sitting together or with their ""favorites"" for long periods on the clock, and then complaining about the store starting to look dirty and unkempt. One comment finally pushed me over the edge of discomfort and I decided to tell my store leader. It was relayed to me that SL had confronted the friend, who denied everything, and then started to passive-aggressively punish myself and others i was close with at work. I spoke with my SL again, and was told that they couldn't start any investigation without photo/text proof, and if I felt the ""friend"" was being too passive aggressive, I could fill my resignation right then. I was and still am appalled at this entire situation because my friends are still involved. The stores are corrupt, and corporate is too focused on numbers to care much about the ground employees."
bad,"Computer super slow due to bad systems. Management is not helpful. Sexual harassment ran rampant at my store and HR doesn't do much when you call them. Groomers are treated like regular retail sales floor workers with being asked to do everything while trying to be in the salon grooming dogs as well. Expect to be asked to do more you can handle because sure enough you already get paid ""too much"".Pay was great even going down to part time but you have to take a lot of dogs to get there. Don't expect help from anyone and know the policy if you're in the salon. You can get fired if you forget it. Expect to be harassed by customers once they find your social media to groom their dogs on the side or squeeze them in that day. expect to get yelled at by management for not doing enough work."
bad,"Working with animals is great, the environment is fun and you learn many additional skills working at petsmart. However, advancement is a struggle and the work environment with associates is not desirable."
bad,"Be careful, if you want to work for one of their Distribution Centers. The environment you will be entering will be unpleasant. If you are not liked by the senior leaders, you more than likely, will not make it past a year. if you are thought to be under performing, you will loose your job. This isn't measureble, if they don't like you, whether you know how to do your job or not, they will fire you. "
bad,I would not ever work for Petsmart again. Being a groomer was great and making animals look good and connect with the Pet Parents. But they have horrible management and do not treat their employees well at all. I tried to advance multiple times and they would never give anyone a chance. Total favortisim in Petsmart.
bad,The management team doesnt seem to care about their employees. Very stressful place to work. Have to learn most of grooming by yourself. The pay is not worth it as they take a percentage of what you make per dog and if you don't commission out you than get hourly pay
bad,"Disloyal company, fired me bc I hurt my back but made the excuse “I had to many hours” they fired me because I was a liability to them but, it is illegal to fire someone for that reason so that made up an excuse. Pathetic management"
bad,"Management actively gangs up against pet care employees and care more about petty things than the lives of the animals. The amount of times animals have died as the result of management preferring to ""prove a point"" than get them help is unbelievable. I have never been so disrespected in my working career. They refuse to renovate anything including the animal enclosures that are taped up because of how many times the glass has broken. Do not work here, especially not in pet care, unless you want to suffer just as the animals do. Absolutely disgusting."
bad,When I started working for Petsmart it was a great company. New ownership has ruined that.  It’s now another example of rich executives trying to get richer by overworking and undercutting their staff.  The rats are starting to abandon the sinking ship. And those of us who work for Petsmart know that rats are very intelligent industrious animals.
bad,"They have unrealistic deadlines for everything to be done, support yes but not enough to make a difference. I’ve been with the company altogether almost 8 years and in the past few years have noticed a huge change for the worse within the company. Clearly they are all about the numbers and dollars with little regard to how the associates are treated. I used to love it and now I hate it."
bad,"With such a large company that claims to have an open door policy, the stores management falls through the cracks. Very immature management, clique like among the managers, and their opinions of their employees flip on a dime! Then when it comes down to it, its your word against theirs."
bad,"I enjoyed working close with clients and animals, a typical day working as a groomer is full of running around, bathing animals, cutting nails, shaving hair, scheduling appointments and taking calls. It is a very fast paced environment and I had to multitask all day everyday."
bad,"I got hired on as a dog bather at the south store in Rochester. To begin with this was my favorite job I've ever had. It can be hard but fun work if you get along with your Co workers. The Co wokers there were the groomers, they have been there for many years. I kept to myself a lot because the only fun part was working with the dogs. My Co workers talked behind my back I don't know what was said but they must have said something mean enough to have the Manager of the store want to move me. I know I did nothing wrong.  I complained many times about the drama and the girls just being plain mean to me. They didn't do anything about it. I quit when I found out they didn't want me in the salon anymore. So I feel the managers took there words over mine.  I looked at my store leader and said I did nothing wrong and your making me quit pretty much.  It's favoritism to the max. I loved that job but just couldn't handle it anymore. I was only there for about 6 months."
bad,typical day would start at seven in the morning. If you didn't have any dogs you would have to sit and wait to see if any would come in. The salon manager always had her picks of who she liked. if you wasn't on her good side then she would give you a lot of extra work to do. the management wasn't good there. some of the managers where decent but they all hung out outside of work getting drunk and partying all the time. if you wasn't in their click then it was as if you where over looked. When you would need mang alot of times they would be to busy to even come back to the salon to see what was going on so you would have to solve the problem your self. Then there was the issue of ppl in the salon always saying that every dog that came in the salon was their req dog. certain ppl would get so upset if a dog they had done just one time came in and went to some1 else. then you have the salon narc. this person would watch everything you did. Go back and tell the salon manager everything and then add to it. The bathers are another store.Only one of the bathers is worthy of being mentioned as a great person and bather. The other one did not know how to do her job and was scared of dogs. Plus she would yell at the dogs. You could feel the tension in the salon as soon as you walked in. Its like everyone was talking about you or they just had something against you. Or I believe it could just be the way the place felt all together.
bad,"This company is all about money, and not about pets. The management team I was a part of gave inaccurate advice to customers, that had ne concernes for their pet's safety."
bad,Management sucks in both stores i was at. The company sucks as a whole they dont care about employee's or the dogs honestly. They care about money  $$$
bad,"The people here were fantastic - coworkers, managers, customers. However, the general manager (Dave) was just impossible to work with. He micromanages everything and doesn’t give you any opportunities to learn and grow. He would even come in off the clock to “shop” and would just micromanage, criticize, and nag for an hour. As for the other managers, they were generally very helpful and understanding if you needed to take a day off or switch. Just don’t take advantage of them."
bad,"The job was fun at first, but having to handle mean and angry dogs all week can kill your mood fast. Plus I couldnt get the hours I needed here. Me and another bather asked for more hours and management decided to instead hire a brand new bather."
bad,"I really enjoyed working here until new management took over. One by one my co workers started to be replaced because of it. Good hard working people shafted by new management. "
bad,"typical day at work is coming in to the store to the weird smell of all different animals not just dogs. Typical worker will face the store and work with products from animals to treats to heavy lifting of dog houses and dog food. They maintain the store clean, animals and the floors from animal wastes. cleaning animal tanks from snakes to birds,skorpions, fishes, birds and sick animals as well. The management aren't the best but there are some great store managers that i worked with that were excellent managers. The hardest part of working in this job is sometimes the coworkers but most importantly the kinds of dogs you get in the store. You will never know if you will be working with a nice or bad pet. Most enjoyable part of the job is that you encounter lots of different kinds of animals not just dogs and cats."
bad,"This was an easy job.  I trained customers on how to properly train their dogs.  I sold training classes and helped other employees with question they were unable to answer, helped out running the register when necessary and helped management close training sales. The management staff was great.  The employee benefits left something to be desired.  Unfortunately I worked every weekend and nights, which is not conducive to raising children."
bad,"A typical day at work for the pet products manager, was arriving at the location at approximately 3:50am to let the rest of the team into the building to begin work. This would consist of a little bit of paperwork, while your team moves displays and pulls out the pallets, working, with the team to unload all pallets, stock shelves, move overstock into places, and correct wrong overstock placement from the previous evening. The next person comes in around 7:45."
bad,This is a great part time job as it allows me to be helpful to people and make a positive impact in the lives of our customers and their pets. The people are wonderful and the animals are even better!
bad,"most disguised sales job with impossible adherence goals to hit. Some folks didn't even make it past the 2nd week of very poor training and they were walked out quietly. (training was a joke, no questions answered, and no training applied to actual position.)New training classes every few weeks due to high turn around, not growth or ""work at home"" positions. Smoke and mirrors.. Treated like a number and not a person."
bad,"Favouritism abounds at petsmart.  they say it doesn't, but you sure know it does.  You are damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't... I don't suggest working here to anyone."
bad,"my managers sucked! Only ever one cashier in the evening, I had requested one day off and it was denied. It was my cousins graduation and I called off with 7 hours in advance and the manager gave me a hard time! Not my fault you only ever have 3 employees in the whole store at a time! And then my STORE managers husband would come in EVERYDAY and walk the store and give me nasty looks, then the manager would lock his dog in the office all day and only take it out 3 times a day. Then, I was only scheduled ONE DAY the whole month. Totally awful."
bad,"Store manager routinely does things to demotivate staff.  Treats them like children, although children might fair better.  Talks down to staff, rants and raves, acts like every time something breaks down money is coming out of manager's pocket to fix.  Ran out of printer paper twice just in the last month in the entire store.  Really?  Maybe manager buys paper at Staples 1-2 reams at a time so manager can claim mileage on car??? Not sure what motivates this type of thought process.  Very bad.  Calls out bad behavior of individual employees in front of other employees.  Very unprofessional from a management stand point."
bad,Petsmart ran their bathers crazy. I was doing about 14 dogs a day (mostly big dogs) in a six hour day. Then I would get them out in a timely manner but the management didn’t want to send me to academy. I was making the store more money than the other bathers I had potential in being a groomer.
bad,"I did not enjoy working here. The management only cares about money rather than the well being of the animals. They don't take the time to train and educate their employees, instead they just want you to push sales. They don't care about animals."
bad,"Was let go after my availability changed. I was working two jobs, and told them my availability would be different, they begged me to stay when I put in my two weeks notice, then fired me when they felt like it."
bad,Do not recommend working here at all.  The pay is not good and they refuse to give you more hours. The managers will overwork you and never show that they appreciate you.
bad,Good work environment but no opportunity for growth or shift changes. I enjoyed my time at the company but management is no help when you have health and or family changes in your life outside of work
bad,"Managers will allow customers to yell, cuss, belittle you in front of other people whether or not you did something wrong, Then proceed to blame you. Most of them do not care for the lives of the animals only about sales and conversion. Managers will yell at you themselves, have no regard for your health or families if you try to call out. Will refuse you official two week notice and then proceed to fire you."
bad,"Petsmart is a company that only cares about the money it earns and not the people who work for them. They will run you into the ground with work and keep adding to your original roll that you sign on for without asking. HR complaints aren’t taken seriously. They fight workers comp claims that take place and have video proof of. Overall a terrible company to work for, don’t do this to yourself no matter how bad you need a job."
bad,"I was dismissed from my job for being on my cell phone. Everyone was on their cell phones. I have Asperger’s syndrome and struggle with social cues, and did not receive clear direction from my supervisor. It was the best job in the world until the new supervisor arrived. I haven’t been able to secure a job since I left."
bad,"poor animal Care policy enforcement. Animals/fish constantly dying due to habitat issues left unresolved. Poor building upkeep.. i.e: blood on floors, uncleaned urine/feces. No supervision for employees by upper-management. Just not a pleasant place to work. Gossip encouraged/repeated by upper-management, favoritism,"
bad,"The main problem with petsmart is that the live animals they get come from irresponsible breeders, these pets are obviously kept in ill conditions since we get shipments of sick animals all of the time. Corporate is aware and yet does not change the suppliers. All they care about is sales. They do not care about managers or the concerns , if any problems occur they can just find a reason to fire or move the person to another store location."
bad,"Despite having all the skills and abilities after repeated application for available positions that don't get filled for months, I still get rejected. I suppose the recruiters Petsmart aren't concerned about making their work place more inclusive and diverse. I get a feeling that the recruiters are very biased and narrow minded. Very disappointed. Will never apply again."
bad,I would not recommended working here. They expect you to do too much with not enough people or resources. They do not care for their employees. The company is moving away from taking care of the animals and becoming money hungry.
bad,pay was pretty good but advancing was not happening and i dont want a job im looking for a long term career goal not being stuck starting at the bottom and ending there too
bad,This company is so backwards. They claim they care about animal welfare yet they sell rodents that come in sick and infested with lice all the time. Plus the discount sucks.
bad,"I honestly loved working here because of the clients. However the employees in the grooming salon, only know what they are taught from corporate. Petsmart is a self taught corporate business and they do not teach the basics of every breed or healthy animal care to their salon employees. The grooming staff is very uneducated and gives a lot of false information to clients."
bad,Little to no opportunities to grow within the company. Lack of care for employees. Terrible conditions of pets. Lack of standardization of care across company.
bad,the only wanted us to work and had zero time to go to the bathroom during the day because everything we did was timed and atomically calculated. also they had know one there to train you the right way.
bad,The best part of my job was working with the animals. 5 years of service and not appreciated for the hard work and long hours.
bad,poor management... rarely get to take a lunch would not recommend if one has other options.  Managers get caught sleeping and leaving associates by themselves and nothing gets done....
bad,Not a good company to work for. They make you hustle really hard as a stocker and pay you next to nothing while doing it. Do not work here.
bad,"As a professional bather, a typical day consists of me bathing and providing care for many different types of dogs. I learned a important trait in the retail business and that's customer service skills. Due to my improvement I even received a employee of the month for the month of April 2014. I loved my management and my co-workers. I knew each time I stepped into the building that the day would be full of laughs and  I got along with everybody beautifully. The one hardest thing about the job would be, dealing with dogs who are afraid or intimidated by the services we provide. Getting them to cooperate was difficult, but when you show them love and care, typically they come around. The most enjoyable thing was seeing the pet parents faces when they get their dog back groomed nicely and clean."
bad,PetSmart has a Bully Culture.  Managers are almost forced to keep the employees in a state of panic about losing their job.
bad,"Its has been a great experience to work along side some very knowledgeable staff, but in terms of animal care and the actual facility, it is quite lacking. The indoor facility where the day camp takes place is much to small especially for the large dogs and is not designed very well. for the most part staff are caring and attentive and focused on the welfare of the dogs, but not surprisingly the managers are more focused on money then making sure the dogs are a good fit. There really seems to be no type of assessment done and dogs are just thrown into camp as long as they have their vaccines. Luckily a lot of dogs are great fits and seem to enjoy themselves but with the ones that do not(aggressive, high anxiety, or just do not like it) there is little done. Dogs that are very aggressive and continually cause fights are allowed to keep coming back and we are discouraged from telling the owners about any issues (or that their pet is not a good fit or does not enjoy it) unless in extreme cases because of, I'm assuming, loss of sales. As an associate we are definitely overworked and underpaid for the amount and type of work we do. As well as their doesn't seem to be enough training for those that are put into camp. A lot of the associates are not experienced in dog behavioural assessment and majority of us are not trained in pet first aid. While it was a good experience and most of the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, I think petsmart should stick to being exclusively a retail store."
bad,did most of the frieght
bad,"First, from day one I noticed a lack of training and hours favoring experienced people, never giving new workers appropriate hours to train or pay bills, I asked for 25 hours and was lucky to get 14  so, because I was untrained, I was only ever on cash register  if you want to work with animals try somewhere else  so disappointing and I felt undervalued"
bad,"Work for this company for over 8 years . It never appreciated the hard workers. Also it was all about the money there was no compassion or caring for the pets, pet parents or employees ."
bad,Good and the work was alright and it was good to have a job well in school and there were a lot of stuff to learn and all that but it was in good fun.
bad,job was great but the treatment of the animals was horrible. litter boxes overflowed constantly and animals were cages for excessive periods of time and never let out. they made it impossible for people to afford the cates sometimes charging 200 for a basic cat. rediculious
bad,"Good people. Horrible management. They cant keep anybody because they're so selfish and absolutely do not care. They dont care about how good an employee is at their job, they only care about the ones who they can control and wont see through their excuses. Been there over a year and the store lead still dosent know my name. Also managers do alot of shady stuff so employees wont get their bonuses. Awful. I'm sure some store are great but avoid this one. It will only bring you down with it."
bad,The pay doesn’t compare to all the work you put in this place. The dogs were great but the staff was separated. There’s favoritism as well. Wouldn’t go back to here.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for this company if you actually need money to survive. The pay for groomers is a joke in California and its set up so you can’t make money. Petsmart has all these rules for “animals safety” yet they make you answer the phones and schedule appts all the while tending to dogs needs and actually grooming them. Taking dogs on and off the tables multiple times to answer the phones is in no way safe or conducive to grooming dogs. There is so much drama also at the store I worked at that it is not a good environment to work in. Also I was threatened by management because I chose to leave because i was offered a better job. I am the sole provider of my family and had get a better paying to survive yet i was harassed right before leaving. Totally unprofessional in every shape and form. One of the worst jobs ive ever had. It was so bad i pert after 3 months.
bad,"When I first started, I ADORED working at PetSmart. I started as a cashier and was quickly moved over to pet care. I absolutely adore caring for animals, so being moved to pet care was amazing for me, until I realized how overworked and under-appreciated I was. Managers are extremely childish and pick favorites, and also have no respect for employee availability. Animals aren’t given the proper care and associates aren’t given the proper equipment or training to care for them. An awful and sad place to work."
bad,"No formal career path (although promised at interview), store manager yelled a lot. The grooming dept was horrific in the way they treated the dogs. (never get your dog groomed there), no work life balance, paid benefits not much of a perk, dog trainers not qualified to train dogs. Take a pass working here."
bad,When I started I was given lots of hours for the first few months. When I started asking for partial days off to attend medical appointment my hours were drastically cut with no reason given.
bad,"lack of teamwork and rough behavior with animals. I did enjoy interacting with the animals, I just didn't like how they were treated by other groomers and bathers. easily overbooked and rushed on a daily basis"
bad,"Dont get me wrong i loved petsmart but it was horrible managers where not on top of what was going on and continue to blame everyone but themselves not only that bather are in charge or there own area but when others are behind then must drop what there doing to shower there coworker dog then continue to work on their own some groomers help when bathers are behind but its not a requirement compared to the other way around,"
bad,"If you're looking to work in the Wilmy area at PetSmart, I would suggest looking at the Mayfaire or Monkey Junction locations. The New Centre location is an absolute joke. Everyone is immature, irresponsible, and accountability is a joke. If you're okay working for a place that allows workers to kill animals with no repercussions, then this might be the place for you."
bad,Managers are decent to work for just pay sucks. When I was hired I worked early mornings but decided I wasn’t paid enough to be waking up that early so I stopped.
bad,"Only giving stars because I got to work with dogs. Management was awful. Was moved into a different department without consulting first or even letting me know just changed the schedule on me because manager didn’t like me. "
bad,"I started as a bather in the grooming salon, after the basic computer tests you'll start right away with hands on training which quickly becomes very stressful, as nail trims and dog baths are in high demand.. you will however get good weekly hours depending on the season and the store ofc. The salon environment will differ from store to store, so I can only speak on my own experiences.. but the salon has always somewhat been hostile, and a very cliquey work environment. The salon I worked in was very small, and crowded, so it was easy for people to get frustrated and start unprofessional drama in the work place. I would recommend if you're interested in the job to stay focused on the care of the animal no matter how stressful the work environment gets, they are what matters most. This is not the job for the lazy or the weak, it will try your patience and make you want to cry at times, but always remember to only sign up to work with animals if you're fully prepared to take on all the stress and fast decision making that comes with it."
bad,"Very hard to earn pay raises, a lot of work as a petcare associate for little pay. Management was very rude and unorganized. Have to have some customer service  and retail experience but they do not require any prior animal medicine experience."
bad,"Mgnt Treated employees like trash. Spoke to us like bad kids. Did not stand up for their employees. Does not train their employees!! "
bad,"Began well, then over the course of 3 years of  working the store went through I believe it was 5 general managers.  People were brought in from other stores promised positions they were never given and forced to work extra duties that were under their pay grade.  Started at 9 an hour and at the end of my 3 yrs there I made 9.99 because 10.00 is apparently far too much.  Seniority, skill, work ethic, and so much more mean absolutely nothing to them all that matters is that less than the bare minimum of workers doing everything in 1/4 of the time needed to attempt the tasks.  Making one person, maybe a second put away an entire semi trailer worth of pet food/goods/etc.  in less than 3 hours time while also cleaning the entire store.  Employees are forced to absorb the responsibilities of sometimes 3 or 4 positions in the store due to management's lack of hiring the appropriate amount of employees."
bad,"I work here and I’m trying to get a new job for a reason. It’s a high stress job and you get little reward. Especially if you are in petcare. You are in charge of all animals from reptiles to small animals, birds, and even adoption. Managers expect way to much from you."
bad,"The constant pressure to meet quotas, sell puppy guides, and harass people for email capture makes an already stressful job even worse. Management is extremely hit or miss, with most managers more interested in having good numbers rather than actually keeping employees and store animals happy and healthy."
bad,"I worked for pet smart for 2 years, Store managers could care less for the pets in their store all they see is money. There is no room for advancement due to stores not making sales or doing too well. Employees are paid poorly and the turn over rate at the stores are 60/100. They are not very flexible or understanding and refuse to hire anyone in school and so they do not have to deal with unemployment they will attempt to flush you out."
bad,"I decided to take the job to this place due to the fact that I want to be a Vet Assistant. It was the worst idea I ever had. They expect you to do many things in the course of one day and yet the pay isn't worth it. "
bad,"I hated working here. Management was all very immature and unprofessional. They were constantly gossiping and having inappropriate conversations with associates. They would also gang up and harass employees for no reason and then when the employee would try to follow instructions they would find a different reason to complain. We weren't allowed to take proper care of the animals and told to just do quick checks to make sure they had food and water, but not enough time to socialize or check the overall health of the animals. Associates are poorly trained and very rarely know what they are talking about unless they have been there for a long period of time. They never give you your breaks, you have to ask for them or you don't get them.  DON'T WORK HERE!"
bad,I ran the morning stock team. I drove the forklift and got pallets down from the steel and filled shelves daily. The job was fast pace and the manager i worked for was difficult
bad,"When I first started the focus was on pets and customers. When I left it was only about conversion and sales, customer service was unimportant, and the culture became one that didn't care even about its employees."
bad,the management does not care for employees.  Employee morale amongst them is awesome however the management team needs restructuring. Good company for having discounts
bad,"They expect miracles but are unwilling to offer support or encouragement. They throw all employees under the bus, they have formally disciplined every management member for not accomplishing goals that they themselves never work towards. the manger is perpetually grumpy, the assistant has issues with dealing with members of the public and so hides in the office and is notably put out when she has to come out to deal with customers."
bad,"Recent restructure really killed the amazing culture PetSmart had years ago. I quit because the environment became toxic. Your results may vary depending on the management in the store and district.  Its become very cliquey- a new District Manager pops in, and suddenly store managers get replaced with people the DM used to work with. The culture is no longer about bringing together pets and people, managers are forced to solely focus on cutting costs."
bad,"Pet care is hard work. Most days It doesn't feel worth it. Starting out It was fun and exciting, but you soon learn that management is bias towards new workers and holds them to the same level and especially ""speed"" to others who have worked there for years. "
bad,I love the customers and most of my co-workers that work there but one person in particular i cant stand. She's never on time for work and she doesn't give me the hours that i need.
bad,The current store i work for only cares about the money they make and has no consideration for the care of the animals who are in the care of the employees. The management also does not care about the well being of their employees as well. I will admit some of the employees do care about their job and a few managers care but the main store director and our manager above our store director does not care for the well being of the animals or employees in their care.
bad,"Overloaded work day. "
bad,"Grooming salon is busy, the girls are gossipers so know you will always be talked about.  You get paid minimum wage for getting bit, hurting your back and getting wrist problems.  You are expected to work every weekend and also expected to handle dogs that bit you.  If you have a soul, dont work here or you will loose it."
bad,"I worked here for 3 years and wasn't appreciated for the hard work I did, however it gave me the leadership skills I needed that would will follow with my career in the future."
bad,a typical day at work
bad,Not a good experience.horrible management and lapse in communication.
bad,I worked in the PetsHotel section of the store
bad,"A very sales pressured job, often pressuring people to purchase items and services they don't need. Management was not attentive to employee needs, health or safety."
bad,Worked as a pet stylist appreciate aka a bather. You start at 9/ hr including tips. The training is all on computers and kind of silly because everything is hands on with the actual job. Dealing with the animals is very stressful and you’re prone to getting bitten or attacked if you don’t handle them correctly. Sometimes they push you to groom a possible vicious dog  even if you’re not comfortable. In the end the fear I had of getting attacked and the terrible hours and pay led to me quitting. This job made me start to dislike animals and that wasn’t a good feeling.
bad,"Job is ok, training is ok, mediocre communication.  No breaks, only lunch breaks, inconsistent hours, drama, high turnover.  Best part is the pets, & most customers."
bad,It was stressful all the time. No one did their job but me and 4 others. Management was a joke. They sat around in the office and got mad when people asked for help.
bad,"If you like jobs where the managers care about you having a life outside working, don't work here. If you like your managers to have reasonable expectations of what can be accomplished in a short (5-6 hr avg) shift, don't work here. I've worked in the petcare department, and the store manager doesn't care about the welfare of the animals and will cancel vet appointments regularly. You won't get a raise, either."
bad,"Fun to see animals in the workplace but management did not care about staff or their well-being at all. Proper training is not provided at all, and staff are expected to do way more than they get paid for."
bad,Did not explain all aspects of job  poor training not enough hours to make the commute  worth while  When one asked for help or an explanation of  how to perform the job task  no help was offered
bad,"My son had passed away and even with factual and tangible proof of insurability, the district manager along with an HR manager for reasons unknown, manipulated the job start date benefits coverage forms which denied the benefits qualifications and subsequently our ability to finance his internment services.Only God knows"
bad,"I’m sure the company as a whole is better than the store I worked at, though the constant questions revolving around the grooming salons safety was stressful. A close friend of mine is still a groomer there and I recommend her, but not the store. The manager I had was awful. Verbally abusive and offensive to team members and customers at times. She was the worst problem there."
bad,I adore pets and am always eager to educate pet parents to better care for their animals. Petsmart was more focused on pushing product out the door than educating customers. Cashiers are largely ignored and management would rather give you a nasty comment when you asked for help or backup.
bad,Constant gossip and bad mouthing of coworkers. Mexican coworkers racist against me.  Catty and cruel environment. They have criminals working there. I was harassed and pushed to my limits. I was underappreciated and underpaid. Just a terrible environment all around. I really enjoyed working with the dogs. I was given way too many large dogs in a single shift and my back was in bad shape by the time I moved on.
bad,"so i started working at petsmart due to my love for animals. i loved the job and once i got really into it things came naturally although the management sucks, i complained multiple times about employees just to have my store leader write me up for not being a team player. managers could sit in the office or on the sales floor hours before being on the clock and never lifted a finger. i never got a vacation although i was there for over a year. customers stole all the time and nothing was done. management didn’t cate about anything unless it directly affected them. they all avoided confrontation. i would still have my job if all the managers weren’t 20 years old and all best friends. terrible place that i will never support again."
bad,"The only job I've had to go to HR for. Management is often abusive and makes the stores inhospitable, which is trickle down from the attitudes of higher ups. Hard work is not rewarded and they will bleed you dry if you are honest and accountable. Would not recommend, even if you like animals."
bad,"terrible management... inconsistent scheduling... aggressive and incompetent store manager... consider this location only if absolutely necessary. think about gas station work before a position with this company in las vegas, NV"
bad,They will bark you down when they get yelled at by corporate and sometimes the tasks are tedious and there is no way to defend yourself when customers accuse you of something you did not do. They lack empathy towards workers and open door policy is a joke. they are not leaders just over paid cashiers and stockers.
bad,Good beginning job but not a stable career. Hours were cut. Doesn't pay enough for the work you do. Most days they were short staffed so they would call people who were on their day off to come into work last minute.
bad,"Managers were constantly coming and going in the location I worked for, with a lot of them unable to handle the stress and pressures brought down from higher up in the company, There are a lot of policies, many which leave too much work for too few people with even fewer hours. There is very rarely any recognition from managers or district managers towards the staff, which is a shame because those who chose to work there genuinely care about the animals and people they come into contact with every day."
bad,"Not a great work environment. Lots of gossip, including management gossiping about employees and other managers. Situations that should have been taken serious were not, situations that were taken serious should not have. Higher ups could not connect with employees due to no actual knowledge of Grooming or pet sales."
bad,"It's a good place to learn how to groom, but not great for the long term. The corporation setting isn't a fantastic place to groom and you can get fired over the littlest thing"
bad,"Loved working with the animals, but management wouldn't allow any more than 28 hours a week. And I was making maybe 8.50 an hour. They refused to give any extra hours or promote anyone so they could support themselves and their families. The favoritism was ridiculous, and the management was always complaining about never having coverage, yet couldn't offer overtime."
bad,"Petsmart was fun at first but the job is very repetitive. Many times all the managers cared about was Sales, conversion, and  not so much the health of the animals. Associates were often times tasked with managerial tasks.  Managers typically only saw the issues with the department and never the success."
bad,"I worked at petsmart for a year, where they threw me in the salon without knowing a thing and then punished me for not knowing anything by cutting my hours and not booking me clients for three months.I was just a maid service."
bad,Management sucked. The pay was horrible. Not enough hours. you  barely can make ends meet. Not a good job for someone trying to support a family. More of a job for high schoolers and college students.
bad,"Despite my impeccable work outcome, and phenomenal customer service, i was constantly overlooked for advancement in my position for people who either didn't have the requirements for the job or had only been with the company for a short amount of time. I left a full time job with the promises of being promoted once i had full availability, only to be told the position was no longer available once my two weeks were done with my previous job. I still stayed for 2 years and 6 months."
bad,When I started at petsmart back in 2015 the location I worked at was upbeat and even when we hit hard times there was still the time when we would come out of the not so nice rutt we had fallen into. But once management changed after the first year and a half we began our decent into the same rutt however there was no coming out of the rutt this year and I saw more and more employees leave and complain about how petsmart is not the best place to work than I ever thought possible.
bad,"Like watching your superiors mistreat animals behind the scenes? Like being forced to work even when it isn't the holidays and you have to attend a funeral? Like watching your managers sit with their feet up in the back doing nothing while customers are waiting? Then Petsmart is the place for you! Only one good manager here, the rest of the superiors are rude, nasty, and completely dehumanizing. They're desperate for employees because no one wants to work in a cruel environment for little money."
bad,"There is to much favoritism, to many clicks.  If you work hard here you get put down that you didn't do your job right, for whatever reason.  The management does not care about their employees only if you are in their click.  The hardest part of this job is trying to stay positive with all the negative around.  The only thing I like about the job is the animals, some of our lasting customers, and just a handful of co workers going trough the same thing I am."
bad,I loved all the animals and I learned new things. Working in the grooming salon allowed me to learn a new trade while working closer with dogs. However I also noticed the lack of management support. They were told to offer and charge for services the salon  but were not given the supplies to provide these services because they were not in the budget. Their were also safety concerns that were ignored .
bad,"The management was not very helpful when it came to training and helping employees, the hours were not ideal and it really took a toll on my day to day living."
bad,"This company is so micromanaged that if you work there as a store employee, you are in complete dark about any decision being made. Even stuff that store managers know is not frequently passed down to employees and promises of promotions are broken often. You as an employee are left with the perception of being lied to often. I loved the pets and the customers but this is the first job I ever quit without having one lined up for a reason."
bad,"they don't care about the animals, or the people. The absolute worst company I have ever worked for. Employees were bullies, management didn't care about harassment."
bad,Not sure if it was just the location I worked but management was awful. Preached all these values but then would sit in their office all day and not assist the employees when needed.
bad,"As a cashier you have to ring up customers along with asking for their phone number then you have to get their emails to be able for the customer to get updates and all the new things that are coming. You have to face the treat wall close to the register so you can see customers. You have to sell puppy guide coupon books. We have to meet a certain goal with email captures and puppy guides. I love to see all the pets that come in it makes me smile. You will most likely get cross trained in pet care which means you have to scrub fish tanks, feed and change bedding, keep back rooms clean and make sure animals in isolation get their medications. You may also have to do customer service such as answer phones, walk around store asking customers what they are looking for, face the store, bring stock down and fill holes, keep all shelves filled if possible with product."
bad,"Pet smart is filled with SICK animals, but of course you will not find that out until you're working there and have to care for, and deeply sanitize after, extremely I'll animals at the fault of"
bad,petsmart is a great place to work if there are proper managers. nice people. fun working with animals. customers were nice some days. stocking can be fun. feeding the animals can also be fun
bad,"The management allows for there to be a large amount of drama within the store and does nothing to stop the issues. This creates a stressful work environment for many of the associates. We are also required to do the job of what should be an entire team because management does not want to work most of the time."
bad,"An excellent work place will be a place where u feel at home and work with people who love your presence. But the structure of a firm where your voice is not heard, no love and communication exists, there is no motivation to work and no free growth as expressed by the firm, such establishment is not the perfect working environment."
bad,I love dogs but this company treats its grooming staff like factory workers. No time for meal breaks and a very stressful environment.
bad,"manegment is horrible"
bad,"I had the worst managers at the Chambersburg, PA location. The only thing good about this job was the discounts. A typical day included being constantly criticized by the managers. I did learn a lot about care. The hardest part of the job was selling animals to owners you knew were not going to care for the animals. I enjoyed meeting new pet parents though."
bad,"I worked at different locations in Ottawa for pet smart. I really loved working with a lot of the staff at two locations they took pride in their jobs, they were very organized and the hours were great. I enjoy working with people and most of all learning about animals and their needs on a daily basis."
bad,"Management at Petsmart in Wilkesboro are never available to the employees, part-time associates cannot afford the insurance provided, extremely hard to advance with the company, WOULD NOT reccommend anyone try to get a job here or accept a job here with the intention of building a career."
bad,It can be a fun place for a second job or someone who doesn't have to rely on a paycheck to survive
bad,"This company was okay, I mean the management is also not very great here, the pay and the hours were horrible."
bad,"The assistant manager was very rude to both employees and customers."
bad,This company has went down hill for the past couple years. Leadership does not know the jobs well enough to help with issues. You become just a number not a face or person. They tell you one thing and complete change it without notice.
bad,"If you plan on working in the petcare department beware. The training given for this department is incredibly lacking. The official training program will teach you next to nothing about the animals you must care for. The monthly videos are equally as ineffective and often blatantly wrong. As an employee, you are expected to keep poorly bred unhealthy animals alive long enough to be sold to families who often know nothing about the animals being purchased. In day-to-day care, you are given short amounts of time to complete detailed cleanings and care for animals not being cleaned. Most of the time pet safety and health are pushed to the side as profits are always prioritized. However, IF you get good managers this can be mitigated. That being said management quality varies dramatically from store to store."
bad,"Petsmart will treat you like a factory line. The management may care about you, but the company itself could care less about you or your well being. You are just another money maker."
bad,You will be told continuously that you’re gonna get promoted or move up to a higher position. It never happens or they do the bare minimum to make you stop asking
bad,It's very very stressful they just see you as a sollar sign not a person training is quick and not long enough they pay you barely above minimum wage and expect you to give them your life
bad,"I used to love this job so very much and now it hurts to go into work every day. My threshold for stress has gotten to the point where my every waking moment is spent thinking about my job. And quite frankly, I do not get paid enough for that level of intense stress. I have given my time, dedication, and passion to Petsmart and all I have to show for it is a cumulation of 50 cents in raises over the last two years. Time and time again I have asked for raises and promotions and been passed up for people who have been with Petsmart for less time and have less experience than me. The only reason I was ever given for my lack of advancement within the company was due to my schooling and yet there have been several instances of other people in college getting promotions over me. Never was I spoken to about my behavior on the job or my attendance, never a plausible reason for why I could not advance. I proved that I was capable of working full time and going to school and was ignored.  Then I was told there was a part time supervisor position and still I was ignored. I was told that I was a good employee, promotions and raises were dangled before me like carrots with nothing to show for it. Still, I remained. I watched as people with no experience with animals were brought in as management, listened to employees complain about the same things I had with absolutely nothing done to help, and did my best to ignore the constant barrage of passive aggressive treatment from supervisors. Corporate has now decided to initiate some of the dumbest policies I have ever seen. Not only are they"
bad,"so i love my job. i love playing and taking care of the dogs and cats. however, the management is a joke. They expect you to dedicate your entire life to the job. Ive gotten calls/texts from very late at night asking for a shift, and at the same time cutting your scheduled hours. Also, they only care about profit and not the well being of the dogs."
bad,"At first, I loved working at PetSmart. The team seemed nice, the work isn't strenuous in the pet care, customer service, and cashier departments. Unfortunately, though, I quickly learned that everyone in the establishment talks horrible about one another when they're not around, the managers disclose other's private information to other coworkers, and the pay frankly just sucks. Most department stores pay their employees additional to early morning stock. Not here at least not in Waynesville, NC. Overall, this is just a job. They don't truly care about their employees whatsoever."
bad,"Poor management and employees are kept in place, promoted, or hired due to who they know, not how well their job is done. Favoritism, nepotism ignored"
bad,Terrible management!! They pick and choose their favorites and they are the ones who actually get hours and they cut everyone else's! If you do anything management doesn't like they will remake the schedule immediately and cut you to 4 HOURS PER WEEK!! I love the actual store but management is completely horrible!
bad,If you have a good manager they understand that you work hard because they understand and they’re there to see it and empathize.If you have a bad manager which is mostly the case numbers only matter and they’re never in your department unless there’s a problem.Not to mention the favoritism even from the district leader!
bad,"Working at Petsmart in Annapolis was not a great experience at all. Schedules were usually made friday for the week starting Sunday. Absolutely ridiculous. Managers often bent rules for themselves, going into the breakroom and having conversations with other employees who were actually on break. (Happened several times while on the clock)"
bad,Have to send half our dogs home because now if there is even a slight chance a dog may get nicked due to matting or behavior the groomers are vilified. Lunches are treated like chores to get out of the way if it is at all inconvenient for management. Company offers discounts that hit groomers commision.
bad,"Everyone is 2 faced , managers don't care about you. All about the money which isn't even that good, no compassion or care in the work place at all. I wouldn't work here."
bad,"In the beginning, working at petsmart was great, but it soon changed. I applied to be a PetCare associate and a week or 2 later i was hired after going to THREE different interviews. When i got hired, i was told i would be trained to be in Petcare (keep in mind a petcare associate and a cashier are two different things). During the first 2 weeks, i was mainly on the computer watching petcare videos, then they had me on the register and said it was part of ""training"". It's been 4 months and i've still been on the register as a cashier. The management never continued to train me for the position i was hired for. I was even interviewed by the person incharge of petcare. During the three interviews it was made clear that i was hired to work with the animals and be on the floor, instead i was stuck as a cashier and the management didn't bother to notice. They also cut my hours soo short at one point, to the point where i was struggling to keep up with bills. It also kinda sucked that there were no benefits in being bilangual. Overall working at petsmart is very hit or miss. The management is not the best and You can't live off this job because of little pay & lack of hours."
bad,Well I worked for PetSmart in Hagerstown Md for almost10 years. I never had a break because no one would give me one. When I would get there early in the morning management would be out back smoking so no one would hear me ring the buzzer which made me late clocking in. I had so many chores to do early in the morning. I even asked if second shift could help out with the cleaning of the small animal cages bird cages and reptiles and I was told they had other things to do so I was stuck with it all. Management did not like me and I was treated like I always did some thing wrong. I hated my job because of the way they would treat me so I left after almost 10 years. Would I recommend people I know to work there probably not.
bad,Worked there for little under a year it took them almost 8 months to tell me we have a benefits plan. I worked roughly 4 hours each week before I ended up quiting. Management is ridiculous if they were having a bad day you would definitely know. The assistant manager disliked me so much he wouldn't even talk to me. They also won't hire anyone under 18!
bad,I WOULD NOT recommend working here. Especially in the grooming salon. If you are starting as a bather and have hope in becoming a groomer let me start by saying they don't pay you very well nor give you many hours. They do not train very well or at all. The salon manager was a joke. She was suppose to be training new employees and helping current ones and she was not doing so. Non of the employees take their job seriously. They violate company policy often by texting/ being on their cell phones even while grooming peoples pets. There is no team work. Instead of being supportive and helping one another they have attitudes towards one another. The bathers and new employees in the salon get treated the worst. The way they treat you is disrespectful and act like they're better than you. It makes for a VERY hostile work environment. The store management isn't helpful and instead plays favorites. Its all one big joke. So if you're looking to become a groomer / bather. Don't go to PetSmart. At least not that location.
bad,you only work with 2 other people in the store so every shift you only have 3 one manager and 2 employees. Part time workers only get less than 20 hours and have to beg to get more hours in a day you only work 4-5 hours.
bad,Very competitive when it comes to getting into management from a normal employee. It's very fun working with the animals and seeing all sorts of different animals coming in to work!
bad,Petsmart always starts with the lowest pay possible and raises and such are so small it barley makes a difference. They are very cheep and offer too few opportunities to move up in the company.
bad,"They only care about numbers. Doesn't matter if you have 120+ dogs in the hotel, they still wont let you hire more employees. With the turnover rate of employment really high, them hiring young ""first job"" individuals who call out, they still expect you to take care of all the animals with the advertised care. Every holiday i worked (employed for 4 years), it was me and 1-2 other employees trying care for 120+ dogs, PLUS maximum amount of doggy day care dogs/customers and management saying not to turn away even if we run out of room. so not only are we over crowding, but every dog isn't getting the proper care and attention that the customer paid for. I only stayed as long as I did because of school, and because I tried to create change for the hotel and kept hoping upper management would help and change themselves but corporate wont let it."
bad,"Before being purchased, PetSmart had a great company culture with managers who were salaried, with good benefits and actually cared about the animals as well as the employees."
bad,"When people first think of working for PetSmart they always think ""it must be fun to play with the animals"". Well yes, that part is true, but the con side of working with pets is some pets don't enjoy what you're trying to do to them so an occasional nip is bound to happen from either pet or owner."
bad,"Managers barely communicate with employees, but scold employees for lack of communication. It was common for them to assign several tasks at once and scold you for not getting them done fast enough. Evening shift was understaffed even though it was the busiest shift."
bad,"Poor management and stressful environment. Constantly being told what to do and never recognized for the good things you do. No matter how hard you try, it’s never good enough."
bad,"Management is often distant, won’t take responsible for issues."
bad,I’m currently working at a micro store. No room for growth within the store. Only two FT Positions; Store Leader and Assistant Store Leader. All projects or operations in the store are passed to whichever key holder is working that day with no communication from the Store Leader. This leads to disorganization and always catching up on store tasks. It’s embarrassing to work at this location most days due to the very “green” leadership from a very inexperienced Store Leader.
bad,"Was my first job. Started at the petshotel in Beverly hills and after almost 2 years transferred over here to long beach in hopes that the level of care was better. It wasn't. They dont treat the dogs with the respect and love they deserve. Rather than give a dog a walk, they'll let them take care of their business in their kennels and act like they were attentive the whole time."
bad,"When you ask for help, very little is given. And animals seemed in poor conditions from distributor and employees not properly trained on pet health and well being. I was excited to work with animals until I saw how many were under cared for. And the manager and assistant manager constantly bud heads and fight in front of customers and employees, making a stressful work environment."
bad,Petsmart was my first job. I worked in the grooming salon as a bather. WIthin the 9 months I was there I watched countless managers leave/be terminated. a very high school level of maturity between employees and management. Store pets are kept in incorrect husbandry.
bad,"It was pretty awful, I wanted to become a groomer and was told every month this month would be the month! They waited until I started my college semester and wanted me to stop mid semester to go to grooming school, when I said I couldn't take off class mid semester I was told I wasn't serious enough about it as a career. One year down the drain being lied to, gossiped about, and overall cheated."
bad,"Upper Leadership over Salon Leaders usually don’t have experience in salon operations. Training for the Salon Leadership position is 33-40hr depending on how fast you can read and take test. The training lacks with a “Sink or Swim” timeline and guidance from the store leadership team usually can’t help from that lack of education. Salons usually have a high staff turnover, causing a domino effect of added stress, budget spending, time spent away from required Leadership duties, training standards effected which all can develop poor salon culture. Poor salon performance is then blamed on Salon Leaders Leadership which then leads to  discipline action. "
bad,"While I was working for PetSmart company stock holders forced the board the take the company from public to private by way of a sale to a private equity firm. While this was not the first sign of issues for the company it did start ushering in wholesale changes. Slashing field team members (District Managers, Auditors) and corporate store liason positions. The company that bought PetSmart had a goal to eventually take PetSmart public again and to do this they started by making widespread labor cuts to quickly attempt to up profitability. But BC Partners overpaid for PetSmart, assuming a lot of debt, and this attempt did not help. Since then they, through PetSmart, have also purchased Chewy.com again overpaying and assuming even more debt. Chewy.com has not made a profit for PetSmart since it's acquisition. I say all of this to drive home one point, the corporate leadership and vision of PetSmart is seemingly non-existent."
bad,Glad to work with animals- too bad they do not have full time positions for all.  Like to handle the reptiles and cats. Like helping get the cats adopted.
bad,"Everybody knows everything that's going on all the time, there is no separation of personal and work life. Very high school type environment, lots of gossip and rumors. Management would threaten with write up and termination as scare tactics to get what they wanted and if you did get to a write up you had to sign or face termination for insubordination for little things. Lots of gossip within the salon and nothing was confidential, management would talk about personal files with other employees management or staff. Other employees call out or no call no show so often your days off will be taken so they can have theirs, overtime is common but you can face write up for overtime if they feel like they want to. Would not recommend at all to anyone."
bad,"While working at PetSmart, I enjoyed being able to work with animals hands on, and that was the only part of my job that I was able to enjoy. While my coworkers were great, the management was not understanding, and made it impossible to enjoy my job otherwise."
bad,If your an experience groomer the money is not worth it. Too stressful. Expectations are high but not willing to pay you enough. Do not enroll in training with them
bad,I had a horrible time here no room for advancement or anything pay sucked hours sucked management was questionable and selective but there are some good people there
bad,"I loved the team I worked with for the most part, but the management would tell you whatever they needed to get you to do a job even if they would lie, would prefer you kept your mouth shut about harassment from management."
bad,"Easy enough job, especially so to enjoy! I genuinely enjoyed assisting Pet Parents finding both what they needed and wanted to get the most for their pets! Loved to see all the animals day in and day out and get a first look at all the new products and learn more about them! "
bad,I have been with the company for some years. You can't move up in the company. They change rules every other day. Management shows to much favoritism. The turnover rate is horable.
bad,Not for everyone and if you choose to do this type of career it's best you invest in your self with experience before jumping into this. This is a fun.
bad,"From store manager to shipment manager, and especially the salon Manager there is no order and sense of loyalty and everyone plays everyone, making job security scarce. Dogs could bite you and you don't file paper work unless life threatening, but dogs or cats fall or soil themselves and they instantly believe you did something. DO NOT work in the salon what so ever here."
bad,the company overworks their employees and does not back them during disagreements with customers the management is lesss tan helpful when dealing with employees
bad,"Management  doesn’t work or try to work. They bark orders, cut hours, and then get mad for things not getting done. If management just got off their butts and did something, working there might be tolerable. This is not the case for all stores. It all depends on management."
bad,"Job varied in time from early morning shifts (3 AM) to midday, closing and even the occasional overnight shift.  It was common for me to go to work at noon, leave at 10 be back at 10 the next day, leave at 6, come back at 3 AM the following day.  That's 30 hours of work (not counting the 2 hours of commuting during that time) in a 49 hour time span.  Employee hours are constantly being cut and we are expected to do more with less while achieving ever increasing customer satisfaction standards."
bad,"PetSmart doesn't use operational common sense in running their business.  They focus on the smallest of details and the most irrelevant things, but then turn around and cut payroll to the point that you can't even maintain day to day operations without your salaried managers working 60 plus hours a week."
bad,"I was the youngest worker, at 18, so I expected some confrontation, but nothing like this. I was treated like a child and was often excluded from in and out of work activities. Towards February, I became very very ill with the Shingles virus and they cut my hours from 20-30 a week to only 4 hours a week. Four. Hours. I couldn't make ends meet so I complained very respectfully and nicely. The gm didn't sit with me and take me seriously, instead, he continued to walk away and talk to me with his mouth full thus, I quit right then and there."
bad,"Once the original managers quit or were fired the amount of work I did tripled. I hope some day they figure out how to properly pay, motivate, and inspire their workers to work. People in lower management do more talking than working, and some managers actually took naps in their offices"
bad,The company did not want input from lower management or hourly employees. The job could be good if not the one rule works for all stores mentality. Upper management could care less about employees personal situations. Worst job I ever had!
bad,"management at my location is super unorganized and biased. You get told how to do something by one manager then get told it is completely wrong by the next. The pay sucks for what we do and the type of people that we deal with, especially because it's usually such a high stress job. Only planning on staying here long enough to get a decent amount of experience so i can go somewhere that i'm actually happy working at."
bad,A very cutthroat environment with a lot of shady doings.Not much room for growth and the pay doesn't make up for the stress and lack of long term security.
bad,"This review is only for the Newburgh, NY store."
bad,I worked here for a couple months and the management was terrible and constantly got schedules wrong. I was hired to be a bather but if it was slow in the salon we were supposed to cover everyone else problems. I did practically everything in the store while I watched the people that were hired to do it hangout and talk in the front of the store.
bad,"poor store management with little experience with personnel supervision, scheduling or event coordination. expect to do all sales and events setup last second without tools, signage, pricing or advertising.if you work hard, are honest and friendly; expect to be accused of theft."
bad,The hardest part of this job is dealing with corporate expectations of how much each store and employees should be selling. Only concerned with the bottom line and not the employees.
bad,"No work life balance. Schedule changes same week without notice. Pet parents are rude because of legitimate situations; however, nothing is done by management to resolve it. Favoritism by management. No positive reinforcement by Salon management. Minimal constructive criticism. Management has no tact, yells a lot,  quick to say you're doing something wrong, won't apologize when proven wrong either."
bad,"I enjoyed working in doggie daycamp for a while, but it got old very quickly. Many times I was denied my break. They would always tell me I would be eligible for advancement and every time I would get passed up for the position. They cut corners on schedules to make you just under the hours so they don't have to pay you more. Managers get bonuses for keeping their hours under a certain amount."
bad,Petsmart was a production job. Which required a lot of physical activity and speed. I must say it was one of the hardest jobs I had with no incentives for the regular employees just for management.
bad,I loved the customers and helping everyone but management is flawed. apparently they go quantity over quality. the pay rate is super low and you are not treated well
bad,"Wow! when I fist started working I got a mix of people helping me but mainly people who didn't want to be there in the first place, that sends a great message. The only great thing about this job was the animals. The management and some of the people there have great customer service i will say that but behind the scenes horrible treatment of each other. You make a simple mistake and your chastised for it and lectured beyond belief,people talking behind each others back, and you get treated so miserably. i honestly wouldn't recommend anyone work here with the type of management it has."
bad,I learned that even though I was excellent at my job increasing sales and reputation for the company and perfecting procedures that all the upper management does is lie to keep you busting your butt with no hope for advancement even if it means telling you that you have got the job and then giving it to someone else just so you do not quit.
bad,not a good company unless you like when your bosses sit in the office and come out and search the floor when they're about to leave. The best part of the job had to be the pets and how happy new pet parents were.
bad,I was taking care of animals at the same time could ring on cash register and do customer service.I have learned that the customer and his needs is always a priority.Coworkers are very understanding when it came to doing the job right.They always helped each other.The hardest part of this job was when customers would yell at me if we didn't had a specific product in the stock.The most enjoyable part was when customers would buy small pets and be very happy and then come back to the store and say that the pet is doing fine and they enjoy having a new family member.
bad,"The pay for the work in the PetsHotel is very poor for the work that is required. Shifts begin at 6AM and part time employees are frequently expected to work the closing shift til 9 PM and open the next day at 6 AM. Full time employees are generally given consistent schedules but may still be shuffled around a great deal during the busy season. It is a very physically demanding job and managers and Senior Associates will rarely assist with harder tasks."
bad,"management sucked. She would call out names if someone said something about you. Didn't care if you were a good worker, cared more about drama and starting it. She was a horrible manager and I will never work for someone such as her. I love animals and it sucked leaving that job but I couldn't stand the environment."
bad,This company needs improvement on management following corporate policies.  They also need to teach them more about eoec.
bad,This company is difficult to work for as the pay is very low and Management doesn't work to help you get promoted.
bad,Coworkers across the board seemed to be unhappy here. Management was always missing and the team as a whole struggled to finish daily tasks.
bad,"Maybe only my store, 1209, was awful."
bad,They were not giving me the hours to sustain the like of a young growing family.
bad,"I applied to every possible position at PetSmart several times for several months. I emailed them, called them, and visited the store to talk to manages multiple times. After I gave them a resume, they took a long time to call me back. When they did, the position I'd been interested in had been taken. I didn't have a source of income at the time, so I took the job as a stocker. The store is dirty, the managers are unhelpful, I work part time with no chance for advancement any time soon and no benefits. The hardest part of the job is lifting fifty pound bags of dog food (especially with bad joints). My coworkers are nice, but feel the same about the job as I do. I haven't learned anything new yet."
bad,crazy stupid manual starting to become walmart management is hard to understand most of the time. The main manager would spend most of the time in the office.
bad,they hardly pay you anything. talk behind your back. extremely unprofessional. no one knows what they are doing. even the management is clue less.
bad,"Co-workers hard working. Management inconsistent w/ policies regarding safety issues, write ups, and coaching. Lots of favoritism-if they like you, you will have a job longer. Very negative environment. Management not concerned w/ employees future w/ company. Make a mistake and it could be your last. Mgmt does not follow policy of verbal warning, written warning, and final write up; defined and dependent on who is doing the write up. Inconsistent with definition of critical and minor accidents. Job turn around extremely high. Firings are weekly and numerous. HR lies about reasons for job turnaround. Rate level established unrealistic. Highest unemployment rate in Illinois. Would not recommend this place for long term employment. I wonder if corporate knows what they are doing in Ottawa, Il. Lots of mandated hours; no choice to refuse. Treated like children. Know what a sweat shop is now! No mutual respect between management and employees. Watch your back and keep your mouth shut. Live in fear of losing your job!"
bad,This place gave you no kind of chance you couldnt even sit down if you got tired. Working all day one your feet is kinda hard..
bad,poorly managed company that doesn't value the great employees they have who are eager to learn and teach. Worst scheduling with very little staff available to assist customers during the busiest times of the day.Management was virtually non existent always too busy to lend a helping had on the sales floor. Management needs retraining and sensitivity training.
bad,"company is doing well and the associates in the office are very nice. Unfortunately the politics among the Sr. Team, backstabbing and general lack of respect and concern for the rest of the team ruins the atmosphere and culture of the company"
bad,"I was hired to train under a certain supervisor, as I would assume that position when said supervisor moved. Within a week of him leaving, the company appointed someone else, and I was demoted."
bad,"Simply, no respect unless you knew the management in middle school.doing pet Care procedures properly was seen as wasting time to gm.if you love animals don't work here. You'll get your heart broken everyday."
bad,Management is pretty bad. They do not support their employees and only care about the money. Pay should be higher considering the amount of work they give you. Sometimes they are flexible with scheduling but they slash hours pretty hard.
bad,"Co-workers are good, some managers create a negative culture that effects the energy at times. But this all depends on what store and manager you have. Not all petsmarts are equal"
bad,"Overall the only good thing about the company is the knowledge you gain, otherwise you are Underappreciated. Everyone is an asset if they make over 2 Grand. Poor Management System. Retaliation. No room for growth."
bad,"I worked at PetSmart in two different towns. I first worked at PetSmart in Rolla, MO. The majority of co-workers were hard working and team players. The General Manager was great to work for. I had a few issues with not getting paid for some hours, which was corrected the following week. After getting certified to work in PetCare, I was still being scheduled for cashier although several other people were hired for PetCare including one young man that worked in PetCare for 3 weeks without being certified while I was certified but scheduled as cashier. I do not blame the General Manager. Again he was a great person to work for."
bad,"When you work fr PetSmart, there are good things you get to do. Connecting with pet parents through pet and product knowledge is very rewarding, and having regular customers that treat you right is awesome. That said, management across the company is not very good, the company doesn’t seem to really care about its employees and it’s quite blatant when you work there, and many stores suffer from the selfish decisions that corporate makes."
bad,"I work in the Doggie Day Camp/Boarding facilities in PetSmart. We are constantly understaffed so every day is stressful and a gamble. We recently got a new manager for the hotel, who is wonderful, but we also got a new store manager who is very unsympathetic and has caused many people to quit or consider quitting. The people I've worked with closely have generally been very kind, the further up the ladder you get with people coming into the store the ruder they are. They treat us as replaceable but nobody wants to apply for a job with us because the starting pay is trash. The hardest part of the job is how unpredictable it is, accidents happen, sometimes we get lots of people coming in to drop of dogs when we don't expect many. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with our clients and their dogs. PetSmart was like a second home to me and it really saddens me that the management has gone downhill and how corporate is changing things about Doggie Day Camp which just makes an already high stress environment even more stressful as well as puts us, as employees, in danger. PetSmart says associate safety is their number one priority. Based on what I've seen since Elevated Doggie Day Camp that seems to unfortunately not be the case."
bad,Work a lot more hours due to unrealistic expectations of upper management.  Too much division within various departments make it hard to get the store to be a cohesive unit
bad,"If you’re a male, same pay, but you’ll be running register anytime a females snapchat story gets updated, plus any cleaning, unloading trucks, and carrying 50+lbs bags on your shoulder all day. In my case, 2am-1pm 6 days a week. Took 2 years to get an extra 37 cents. I quit when my stock manager went on vacation (he was great) and his replacement was a 109lb girl (including her surgically attached phone) to haul stock. Spoiler alert: she did nothing."
bad,"Although there were good days, it was often very stressful, especially for a minimum wage job. Management will make you come in even if you're really sick unless YOU find someone to cover your shift. I was with the company for a while and saw it change for the worse. I am so glad I left. And despite missing some of my coworkers, I've been way happier at my new job."
bad,great co workers . bad management .hope you like overtime .salary cap at 2 years. no job security. if you cant show up on time or work without calling off don't waste your time.
bad,"The job at Petsmart started off to be a fun inviting environment to work in, but when management changed and procedures changed, the job then changed. The job doesn't pay well enough if you are living on your own, but if you are still living with your parents it might be a good job to start off with to gain some customer service experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with all the pets coming in and also the cat adoption area, spending some time with the kitties! Petsmart doesn't seem very capable of adapting to anyone with temporary disabilities. I was in a car accident while working there and took some time off work, but once I returned I was told by doctors I needed a stool to sit when needed at the cash register. It took several months for management to agree on me having a stool. Also they cut my shifts drastically to the point where I wasn't working there anymore, but nobody communicated with me of why I wasn't getting any shifts."
bad,Salon managers are under paid and overworked. The expectaions are unrealistic. They expect you to be everywhere at once. It doesnt matter if you are short staffed or not they have the same expectation. You are held responsible for everyone's actions if you were in the building or not. Don't work here if you actually need a job.
bad,"I know every store has a different culture but the store I was at, the store management was awful. They were immature and only cared about themselves and would throw any employee under the bus to their DM to save their own a**. Even if it meant that employee would lose their job. I was management there and witnessed it myself and it was the reason I left. You can't treat your employees like this and expect them to work pleasantly."
bad,"I've been at my store for about three years, never gotten any sort of advancement. Had the chance but they always said they found someone better. If you let on that you know how to do something, the managers with exploit the f out of you, and a t like you volunteered to do it so they don't have to reward you in any way. I covered a few shifts as a janitor while our janitor was out sick. A few months later, he had quit, so my managers just decided to schedule me super early to clean the store again without asking which was definitely not okay because they didn't ask or give me or anyone else any warning but got upset that I didn't clean the first time. I changed my availability after that, and then they docked my hours because I refused to be a janitor. They claim to have an open door policy to contact the DM and RM, but in my store, the main manager and the DM are friends so if you have a complaint about the main manager, you'd have to go to the RM. My main manager has conveniently never written down or given out the information to contact the RM, which is against the open door policy. It basically forces you to have no option but to let her walk all over you because the DM wont do anything (because he's her friend), and she will straight up fire you for trying to say anything against her. The PetsHotel is ran like a sweat shop- literally have been told by the manager there that no, I wasn't allowed to call out to go to the ER because she already let two other people call out without doctor's notes. (!!!?!?!) Corporate basically allows the workers to not be able to stand up"
bad,"Store department was doable for the amount of pay. Don’t work in the grooming saloon if you just want go there to work and do your job. The girls are mean and cliquey, would not recommend being a dog bather bc you have to work twice as hard and have to deal with the groomers that think they’re better than you."
bad,"Working at PetSmart was awful and they made you feel awful. You were encouraged to work off the clock to show your support.  In the grooming salon, you were instructed to work in the front of the store even you commissioned out (this means that you passed what your base pay for 40hrs for the week would be- free work for them.) You are not supposed to work in the front if you commissioned out, but were threatened to be fired if you didn't. The salon is in the back of the store, which means when you take lunch you have a very limited time to do so as you were also timed with the pets that you're grooming. You had to go to the front of the store to clock out but were often asked to help people in the store while off the clock. In which you were never compensated back. Several of the groomers had worked multiple times a week off the clock. When HR was called due to harassment, HR called the store manager and repeated the entire conversation with others in the room and all personal information given. Which drove for more harassment. My advice is to stay away from PetSmart or always get a paper trail. Take pictures of your time clock and record conversations."
bad,"I worked for petsmart years ago. Management was horrible. If you were not a part of mgmt cliques, then expect to be pulled of register to go clean feces in an aisle. Management became very verbally abusive mentally. If they did not like how something was cleaned, if I was in the bathroom, one manager in training, who was former managers best friend as well. Would Knock on the bathroom door and let me know to clean things through the door, Then when I started having attitudes with them, not tolerating the disrespect, they acted as if I was the problem from the start. I would then be told I would be able to train as a dog trainer, but then after months of waiting and asking come to find out it was the ""dangle the carrot over the horse's head"" treatment. And they gave the position to someone who knew nothing of dogs or dog care, that person was working with the small animals section. Do not waste your money on petsmart training."
bad,"Its not environment well received, quirky people who may seem nice, after a while quite burn out people leave , "
bad,"I worked as a Pet Care Specialist at PetSmart for 1 year, 4 months."
bad,"Work here if you like being agianst other people. I told my manager several times that I had a associate not following policies and procedures, Same associate had tons of  attitude when I would ask her to do call backs and stuff like that. I told my management over me and nothing happened. So I quite."
bad,"A typical work day is being in a camp with 14+ dogs at a time nd making sure they are properly and safely taken care of. I have learned better communication skills and time management, costumer service and learning to resolve problems with others. The management isn't all that great at times but I've learned to cope with it. The workplace culture is a fast and overwhelming place at times but is fun. The hardest part of the job is dealing with costumers at times in stressful situations. The most enjoyable part of the job, I get to play with dogs and show my love and care to them."
bad,I learnt they fire their best employee at the first opportunity they can. The manager had it out for me and wanted me out because I was their longer then them. Refused manager positions time and time again. Management is awful. Probably the only good part was being able to help pet owners with their needs for their cat dog fish bird or other small animals
bad,The associates here are amazing and very helpful and kind. It is a very laid back and comfortable work environment but management is poor. Nothing gets done and they care little about the animals. It’s very rewarding to be around the animals but sad at the same time because managers don’t care when something is wrong with them and there needs to be a change.
bad,"Working with animals is hard and stressful which is why most places will pay you above minimum wage to do so. My first day there was met with multiple people telling me they were unhappy to be there and didn't feel comfortable with what they were being asked to do. Also was immediately told I would not get benefits unless the managers decided they like me. I was told someone who was a senior member for 5+ years was still fighting for their benefits while this girl who had only been there 1 year was allowed to have them. As someone else mentioned, you are on display for all of the customers and they really have no common sense, allowing their children to bang on the glass and watch as the dogs viciously bark at their kid. They need to have signs on the glass that discourage the customers from interacting with the dogs. This does nothing but create tension in the room, all of the dogs will start to crowd the glass and they all become easily agitated from the energy in the room. The turnover rate is high and because of that there is a serious lack of proper training. No one there really knows how to handle being in a room filled with dogs. They are simply given a spray bottle with water and told to use it."
bad,"In the four years I worked for PetSmart, I had 5 different store managers. So many things got swept under the rug, like performance reviews and raises. Not ok! I was promised multiple raises that I never saw and the work hours were unreliable at best. Managers didn't take responsibility when things went badly and tried to blame lower employees. Overall, terrible company to work for."
bad,"This place is just depressing to work at. The coworkers are rude and in some instances just mean to each other and the animals, a dog screaming about a nail grind isn’t in the dogs best interest it’s in the companies and the groomer who is getting g paid for its best interest"
bad,"The pay is decent and the benefits ok. The management will not respect your availability; the will schedule you when you say you cannot work, and it is up to you to cover your shift then. No chance of promotion. I was promised one 2 years ago, and every time it opened up (which was a lot) they hired someone externally, or promoted someone whom they admitted wasn't as good as me. Only work here if you are desperate and won't be here long."
bad,"Petsmart has become more about the money and less about the people that work there. They push you to your limit ,and farther. Their expectation from their employees are unreachable. Very demeaning, misogynistic, and rude CEO's. Workplaces culture is very unsettling. Many people try to get others fired, career advancements are limited. Management back tracks on things they promise, and keeps people that have injured animals multiple times on the team even after probationary period."
bad,"this may be a lengthy review but please read if you’re considering working here. i feel like 2 stars is generous, but because i was so happy when i first started this job, it deserves at least some recognition. "
bad,"They don't know how to hire responsible managers. They always say keep your personal life private, but most the managers have an attitude problem and can't be professional."
bad,"My availability was part-time, 20-25 hours a week. When I first started the hours were exactly as I asked. After two months, I was receiving less than 10 hours a week."
bad,"You get a lot of hours which is nice but the job you do is definitely worth more then 8.50.  And that was after a few ""raises"".  Managers will also call you at all hours to ask you to cover shifts for other employees who do not show up.  Its a fine starter job"
bad,"My first couple days I was plopped on a computer for training, and whenever I had a question I was treated like I was bothering them. I was yelled at for not knowing things I hadn't been taught, and was yelled at for doing exactly what I was told. Was fired for a complaint a customer supposedly made about me, from a day when I wasn't even working. Was never told my position was seasonal and turned down 2 other positions. It had its fun points but in general it's not worth working here."
bad,"There’s were literally hundreds of employees who left because of a horrible incompetent manager, she was so aweful they sent another manager from another store to try and fix the situation which was not resolved until she was finally let go."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the animals, but you were not given enough time for the daily duties. It could be considered a stressful environment. Customer service for the most part was good, but when people did not want to adhere to the advice given and then came back and complained made it for a sad day"
bad,"From day one, there were issues and things were always changing and I was never told until it was too late. I did not enjoy working here at all. All they cared about was their numbers and didn't care about the well being of their staff."
bad,"The animals make the job worth it. I worked in the Hotel section. Walking and playing with dogs that were here for daycare or boarding. A lot of cleaning is done to keep everyone and animal safe and healthy. Always on your feet, walking/standing on concrete leads to constant joint pain."
bad,Very little chance for advancement. Have been with the company for a long time but there has been no chances for advancement which is causing me to look else where
bad,"I joined petsmart thinking that it was going to be a great place to work and advance, learn  new skills. but the longer you are there the less people tend to like it and for me that was true. it is the most freaking dramatic place to work and it becomes very mentally tiring."
bad,"Actually sucked the entire time, management does whatever they want and dont pay any attention to the animals health, only really cares about sales. pet care team ends up solely responsible for animal health and has to convince managers to actually take care of the animals by getting them vet appointments."
bad,"Strefful place to work, always under-staffed, horrible management. Unorganized, high prices, careless associates, unfair scheduling. Bad pay, rough environment. Low discount rate."
bad,The job itself was nice but the way corporate runs things makes everything stressful and hard to handle.They only hire for part time positions so having this job as a main source of income in not feasible to live on. They often cut or changed my hours without any kind of notification which caused confusion on multiple occasions.
bad,I like most people wanted to work in pet stores to be able to care for animals. PetSmart takes excellent care of it's dry goods but the same cannot be side for its live animals. Store is also extraordinarily clique-y with no room for advancement.
bad,"I liked working there when I was just a part time pet care associate. By the time I was offered full time, we had new management, we were suddenly micromanaged by managers that rarely left the office. They have no respect for associates, talk down to you, turn and walk away from you while you're discussing something related to your work. Other employees would butter up to leaders and constantly undermine you. I was often overloaded with the CEL and MIL duties. Then brow beaten when I couldn't get my stuff done because the MOD would give me other tasks they wanted done first. I was told that I was being prepped for the CEL job, and was doing most of the duties after the CEL quit. Then they gave it to someone else that had zero clue on the job."
bad,"Came to work at petsmart Port coquitlam and it seemed that all the other associates just wanted to get paid and didn't care. When their lack of care impacted to lives of the animals, it really upset me, after bringing it to the attention of the manager he did nothing. I worked in the grooming salon as well, i worked hard, was not trained properly, but gained experience working there almost every day. Just recently two new bathers got hired and my hours are getting cut. This is very disappointing considering I worked there during the busiest part of the year (Christmas time) and picked up shifts constantly and my hours are still getting cut. There is a lack of care and respect from the managers to the associates, along with them cutting your hours for people that do not care about the animals."
bad,"Strife and undercutting fellow employees was encourage in the salon and team members were often asked to do jobs that they were not hired for. Salon would frequently be asked to fill in for floor team members and stockers when short staffed. Management was condescending and unsympathetic to person lives and struggles due to the stressful nature of the salon environment. Events that were not uncommon in the work environment were, petstylists finding personal equipment lost, stolen or broken and overtime for holidays not being paid. Recently, PetSmart lost a lawsuit in which over 1000 workers were paid compensation for unfair wages."
bad,Stressful place to be. The management was bad and actual lives depended on you. One time I had to give mouth to mouth to a guinea pig because we weren't cleared to take her to the vet yet.
bad,"Although I love grooming, I am just not happy grooming with my current company. I have such a passion for the animals I work with but I also have a passion to feel and be respected and fairly compensated in my workplace, especially if I am abiding by all standards, protect and model the brand with extreme professionalism"
bad,Petsmart culture has changed since buy out. Unreachable goals set by corporate leaders. Weak management habits with poor mentorship and opportunity for growth.
bad,"Having a grooming salon manager who is also suppose to be a regular groomer hit a dog and nothing be said about it, is awful. It makes it very hard to work in a place with a person like that, but we have documentation and proof of the laziness of this manager and do intend to be talking to corporate about the issues that are at hand and have yet to be mentioned to them."
bad,"Petsmart management runs on favoritism. If you suck up to the boss then you have more of a chance of moving up, this includes throwing co-workers under the bus. The job is beyond stressful and will take a toll on home life. You become numb to abuse of animals and managers will show no empathy for sick animals unless a higher up manager is around. If you call in you will be treated terribly the next day you work. It's over all a miserable place to work, the only pro is the bonds you share with animals and the knowledge you learn."
bad,"Never have I ever experienced such poor management. The managers seemed to have no clue what was going on. I transferred from the Roseville location to Duluth location and signed on as a bather in the grooming salon and I warn you, do NOT work for this location in the grooming facility. Hours were completely all over the place, the manager has CLEAR favorites which makes it hard to advance in the workplace, and for some reason there is excessive amounts of drama. I love working with pets, when I worked at the Roseville location in the pet hotel, pet safety always came first. This location disappointed me so many times and it was frustrating to see that the money was the main objective and focus, not the pets actual needs."
bad,This place was a nightmare. I was regularly sexually harassed by my manager and the prototypical treatment our animals received was NOT what they needed. The employees are stressed and the customers were awful. It's an easy job that PetSmart corporate made extremely difficult.
bad,"Company pays well, but when they were bought out, they fired half of the corperate office.  Since Pet Smart was a ground up company, that meant that they pushed out the culture that brought most of us to the company.  They claim that one of their key values is ""Do the right thng,"" but that only applies to the Store Management to the customer, not the company to the employees."
bad,Living conditions for the dogs were unsanitary. The management was awful and the job didn't pa enough for the work that you were doing. Its like putting pets in a motel 6 with iron bars.
bad,"I loved working at PetSmart, but they slowly started implementing rules that hindered our ability to get a job done as well as we had been before. There wasn't anything wrong with our methods, but corporate companies like to change things that don't need changing. For example, we had to bathe dogs, all day. We wore a water-resistant smock for that, but we would still get wet underneath, which was completely expected. But anything in our pockets would in turn, get wet after having bathed a dog. Wasn't a problem because we had our own little stations where we kept anything we didn't want getting wet. It was perfectly fine the way it was. But then all the sudden we were required to keep a ""puppy guide"" in our smock pockets at all times, which, by the end of the day wasn't even readable, or recognizable as a piece of paper. But we were marked wrongly if we didn't have it on us. We were also marked wrongly if we were sitting down, doing computer work, which was absolutely mad. If all of our other work was done, (sweeping, vacuuming, etc) and we were on the phone, trying to schedule appointments with customers over the phone, we were not allowed to sit down on the chairs that they provided for us. Absolute madness. We were allowed to at first, but then somehow it was decided that it looked unprofessional. Now I get it looking unprofessional if everybody was on their phones and not doing any work, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about, we would get a stern talking to, if we were currently on the phone with a customer, trying to make them an appointment for later"
bad,"Employee moral was low at my location. Staff was over worked, animals were not cared for and management used many intimidation tactics to get what they wanted. If they didn't intimidate, they would either lie to your face or leave you to fend for yourself even when lives of animals were potentially at stake. Some locations are good...this one,...STAY AWAY FROM THE LARGE HOTELS. They won't staff approproately which leads to chaos. No one can keep up. All staff was tired and overwheamed."
bad,Its fun because employees get to bring dogs to work but management is terrible and biased. They have a lunch room in the main building so that was really nice and a starbucks
bad,The pay is awful and mangement expects you to do a job that would take at least 2 to 3 people to do.  Nothing you ever do is good enough and management will let you know that to your face.
bad,Just in the end poorly managed The company itself was a good company to work for. Just this store seemed to do downhill on morale after it was sold to a diffrent company
bad,"The store manager was a awful human being, she did not care about her employees unless she knew you personally. She would promise you promotions and more hours and then avoid you and the situation. The managers would write horrible comments on the back white board thinking it would help promote positivity. Will never work for a company that doesn't care about employees or the animals they are selling."
bad,i was injured on job. a year after i was still refused any advancement and forced into resignation. i appealed to corporate but they never responded. easier to leave and sue them.
bad,"Business is business and I understand that. Expecting 3 people to manage an entire truck load with the back room being way to small that a forklift can barely get around the area. Cuts hours, expects part timers to complete full time work."
bad,They go through employees like food with an expiration date. They do not keep many people because of their lack of organization and professionalism. Management does not step up for their employees.
bad,"It's now just a job. The company used to be a good company to work for. I used to love my job and working for this company however with recent management changes, the current managers are being pretty, firing people who have worked for the company for years who were good employees. there is such a high school mentality with people, back stabbing, petty gossiping, fear of losing my job. managers are using manipulation to try and fire employees. they manipulate a weakness and fire people for ridiculous reasons. Fear of complaining to due to repercussions from current management."
bad,"Although I currently work here, I will never again work for this company. They do not want to keep employee's who know what never again. I have been harassed by former managers and my active store manager is trying to fire the senior staff. work place is basically high school"
bad,"Ever since the buy out the managers have been micro managing like crazy.. new and stricter policies come up every week and we are constantly getting yelled at for things that didn't matter a month ago. They are on our a55es to sell a product that is overpriced and underperforming. Petsmart doesn't care about the animals anymore, not like they used to. They only care about the dollar signs and the store numbers."
bad,Depending on your job title at Petsmart your job description and environment can be unpleasant. As an RCA the environment is very different than that of a cashier. The lack of communication between different job titles also hinders your work.
bad,"I loved the actual job, unfortunately the managers are unqualified, petty, and immature. Multiple people quit because of new managers. It is a high school like environment filled with drama. PetSmart cares more about money than animals."
bad,management is good at times but it is a one sided relationship. Management has our way or no way at policy. They can be very disrespectful.
bad,"Since being sold, the company has definitely become more about the quantity and not the quality of service. Store policy seems to want to focus on micromanaging, which we all know doesn't do ANYBODY any good, and deny its transferred employees the minimum funds to even get to work. Unfortunately, in the two years I've worked for them, the company seems to continually sink further and further down the drain. It really is saddening."
bad,When I started grooming at petsmart 3 yrs ago I loved it but a lot has changed since then. The new owners have changed alot of things and it makes it hard to enjoy working there. They are more about the money than the safety of the pets. They push you to groom more but still expects you to take a lunch and leave on time then fusses at you about over time. If you want to work for a money hungry company then petsmart is the place for you.
bad,It was an alright place to work but some of the managers weren't the easiest to get along with and they weren't always the best with understanding my schedule and situation.
bad,The company leadership is terrible and they are react instead of fixing the problems. Makes for a very toxic work environmnet
bad,"General managers required to do very little actual work, spend little time on the sales floor leaving all the work to the Ops manager and Leads. Scheduling not done with any consideration for family time except for General Manager who worked 9-5 five days a week, no Sundays while the rest of the managers and leads had schedules that were never consistent. Learned a lot about pet food and corporate marketing though there is to much pressure to sell coupon booklets and training classes. Loved my co-workers, particularly the associates who respected me as a manager because I respected them and their abilities. Best part of the job was meeting pet parents and their pets and caring for the small animals"
bad,"The best part about working here is the pets and the customers. This company takes over your life. At times, you don't get to take a lunch. They expect you to run the store smoothly with 3 associates for a high volume store. Upper management can care less about your situation as long as you make plan. "
bad,"it was ok, manger sucked. very rude guy. made working there bad. had to ask for your breaks or they wont give it to you unless its a half hour"
bad,"Getting to meet all kinds of pets was generally the high light of my day. Cleaning up after them, not so much. Wore several hats as a manager with an ever increasing level of expectation with very little support."
bad,What you would expect from your average run-of-the-mill pet store grooming establishment.  Nothing more.  Nice store for starting out in the profession.
bad,"It's all about the bottom line. Everything is about pushing extra sales on customers who don't want it and making the shareholders as much money as possible while you get minimum wage even with years of experience. They have gotten so greedy they even cut out the music in the stores just to save a buck. "
bad,The management at this store was terrible. There was an extreme lack of leadership and ability to relate to employees. Performance reviews never happened so there was little to no feedback. Many managers didn't care what employees thought. Turnover of staff was extremely high.
bad,"they over work you"
bad,"this is the most boring place to work at. there are no possibilities to move up in the company, no benefits, NOTHING! They start you on minimum wage or close to it and you would have to work there over a year to get a few cents raise."
bad,"The job experiece is worth it but very stressful. Hours are pretty good, but you're very limited as a cashier on how you can help a customer due to the new ""policy"""
bad,The other coworkers were very rude and gossiped alot and were not nice to me and i recieved little to minimum training and the store was poorly managed and always short staffed.
bad,"This company paid well but the way the company production and management worked was awful. Supervisors and Managers dont appreciate the employees, rather they look for ways to punish people instead of aknowledging hard work."
bad,"I know many people will say you get to play with animals all day. That they learned a lot about animals. But I have a degree in Animal Science ( and worked at a PetSmart for two years for fun. You may think you learned a lot but most of it is wrong. You learned how to sell. PetSmart is extremely successful at marketing and hiring young 20 somethings that can be molded into the PetSmart philosophy which is not necessary the right philosophy. PetSmart is also expert at protecting themselves legally as far as employment laws but not so good at following its own policies within the store. It is an awesome job for a young person but certainly not a career move unless you are interested in corporate stuff. If you are interested in truly caring about animals ...this is a business people! Pets are a huge marketing niche right now and PetSmart is running with it. Smart business move but don't fool yourself that you are actually 'saving' lives as their moto says. Their trainers are useless, on average, and aren't allowed to train any dogs with 'real' problems so what lives are they saving? Oh..that's right..they donate money to animal groups and allow them to adopt out animals through their stores. That actually gets customers in to the store...its not all altruistic. You can not, or should not, take some 20 year old person with no background and have them sit through some PetSmart training classes over a period of two weeks and then suddenly hand them a classroom! That is cruelty to dogs in my book because that person has no clue about the psychology behind any of it. They have weekly"
bad,"ok to work for but not enough pay or hours they had weird shifts like 4am til 8am, they would schedule me for 4 hours and expect a truck that would take 8 to 10 hours to be done in that time, they also expect you to clean up after dogs and cats going number 1 and 2 in the store they never told me i would have to do that when i was hired"
bad,"No matter how hard you work it's not good enough. The company could care less about wether or not you have a personal life. You miss baptisms, weddings and birthdays. And don't even think about having a death in the family. All of these statements are based on my experience working in the salon."
bad,"Working with dogs and seeing them leave happy and beautiful is very rewarding. Store management was on several occasions retaliatory when I spoke to HR about issues in the store. Management repeatedly made employees break policy when it benefited the managers, picking and choosing which policies were to be followed"
bad,"Its was a great chance to collect new found skills and get my foot in the door so to speak when it comes to animal care. But how the company was ran via management made it very difficult for a long term associate to grow in a position. I handled a huge majority of tasks ranging from pet care, stock, sales coaching, cashier, training new employees, picking orders and helping managers with their duties. Petsmart does a lot of amazing charity events to help local animals in the area find good homes however the lack of empathy and understanding from management was appalling. Due to the everyday work environment and management team it made it incredibly difficult for all store associates to complete their given tasks with 100% success. So over all as an associate you don’t get paid enough for the hard labor you have to do and were often treated poorly."
bad,"Ever since the new investment group purchased PetSmart, all they do is take away as much as possible. I've only been here 2.5 years but many drastic, yet unnecessary, changes have already been made. It is really a shame because barring the drama, it's not a very hard job. However, it is very difficult to succeed when there is rarely any help from management."
bad,Petsmart is a very cutthroat work environment. Management cares nothing for their employees and only about bettering themselves and numbers on a piece of paper.
bad,No room for advancement. Decide your worth before you get to show them. Disrespectful and unfair. Didn’t even get trained on my position because they didn’t want to train me. Do not follow protocol.
bad,When hired by the company they stated that I would be worked up to full time hrs within 30 days . 14  months later I am still at 20 hrs. a week or less. I cannot make my household budget work on that. They don't seem to care.
bad,"Hours are inconsistent, management is bad and has no care for their employees. Always complained the few times i called in sick. Too much work for one person in the back while working overnight."
bad,Stressful workplace with small amount of hours and little pay. Decline in hours and not secure with this job at all. Unable to depend on hours with debt and other payments. Not enough to survive on that makes it highly stressful on top of everything else.
bad,PetSmart is a vert stressful place to work. Management is always changing policies due to corporate. The interviews lie about the difficulty of the job. The company does not pay fairly or recognize hard work. No one will advance in the company by traditional methods.
bad,"A typical day at work derives of taking care of all the animals, fish, reptiles, birds, crickets, worms, roaches, tarantula, making sure that every single one of them goes to the vet if needed, or if they should be isolated in the backroom or not. This is just a vague touch on what we actually do, ask someone who's actually done this job, there's a lot more to it. "
bad,"Typical corporate job, overworked and underpaid staff that are given none of the resources necessary to carry out their very high expectations. Customer base is more important than the sanity and safety of staff and animals in the store."
bad,"Was with PetSmart going on four years and my annual raise was $.14/hr!  I started at $9/hr and wasn’t close to $10/hr yet! Part time associates get no paid vacation or time off. Management was always crying about lack of loyalty, but never did anything to gain any loyalty. They want to employ all part time associates so they don’t have to pay Benefits. Not a good place to work for any length of time."
bad,Never having enough hours. Not making enough for what I do in the hotel. Skip my breaks to catch up on things because other workers are slow or dont care how they work. Always being reminded that I'm replaceable.
bad,Managers weren't the best. After working there for three years I received an 11 cent raise (woohoo!). So sad. I also was the leader in salon sales for my district. Glad I got out of there.
bad,"grooming is great pay and benefits offered to full time employees. Friendly work environment. The company likes to add pointless procedures and the occasional useless after hours ""paid"" meetings."
bad,"Maybe it's just the location (Logan, UT), but nothing gets cleaned properly, animals get sick all the time from poor care, and it's always the associates' fault (according to the managers anyway).  In the end, I hated the job and just couldn't handle the sick and dying animals anymore."
bad,"Poor Company Practices and Management. "
bad,"Petsmart tends to work its employees really hard. Advancing is hard . they move their managers around alot so you just get used to one and new one appears ."
bad,"I've been working for Pet Smart for almost ten years. They over work their employees. The overnights are treated badly and the pay is awful for what you have to do in this job. They accept just about any dog whether you can get a lead on them or not and whether they are aggressive or not. Even when the policy is if you can't get a lead on the dog you can't accept it. They accept them anyways and it takes MONTHS before they finally tell the pet parent we can't have the dog there anymore. Overnights have to walk up to 70 dogs BY themselves when they're busy, which is tiring. They give you a hard time when you call in even if you NEVER call in and it's something important like your car won't start or something. The only good thing about this job are the animals. That's the ONLY reason I have been with this company for so long and also I didn't really have another choice. If it wasn't for the dogs I'd probably be gone a long time ago. The benefits are really good if you're full time I'll give them that. All in all I wouldn't work for Pet Smart. Their pay is bad and so is their management. Promote just about anyone and they're lazy."
bad,"Not too bad a place if you want to start learning how to work with animals, but that's about it. Many locations are nasty, have poor managers, or just not enough hours. I left my store due to a rat infestation they failed to contain along with a large amount of people leaving due to poor management."
bad,"Petsmart went to trash ,  used to be a great company to work for. Then they started to make you a salesman and push a million things down each customers throat. And if you don’t meet their quota then your store is punished. Got to be a bit redundant."
bad,I loved grooming dogs but the work environment was hostile leaving multiple people transferring to other locations which resulted in job losses because of poor management including HR.
bad,"I was the jack of all trades. I was a dog trainer, worked petcare, cashier, bather & stocker all at the same time. You’d think raises would happen. They pay their employees very poorly. You have to move around from store to store for promotions. I’ve worked in two separate states for Petsmart and both places were just such a letdown. Management did all they could for me. It was Corporate. Their human resourses dept. is a joke. They don’t care about their lower employees at all. It shows in all the lawsuits from their employees. "
bad,"Change of management, in particular an AGM, ruined the work environment and culture. This particular AGM was prejudice against associates that did not look like her. She went out of her way to treat associates badly and it was very apparent to everyone as to what was going on."
bad,"Worked in the San Diego area. This company could care less about salaried managers. They work you to death, 50 hrs a week and expect you to be an overpaid stocker. You will have almost no say in who is hired or retained. Just not a good place to work."
bad,"I am currently employed at petsmart. I've been there since April 2018. I'll lay it all out, and you can decide if it's worth it. "
bad,"The managers are horrible and show favoritism. They keep pushing you to try to up sell and bother customers. They don't care about the customers,all they want is a sale. They don't care about the workers and allow customers and employees (the ones they favor)  to disrespect you. I've been there for about a year and NEVER received a promotion. If lucky you'll find the one manager you love but the rest are straight imbeciles. They hire more people and cut more hours to the point you're only getting 5-10 hours a week."
bad,"Started off alright, untill i noticed that they didn’t bothered to train managers. Store manager was always lying and bending the truth to guilt people into working more than supossed to. Understaff so i had to do two jobs at once and then yelled at that i wasnt better. Managers got thrown under the bus and fired so the store manager didn’t take the blame. Never felt like my job was safe and it was only a matter of time before I’d be thrown under the bus."
bad,"Working for Petsmart has been a ride. While the pay is okay, the benefits are great, and the hours for fulltime have been plentiful; the overall work environment is poor. The rest of the management team are unreliable, unorganized, and uncaring. I'm sure thats not the case for every store but it certainly was for mine. While I did get 40 hours a week, the inconsistency of set days and times got very stressful. Some nights you are there from 1 until 9:30 pm and expected to come back in at 6 am the next day. Some weeks you'll be working 8 days in a row because of poor scheduling. They dont allow overtime. In fact, payroll was just poor. Often times the assistant manager wouldnt have enough hours to provide enough staff for the day. So, it just got very stressful.  Its a great place for the part time employees. It's great if you want full time hours but no time to do anything else with your life. Petsmart wants your life to revolve around the company, which would be fine if they had a bit more compassion for the employees who are wasting away trying to keep the store up to standards."
bad,"Although I loved grooming, the store manager was horrible and cheap. He refused to buy new tables and dryers when they broke down said they're too expensive, he also played favoritism towards a few employees. Management never scheduled people properly in the store so there was never enough employees working to help or cover lunches. The girls (groomers) in grooming it was nothing but constant high school drama bs, they always were complaining about each other and telling on each other like they're a bunch of 6 year olds, always stabbing each other in the back, one min they're your friends next min they're try to get you fired. No one in that entire store has each other's back nor do they respect each other. The entire place is falling apart and isn't run properly, everybody is rude to each other even to the customers, and such lack of communication. They really don't care if you have an home life and kids they always want you to work. In grooming (the groomers have no respect for your request clients and always trying to steal them away from you, if they're mad at you for whatever reason they will refuse to schedule you dogs pretty much stealing your money"
bad,"no one cares at petsmart, the management force you to come in early or on your days off or even when you aren't available to work. They push you around and make you do their job because they're too lazy to do anything and then when someone gives a compliment to the store they take all the credit. nobody even gets a thank you or an consideration for all the hard work and extra hours we come in for. asking any employees for help in the store is a total joke and then the customers get mad at you because everyone else is too busy picking their noses in the corner. petsmart needs to invest in some actual managers and supervisors that will make their employees feel appreciated every once and a while."
bad,"Very stressful and tiring environment, I would never ever recommend. Terrible pay, and not enough time to get the work done in a reasonable timeframe."
bad,I have learned a lot about people and their pets and how to assist them with the problem at hand.  The employees are very easy to work with and friendly.
bad,The job itself is not bad but the poor management skills are horrible. they did not give me enough hours at all. I worked 8 hours one day and then 2 weeks later they finally decided to give me ANOTHER 8 hours.
bad,"The day to day work is not that bad.  However, training is extremely vague and inconsistent.  A lot of what you have to learn is taught by word of mouth or through employee knowledge.  Every store operates slightly different based on this.  So many procedures gets 'updated' or changed so frequently that you're literally just trying to keep up with all the changes."
bad,"Working here was fun at first I got o play with dogs in the pets hotel and pick up after them however management was severely biased. favorites were clearly played, managers will sit and do nothing while they expect you to fulfill daily tasks. scheduling was fair and were able to work with every ones schedule. the worst part about working here was the management"
bad,"In my store, we had 4 managers. The primary manager (i'll call her N) was a cold, heartless woman. Rarely smiled, never gave praise, but quick to anger and lash out. She also would be more than happy to fire someone for absolutely no reason if she felt as if she was being questioned in anyway."
bad,"The management has very bad communication with associates. The new policies are very unclear. One supervisor will ignore policies, and another will try to get you fired. a lot of favoritism."
bad,"I left because I was picked on by upper management. I was overloaded with work and when I would ask for help, I would not receive any. Rather, they would put people in other places rather than where the help was really needed. New employees where making the same amount of money I was making when I left after over 5 years of dedication to the company. Raises where never more than 10 cents. "
bad,it was a fun place to work because you can see animals all the time. The dogs that come in make it worth working. I got to know some customers and their dogs so they know and recognize me when they come in.
bad,A lot of hard work for minimum pay and the management was not employee friendly. Unexpected life issues caused problems with management. The other employees were easy to work with.Learning multiply positions could be difficult at first. Being around the animals made it fun.
bad,I have been with this company for about 2 years. The management team at my store is horrendous and the higher ups do not seem to care so long as we make profit (which we are not). We are in the business of selling animals and yet our animals and their health seem to be the lowest priority to the management team.
bad,"PetSmart is a decent company, though, my experience here was not spectacular. Management was bad. They were usually in a bad mood from something else and translated that onto me."
bad,usually wake up very early to make it for work generally stock shelves without much instruction which is alright. you learn essentially nothing here. its an alright place to work.
bad,"I was not given many hours and no benefits as a bather,so this job would be a good job for a young person who just needs to fund their hobbies. Not very good to make a living."
bad,This is just what you would expect from any retail job.  They only real difference here is that you have to be some what knowledgeable of animals.  People are very protective of their pets.
bad,"My experience might have been unique to my store, and because of my position, I cannot say much because my position was somewhat unique. That being said, the managment style was antagonistic and unhelpful. I was often unofficially instructed to put the pets' needs second and instructed to do tasks that are done by teams in other stores alone and without help and then gaslighted and insulted when I couldn't perform.  It wasn't a sudden change, but eventually I was daily given the choice between following my conscience (by giving the attention to the dogs that we advertised) and cutting corners by following the instuctions by my direct supervisors."
bad,"This job is great at first but then you quickly get overloaded. Management does not care about your well-being or about how hard you work for them, they clearly only care about productivity of the company. Also, they fail to promote within the company or give adequate raises."
bad,"The pay is decent but the job is very repetitive and boring. The hours are flexible and its easy to pick up a shift whenever you need it. However, the supervisors do not communicate well with each other."
bad,"a typical day of work for me consisted of coming in before the store opened and  feeding all the animals, cleaning their cages/bins, same with the cat adoption center. id also do a quick  look over my department to make sure  that the product on the shelves  were nice and neat in time for the store to open. after the store opened it was standard customer service and multitasking to other departments  or taking over a register if things got busy."
bad,It is a great place to  work if you have no ambition to move up in the company. Most of the time you do not have  enough staffing to ensure anyone gets a brake or lunch. 10 hour shifts with out a break or lunche is common place.
bad,Working at Petsmart was horrible. The management did not care about you at all. They only cared that you were there and did your work. They didn't care about animal safety or human safety when you worked with the animals.
bad,If you are looking to start in retail.... This is a good place to begin. A challenging place to work. Fun people to work with. If you're an animal lover you'll really enjoy seeing and working with all the different animals.
bad,Working with animals and customers is fun. Management has no experience with animals and insists on dictating the care and management of the animals. Management is also against the education of customers when they are buying animals and will let them get what ever they want without the concern of the animals in question.
bad,Petsmart does alot of great things. My review is solely based on my last manager who couldn't find his way out of a paperbag if it was stuck on his head.
bad,I worked here for 5 years. Essentially a typical retail job. Great employees- horrible management.  Managers don't train employees- everything I learned was either on my own or from watching other employees.
bad,It was a good job as long as you didn't make any mistakes. There is a completely different staff there now from when i first started 3 years ago.
bad,"Mixed messages from management, move things out of the back room however when the backroom is clear.  The question is asked why is this out on the floor?   You only sell 3 a week.  It isn;t going to sell in the back.  "
bad,"While my coworkers and peers at Petsmart were usually amazing, upper management wass often disorganized and ineffective. When it comes to the job, it is just like any other retail job except with the perk of spending your day with animals. As long as you get lucky with management at your store, it's an alright job"
bad,"The other employees were friendly, most of the time. Management was alright. I feel like communication was lacking between employees. I did learn a lot of new skills. Seeing all the animals was the best part. The hardest part was having to work holidays and also not getting paid very much for the work that was done."
bad,Bad management means a very stressful job. Most of the employees there are great to get a long with. Although the rest aren't and a lot of home problems are brought to work making work stressful and a depressing place to be.
bad,This used to be a great place to work. The leadership was great and the moral was very high. But then the company went private and the entire leadership of the company turned over to people who didn't care about the employees and mid-level VPs and managers only cared about looking good and saving money and were constantly laying off good people and re-organizing for appearance sake. There are no decision makers and many micro-managers. I would guess probably 1/2 of the 1000 corporate employees have turned over at least once in the past 2 years. I wouldn't recommend working here until the new owners sell and all the upper management turns over again. They will likely lay off another large group right before a sale so watch out for that.
bad,"How can you be in a bad mood around all those furry faces! Love working with the animals, feeding, cleaning up after them and of course cuddling. Learn a lot about nutritional benefits for several breeds of animals."
bad,"My schedule was all over the place, so I would be working 35 hours one week and 15 the next week. Sometimes the schedule wouldn't be posted till closing the night before, so you would have to call in or stop by right at 9 to see if you worked the next day. "
bad,"There was always something to do with many clients coming in, but everyone paid little attention to detail and worried too much about getting dogs in and out and not caring about quality and comfort. Learned basic dog bathing, nails, and trimming."
bad,"Petsmart is a company where all they care about is their numbers. The location I worked at was beyond unorganIzed. They don't have the associates best interest at heart. The communication is horrible. The business is slow. Also how they keep the actual store is disgusting and unsanitary. It's always nasty from the restrooms, to the break room, oops stations not being cleaned out etc."
bad,"Current management needs work. Employees are not valued, often are told to deal with issues, and therefore, there is a lot of turn over. Other employees are nice to work with and the job can be fun and rewarding. There is a chance of moving up in the company but that is not readily available. Full time is not offered and is very hard to get. Hours are varied and work is not steady but this is understandable because of the business type. Working on holidays is required. Schedules often change."
bad,"I have learned how to build long term relationships with clients. Working in a fast paced environment. Working with difficult customers AND coworkers. It has taught to pay close attention to detail, and how to defuse situations with upset customers."
bad,"When I started with PETSMART corps in 2008 it was a wonderful company, with terrific beliefs, values and a great corporate culture. After the buy-out from BC Partners in Sept 2014 & finalized in the Spring of 2015, there were two sets of RIF which layer off 700 plus employees at corporate, and me being one them. My values and beliefs no longer aligned with the new Pet$mart culture, where the connection between pet parent and pet is no longer valued by the emotional connection of saving a pets life and often saving a persons life, by adopting a new friend, but based on the connection of how much can that pet parent spend on the pet in a Pet$mart store. No longer my cup of tea."
bad,a typical day at work is hectic and short staff. I learned to deal with ignorant customers and rude staff members. Management is terrible their always slow. The coworkers are rude and the hardest part of the job is getting help on the register. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting off.
bad,"Typical retail environment"
bad,I worked here as an early morning stock crew for a month because the management was so awful. I was the only team member that would work to meet targets and when they were not met i was the one who mostly got yelled at. Also the wage was awful for getting up at 3am and carrying bags of dog food all day. The pets were nice and so were the clients and other co workers.
bad,"Management was like a revolving door. No real interest in their job and worried too much about personal things and showed way too much favoritism towards others. Way too many young kids being managers with no real grasp on life  If they didn't like you, you knew it. And it showed. They had a funny way of totally disrespecting you! And seemed to have a hard time even remembering your name.It was a click! The hardest part of the job was having to let it go. I loved it despite it all. The most enjoyable part was the animals I got to know and their pet parents."
bad,"The management is all over the place (most of the time the managers don't show up), gossip and inappropriate jokes are the only form of communication among the staff, everybody seemingly loves and hates each other at the same time, if you try to avoid all of this you are treated like dirt. One of the worst places to work, reminds me of all of the worst aspects of going to high school."
bad,The management had no idea what they were doing and they had no idea how to properly treat their fellow associates. Every day I would go in and get constantly yelled at for tasks that I had no idea needed to be completed. The instructions given down to the fellow associates were vague and not translated properly from person to person. I tried very hard to do my best at not only my job but to help others at theirs and the management team scorned my attempts to help others. They did not care about their workers and it affected everyones morale.
bad,"A typical day would me having to work the back stock room, help customers, answer the phone and use the register all while having other daily tasks to accomplish. I learned that some managers would rather not help but instead just tell you that they were able to accomplish the tasks when they were in the same position. Only a few of the management team was helpful and sensible. The rest were unfortunately corrupt with the ability to say whatever they would like with no ramification. My co-workers were always helpful and would push through the day to get all the tasks completed. The hardest part would be having to accept a truck in the receiving bay in 10 degree weather. The most enjoyably part would be working with the dogs."
bad,"A typical day at work was usual on the register. I wasn't suppose to be on the register as much as I was, not really sure why I was all day with how slow the store was. Management didn't really manage and did not treat all employees equally which is something I had an issue with. The co-workers were difficult to work with and I never felt welcome working at PetSmart after being there for 2 years. I absolutely loved being a dog trainer and I learned a lot on a day to day basis. But I do think that Petsmart does need to look at the way the run certain things because it honestly is not an enjoyable environment to work in."
bad,I did not enjoy working here because my manager and several coworkers sexually harassed me.
bad,"It was a nice place to work and had friendly staff. However, management only scheduled 4 hour days once or twice a week and continued to hire more people than were needed. People could not afford the gas to get there on their pay. "
bad,"I worked for a year, progressing in the store from cashier, to petcare, to bather to groomer. The pay is low, morale is low, and a lot of the equipment is in poor repair. Air conditioning didn't work either, very hot and not safe working environment."
bad,I stood a cash register most of the time even thought they hired me to sell training classes that I would then teach. I wanted to sell and teach not stand at a register all day.
bad,"There was bad management however, it was a great environment. The coworkers were great and taking care of the animals was enjoyable."
bad,"I was lied to about being hired as a dog trainer, they put me on cashier and were reluctant if not down right rude about letting me interact with the animals or help with the training. After being there for a few months, I discovered that they had hired EVERY other cashier for a higher paying and more prestigious job such as dog groomer, trainer, fork lift operator, etc. with no real intention of training them as such and just wanted smarter, more capable cashiers than the usual dirty T-shirt wearing low lives of Anderson who came in daily in flip flops to weakly ask for a job. NOT HAPPY WITH PETSMART! Further more, I was intimidated and threatened to resign or have a BS theft charge placed on my record! Basically because I wouldn't put up with doing the same lame routine over and over again as opposed to actually wanting to work in the position I was hired for. Very immature and incompetent management and employees!"
bad,"Fickle, hypocritical, disconnected corporate, allows stores to be run on personal quips by people who only look good on paper."
bad,hours required were not consistent. Many times I was expected to go to work to fulfill duties required by management.
bad,This is a good job if you are a teenager or going to school. It is hard to get over 20 hours.
bad,"This company is a ripoff.. Please save your time from here. They use you until they are tired of you and lay you off.. but, dont even try to file for unemployment they told the unemployment office i was a no call no show.. Never had a positive experience here"
bad,I hated working at Petsmart. Dealing with needy Pet Parents and and not having a supporting management team really made the job difficult to perform day in day out!
bad,When I began at Petsmart it was about service and work; by the time I left it had become a psychophantic culture.
bad,meeting alot of nice people and their pets. Enjoyed the work and helping people with their pets behavior.
bad,I was not promoted within the store because I was female and the store manager preferred to advance male employees.
bad,My co-workers and I work as a team. We have fun working with each other.
bad,There is to much attention paid to things that have nothing to do with running the business. The company has fired many managers who did not deserve it.
bad,"Petsmart is a lot of fun to work for, the job requires a lot of energy and standing for eight hours straight."
bad,"Saying that you are customer focused, while truly only caring about “brand” value. Parent company only invested in PetSmart to build up its value then sell off for max profit."
bad,"The Store Leader was horrible to work under. People constantly called out and weren’t held accountable, the lack of communication between managers was atrocious."
bad,"No matter how good of a job you do, the vast majority of management (especially the Store Lead and Assistant Store Lead) will never recognize it. I worked in most departments and as a Pet Care associate as well as a Stocker, management will have completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to completing tasks (which keep you extremely busy your entire shift, on top of you having to help customers/sell animals/keep the store clean). New hires will nearly always be hired in at a higher pay than even the associates who have been there 3+ years, but will actively tell you not to discuss pay despite the fact that telling your employees that is literally illegal in this state. The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because of most of my coworkers and my love for animals. Trust me, work at a different PetSmart."
bad,"Petsmart, like many other big retailers, is concerned about numbers first, employees second. During my tenure there we were expected to work often with only three people on the floor (one of which would be a manager). We were somehow expected to greet and help every customer that walked into the store, set up displays, keep the store clean, care for the live pets, and stock shelves using bare-bones hours."
bad,"Petsmart won't offer liveable wages for work load to tenured staff & only hire PT associates.  Even though benefits are extended they're not affordable on the wages paid there.  PS has a revolving door of untrained desperate job seekers with an unbelievably high attrition rate!  Managers outnumber assicoates sometimes 4-1 on a shift.  The company can afford to pay more, but won't."
bad,It was a ok place to work when i worked there it was only part time. at the time i worked there the manager was ok but not the best. I would never go back there to work.
bad,"You never get a chance to advance , and you don't get training to advance. Employees and managers were always talking behind eachtohers back saying nasty things . Work was never evenly distributed between employees , two people would do all the hard work while the other four on shift stood around and talked and went on paid breaks ."
bad,"A typical day at work can be super stressful. The majority of the time you are working there you are usually understaffed, in my 2 years there was never a time where we were fully staffed. Even in the holiday season."
bad,"PetSmart is focused on sales, sales of products and services for pets, dogs, cats, birds and reptiles. They have a good variety of mid-priced products."
bad,"Everyone was extremely negative. No matter the day or time of day is was just people complaining about misery constantly. Now, I'm not trying to say whether it was right or wrong to complain about the situation. But it was very depressing as a result. That was my biggest take away. And with most low paying jobs management was terrible and you always felt overworked."
bad,all I have to say is over time this company has gone down I love what I do but I can’t wait till I no longer have to do it for petsmart management sucks at my location and the communication is worst and it starts from the top
bad,"While working here, I began to notice that new policies were implimented that made place a high amount of stress on my co workers. Most began to have mental break downs at quotas or unrealistic time restrictions that they were unable to keep. After leaving I experienced these issues both as a customer and as a friend of some of the managers and remaining associates. Unless you are good friends with the District manager dont expect any advancem either."
bad,If you are a pet lover then you will enjoy working at Petsmart and that has to be the most enjoyable part about the job. If you are able to drive the team to achieve results especially in customer service you will do well at Petsmart.
bad,Typical day was feeding cleaning walking dogs load play rooms quickly. return pets quickly. Everything done at a fast paced so quality of work lacked. Some people worked harder than others. No formal training just how to clean cages and rooms and how to do feedings.  Physically demanding job
bad,"Every individual store has different management so I can’t speak for them all, but the three stores I worked at had managers that liked to contribute to drama in the work place and definitely played favorites."
bad,"The workplace is slow-paced for the most part, except on weekends when the store is really busy. It is a team-oriented workplace where you are constantly communicating through radios to managers and pet care associates."
bad,There is a lot of bullying and clicks there is alot of young people working there so if you not in your 20s you wont fit in I worked grave and days and had alot of issues being bullyed cuz I am 35
bad,Cleaning cages was actually fun. Management was lacking. They were not very flexible with hours or days. If you love animals its a really cool place to work.
bad,it was a alright experience with poor leadership skills and bad management. for me personal it was a major conflict of personal interest as it was more business rather than caring for the animals within our store at varying times
bad,"I worked at PetSmart for about five months. I was a Pet Care Associate, also trained as a cashier, so I spent the majority of my time working with animals or customers looking for items related to their small animals, reptiles, and birds. As someone who has extensive knowledge on small animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and of birds, I was really disappointed by the lack of knowledge the rest of my coworkers had regarding them. Birds don't and can't live off just seeds, and they need relatively big cages, not those tiny cages PetSmart sells. They also need outside time from their cages. Same with rabbits and guinea pigs. Many of our customers were uninformed about reptiles and their lighting requirements, and my coworkers did OK explaining, but didn't cover all bases. Coworkers were mostly nice though. Mostly our customers were awful about our fish. You can't put a plecostomus in a 5 gallon tank, nor can you just release them into the lake near your house once they get too big for you. They'll die, or mess up the ecosystem as they are an invasive species to my state. PetSmart has a policy where you can say no to a sale of an animal, but management wouldn't let you do that for fish. Now, moving away from the ignorance of coworkers and customers in regards to animals, I'd like to talk about the ignorance to mental illness and health that management has. I'm someone struggling with my health, and always have. I was put on lithium in June, and I had become progressively more sick. By the end of my taking the medication, I was throwing up daily and I was shaking violently shortly"
bad,"The biggest problem working here is the coworkers, like all petshops it attracts eccentric people, so your experience will vary depending on how much of that you can handle"
bad,The manager was constantly lacking leadership. The pay was not enough to live off of. The job required lots of labor for a check that was not enough. The team was young and not motivated to succeed.
bad,"Often asked me to do things that werent part of my possition, nor what I was physically supposed to be doing. I.E. organizing the backstock of dog and or cat food during my shift dispite me having back problems (not supposed to lift more than arround 40lbs occasionally at most) as well as another employee with even worse back issues. I was only in pet care. "
bad,"If you want to gain experience in animal care for minimum wage and minimal hours, PetSmart is the place to work. The dogs are great, the customers are wonderful, the company itself... needs improvement. They provide wonderful training videos, updated weekly. However, if you wish to receive a living wage, you may want to look elsewhere. Its a great environment for entry level experience in animal care. Though PetSmart lacks the ability to fairly compensate it's employees."
bad,I would not recommend working at petsmart on Pinole. There was never any workers. Management never did there job and it was way to stressful for such a low hourly pay rate
bad,"Working there was okay at the start but when new managers came in they started to play favorites with the staff. It got so bad that some of the employees would spend hours of the day on their phones not working while others had to pick up the extra work.Never had a job where management promoted the worst employees before."
bad,"-This would be a great job if it wasn't for the poor management. "
bad,"when I worked at PetSmart the place was infested with rats. The products were covered in urine and we had to walk the store in the morning to inspect the rat traps laid out the night before. Management told us to tell customers that the rats were pet rats that escaped, but they got so big that it was impossible to keep up the lie!"
bad,"I was hired as a bathing trainee, still in training and i had made a couple mistakes because i was still learning. manager kicked me out of the salon and forced me to train as a cashier with little to no hours and no second chance in the salon. i learned from my mistakes and never repeated them yet they still kicked me out in the end because they care more about their reputation than their employees"
bad,Its good for a first job. I learned a lot of good life lessons and it helped me a lot with my social skill. After that though its time to get out and get a real Job.
bad,"People are quitting/being let go left and right, no one knows whats going on. Everyone in pet care has little to no training. I've had several managers quit on the spot.  Pet-smart was once a great company to work for but not anymore. I would not recommend working there"
bad,"If you’re just looking to supplement your existing job or work while going to school this job is ok. But it in no way pays living wages. I’ve been here for two years and only make $10.30/hr. Even if I was working full time I wouldn’t be able to pay bills or rent. People come and go quickly here, never staying for long because the company is terrible to its employees. They care more about whether you wear your name tag and if you follow the script given to “assist” people then if you’re happy to be there. We are advised not to say no to people who want an animal despite them not knowing anything about the animal, not caring about our suggestions for keeping the animal, and not having the proper enclosure for the animal. Don’t work here! This place shouldn’t be selling animals!"
bad,I honestly don't know how people stay here for more than five years. At least from the location I am from. Each PetSmart I've worked at is poorly managed and the pay is barley anything. I would not recommended working here if you are a single individual trying to pay bills on your own. You're gong to be living pay check to pay check. Sometimes I felt like I was being treated poorly by management as well. So that didn't help matters any.
bad,"coworkers are consistently rude, the management does not care about there employees at all. The job was decent when i started but as time went on managers started to leave and then we got a new manager and everything went down hill."
bad,I liked working there for a while. But my manager was just rude. She would yell at me for doing what she told me to do. She said I did everything wrong even though I followed the book. I thought I did a good job but I guess not. Also I didnt get many hours there which I didnt like. So I quit because I had already gotten a new job.
bad,Manager expected you to know how to do everything with little to no training involved. I had asked for more training which they never gave me. It was a very unprofessional work environment.
bad,It's honestly been to long since I've worked at this job. I loved the people that I worked with when I did work there. It was a nice place to work and paid okay for a college kid.
bad,this is more of a high school job. they don't pay much. the hours were not consistent. the people I worked with were fine. the store manager was the worst store manager I ever had.
bad,Petsmart's managers are not willing to assist you with customers around the store. spends most of their time in their office  if Clarence isnt coming.
bad,"Overall the job itself isn’t bad. There are worse places to work. If you’re a teenage animal lover with a flexible schedule who doesn’t mind working weekends it could be ideal. If you’re over 30 and just need a few hours to supplement your income, not so great. If you have a specific number of hours you’re available to work this job probably won’t meet your needs. They will either try to put you on a full time schedule or cut you back so much that you’re forced to either quit or find additional employment. It’s a great first job for a kid right out of high school. For a parent just trying to pay the rent it’s not worth the trouble."
bad,"if you want to be a groomer it's great, but corporate doesn't value you and half the time the managers don't either. It's all about money. They don't care as long as you can do a minimum of 5 dogs a day, which is a step up from 4 a day. Military discounts are now taken from our commission instead of a coupon we would give to the customers which wouldn't effect our pay at all. Petsmart upped grooming prices but in the end the groomers are still losing more money than we ever had before. If you wanna be a groomer, be part time, unless you need benefits."
bad,Petsmart had great benefits as well as tuition compensation programs but the management was very poor. Management was not good at supporting employees.
bad,"great for a start up job. the best customers are the pets that come in, you get to interact with multiple pets everyday. you help the pets and the pet-parents become closer and get everything they need"
bad,The managers are often rude and not helpful to their workers they are training. Some of the managers here bully some of their employees and even embarrass them in front of customers. Each manager has their own way they want things done which makes you have to redo most of your tasks multiple times a day in order to please the wants of the managers that is on the clock that day.
bad,"Poor management, a lot of free time. I was made to feel like the managment was out to get me and ended up calling HR about it, even though nothing was done after having done so."
bad,"Good place to work but extremely disorganized. Don’t train employees properly and struggle to keep everyone and everything organized. Also, need to keep track of applicants and alllications."
bad,This place was a good place to work while starting a family and working your way through college but was not a long term career for me. It was very labor intensive work and was not always ideal.
bad,In our area the mgmt is terrible or it would be a good company. I worked my way up over three years and when I was MIL I wasn't even given the hours assigned by the company from my store leader to do the massive monthly resets leaving every week stressful and me having to do them during the day while I was running the store and helping customers. Very frustrating. The upper MGMT does not care about it's employees since the company was sold 3 years ago.
bad,"The people you work with are great, the management however is young and inexperienced. The professionalism between directors and Vice Presidents has great potential for improvement as they are all young and young in their positions. There is a reputation for a revolving door among all departments, and yes that is true, which makes business very hard to run. The departments are constantly changing roles, without communication, causing either double work or something to slip through the cracks. It can be a great company to work for, there just needs to be better more experienced/mature leadership and consistent direction."
bad,"I worked at a Petsmart in a different state and my managers were the best, everyone got along great, I wasn’t stressed at work and I could separate work and personal life. Since I moved stores its like working for a completely different company. I understand everyone is different and does things their own way but it should all be the same policy and everyone should be treated with respect. Whenever managers change stores they implement their own rules and how the store is run day to day and it takes time for the people who worked there before to get used to them and some people just don’t have the patience or respect for that."
bad,"The first location I was at wasn't too bad. I was a bather there and transfered to another place once I had my grooming training. The management there was terrible. The work environment is extremely fast paced, especially for a new groomer. They overbook like crazy and expect you to not work any over-time or you get written up. They want to churn out business in unreasonable amount of time, yet not sacrifice quality. This is causing safety concerns and loads of unnecissary stress on both employees and pets."
bad,"The store is run with money in mind first, regardless of animal health or safety. They knowingly sell brands that make dogs sick and have had numerous recalls."
bad,Great place to grow and flourish the best place for anybody who is trying to advance in such a workplace. Loved my experience and hope the next lucky candidate the best
bad,"Managers are all full-time. If you are a part time associate, you get treated like a janitor. Benefits come with a full time associate. I learned that Pet Smart lacked management."
bad,management sucks they don't care about associates. they want robots not people. most supervisors know nothing about the department their over. they are always late posting numbers. overall I would not recommend.
bad,Animals were not kept in the best conditions and we as employees could not do anything to help them. Management was terrible and some managers did not know anything about animals that were not dogs or cats.
bad,"Terrible place to work when I was there for the start up. Management was not competent did not know what or how to run the teammates . they kept changing hours to work if they needed 1, 2 or 3  shifts.  Did not know who was really incharge."
bad,grooming salon is stressful and they groomers are jerks. the petshotel was amazing and loved their jobs. groomers were always getting over booked and getting behind . the management expect to much from the employees in the grooming . They DONT communicate professionally or courteously. BUT petshotel was awesome and friendly .
bad,"There were many issues that happened with PetSmart. They only gave me an hour of training, and then proceed to get frustrated with me when I don't understand the procedures. I've had to stay past my clock out time several times, it's constantly understaffed, they overwork you and they treat you badly if you take your 15-minute breaks. The staff is heavily disorganized and only certain workers know how to properly handle situations without a manager."
bad,Poor store manager creating a negative work environment. Employees are made to feel like they can never do a good enough job. Hours are given to favorites.
bad,"Teams are making strides to restore the fun and exciting culture that he company was known to have in the 2000s."
bad,"Not able to take any breaks, get harassed during lunches, willing to work around some employees schedules and not others. Used to be a fairly easy going job, that changed when management kept changing."
bad,I left because the management wasn't fair. Some managers were very rude and selfish while others cared a lot about the staff. I couldn't take working somewhere where my direct manager couldn't take the stress of being a manager and having to do her regular job
bad,the company was not enjoyable to work for at my store. we did not get many breaks and were pressured to do more work than we had time to do or felt comfortable doing.
bad,Management of team of 5 accounts graduates and process and collate the sales and cashflow of 50+ stores throughout the country. Ensure all takings reconciled with the till sales reported.
bad,Volunteeing at shady grove helped me love cats. Initially i was terrifieed but i grew a fodness of them. It also helped me help the homeless and provide as much as i could for them.
bad,I enjoyed my clients much more than I enjoyed working for the company. It was very stressful to not get any help to move up in the workplace. I have definitely improved my customer service skills.
bad,"I had a stint at Gamestop for a week and got called back two weeks later telling me to come in for a shift I didn't know I even had; already hired at PetSmart. That feeling of uncertainty and confusion basically sums up my career at PetSmart. Terrible management, terrible customer service, no connectivity with the customer at all and if there was it was forced by tracking down folks in the aisle to sell them garbage to meet a quota every month. I could go on but it's not worth it, I was told even by one of my close team mangers that this job was not worth the effort with minimum payout."
bad,"A typical day at petsmart consist of me assisting customers to find the right product as well as training dogs, I would cash out customers at the cash register as well and try and get people to get there dogs signed up for any classes."
bad,"Management doesn't like to assist cashiers and petcare associates when they are busy and need it. "
bad,I loved working with the cats but the people in charge were always rude. I eventually stopped going because I always felt like I was in trouble for something.
bad,"Not a fun place to work. Extremely stressful, high turnover rate for managers and employees alike. Tense work environments, groomers are paid fairly for their haircuts and commission possibilities but are not compensated or assisted with the other tasks we are expected to perform such as reception work and checking in other peoples clients and walk-in services, which take up considerable amounts of time. Benefits are expensive but very good."
bad,when a customer was rude management left me by myself to get yelled at. management was hardly ever available to answer my questions. Too many contradictions in policies.
bad,"district and store politics shape the work environment, good hard work is valued below personal friendships and you are an expendable number if you don't grease the right hands."
bad,"I worked there for almost six years. I was never approached with advancement opportunities, even though I had received corporate commendations several times. I had also asked for a full time position on a few occasions and they were never very willing to work with me on it. We had a couple of leads that weren't interested in advancement, so I was stuck in limbo. I had asked for advancement opportunities or workshops and I was never taken seriously. They almost always hired outside of the company for management, which makes no sense from an integrity stand point. Raises every year were expected to be around 10 cents, if you were lucky, 25 cents."
bad,"Its very competitive and very unprofessional. The groomers are commission based so stealing dogs happens frequently, the pay is good but the stress is difficult to deal with."
bad,The work place was decent. Very fast paced and very technical. Everything must be done near perfect and you cannot be late. If you are sick and they send you home they will fire you.
bad,"Very poor training after you do the basic computer classes.  When you are trained poorly then constantly nagged at for doing things wrong it becomes very stressful.  Managers aren't always very friendly and they all do things different so you can easily get in trouble for doing something wrong that you've been told was right.  Employees are not enabled to do the right thing for customers and as a cashier you are left basically alone running the entire front of store. Any prices and sales are not correct in the register so you constantly have to call for help then get a nasty attitude by management for bugging them.  You are constantly pressured to sell puppy guides, get emails, and sell training or get donations.  It feels like you are constantly begging your customers and getting nasty feedback for doing so.  Also some staff come to work high but managers do nothing.  Also have watched a lot of employee theft and again no response or action from managers.  Very frustrating place to work.  Don't plan on getting full time, cruddy shifts and they don't want to pay full time employees."
bad,"I worked at the appleton store for a year. It was nice at first but after a while my co workers slacked and i was expected to pick up the pace. Management played favorites and screwed me over. The shifts went by slowly and the breaks went fast. We were yelled at if we werent constantly doing something when if there was nothing to do (slow days).  Peopel think working at a petstore means playing with animals but honestly its 90% cleaning, 5% customer service and 5% selling animals and products."
bad,"The job was okay at first, it really depends on the management. When I started the job was fine, the assistant manager was understanding and very efficient in his job. The store manager was a jerk and belittled staff. The next set of managers was worse than the fist set. The store manager was a sexist jerk and the assistant was a ""please every customer"" type. There's pleasing customers and then there's making a profit off of animals and selling them when you know they're going to come back dead. Empty promises of a promotion. Very little schedule flexibility. Awful morale and a secondary management team that was stuck in high school and if you weren't in the ""cool kids group"" then you were no one and disregarded."
bad,PetSmart is an okay place to work . Its fast paced and competitive .Grooming dogs is a passion of mine and grooming them as fast as I could was not in my wheel house.
bad,Until people that did no work were rewarded more due to favoritism. Some manager didn't ant to even do their job and it was a hassle to even get taught my first week working there.
bad,"Not bad for a college or high school student, or for extra income, but definitely not a reliable source. I love animals a lot, and enjoyed educating the customers and my job responsibilities, but the pay was not good at all. I was there for 3 years, and at the time I left minimum wage was 8.00 and I was making 8.02.  Some random person off the street was getting paid more than I was, having no experience whatsoever. I was reliable and very good at what I did, but the raises were like 10 or 15 cents per year! How is anyone supposed to live off that?"
bad,I hated working here! the management sucked and no one really cared about the employees in my opinion. I worked well and did my job and barely got an recognition
bad,"The manger only trained me 3 days then left me on my own, i was the only one working the night shift. It was depressing and everyone said i did a bad job."
bad,I really loved my job at petsmart. It was challenging but so rewarding as well. I would have never left but the store manager and I could not work out our issues. And when I went to his boss I was punished and things got really bad. I was hospitalized for the stress it caused. I have 3 children one of which is disabled and my health was more important.
bad,"In the Three Years I worked for PetSmart, I not only worked Full Time hours and only got paid Part time salary, but I was tricked into believing I was getting paid Full time. This was technically my first job and getting started was simple. This job was best for someone with NO experience in any job. I got along with most of my team and management but as time when on not only did employees come and go too often but i started to see a lack of care from management. Customers are very difficult to work with in any job but when the Management just stands back letting someone verbally abuse you, it becomes clear that it isn't the best work environment. My last year of working there, I had received enough job experience to know that i needed to move on to something better."
bad,They only care about small unimportant things that don't actually consider your actual work ethic when they are considering you in comparison to other employees.
bad,"Don't go to work for the one in Rogers. The 2 main managers our aweful! Bad personalities. Belittle and degrade customers and associates.."
bad,This job leaves you with a bad taste in the mouth. The company did not give much support. Managment was out for their own agenda. Money was the only concern of the company. Emplyees
bad,"Anyone who has been there more than 2 years knows PetSmart is not what it used to be. Payless management came on board 2 years ago and has changed everything. Positive side, implemented retail practices that should have been in place 25 years ago. Negative side, they don't know what they are doing. No work life balance. Everything is re-done numerous times. It has nothing to do with change or new evidence. It is all re-done because you have people in leadership roles who don't know that they are doing or what they want. Workload and timeline are totally unrealistic."
bad,"PetSmart is more concerned with the business aspect of the company and how much money the company will produce yearly.  Therefore, their employees are not valued or respected."
bad,"It was stressful because they need to have better managing styles and better communication with everyone they hire. Also, more knowledgeable people in petcare."
bad,i enjoyed petsmart in the beginning but eventually management changed n the joy i had for work slowly started leaving the job over all is very enjoyable
bad,i worked there for five years training management just to succeed me and that was not good feeling but live and learn these skills ive learn along the ways have helped me grow
bad,"It used to be a fun place to work. Now it's ALL work. Not enough staff, not enough payroll. New initiatives that focus on cost cutting and profits at the expense of customer service."
bad,"*New experience to a lot of things learning on the job is very important."
bad,"They do not like to follow their own guidlines and policy and procedures and does not care about putting there salon employees in danger when there is supposed to be two people in the salon at all times and they screw it up,."
bad,New district manager ran a great district into the ground. Doesn't seem like corporate cares with hours always getting cut and more tasks being given. Focus should be on the customer and not ho many conference calls we can be on in a week
bad,"Management could be difficult to deal with  and would not effectively communicate, thus creating situations that would cause problems for other associates. Employees would frequently not show up for work and at times this could lead to only an associate and manager running the store alone. Working conditions at times could be unsafe and ill kept, with the store and store room appearing messy with pallets askew. There was a constant issue with infested dog food, as the bags would not be turned or checked frequently thus insect larvae would begin to grow, chew through the bags, and infest other Merchandise. On top of this food would often be returned in this condition and I recall a couple times when pets would get sick from the food. Would not recommend at all."
bad,"I worked back in pet care so I would prepare the animals for the day, feed them, clean their cages, and interact with them. I would clean fish tanks, count fish, and remove dead fish. I prepared animals for purchase, gathered crickets and feeder fish, and removed any sick animals from the floor and took care of them separately. I actually enjoyed the work, honestly. The issue was with the people working there and how they handled their jobs. Other people working in pet care would disappear and I would have to cover for them, or they would neglect their duties openly until I did them. Management was incredibly harsh and particular about how things were done. Any discretion was treated as a major infraction. One manager told me to leave fifteen minutes early; I was publicly berated the next day by another manager in front of other employees and customers. I loved working with the animals. I didn't even mind having to scrub fish tanks as long as someone else was there to handle customers. I ended up having to quit due to medical issues and moving away, but I can't imagine having stayed too much longer anyway."
bad,"Overall is a fun place to work if you are an animal lover such as myself. But It can be stressful, some associates are negative making the work environment uncomfortable"
bad,"I work with some really nice people.. they are often helpful when I ask for help... I love the dogs that I have the chance to play with and care for.. "
bad,"A good part time job if you don't expect to make very much money or advance quickly. Stores aren't allocated enough hours to allow things such as forklift training and/or cross training to make an employee more valuable.  Also, entry level employees only get about 15 hours per week to work. It's a good job for a student living at home with minimal expenses."
bad,"For an overnight job, there was too much physical work for one person.  Taking care of 100-200 dogs and cats very stressful.  Pay did not come close to duties prescribed"
bad,The management there did not seem to be on the same page.  They were back stabbers and looked to rid the place of employee's who had been there since the opening.  They let their employees work there for 5 years with no rate then decided to put everyone on a rating system. Several older associates lost their jobs because they could not make rate.
bad,"As a Groomer you are required to work long hours and are discouraged to take your lunch break or other breaks. you end up working 10 hours a day, and only being paid your 8 hour day."
bad,"You'll start off at minimum wage and will only get a small raise once a year. Even then, you have to score high enough on their evaluation system. And if you do, you'll get a few pennies. There's little loyalty towards employees who stick around so most simply don't. Just about everyone who works there felt the same so it was fun to complain in the break room. Plus they hire so many people that sometimes you'll get 10 or less hours a week."
bad,"Working in the petshotel should be really fun and in theory it is. But the  corporate people pass down new rules, regulations, and Ideas that prove they have no idea what we go through on a daily basis. There is a huge disconnect from the corporate office in Arizona to the actual stores. And we are just expected to make it work while they continue to cut our hours down to the bare minimum.  The management has an ""open door policy"" but really you can't trust it because they blab everything you say or have a condescending remark which isn't helpful. Also as a full time associate they have to have full access to your week (day or night), the schedule gets posted last minute, and they try to change it constantly very last minute. And they seem to get upset if you aren't waiting by your phone on your day off for their call. Overall I would say look for something better. This is not a great place to work. If it weren't for my love of the animals I have gotten to know over the years, I would have been gone long ago."
bad,"I worked in almost every department of Petsmart for three years. I was a military dependent, so I traveled. My first store was by far the best store. My last store in Pensacola is awful. My store manager made me feel uncomfortable with touching me and inappropriate comments. I filed a harassment form and all that happened was my DM spoke to him. Management always talked down to me. There was also a lot of favoritism with some associates and management."
bad,Its a great place and does have room to grow. Its mixed with ethnicities and they take care of there employees. Treat us well and make sure safety is first
bad,"As a retain Job, PetSmart was not as bad as most other stores. The job itself was great, working with animals was great and I did learn a lot. I started at this job with 0 retail experience and will be leaving with a year of management under my belt."
bad,"I currently work as a stocker at Petsmart. A typical day of work consists of getting to work at 5 AM and doing nothing else other than filling shelves 'til either 12:30 AM or 1:30. The store typically takes in about 9-12 pallets of product in every truck day. All of these pallets have to be worked the next day with some exceptions. much of the stuff stocked is dog food bags anywhere from 5 - 50 pounds."
bad,"Fun environment, good clients and pets, learned most of my grooming knowledge there the corporation was just too tough for the business to be a happy workplace."
bad,"They could be better if they would treat the animals decent!"
bad,Nice place to be if you love animals or your first job.  You meet great people and animal lovers as yourself its just hard to not bring your work. (meaning the love of animals)
bad,"Management was lazy, never backed up employees for enforcing company policy, medical insurance was expensive and went up in price every year as benefits got smaller-like not offering dental anymore."
bad,"Some Managers pick and choose favorite employees. Some managers do not follow protocol. Grooming Salon is very unkept, moldy, and hard to work in."
bad,"Great experience, friendly staff, reasonable prices and the haircut is as good or better than the haircut from the expensive place we used to take our dog to.  I've tried many different groomers and just settled for the expensive place until the service dipped.  Finally, I am happy with a groomer!  They have been grooming my two Schnauzers for over one year and they always get a great haircut.  Prices for puppies are less than the regular price-- unlike my former groomer"
bad,"mature, Excellent planner and coordinator, Works well under "
bad,"I pick and pack orders for stores,cleaned my area, put orders in totes and pallets.Operated an electric pallet rider.Management did not give all associates respect.Co workers were very friendly except for a few who like to laugh at things that were sad but they are forgiven."
bad,Upper management does not care about you.  I worked the night before thanksgiving from 9pm to 6am Thanksgiving morning.   This meant I spent a good portion of the holiday sleeping.  Plus I didn't get any extra pay.  Then they expected me to work black Friday 6am to 9am.  Horrible job if you're a stockworker.
bad,Management changes too often which causes chaos.  No communication.  Company changes had a negative effect on the level of care the live pets receive.
bad,"It was a thankless job, based only on productivity and the amount of extra sales you did."
bad,I enjoyed my job but it was very difficult to deal with the constant changing of management.  It seemed like there was new department and/or store managers every couple of weeks.  It was difficult to get a good relationship built with them.
bad,A work day is fast paced with a lot of tasks to complete. Employees try to assist one another as much as possible. Provide customer service while answering phone calls and manager pages to the front.
bad,Petsmart is transitioning to something that I do not want to continue to be a part of. They are going away from the core values and looking solely at profits. What a shame.
bad,Upper Management are sneaky and find ways to get rid of store management teams
bad,"typical day was pretty simple... get in to work, put on your protective gear and start cleaning up cages and feeding animals.  if you're opening you go in to the isolation rooms to care for ill animals and new arrivals before going on the floor before you start cleaning and feeding. if you close, you do the same. mid shift is primarily helping people on the floor."
bad,"co-workers were ok"
bad,The managment at this location are not good at doing their jobs. They let certain employees get aware with 'murder' in a matter of speaking. They cut corners and because of that the place is dirty and only taking care of half way.
bad,It was a great job just had some unprofessional people operating the equipment which made it unsafe for other people.
bad,"the work place was fun due to the animals, but when it came to management it was not good."
bad,"Petsmart was only concerned with making a profit. No one was allowed to advance based on merit or skill. People with no experience in retail were hired to run the stores, forcing existing employees with more knowledge to train their bosses. District Manager and HR refused to remove managers from stores even though they were severely destroying store morale. Associates were always fearful they were in jeopardy of losing their jobs."
bad,"Take calls, schedule appointments, call clients we haven't seen for a certain period of time, wash, groom dogs. Learned a artistic skill, management was very secretive and threatening, coworkers were easy to get along with and made shifts easier. No hard parts to the job most enjoyable parts pleased customers and happy dogs."
bad,"A typical day at work would include helping people find what they need for their pets,doing exchanges,returns,and customer service. I learned all kind of things about skin allergies,what kind of food is best for certain kinds of breeds of dogs,etc. My co-workers most of them are nice,easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people and still maintaining a smile on my face. The most enjoyable part was helping people find whats best for their pets and seeing them leave satisfied."
bad,A very Political job. Overall a great place to meet people and their pets
bad,"Typical day at work was wash,brush,dry dogs also check in and out customers. What I learned there was to wash dogs. My co-workers were awesome people to work with. The management was awful. The most enjoyable part of work was my co-workers."
bad,I stocked heavy bags of bulk pet food before the cutomers arrived and after the store opened I helped with general customer service duties.
bad,"As a mgr, day evolves around reports, tasks relating to reports, customer service, emails, recalls, holes, signing checklists(many), prompting and pushing associates, cash controls, safety & shrink controls, etc. Management must stay tuned to associates locations so as to direct customer service. All activities relate to being more profitable all the time. I have never worked for a company that was this greedy. Policies are dictated strictly by corporate and no adaption or alterations are tolerated. 50+ hrs per week. Hardest part of the job: going to work."
bad,"Typical workday is very repetitive, everything's required to be done on a time line. It's always a challange to put a twist on things to keep employees motivated and keep from getting too complacent. Some co-workers make the work place enjoyable because you can see so much potential is these individuals."
bad,its fun sometimes but other times everyone else just plays favorites
bad,"I worked for PetSmart for 3 years. 1 year as a cashier and 2 years stocking which was great when you had a good manager, or a night mare when you had a horrible manager. Despite coming in at 4 am and 5am daily, staying later than others to help out, and my seniority, I had to ask for a promotion to lead stocker. They took their time giving me my pay bump, then told me i'd get my back pay in one check, I was ok with that. Two months after I quit to go to college they called me and said they weren't going to give it to me. I also went back and and calculated my vacation pay and they based it on a lower average hrs worked per week. Basically, they forgot my years of hard work in the end, just to help their bottom line. At PetSmart hard work goes unnoticed. :/"
bad,I stared sr year of high school. it was my 1st job. it worked out ok until i got in a car accident and had to leave because of injuries.
bad,"A typical day includes phones ringing, barking, howling, and biting. You can expect about 6-8 dogs a day, and you get paid commission, so it good money. However, even if you dont make commission, you still make a hourly wage. Bathing, brushing, trimming hair to the customers likes is your main job. The second thing your responsible for is customers, and phone calls. We make appointments, and answer the questions customers have. Third, we are sales associate, and cashiers. You learn to be patient, because not all dogs are well behaved, and not all customers are too friendly. The management of Petsmart is confused. Everyone has different ""rules"" to follow, and no one is on the same page about anything. One of the hardest part of the job was knowing what the REAL rules were. Balacing working on dogs and answering phones at the same time was also very challenging, but you get use to it. Working in such a close environment with all women can be hard at times but you develop close friendships and you work as a team. The best part of the job is working with the dogs! They all have thier own personalities and remember you once they become regulars."
bad,"staff needs to be more professional and friendly, in my opinion. my second supervisor played favorites with the employees, and treated the ones he didnt like less than well (not professional, and not very mature). employees bad mouthed each other too much and it was not easy for everyone to get along with each other. the work and labor was demanding, but im not complaining about that. the pay was average. the only parts i enjoyed were the few good times i had with co-workers, interacting with the dogs, and the good dog and owner relationships i witnessed."
bad,Poor Management Decisions led to the loss of approximately 25 employees over the course of a three month period. I was a manager for this company in which the pay was good but the companies polices & procedure prohibited the creation of a strong and sucessful work environment.
bad,this company is good for someone who dont want to be better in life. is one of many that think about the company more then the employee.
bad,Did not fit with the culture at petsmart. The demands of the jib were just to much for me. I had to compete with their best worker and couldn't keep pace. So they cut me down to one day a week
bad,"they make it sound amazing to work there when you start but if just one person above you doesn't like you, they can ruin you which happens a lot so the turn over rate of the company is tremendous"
bad,"It's aight, but don't get stuck there. Best person for this job would be a workaholic who enjoys a fast paced environment with lots of rules. Over achievers welcome, but they definitely won't pay as much as you deserve"
bad,"This job is so awful. It could’ve just been my salon, but the work environment was full of toxic people and high school-like drama. All they care about is numbers. You mean nothing to them as an employee. Not to mention, you work until you feel like you are going to die, but they will always want more from you"
bad,"I have been working at Petsmart for a little over a year as a Petcare Associate. Your job is to take care of all the animals in the facility (upwards to 20+ different species of animals) and answer all questions pertaining to all these animals for customers at the same time. While also being an on-call go-guy for anything the store needs at anytime. This a stretched thin kind of position."
bad,"Not a place to work unless your obsessed with animals."
bad,"I was excited to work here, they seemed great, the store manager was great, the other mangers were pretty fair too. Then I started working there and the atmosphere was so rude. A lot of gossiping, catty, rude women just being nasty in every way. I was a new bather and apparently a lot of the groomers didn't ""like"" new bathers and were not kind at all. I thought it was just me, but nos there were a couple of other bathers that got hired after I had been there for a while and they were treated all the same. You only ever get a break when you become a groomer or if you come into it as a groomer. The managers didn't care, HR didn't care, and because they didn't like me, despite me being a good bather (to my knowledge), I got bullied out. "
bad,"Being a groomer is incredibly taxing work. No matter what you do, you're underpaid, under valued, and so far past stressed it's ridiculous. You spend busy days drowning in work, I didn't take lunches most days because I didn't have time. And even then I was leaving 1+ hours late every day. Management will not stand behind you for anything. If you upset a client and they want their money back, sucks to be you."
bad,Production standards always going up now at 100% and must be maintained or it out the door....stupid attendance policy....annual increase is next to nothing for busting your *** all year...but I do have to say as far as the company its self they do treat the employees good
bad,most days everyone is running around doing everything with little to no recolonization of all they do and it always seems like we are under staffed. I have learned a lot about different animals and their care as well are working with a team and acting like a manager without the title.
bad,"Upper management, district manager and above.  Completely out of touch with unrealistic expectations.  Payroll is not enough to get everything done.  Too much stress, and too many demands that effect your home life.  I was there for nearly 11 years.  I left because of management and the lack of support, and respect."
bad,"I loved working in the hotel as a pet care specialist at first, but very soon I realized that this company is not on the same side as their employees. I worked my way up and eventually became a senior associate within the hotel. Direct management was great, but anything above and corporate was a disaster. My specific district manager had no backbone and was one the worst managers I had seen in my time. "
bad,"Every store is different, and will depend on the managers at your location. I had serious issues with my store team, but there are plenty of stores that are awesome."
bad,"It was a very fun job to work at when i had my old boss, then we got a new boss and she didn’t know what she was doing and made the job very unpleasant. She made a lot of the workers upset and didn’t make herself approachable and wasn’t understanding at all."
bad,Worked hard and was promoted for effort.  Once was paid salary was required to work 60 hours a week or more since salary people don't cost more to overwork like their hourly people.  Overworked and underpaid.  Very corporate lifestyle.
bad,"Morning shifts, had to feed and walk boarded dogs upon arrival and then doggy day camp where you make sure dogs safely interact and clean up when they go to the bathroom and keep a log of it. Night shifts, had to take dogs out of camp, feed them dinner, and then clean the entire facility. Management is friendly, but not trustworthy. No time to sit, constantly on your feet. The dogs are always great to interact with."
bad,"Great place to work with animals. Work environment is usually laid back, and other staff is friendly and easy to work with depending on who you're working with. Always something to do."
bad,"I won’t even say it’s management it’s the company all together. If you go to other Petsmart’s it’s like that too. Now don’t get me wrong i love animals i love being around them the problem is the pay and the other employees. The managers don’t want to fire the ones who never show or do what they want yet the ones who do go out of their way to stay later, work harder, and work someone else’s shift on their off day gets no recognition. They don’t want to give FT hours nor pay you more. It’s like you’re forced to quit or find another job. I’ve talked to ones above me about training to be a stylist but i don’t even think i want to work for the company any more. It’s sad because i love and adore animals"
bad,"Management is very poor. Petsmart corporate enforces terrible requirements on management. District managers abuse their power not allowing employees to use rightfully earned vacation hours. Instances occur where people get accepted off for vacation but later are told that the manager changed their minds even after paying for said vacation because too many people requested off. It really feels like a middle school. Average wage employees (which is $9/hr) are forced to do manager specific tasks such as printing tags, overnight shifts which include taking down isles while cleaning and resetting them. When asking for a raise for a whole year, I was still denied it. Even after working both cashier and petcare while still doing overnights. Maybe my particular store was corrupted and this doesn’t reflect on the whole corporation but my experience was very poor and left me feeling used. "
bad,"I started off strong there. I enjoyed going to work. My team, managers, the environment. But over the last several years it has declined dramatically. The new customer discounts they rolled out where they take half the discount off the groomers pay is not ethical. Managers can package it anyway they like but it's not something I agreed to. And it adds up. Being told to work harder to make up for the loss of income isn't right. When the A/C broke last summer, it got well above 80F into the 90s and they made us work. They had us break policies left and right. And if we didn't, we were just being negative or complain too much. Salon understaffed? Grooming dogs and cats alone. Employee mishandling animals, on the cusp of abuse, they tell us they are handling it but it took months of reports of this person before they simply transferred her to another salon where she escalated to abuse and got fired. Want to leave? Don't tell them what salon you are going to. They will call the new job and threaten legal action if you bring any of your clients with you. "
bad,"Pay starts out terrible with a promise of 4 raises 3 months apart then yearly raises; I had to fight and fight to get just one while none of my co-workers ever saw one without promotion. Meanwhile management non stop gives you more and more to do; they are still piling new things on me weekly even a year and a half into the job. I'm doing the same amount of work as the petcare lead position while making $5 less. Too much cleaning up feces from all animals and having to attempt to respectfully gather a deceased animal after sickness or literally torn apart from being stressed with other animals. Customers treat you like garbage and question everything you tell them they're animal NEEDS because they think you're scamming them into buying stuff. Any customer that buys an animal will NOT research them so you must take 45 minutes out of doing the 100 tasks for the day to tell them what they have to buy, not make commission for the $300 you just made the store, then get yelled at for not getting all the tasks done. They wonder why there's an issue with people leaving after a month on the job."
bad,"I knew significantly more about the animals than my managers did. I proved it time and time again, yet they were constantly questioning and challenging me. Normally, I wouldn't mind questions and challenges, but they acted as if they knew more than I did at the cost of the animals' health. It was toxic at best. Right as I had to leave the store (relocation purposes), we got a new Pet Care manager who, from the week I spent with her, was a MUCH better and well informed manager."
bad,"The company doesnt stand behind their employees, customers are allowed to treat the employees terribly and constantly get free things for complaining. Commission based groomers get customers discounts taken out of their checks (senior and military discounts and any special going on)."
bad,"This is a good job to have while you are in high school or just graduated from high school or you want to move up in the company as a manager. Just being a cashier or an associate will not benefit you in the long run even if you are full time. They do not give you a raise annually like they initially tell you. Then a lot of the times employees quit or stop showing up to work, which means hiring new staff all the time. The store I worked at was always losing employees and hiring new ones. I was there for almost 5 years, I never got a raise and I worked hard because we were always short staffed."
bad,if you end up working here watch your back constantly. Management is horrible don't go to any of them for anything they will all get together and it will come back to bite you in the backside. HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,This was actually my first job at 18 and i worked there for about 6 years combined(left for 2 yrs and came back). I did almost everything but manage and groom dogs basically. Got bad pay and only told to hurry up by managers who did nothing but sit in the office all day. If your a true animal lover I definitely dont recommend. The places they order animals from have animals in horrible conditions and most come in sick or dead. Since we had a vet on staff we would try to treat them but we couldn't always give them what they really needed because everything goes by corporate rule and corporate has no idea what they're doing.
bad,really don't wanna talk about this job other then say it full of bull hate the job. all I can tell you is go work for them and youll see for yourself.
bad,"You don't leave a company, you leave bad managers, overall discounts for products was 15% occasionally you'd get 50% off some brands of dog food. was very happy when i had managers that cared and shared a mutual respect."
bad,"I've worked under 3 different store managers and only 1 was worth workin for, from the ungrateful attitudes forceful management and the lying aspect I've seen from that company. There were no incentives for the workers to show appreciation only management could make good money including bonuses most of the time management I worked under were buddy buddy with each other and did as they wanted.. the pay back then was not good at all for what had to be dealt with in most occasion struggled to even get back into work the next day. It took me 8 years to finally make over 10 bucks an hour. It's hard to say what I enjoyed workin for that company I stuck with it long as I could hoping for a better outcome each year, when I was released I just found out I was having a kid and the day I was fired the manager at the time told me it was because of a customer complaint at the time but also cause of a complaint 6 months before that one so I asked to show me the documentation which all complaints were filed on the computer and she told me she couldn't pull it up and didn't know how cause she would of had to look through a bunch of files which was a lie. The hardest part of that job was tryin not to walk out."
bad,theres no drama but its impossible to have any weekends off. If you want to be a dog groomer there is room to move up but if youre going to school at all its difficult.
bad,If you are looking for a job to give you 40 hours a week this is not it been working there for five months only seen 40 hours four time twice because I used vacation time the management staff tells you  only have to average a 100 for the week but if you try to only pull a just a 100 will wright you up for steeling time they will also try and take your bonus any way they can im looking for a new job.
bad,"While working in this position is pretty easy, management and the general atmosphere in the store is a big put-off.  Hours vary widely week to week and managers are not very helpful."
bad,hours were super inconsistent because i was “part time” and they wouldnt let me have a more set schedule. boring. people who have worked there longer can do whatever but if you do something they do you get in trouble. all cashiers/floor people/ pet department are part time only. have to clock on ON the dot ONE minute early or one minute late will get you in trouble
bad,"I did not make much with the hours I worked, nor was there any room for advancement. I tried to get more hours by taking on more task, but was not able to."
bad,Management time was not very good.  Many problems throughout the time I worked there.  They always tried to just hide problems instead of trying to fix them.
bad,"This job started out great then the company went private and they started having unreasonable expectations such as counting every customer, including children, and expecting you to turn them all into paying customers. "
bad,"The best part is all the animals. it can be fun at times and others not so much. the relationships you make with the animals and pet parents are the best, especially when you see a dog come in and they know who you are."
bad,"They don't reward loyal employees. Extremely small raises even with high review scores. Management does the bare minimum. corporate now only cares about the bottom line, not about pet and associate safety."
bad,"The hours were not great in that I could work only 8 hours one week (two four hour shifts) and others I worked closer to 30. Working at pet smart alone would defiantly not pay the bills or really even give you spending money. Management not supportive of their employees. They were quicker to punish what they saw instead of asking what happened to understand and treat correctly."
bad,"Safety rules loosely enforced, groomers causing injury due to poor and limited experience.   Add on packages are a customer RIP off, but heavily pushed."
bad,Ever since the company was bought out the Culture has went down. The Plans were not achievable and we had no help from corporate. Every week there was someone new there and they had no idea how to do there job...
bad,"While working in the PetsHotel,it became  the dogs were not treated correctly and it seems that everyone was so caught up in drama and creating divisions between people. Head manager of the Hotel Trelawny seems to be the only manager worthy of her position. I received threats and had horrible things said to me by all the other managers, specifically the store manager and assistant hotel leader. I got along well with the majority of my co workers, but we all felt the same way. They never stuck to hours, some weeks I'd be lucky to get 5 hours, the next they would have me working overtime up to 30 hours. Communication was really lacking also, it was hard to leave because I had become close to the regular pets and pet parents, but ultimately the treatment of pets and employees grew too bad."
bad,"this whole company is about micromanaging and streamlining animal care, maximum results minimum expense, they brag about how many stores they have but the animal care is atrocious, their employee treatment is abysmal, they're fish system is overly complicated, the fish quarantine system is worse, one tank to lump predatory fish, cold water fish, brackish fish and warm water fish together to treat any and all sicknesses (streamlined), no fish would leave that tank alive because of all the chemicals in the tank to treat various other fishes illnesses most of the reptile habitats are under equipped and too small. (beardies, snakes, tortoises and chameleons)"
bad,"Small space with lots of noise, placed right in the front of the store so everyone could watch you. Lots of pressure, multi-tasked like crazy. Never hired the right people, always just tried to fill positions."
bad,Ever since they went private it has been cut throat.  Managing by treats and not by positive reinforcement.  I liked the job but didn't like upper management.
bad,"During the time I worked at Petsmart many of the managers either didn't do their job correctly or didn't know how. I trained one of the managers for my department and believe he shouldn't have been hired in the first place. Many of the managers are petty or upset and take it out on the employees. I enjoyed working with and taking care of the animals, but it was hard for me to watch some of my coworkers mistreat them/injure them/kill them (all on accident). I met some great people working here, but I also met a lot of not so great people."
bad,Worked there in highshool and they worked around school hours. Got a new manager who started getting rid of everyone who already worked there. Instead of saying anything she just stopped scheduling me and when i asked about it said they were too slow to give me hours
bad,I had a bad time at PetSmart when it came to personal issues they were so rude and not understanding. the girls always tried taking your dogs so they had more dogs with more money
bad,"I would not recommend working in this position permanently but if you need income or a temporary job while in school it will pass for that. It is a low paying job for physically demanding and high paced work. My current manager hates her job and it shows she never wanted to be in that position. The perks though are that you get to work with dogs and it's not a mentally difficult job. Plus as a bather you avoid the drama groomers have to deal with, there is a lot of competition between groomers and management is harder on them."
bad,"My store leader picked whenever it was convenient for him to care about the pets verse customers. The company numbers are all they care about these days when it comes down to it, all they want is to look good. It is all a facade. Its painful when you care so much about the animals but when you were pulled away to do so many other tasks you cant keep up. Maybe it was just my store where leadership stunk, but it was not a good environment."
bad,"Typical day at work includes mostly pleasing customers under the scrutiny of the store manager. I have learned that under a good, respectful manager, I am able to perform MY managerial duties in a efficient fashion. Company cares more about money and quantity rather than quality and safety of pets."
bad,Retail jobs suck unless you are a kid who doesn't need to make ends meet. It was a great job for me when I was that age. The boss I had at the time was awesome and really tried hard to work with everybody's schedules.
bad,I loved my coworkers and my salon manager but the store manager would expect us to work like machines and had 0 experience with animals so when we would say a dog was not fit for grooming he would still tell us to do it
bad,"I love animals so I thought the hotel would be a great fit for me. In short, the job itself is great but the management makes it a terrible place to work. They try to express concern and support for those who feel they are being mistreated in the workplace or for those who witness animal abuse or similar situations, but when the time comes and you express concern, there are never signs of improvement. I, along with several other employees, have contacted the company provided for dealing with these situations and have never heard anything back. This company is driven by profit and nothing else. Customers are charged for services they don't receive or overcharged for services that should already be included for the well-being of the animals.Working here is almost shameful. Zero integrity, zero compassion."
bad,"I didn't enjoy it, the job was very suspicious. We did not make a form of payment for 3 weeks and I didn't get any of my pay until after I left. I didn't get paid the whole month I worked there."
bad,Working at Petsmart was absolute garbage. 2 out of 4 of the managers were verbally abusive. Pay was extremely low. Hours were constantly changing. And the customers were often dense and extremely rude. Never going back.
bad,"Not much to say. Pay sucked , benfits were ok , Lack of hours and lack of advancement opportunities. This job offered little. If you need a little extra cash then this is a great place for you ."
bad,"Management puts sales above pet care. I worked in the pet care department, the focus was always on sales above pet care and I was constantly pulled from my department."
bad,"Management here is not the best, they do not care about their employees, or the dogs they have come in. The rush your work. It like you are back in high school with the drama this job comes with"
bad,"A day in the life of the stock associate can either be slow or fast. This all depends on what need to be accomplished throughout the day. For example, if it is a truck day then the primary focus is the completion of the truck; this includes working out the product, putting away overstock and blocking the store. If the day is simply a fill day then the primary focus is fill the shelves and block shelves then provide assistance to customers."
bad,The first few years were informative and Petsmart was a great company to work for. I had exceptional managers and was promoted quickly. The last couple years i worked for Petsmart became very sad. Petsmart started firing long time managers at all stores and was sold to an investment corporation that changed how well Petsmart did business.
bad,"Squandered market leadership space in pet specialty with weak executive leadership leading to poor results the past several years.  Some really good corporate and operational staff, but weak from VP and up."
bad,"It was a good place to work.  Meant alot of people and helped with the pets.  Learned something new everyday.  "
bad,"petsmart is a good company to work for good benefits good hours."
bad,"Expectations are too high-hours are continually being reduced-they even decided to cut our bonuses because after they set the parameters, it was more than they wanted to pay-they have too many singular goals that are focused on...Sales, pet training classes, adoptions, salon, puppy kit books, and now traffic tracking!"
bad,"Great place to learn work experience, but no room to grow with in  the company. The store manager dose not give a great work environment always puts her employees on edge."
bad,"There is no clear attendance policy, hours for stocking are awful, will sometimes work 3 hours a day. they will work around your school schedule and are pretty understanding about family emergencies."
bad,"A mixture of cleaning the entire store and bathing pets all in a days work."
bad,Working at petsmart was fun depending on what you were doing. Working stock and mechandise was great. But the people that come into that store are horrible. And not to mention the horrible customer service that some of the employees give.
bad,"A typical day at work was calm always to me never to extreme, I was pretty familiar with cashier system and stocking wasn't so different from what I learned previously so it wasn't a hard day at work."
bad,"Worked there for nearly a decade. Never had an issue with any management until a new GM came in less than a month ago. She had no idea what she was doing as her old store ran on a different computer system. She asked for my help with multiple tasks, and I happily obliged. My knowledge and assistance became a threat to her and she fired me. No verbal or written warnings, nothing. PetSmart used to be an outstanding company to work for, they had high standards for their associates and managers and cared a great deal about their employees. Ever since the company was bought out it's gone downhill. My prediction is that the company will go under within five years."
bad,"Difficult to take full time- uneven shifts, low pay, variable management. I was lucky, then unlucky when management changed in that regard. Beats retail as far as minimum or near minimum wage jobs go. Work in daycare is a mental challenge after a while."
bad,"While the actually environment of the store in amazing, the expectations this company has on you to sell services being offered by unskilled and unqualified employees is a matter of personal integrity that I struggled with."
bad,I love the people at PetSmart! It is a great place to work if you are there for the people. The job security and advancement is a bit lacking and the management style was not too good. But it was still a very enjoyable job.
bad,"If you love pets and can put up with hectic surroundings, Petsmart is the place for you. You get to wash, dry, and brush dogs. You also have to stop what your doing and take care of walk-in nail trims or brushings. You as a bather are on the bottom of the totem pole.  Overall you work your butt off for not great pay, and work full time with not benefits. Other wise I would love working for Petsmart."
bad,When i first started out i loved my job. But there is very little room for advancement. I was lucky and did get advanced but once you are advanced to a higher position such as management all they do is work you like a dog. Your hours will never be consistent. One week you might open every day and the next you will only close or have a mix between the two.
bad,You go on and clean everything. Takig care of the dogs should be high priority but with all the work it is impossible.
bad,A usual day here is like working in a real life soap opera. I learned to trust no one because confidentiality means absolutely nothing to anyone. Most of the management team doesn't have to the training to do their jobs or teach anyone under them how to safely do theirs. Most of the associates there are just looking for a way to stab you in the back and take your position. The only good thing about working here is the excellent benefits package.
bad,"Customer service was key"
bad,"The store manager is the worst manager I have ever worked with in my entire working career.  She does not give any of her employees recognition, never chips in to help or praise anyone even when they go above and beyond their job.  Our new salon manager  is a pleasure to work with and she is trying very hard to get the salon and all of her workers to enjoy their jobs and gives us the recognition we deserve."
bad,"worked for the company for 9 years in the grooming salon, had only two good managers, throughout 6 different store. I was a salon manager for two of these years and was pushed around and told that the policies were there to protect the pets, but it was only to protect themselves. There were policies that did not make sense when dealing with animals in a grooming salon. Do not work for this company in California, they do not compete with the pay scale. I made more in Arizona than I did in California."
bad,"My particular store has its ups and downs like any other. I have worked at other locations, and I have liked other locations more than my current, but I do like what I do and it is not a bad place to work."
bad,"A typical work day within the salon, started with checking that all equipment is in good working order and that all the supplies necessary to complete each appointment were available. It is also important review the appointment schedule to make sure each dog has the appropraite time and stuff member. Throughtout the day I would be dealing with checking in appointments, insuring I understood what was required from both Pet Parent and dog. Completing the groom, taking into consideration, the needs of the dog, health and safety requirements and the needs of the owner. I would also book in apppointments over the phone and in person. Answering customers questions in regards to brushes, nail trimmer and clipper was also an important part of my possistion. It was necessary to establish a good working relationship with all team members to ensure that the levels of stress were keep to a minimum, the atmosphere is the salon has a direct effect on the behavour and welbeing of the dogs. The most challenging part of the role is balancing all the demards and interuptions and completing the groom within the agreed time. Meeting a well loved and behaved dog that belonged to a caring owner was the highlight of the day."
bad,"I was an employee for 4 years, they made it hard to actually enjoy our jobs, i love grooming animals its my passion but they were constantly making us pressure clients into things they didnt want to spend the money on or would force us to charge them for services whether they asked for them to be done or not. Also the salon manager was caught red handed stealing and under charging clients and was verbally abusive to all of her groomers and NEVER and i mean NEVER even got a slap on the wrist."
bad,I am very disappointed in how the managment team has done over the past couple months. They get away with EVERYTHING!
bad,Petsmart was short term for me but it was a ok place to work.
bad,"alot of heavy lifting and long distance traveling, 12 hours shift, very good job"
bad,Management can be very demanding and not at all supportive. Co workers are very cliquey and childish. Management does nothing in regards to discipline.
bad,"At my store, the store manager (paid salary) leaves an hour early almost every day. He plays favoritism, disciplines the good workers, and lets the bad workers get away with everything. He is constantly saying one thing, then turning around and saying or doing something that contradicts his prior decision. He never takes blame for his actions, instead, throwing the blame onto someone else, including but not limited to: selling animals for inappropriate habitats, voiding guarantees for animals instead of outright denying them, telling customers that the grooming salon is open later than they are, etc. I don't feel comfortable talking to him about ANYTHING, however, I also don't feel comfortable going to the District Manager about him. Besides the store manager, the pay isn't great. I'm working almost 40 hours a week and barely bring home $280 a week. If you are full time, you never have a weekend day off unless you are the store manager or pet trainer. You're expected to do 5 different things at once. If something doesn't get done, you will be blamed, no matter what. While the atmosphere and most of the employees are great, the pay, being the scapegoat, and feeling of unimportance isn't worth it."
bad,"The particular store that I worked at had terrible management. I worked in the salon. Everyday that our salon should have been enjoying our work day, it seemed as if we were wishing we were some place else grooming. New groomers did not get the training and one on one time that they deserved and experienced groomers within that company were highly under appreciated. My particular manager was never there to guide us and was always doing ""paper work"" in office while our seasoned groomers were trying to groom their dogs and teach the newer groomers how to properly groom. Busy or not busy, it was always our fault that we did not have enough dogs to groom on a day to day basis and they would let us know! Rewards were not as abundant as getting negative comments."
bad,Company going through organizational/management changes (not good ones). Staff did not receive salary of hours they were told they could receive during the interview. Benefits if you received a certain amount of hours which you only would if you were in management or the grooming salon.
bad,"Most managers were poor and unfit to be in the positions they were in. An image of being pet motivated people is set throughout interviews and training but it is seen through work there that the company doesn't care for its animals much. Do not work there if animal death will heavily effect Not the hardest job i've had but communication is lacking between managers and workers. "
bad,"As a petcare employee who usually worked opening shifts, my typical workday involved feeding animals, cleaning entire habitats (one set of habitats per day, e.g. small animals, birds, etc), and scrubbing fish tanks; additionally I was responsible for helping customers once the store was open, with anything from general advice to fulfilling a shopping list to selling animals. I did learn a lot working there, but it was extremely demanding, with upper management continually expecting more and more work done in a shorter amount of time, which inevitably (and unfortunately) leads to poorer care for the animals. Managers were generally unthankful and unsympathetic, and paid little or no attention to actual quality of care provided but only to deadlines being met. The hardest part of the job was by far the frustration at not having enough time to really do the job right every day. "
bad,"Working here started off wonderful. I enjoyed my duties, taking care of the animals always put a smile on my face and informing customers about the animals we carried was enjoyable. However, after a few months, it quickly turned sour. You learn fast that management plays favorites all the time. It is reflected in the way they treat you and on the schedule with how many hours you receive. If you call off even once you're no longer special to them. The pay is fair however I worked there for over a year and never received a yearly review or raise. Their turnover rate is also extremely high, in my last couple of weeks there at least 5 of my coworkers quit. The district manager doesn't care about the quality of care for the animals and is more focused on the customer service survey scores more than anything else. Overall I wouldn't recommend working here at all."
bad,"The schedule is great (3 days a week for 12 hours a day) but it’s constant drama and management is never satisfied with a your numbers, along with this you’re given unrealistic goals to meet and management will openly admit that they’re unrealistic but still take disciplinary action. I would recommend this job because it pays well and as long as you can ignore management it’s not a huge deal but I personally enjoy job security so it wasn’t for me."
bad,"at petsmart dc 38 the leadership team is terrible."
bad,I worked at Petsmart for three years from being on the floor to working my way into the salon. I won’t say all stores are bad. But mine was a horrible store
bad,"It was fun while it lasted. I was a bather. Started out at 12.50 last year and didn’t give me a yearly raise. Found out someone who got hired in at no previous experience got paid more than me. Manager of the salon was making sure one girl got the most dogs booked so she can take her 1,000 a week for her commission. Drama all around the salon and the managers outside seen the drama on the inside but did nothing about it."
bad,"You don't advance by being competent and honest, you advance by brown-nosing your superiors. I watched multiple people who were completely unqualified and/or clueless get promoted beyond their abilities. Hard work is rewarded with a pittance raise, usually less than 50 cents, during your yearly review. PetSmart does not give raises based on cost of living and will start you at minimum. If you work there several years, and minimum wage gets raised in your state, congrats, you make minimum wage again. New hires will then make more than you before long. Animal care is secondary to money. Sell sell sell."
bad,All they care about is selling. My last straw was when they sold a bearded dragon to someone who obviously wasn’t fit. She didn’t know about it or have any of the supplies and wasn’t going to buy any. She was going to go home and order (which would take at least 2-3 days if not more). My manager sold it to her anyways. She brought it back dead 2 hours later after leaving it in her car because she “thought it would like the heat” and my manager then gave her a full refund
bad,"Im an Early Morning Stocker and have worked at PetSmart for 2 Years. My start time would usually be at 4am and my teammates would be set at 5am and 6am respectively. Usually you'll be working with 2 people. The manager who comes in to check inventory and your Teammate. The manager needs to open the store so they come in at the same time as you. If you go In at the same time as your manager you'll first have to clock in than check if any price tags for the morning need to go out. you will than proceed to sweep the store, restrooms, than mop the important parts of the store while fixing anything that looks out of place or disorganized. You might have to replace the soap, toilet seat covers and toilet paper if the bathrooms don't have any. Than if everything goes smoothly and if the truck is on time your manager will offload the truck and get the pallets ready for you to pick up and take them on the sales floor to work.  Load days are Tues, Thurs, and sun. Thursdays are the biggest load so most likely you'll have an extra person coming in to help at 6AM. Now that the loads being moved out It should be 5am and your teammate just clocked in and is helping you stock. You work from 5am to 6am doing load than take your break. since the stores censors turn on around 7am you'll want to be inside the store before depending on what time your break is. 6am, 7am, 8am. around 7am your last hour you will be putting out inventory. It sounds easy and its supposed to be, but managers want you to do everything at half time or less and everything has to be perfect."
bad,"The job itself is a good job. It’s fun and rewarding. It can be stressful at times. The management and lack of training makes he job tedious. As an employee of nearly three years, I have to do much more than I’m paid for."
bad,"Management is always on different pages, they are always low on pay roll so they are always cutting down your hours or trying to get you to leave early. Employees aren’t listened to. Overworked and under paid. Only pro is the fact that you’re around animals all day"
bad,"Petsmart has unrealistic expectations from their groomers. Forces more work on you than you can handle, which stresses you out & raises the chances of incidents but yet they preach safety & threaten constant write ups if you don't get everything done. The company doesn't care if their store managers are horrible to the employees. Worst store manager I have ever worked for is still employed there even after multiple HR calls from multiple employees that ended up just quitting because the company won't step in to stop the constant rude & spiteful treatment."
bad,"As much fun as it is to see and play with all the dogs that come in, the two top managers are horrible and have gone weeks without giving me any hours. They’re cold, distant and overall not fun to be around. Whenever I actually DO get hours, I hope to be working with the nicer lower managers so I don’t need to put up with the other ones. If you want to work at Petsmart, pick a different location"
bad,"While a Petsmart I was able to let my creativity shine as a Pet Groomer. I was able to build personal relationships with the clients"
bad,"I’ve worked with pretty good managers, and terrible managers there. The biggest problem is they are an incredibly cheap company and leave no room for advancement,  because they would rather save money and just give the person in that position twice as much work load and just  give them a slight bump in pay. Very slight. They ask way too much for what they pay, and do not help you in any way from the top. If you’re lucky, your direct manager may help with some stuff, but then you realize they give them an unrealistic amount of work load also, so you can’t blame your team. To sum it up in a short way, let’s just say they’re a multi billion dollar corporation, and I have been trying for 4 years for it to not be super warm in my department... it’s not a place you want to be overly warm in, creating unnecessary stress. But the temperature is controlled from a different state, and it has yet to be handled after multiple phone calls and back and forth. That should give you a small hint as to what goes on... except it’s with everything, and bigger things also."
bad,"Poor management all around. They only want to focus on pumping out grooms to make as much money as possible, they don't care about the people or the pets themselves."
bad,"I loved my job. Working with animals is my passion and I planned on doing it for the rest of my life. I learn a lot working in the Grooming Salon at PetSmart. I learned how to train dogs, bath, and groom them. I also learned that management is horrible and even if they are wrong you are punished. My Grooming Manager was a person who did the bare minimum. She had a high turn over rate. She acted like she was friends with everyone then stab them in the back. She lied and fired anyone who became a better groomer then her. NEVER become a Groomer with this company. They train you wonderfully but its not worth the stress and pay."
bad,"Playing with the dogs is fun, but if you're constantly in the playroom, it gets boring very quick. The dogs seem very bored, most of them didn't want to play, and a lot of them cried. They don't get to go outside, so I feel bad for the ones who are there for a long time. You're also on display. All the customers can watch you, and can irritate the dogs by banging on the glass. Staff was nice for the most part, but there weren't a lot of us when needed. The management wasn't nice and drained everyone of their moral. So, if you like stagnant jobs that endanger you (being bitten, dealing with hazardous materials, bodily fluids, etc.) for minimum wage, then maybe you'll like this one."
bad,Typical day was you book you dogs and bath and dry and trim nails and then day you would get so slammed and stressed.you had to make sure the dogs were smelling good and looking good
bad,"It was hard work and depending on management it can either be good or bad, do your research and see where the best managers are and then you will find a great place to work"
bad,"Too much work for the liitle pay, to many rules that should not matter."
bad,A typical day here is full of stress. Usually overbooked and struggling to get through the day. On a day with clients you already know it does go well. Usually days like those go by like a breeze. Working in the grooming salon is much like being in high school. The most enjoyable part is working with the dogs and seeing how happy customers can be. Plus they tip!
bad,Petsmart was a hard-working job.  Working from four in the morning until 11 in the morning is not exactly an easy thing and for me it was quite an experience although I personally feel that was me that field this company. The job itself was not easy.  I personally learned a lot from this company as far as organizational skills and how to be able to use my time in a viable manner.  My only issue with this company was the fact that I just did not or could not for that matter be able to keep up with the workload as it was a lot of heavy lifting and I was overweight at the time.  Because of this I thought I was not a good fit for this company this company was nice enough to bring me back even when I decided to leave.
bad,"Perhaps it was my location, but the managers feel like they can step on you however they want. The job is fine but the way they constantly push you is stressful. When you try talking to them, they brush it off without helping. If you request time off or call out, management and coworkers get very upset."
bad,"Was let go for obtaining pink eye and brought in a doctors note stating I could not work the hours I was set due to an emergency, I felt the manager was being a little insensitive and not understanding."
bad,I only stayed because of the people I was working under. Few benefits for part timers and little respect. I would not have stayed at this company if it were not for my coworkers.
bad,Petsmart is an OK place to work. For a part time job or even a first time job. Would not recommend for a long term job. Higher up management does not resolve issues.
bad,"Petsmart is a great place for a teenagers first job, but if your are management things play quickly into politics and the backstabbing is increcredible."
bad,"This was my first full time job. I loved seeing the puppies and kittens and all the different animals."
bad,"Orderfilling is a very stressful job. You get moved from racks to the mod. Extremely fast paced. Expect 100% production at all times. If you take a bathroom break, it severely affects your production time (and the bathrooms are across the warehouse). They do not give you time for switching job functions which causes a decrease in production stats. Drop off for orders are even timed which is difficult if there is a lot of traffic, if the orders are light (because they don't like to come off of the PIT forks), or if no one visibly labels the order lines because you can't see the number of the store you have to drop on which line so you have to get off of your lift to go search for the correct line to drop in. You get very little time to complete orders. They do not give you downtime for some of the things that are the managements fault like switching job functions, no tasks, having to pull boxes to complete orders, switching lifts, etch."
bad,"The management, both at a store level and corporate level is what's going to make or break your job. If you're working there part time it's ok but if you plan on making it a career you should probably go somewhere else. I was never offered advancement and people outside of the company were hired to glide through my job and advance. After much upset I caused at multiple levels nothing was done. Not to mention those who were hired at my job with no experience were hired at a higher hourly wage than me who had been working there for years."
bad,If you love animals this is a great place to work. If you would like to become a groomer there is full time position available with benefits after they have sent you to grooming school for a month in which the company pays for. The catch is you must stay with Petsmart for 2 years .
bad,This was a great place to work up until 2010. The focus towards the bottom line caused a cultural shift that makes it unbearable for associates. Upper management is quick to inform employees of their expendable worth and your family obligations mean nothing to them. You are a number and their profit work horse.
bad,"Poor management, very stressful. Not a pleasant place to work.Great benefits, Great co workers. I was always closing. Not a good life/work balance.Learned to close store and a lot about the care of animals."
bad,But once that is done get out fast and find somewhere private to work. The whole fish bowl zoo animal type atmosphere drove me crazy with people watching me through the glass on the regular.
bad,Great job for somebody looking to make some cash. Management is poor while i was working and made it hard to enjoy work or look forward to going.  Fun job based on tasks at hand.
bad,You walk into work and everyone there is super kindly and have all the same interests. You really get to connect with customers as the job environment is outstanding. Management is just a huge problem. They don't care about job security at PetSmart and good managers tend to get let go while other moody managers come in and bring down the spirit of the team members.
bad,"Working at PetSmart started out great, but quickly went downhill. After the company was sold they just stopped caring and became a very money oriented company. Everything they did was how they could make more money and there was no care about the animals in their care. They have become very task oriented to the point where there is more work than hours given to complete the task. They have unrealistic expectations, for example we may have a total of 35 hours in store resets, plus trucks and all the merchandising activities that they require and we will only be given 55 hours to complete everything. That is not even enough hours in a week to have two people to work all of those tasks. The culture is a huge popularity contest, and promotions are done based on who likes you instead of how well you do your job. If you are not someone that is liked in the store they are to bully and harass a person until they quite. If you are in management you will be hourly unless a store leader and many times the expectation is to work 6 days but only get paid for 40 hours. On average you will work about 46 hours but not get paid for the other hours because they make you take a little bit longer of a lunch or have you come in a little late another day to cut out the overtime. Hardest part about the job is to hit the unrealistic goals or get wrote up for not hitting the goals. Some of the requirements for cashiers is to sell puppy guides which the coupons are only good for people with puppies and very difficult to get your money back on unless you are buying all new items for the puppy, getting"
bad,it too fast pace rate was to hard to meet you will hate every minute work at this place you will will always be getting yelled at to work faster have to stay two hour every day make your day from 10 hours to 12 every day it hot so you all was in stop get water what ends up slowing you down and killing your rates
bad,"Starter job, no room to advance quickly, pay is less than offered at local fast food establishments.  Pay raises not acceptable, discussing pay leads to termination."
bad,"Moves you all around too much, spent most days cleaning, stocking, or cashier. always have to ask for emails from customers and they dont give them to you"
bad,The benefits given by this company is remarkable.  Unfortunately that does not compensate for the lack of job security.  Associates and supervisors are fired at an alarming rate.  Don't count on retiring from this company.
bad,"Stressful,management is rude and clueless. Working hours constantly get changed, managers are contradictory in the things they say. Expect to get yelled and treated poorly by employees on a daily basis."
bad,"The managers have poor commnications skills within each other. the employees are always late or calling out, they can't deny a sale so the improper pet goes to an improper owner just so they won't call corporate. some of the habitats are not suitable for specific pets."
bad,"Loved the job until the company went private. The whole culture of the company seemed to change. They claimed that it was all about taking care of the customer, but failed to give us the resources to accomplish the task."
bad,"This job offers good relationship with animals and pet parents, but I think that the management needs to be fair with the employees. Sometimes there is lac of communication, and there is no opportunity of growing more in the company."
bad,Depending on your job title the tasks vary in difficulty but i must say merchandising and stocking for PETSMART is the worst. They pile on the tasks with little hours to complete. The job itself is very labor intensive even if you're a manager. Being semi fit to very fit is a must as you need to lift 5lbs-50lbs of dog food/cat litter continuously. Various overnight shifts intertwined with early mornings makes it extremely hard to balance a sleep schedule. You can work an overnight and get out in the AM and they call that day your day off. I enjoy the merchandising part of it. Petsmart does their own inline resets which i enjoy doing as well as seasonal merchandising. Raises are unfortunately given based on a combination the stores performance and metrics as well as your own performance so even if you feel like you've been performing at your peak and your store does not your raise can be 10 cents to 25 cents if you're lucky.
bad,"Please note: While at PetSmart Charities, PetSmart Inc. was bought by a group of private investors. There were many layoffs in PetSmart Inc., and in November of 2015, all positions in PetSmart Charities were eliminated. We were given the opportunity to apply for the new jobs in the organization which I did. During the time in my new job, they were still hiring multiple positions and trying to fit in with the new organization and management."
bad,"I worked here as a high school student. I was unimpressed with the management of the store, as they were mostly people whose only experience was working at petsmart. They had no leadership. But the pay was good, and the work was easy. It was always sad to watch the animals pass away."
bad,"Worked here for 5 years and never felt appreciated. They care more about making a buck than what the associates can physically do. managers and corporate try to force upselling which isn't bad but it's bad when you blame the associate for not forcing someone to get the upsale. There are some good things about this company like benefits and an be a stable job, and you can get training for different things. If you have bad managers, for one corporate doesn't listen or care (even when they say they will) if they and rude or do in appropriate things. it will also drive you to the point of insanity because they don't care if you have a family or social life."
bad,"It was a great job at first, then they changed management to a woman who had no clue what she was doing. Other than that I would say that this was a wonderful Part-time position"
bad,The management is out of control. They seem to have no idea what they are doing and it makes the job more stressful then it should be. My co-workers are awesome and fun to be around but there can be some drama. The hardest part of my job is dealing with dogs who do not cooperate or are aggressive. The best part of my job is seeing the satisfied faces of the customers when they see their pet.
bad,PetSmart is an O.K. place to work if you enjoy helping people with their pets and can ignore the fact your coworkers are rude and the management not very helpful.
bad,if you are not a salon employee or manager u will not make over 300 a week full time and they have cut 5 positions that in the past would have left room to advance since those are gone only way to move up is if someone at a manager position quits or moves up in the company.i am a current employee and put my 2 weeks in recently couldn't do t anymore not worth stand i would never re-apply
bad,"Depending on the day, first thing in the morning small pets, or birds, or reptiles would have their cages cleaned.  Fish would be fed and then a certain set of fish tanks would be cleaned per day.  After that is done, we are to sell pets and answer questions and concerns by pet parents."
bad,"everyday was the same day non-stop and never really had a day off. only because either call in, no shows and always working double shifts. learning and understanding new challenges everyday was plus. Management was ok but always put there work on others to try to get the credit. but communication skills towards employees was below average. never really strict on them. the hardest part of the job was correcting everyone mistakes. towards the store and customers. the best part was making customers happy and showing  that I cared about the values and needs towards the customers and there pets."
bad,The job was fairly easy but there were many policies that you were not made aware of that they used to terminate people.  They play favorites.  One person would sit and do nothing all day and get a rate over the minimum required and someone else that wasn't friends with management would work as hard as they could and still not make the required rate necessary to keep their job.
bad,"This job has decent benefits, but very poor management skills, and know room to grow! When you first start, they sell you hope and dreams but as time goes on, its really no room for good opportunity!"
bad,"Honestly, its eh. To me its not a career but to others it may be. Where i am at there is not a whole lot of room for advancement. They like to to hire and promote outside of the company. So unless you you are the the of person who would be okay/comfortable not moving up then it might be for you."
bad,"A typical day at work would normally be a 4 or 5 hour shift.  It consisted of making appointments for dogs to be either groomed or bathed, bathing dogs, and performing maintenance tasks.  It taught me a lot about time management because I only had 2-3 hours to work on the dogs.  If a pet parent came in with 4 dogs, they all had to be done in 2-3 hours.  Some dogs took 45 minutes and some took the full 3 hours.  When I started working, the salon manager was in the process of transferring to another store.  He/she was only there for a few weeks when I got there. There was no salon manager for the majority of the time I was there so I had to learn most of the tasks either by myself or from the other salon associates.  The management was rather poor.  The store manager would threaten to fire the employees instead of simply telling them that they weren't doing their job correctly.  The training was poor as well.  I wasn't trained to my full extent by a manager.  My co-workers were very helpful.  They basically trained me and we acted as a team in the salon.  No one had a specific job; we all pitched in to clean and make appointments and pick up slack.  We were like a family.  The hardest part of the job was the time management because I had never had a job that gave me a time limit to perform my job.  By the end of the job, time management was no longer an issue of mine.  The most enjoyable part of the job by far, was working with the animals.  We would have regular customers come in to have their dogs bathed or groomed so it was a joy to see the pet parent and an even greater joy"
bad,Depending on location and management Petsmart can be a very fun and educational place to work. Its great to gain some experience however after a couple of years of being there you will probably burn out and look for something new.   policy
bad,"I just was forced to quit my job here at petsmart out of the blue. I had no idea why I was there at 6am called into the office. I was told that I ""Called in too many times"" I only called in 3 times and that it wasn't ""good for the company"". Explained reasons why 1 time called a week ahead of time to remind them I had school the days they scheduled me then I made sure I reminded them before that so that way I got my schedule taken care, was never taken care of at all I was being called where I was. 2nd time because I was really sick had the stomach flu then the 3rd time I called because I got into a wreck which where my car wasn't drivable and I didn't have a ride to get to work. They even put against me where I called to say I was going to be a few minutes late. He didn't care whats so ever, also we had in and out manager, bad experience at the grooming saloon for almost 90% customers were upset. I was told that since I had a ""bad track record I could either quit or be fired the decision is up to me depending what looked good on my resume."" I barely got my 15 minute breaks I had to ask for them because they forgot, they also forgot to almost give me a lunch until I reminded them that I had to get one. The co-workers that I worked with were amazing, pets were always happy, customers I couldn't complain about its just the whole management."
bad,Constant changes to LM standards made this a difficult place for most to keep up. This lead to an extremely high turn over rate. Most Leadership had very little experience in the methods and procedures required for the task at hand. Also they refused to take any advice or ideas to improve the company and create any job security. Outdated and in some cases dangerous equipment.
bad,"I started with petsmart one year ago as a dog bather. The work is hard, hot, and stressful. They expect the bathers to do a large amount of dogs no matter what temperament. My coworkers were so helpful and friendly though! Corporate pushes hard to move bathers into grooming positions, even if you don't wish to be a groomer. I didn't, so I was moved to a cashier. My hours dropped when this move happened. Coworkers where great again, helpful and cheerful. Management was fair and also helpful. The customers where friendly almost all of the time, and I truly enjoyed the work! "
bad,"Spent the early hours stocking shelves and cleaning, once doors opened I interacted with costumers and made sure their experience was enjoyable."
bad,"worked part time as a dog bather. Learned how to assess the overall condition of a dog and well as basic groming techniques. Management and co workers were friendly and helpful. The job was physically demanding, standing and bending all day. Enjoyed seeing the satisfied looks on the customers faces when they came to pick up the beloved pets."
bad,"it was good until the day I got the job. after that management left new ones came in changed a lot no team work or effort no help bad reviews online till this day, still runs poorly no team effort... I don't have supplies to clean when i ask for them.. ect..."
bad,"They expect alot from you, this is not at all a laid back job, and you might not get trained fully. Training takes longer the most places too, alot of tests and videos, along with exercises in the training book they provide."
bad,They pay is terrible for the amount of work you do. There is no real chance to earn more unless you work to the point of constant stress. It is fun working with the dogs though.
bad,"At one point PetSmart was amazing: a focus on developing great leaders and a very cooperative enviroment. I grew a lot. But that all ended about 5yrs ago and every year we have been expected to do more work less subtitles I no longer feel I was given the tools required to succeed. When dealing with animal care, there comes a point when further cuts become unacceptable and i couldn't expect my team to provide a level of care that I was comfortable with"
bad,petsmart has good and bad points like any job the hours are bad usually only 16 hours a week for part timers no benefits unless your full time. The only good thing are the people you’ll work with and most leaders are completely useless the company itself isn’t bad it’s the store leaders that hold you back.
bad,"fun to interact with diffent types of pets. can see anything from bearded dragons, to parrots, to puppies! "
bad,Used to be about the pets the company is now directed into making the metrics. Work life balance as a manager is nill. I was talked about negatively while I was morning.the loss of my husband by my superior.
bad,"Typical day was coming in at 5 or 6 AM, open the store and do computer work, make the daily schedule, open drawers, then shoot consumables holes and part of hardgoods depending on the day. No help typically, so very stressful to get all of this done on time. Then typically short staffed all morning, so it was mostly getting pulled away to help customers, while attempting to get Planograms set, pricing done, and a million other additional tasks payroll didn’t account for. Never enough stocking hours, and it was made clear that stocking was a priority, but then nothing else would get done and customer service would suffer. I’ve seen this position destroy 2 others, and now it has destroyed me. My team was awesome for the most part, some of my best friends, but the position is extremely stressful and not worth the pay. Health insurance is expensive and not even worth it. No one would help with my department because they were all in the same boat, with too much to do. Company needs to figure itself out, and I’m tired of waiting. Too many dumb misteps and focus on apps and computer programs that barely work. Nobody here is not stressed out on the daily. Good job for part time college kids, and that’s about it."
bad,You have to white to be offered any type of lead position first.If you’re a POC then you’ll get whatever is lying around if that A job maybe for teens
bad,"Great place to work and love it, they have a lot of employees and don't give anyone very many hours.  The most hours I have had is 28, and some weeks I get 8 hours.  This is why I am looking for a different job."
bad,"Min wage job, you will get hours if you want them, co-workers were somewhat ornery but no one was too bad, manager and most people there were positive and nice. They give you plenty of chances to advance your job title and even do training in the dog grooming salon, if you want to groom dogs. The job itself is honestly terrible though, I started working there simply liking dogs well enough to do the job. I was not prepared for the horrible non-trained dogs people brought in there however. Insane all-hours of high pitched barking, dogs fighting, dogs eating other dog's feces and vomit, other dogs biting you, dogs constantly trying to knock you down, pulling so hard on leashes they choke themselves... and the rooms they're in...no matter how hard everyone tries to clean everything up...it smells so bad. There was not a work day that went by that I wasn't gagging at something disgusting. One day a 100lb dog jumped on me trying to get out the door and scratched the my arm very badly with his hind feet. I actually have scars on my hands and arms from people's horrible dogs. This job -no word of a lie- made me HATE dogs. Only take a pets hotel job if you love dogs more than life itself... cause you will not be in the cat room for more than 10 minutes to clean the litters."
bad,"I love animals, but this job was a bit messy at times. Also, the managers could be rude but you had to learn to laugh it off like you were unbothered. Scheduling is a mess and the pay wasn't the best. Overall 2/5."
bad,This company has little room for advancement and growth. Pays well and a good learning experience. I worked for 9 years and was an assistant store leader the entire time.  I maxed out in my pay band and they found someone to do my job for less money so I was let go after 9 years of employment. It was very disappointing and upsetting to see the poor management skills of upper management handle the situation the way they did.
bad,Once PetSmart was no longer a public company.  The values of the company themselves changed and are no longer focused on the pets and pet parents.  Just the opposite of what you would have expected
bad,"poor managment, no support from management, its a place where if there is promblem people turn the other way, dont do anything about it. and them point fingers."
bad,"I was excited to work at Petsmart as I love animals. The customers were awesome, but the management was very poor. It was like you didn’t really matter. They were there to get a paycheck and didn’t seem to care about anything else. They picked favorites and gave very little to no hours to the ones they “didn’t like”. They promise things to you in an interview and those promises never happen. They made it a very stressful work environment. The store seemed super cluttered all the time, animals didn’t seem to be cared for as much as they should be (some were even dying), and fellow co-workers were lazy. Overall it’s a good place to work if you’re looking for a first time job, but if you’re looking for something to make money to pay bills, this job isn’t the one for you. You’re better off at McDonalds where you can actually advance to better opportunities."
bad,I learned more about customer service and how to deal with tough decision making in a short matter of time. I also learned how to bathe dogs and do a haircut based on parents needs and wants.
bad,"It was a very stressful job at times, very quick paced and most days tended to be short staff with working staff members having to pick up the remainder of the responsibilities on top of doing their own tasks."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job because it is extremely stressful and I don’t feel that they level of pay accurately reflects the work that I do. I have also not seen any opportunity for advancement in my position.
bad,"An average day is fast paced and packed. I usually cared for three dogs at a time in a three hour time period and two near the end of my shift. Customers can be extremely nasty and there were multiple accounts of sexual harassment from customers. When the offenders were asked to leave, they would get upset and were then given free items and grooming. Getting bitten and attacked by dogs is fairly normal and you are expected to continue with your work. If you report another employee mishandling an animal, you are written up or transferred to another store."
bad,Some areas are highly over worked and you'll most likely have to work through your breaks including lunch. Proper training is key or it's just an uphill battle.
bad,"I can only speak for the store I worked at, as a company PetSmart gives benefits and fair pay. Although the management was awful and ultimately the reason I quit. They push you beyond your limits and do not care about personal needs. Its all about making as much money as possible and making sales plan."
bad,"Pretty good job overall, I just got upset with corporate stuff- like my manager had changed 3 times during my time there. "
bad,"Very few hours, lots of misleading, poor management. I applied to be a bather\ groomer got put in pet care for two weeks and then landed on register and haven't left since. Email capture is more important than it should be. Petsmart is the only company that hasn't appreciated my experience or work ethic."
bad,This job was a decent place to work for. Fun environment around animals and working in all departments. They definitely use you for everything they need help with.
bad,"Company is great to work for. They give plenty of vacation and sick days to employees(full time and part time) and give full benefits, and are flexible with hours and requests off. Management however is a different story. Managers would regularly not show up for shifts, or were late. Employees were given preferential treatment and there was zero accountability with employees. With the right management I would highly recommend petsmart"
bad,I would never work there again I didn't not have a good work experience. The company is so much about making money they treat you as a number not as a person. no
bad,"Low hours, poor management, open door policy was not true, dangerous workplace, over worked and underpaid, best part of working there was seeing the animals everyday, managers don’t back you up with customer complaints"
bad,New management is horrible. You can’t advance if you don’t suck up to them. They don’t value their hard workers. They constantly get rid of jobs positions and they do not offer any lateral moves if your job is taken away.
bad,The hardest part of the job was being harassed daily by supervisors and other associates. The environment was terrible the supervisors were dealing drugs not to mention dating some of the girls. There was good people out there too a lot of hard workers. Main thing I learned from this job is be amazed anything can happen. Saw this women in her late 50's doing same job as me and it was hard but she did it was awesome.
bad,"Early morning stock position tended to be understaffed, hours were minimal, no benefits, and management didn't seem to care about anything besides trucks being unloaded by a certain time."
bad,"Usually busy days, sometimes if you're lucky you will get the right amount of breaks you're suppose to, alot of drama and associates talk to much about there personal lifes. Management complain alot and can put off a rude vibe. Hardest part of the job is trying to do the work you're suppose to do on top of customers and on top of being told to do other things by management. Enjoyable part of the job is working with the animals. You remember customers after awhile and they remember you which is nice."
bad,"super busy environment, customer service experiences needed, animal care experiences needed, management could be improved, the hardest part is of the job is not being able to express your rights as an employee and super underpaid"
bad,"Grueling pace, laughable payroll, abysmal work/life balance, poor leadership at home office has no concept of what actually happens in a store daily."
bad,Money's o.k. I would try to get into the petcare dept. or cashier. The workload in my opinion is too much if you as a stocker. Management isn't great and probably shouldn't be managers.
bad,Most Days were good and other days not so good. I learned not to get involved with others at work. Management could not get our schedule right and would change it without telling you to suit her. It was a stressful job and others you worked with also were getting very stressed out.
bad,"The work day depends on the day."
bad,I left this company because of the SL. They were always talking down to the store associates. They also did some sneaky stuff to get another person who worked within the store fired. The plus to this job is seeing all the animals. It all just depends on the management and if they want to help you or hurt you.
bad,"Multi-tasking between being on the phones when the call volume is higher than usual,, and processing back office work to ensure orders are being processed correctly. I've learned to have more patience at this company than any I've ever worked for in the past. Management is poorly constructed at this company, and empty promises are made rather frequently. My co-workers make the day for me, I have great relationship with most of the people I work with. These people make work worth coming too."
bad,"A typical day at PetSmart in the grooming salon as a bather was exhausting. On top of having 8+ dogs to groom (expectations were 16 dogs, 2 every hour), bathers are also responsible for ALL the walk-in services (each ranging 5-10 minutes to do), so all in all, a bather would be handling 20+ dogs a day. I have learned a great deal working with pets while working at PetSmart. I have learned the how to keep up on health on pets health well as learning new things about pets that I would have never known. The management of PetSmart is either a hit or a miss. You have some managers who don't follow safety protocols at all (and even gets defensive when confronted about it) to managers who have dealt with so much, that they are at the point of not caring what customers have to say or corporate has to say. My co-workers in the salon, though, were the best group of people I have ever worked with. We always had something to talk about, to joke about, to laugh about and to cry about. Everyone was there for each other when needed, and the help was there when I needed. The hardest part of my job was the high expectations. Groomers made 50% commission, but I was hourly. Therefor, PetSmart was expecting me to do the most work. Well, a typical store has 4-6 bathers on their teams. I was the only bather for my store, so my workload was always a workload meant for four bathers. In perspective, in 4 days, I did $1,550 in sales, more than groomers did in 5 days. But as my salon manager always said, I'm a rockstar and did it all. The most enjoyable part about my job was working with Animals, helping"
bad,"was a fun and rewarding business to work, down fall was it was conceiving in the care of pets , and did not provide all the services in the pet hotels that was paid for by customers."
bad,"A great place to work, working with the customers is usually a great experience. It was also helpful that I was able to be cross trained to all the departments."
bad,"The structure of a solid company may be in place, but the lack of hours to perform the expected daily tasks sidetracks from the main goal of customer service.  The love of pets is evident by workers and customers, but it gets overtaken by the thought that even while doing the right thing one day, it could be perceived as wrong the next.  That's hard to handle for most people."
bad,I loved this job when I first started but with time and management changes the job became less about the dogs and more about the money.
bad,"Typical day at work was every day retail environment. Dealing with customers, but also the added upkeep of small animals, fish, and reptiles/birds."
bad,"PetSmart has good compensation and benefit programs. However, many managers do not want to do more and stay in a position that they are comfortable in and never move or get moved from location to location because they are a problem in multiple other stores. Managers that have no business being in positions of influence over others are kept in place and then they are allowed to have many complaints made about them and when the complaints reach a point that they are made to corporate nothing is done. The hours are less than favorable, they are very random, ranging from start times of 2:30 am during the week to 5 pm on a Sunday. The best part of the job was working with the animals and helping the customers on a daikly basis."
bad,"We worked revolving shifts from 7:00 am to 3:30 pm, 11 am to 7:30 or 12:30 pm to close. Co workers were very nice and everyone helped each other. We had fun and everyone got along and we were a good team."
bad,"Stuck behind a register all day and even when i ask for things to do they say no, on my 3month review i didnt get my 10cent raise because my manager said i never trie to pursue other activities and i just stood behind the register, um NO i asked all the time for extra work YOU wouldnt give me anything else to do, and you can only clean the windows SO many times."
bad,"Been there for 3 years and every day I ask myself why I’m still here. Company only cares about making money and pleasing the customer. Does not care about animals or employee happiness. Will never respect or listen to employees side if there is a customer disagreement. Terrible at scheduling, does not offer you full time but will work part time employees 39.9 hours so you can’t get any full time benefits . Working with the animals is fun but you are over worked and typically under paid. Competitive salary makes everyone very upset and some people get paid unfairly"
bad,"When I first started at PetSmart, I was really excited and that quickly left after the first month or so. I mean ya they teach you some basics but you could learn that elsewhere. I worked in the salon as a dog bather and thought about going to grooming school but after hearing that you have to sign a two-year contract I decided not too. I was always looked down on because of that and not treated fairly. Corporate is terrible. Some of the coworkers are nice and were a big reason why I stayed for so long."
bad,"I enjoyed the job, don't get me wrong. However, the longer I stayed in pet care and saw the condition that these animals came to us in broke me. They kept syrian hamsters in groups (syrian hamsters will kill cage mates), did not provide proper diet, had so many ringworm and wet tail outbreaks, and we had ""lost"" multiple reptiles just for their corpses to  be found under buckets in the back."
bad,Managers will stalk social media pages of employees to see if they are hanging out with other employees out side of work environments. Will show favoritisms towards employees who have 0 motivation to help customers and management will confide with work drama and add to a underlining problem rather than fix the issue.
bad,"Management is lacking. Early morning stocking is easy but during the day you are required to sell coupon books and training classes and whatever else is chosen as important at the time, with little incentive to do so. I worked at stores that were great and the people supported each other but I've worked for other petsmarts that were every person for themselves kind of places. Customers can range from pleasant and fun to talk with to Yelling in your face because you are out of shredded turkey cat food. You do get to see animals everyday and full time benefits are nice. How much you enjoy your job, workplace culture, and typical day entirely depend on how good your management team is."
bad,"Just when it comes to your one-year evaluation, raise, and benefit qualifications, they tell you that because they required you to start part-time for 6 months, you had to be put in as seasonal. Time spent working as seasonal does not count towards your company time to qualify for a raise or benefits. Also, tuition reimbursement is only for advancing up the PetSmart ladder, which from what I have seen, does nothing because they prefer to higher from outside the company rather than within."
bad,Unfortunately I just had to deal with poor management. Other than that the only real issue here is rude customers and dealing with dogs passing away..
bad,Not a big fan after management change. I loved working there until I stopped getting breaks and started getting told I would be there one in trouble for it even though it's the scheduling causing it
bad,"They want you to spend the rest of your life as a groomer, if you go through there grooming academy they own you for 3 years now. When you want to leave they act like you are betraying them and everything they've done for you. Job security is nice but only because they don't want to train a replacement. The pay is good but the drama hardly makes it worth is. They are pretty quick to blame the groomer for anything that goes wrong with the hair cut. For example if you can't trim the nail because they dog is biting and stressing out they will blame you for checking it in in the first place."
bad,"I worked for Petsmart as a groomer for a little over a year with mixed opinions by the end of my time there (also based on this particular salon). "
bad,"Once the new owners took over Petsmart, they began cutting a dangerous amount of hours. This resulted in more pet injury incidents, and more employee injury incidents. The new policies put in place made it very clear that the only objective was to pocket more money, with the customers and employees directly suffering."
bad,I loved the job. Hated management. The hours sucked. Its a great job if you’re just doing it for fun not for pay. The pets were the best part! I was a cashier and was asked and expected to stock during my shift. When a customer would come up to the register I was expected to be there asap and would get called out all the time for it. They pretty much dont wanna pay 2 people to do 2 jobs so they try to suck the work and energy out of everyone to save money.
bad,"Too many meetings, too many changes in management, too many different management styles. No freedom to work as your own person and product quality work. To CLEAR expectations when projects are given out which causes 3, 4, sometiems 5 itterations of the same thing. Working around pets sounds good until you are really trying to work and there is no peace and quiet. "
bad,"under staffed which leaves a lot of pressure on you (even if part time)."
bad,I absolutely love the job opportunity that Petsmart has given me. If it wasn't for the management I would have stayed for a very long time. The management is horrible to be honest although our district leader is wonderful. I hope Petsmart in the future maybe conducts 1 on 1 with its employees to further understand the situations per store.
bad,Stress filled day in and day out.  Loved the pets and merchandise but the atmosphere at our store was very stressful.  Nobody took their job seriously and they were always getting into disagreements.
bad,great benefits and bonuses. There is always room for improving yourself . The coaching is fantastic and they give you the opportunity fir growth. The hours are shift work and you must have open availability. The hours start from 5am to 10pm and there are times you must work graveyard shift from 10pm to 6 am to stock shelves.
bad,"Often times the stock room was so unsanitary it made me think twice about how much they truly cared for the pets they claimed to love during the interview process. (The reason I joined initially.) "
bad,"Worked long hours with 4am start time. Physically demanding and long hours and weekends. Pay is normal for retail, but the work is more demanding than the average retail."
bad,"The management there was really horrible and never bothered to memorize my name, even thought I worked there for over a year. The overall love the associates had for the pets and customers was what mainly kept me going from day to day."
bad,"If you love pets, this is the place to work. Unfortunately all else pretty much matches that of a retail work setting. Compensation is not good, management is very unmotivated, and customers treat employees very poorly. "
bad,"PetSmart is to stressful to be a fun place to work. The priorities are always shifting, the goals change daily, the company expects to much with to little."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for this company. I was bit really bad and they had me work instead of recouping, even though I couldn't bend or lift or pivot. And I was in tears driving my self to work. They said I would have to take the time off with no pay, even though I got bit working at the Pets Hotel. Wish someone would have warned me that this is something that happens at this company."
bad,"ok job a lot of stress , they seem to make us do everything even dealing with rude customers, at the end of the day they are all about the money even though  they say they arent. they pretend to care but at the end of the day they dont.             ,"
bad,As a dog bather I was in charge of my own appointments.  I would get on average 5 appointments a day.  Depending on the size of the dog it could be labor intensive.
bad,"A lot of clashing egos "
bad,For the of love pets this is the perfect job for me. I enjoy interactions with the pets and pet parents. See a not so groomed dog transform into a beauty is the best feeling.
bad,collect slip sheets and pallets all night. if pickers need pallets or boxes I bring them and anything else the supervisors may need. Some of management is ok. There is nothing really hard about the job. The people I work with are ok to a point but there is to much drama in the warehouse.
bad,They repeatedly broke company guidelines and treated employees with little respect.Co workers were mostly friendly but turn-over was large because of the terrible management.
bad,"On any given day at work there was a lot to do. The mornings were especially busy, that is when most tasks had to be completed. Every task had to be done by procedure and in a timely manner. Mornings consisted of feeding all the pets including the cats in the adoption center, then sanitizing the designated pet habitats for the correspondent day. After completion of those tasks I would analyze then medicate the ill pets. Following that I would clean the designated fish tanks for that day. Lastly I would sanitize my work area and organize the store products. The hardest part of the job was sanitizing the pets habitats because it was so time consuming, I had to make sure I was doing everything correctly in a timely matter in order to be able to complete the other daily tasks. The most enjoyable part was caring for the pets, seeing them, being able to spend time with them, and helping them recuperate when they were will was the most satisfying thing."
bad,"Petsmart is a decent employer, and I was a satisfied employee. The reason for the poor achievement in job security, or advancement is they don't allow for growth internally. Management was replaced frequently in short terms. They do have good branch management, but this location lacked consistency. Therefore, certain management teams were bias."
bad,"Overall it's an exciting place to work if you have a passion for pets! Ok benefits, hands on training and competitive atmosphere. Mission statement and goals are clear if you want to move up in the company own it and lead by example."
bad,"My experience with Shaw's was not something I would brag about.  It was a great first job for me, however there was no room for advancement.  Hours were always few and far between.  Instead of giving employees the store currently had more hours, they would constantly be hiring new cheaper people and giving them the hours.  Not a company that showed much respect for their employees."
bad,"it was a good place to go to work, where you would stay busy for the entire day.  very productive. the hardest part of the job was working on huge dogs that were not used to being groomed,  the most enjoyable part was when you did a great job on the dogs and the customers were impressed with the job that you did with their pet."
bad,"I have a passion for animals, so the position was perfect for me. The hours and pay/benefits were excellent. Some inexperienced co-workers."
bad,"My career at PetSmart was that of a ""Petcare Specialist"". We were trained and responsible for the diet, hygiene, health, habitat upkeep of animals, as well as proper resource and education distribution. As well as daily corporate reports evaluating the ""expiration"" of any animal, health and conditions."
bad,"Responsible for receiving products from vendors and processes it for shipping to our retail stores. Which includes receiving product, fulfilling store orders, ensuring that orders are filled accurately, timely and efficiently and packaging and preparing the product for shipping."
bad,"It’sa good job if you like animals, but the management could be better. Very sloppy scheduling and training. Time off request could be better too and animal care should be their number one priority which often times isn’t."
bad,Good for inbetween jobs but never something long term. Management is a mess and turn over is incredibly high. Especially with MANAGEMENT. So don't think long term.
bad,It was a different atmosphere to work at but I loved seeing the animals and watching them grow up. I didn't agree with the pushing of the puppy kit and training.
bad,"I applied for Pet care Specialist. It took over 2 weeks and me asking, to be trained in the pet department. I was put on registers every shift before then. Management was rude and snarky. Not sure if it was just my location, but definitely would not recommend."
bad,"Not a great company. It's a corporation, so obviously the higher-ups don't care about your well being, they care about making money. The manager in the salon was NOT this way, but the store manager was. Employees were great."
bad,"My store leaders, focused on criticizing ridiculous things like keeping the tables disinfected 100% of the time, not holding the pet's restraint harnesses but the pets themselves, and maintaining impossible standards of sterilization. Rather than on important issues.  We were severely understaffed, and down a bathing area due to lack of water pressure.  Disappointing!!"
bad,"The work is fine(cleaning, helping pet parents etc), but the management do not care about your well being (physical or mental health). "
bad,I loved my job and the people I worked with. The hardest part of any given day was dealing with ignorant customers that thought they could do my job better than me.
bad,"I would not recommend working here, very rude customers all the time, poor management, they dont take care of the employees, push so much work on you that isnt your job, all for minimum wage. They will still have you work even when the working conditions are against the law. Definitely a slave corporation."
bad,"It was fine until new management came in. They put feces in a trash can and leave it there, they refused to give me a sick day, and leave me with more dogs than one person should deal with. DO NOT WORK THE NIGHT SHIFTS."
bad,"A great place to work if you're interested in caring for a variety of animals. Coworkers and customers all care about animals. Outside of store management, it was obvious the corporation of petsmart couldn't care less about the employees or animals or even the customers. The district manager is insanely nitpicky about the smallest details and then will overlooking major issues in other petsmarts. Overall the corporation is awful at being fair and holding equal standards amongst other petsmarts. They are willing to let buildings fall apart and dont care about the health of the new animals we received."
bad,"Petsmart was a good opportunity while putting myself through school, but has become increasingly poorly managed. Management doesn't care about you and workers aren't properly paid for what's asked of them. The only reason I stayed for so long was because of the dogs."
bad,"I wanted to work here because I love animals and thought this would be a great place to work to be around them. I learned quickly that the company cares more about profit than the pets. Although I know they do need to care about money to be a successful company, I feel as if that was put above the safety of the pets on numerous occasions. The grooming salon was a big example of this. The pet would be there for over 6 hours normally for a groom that would take only a fraction of that time. They are put in a kennel with no bathroom breaks. The goal of the salon is clearly to just get as many dogs in there as possible, even though it causes intense stress to so many of them. I used to take my dog to get groomed there, but after working here I would never recommend it to anybody. "
bad,"great, always making sure that their customers and employees are okay. Flexible hours and flexible vacation time! Love the company over all!! Always There to help eachother even when we need help with our own animals"
bad,The staff was friendly to the customers. They were always good on making sure we took our lunch break on time. They also was willing to step in and help any customer in need of assistance.
bad,"Only thing I didn't like was that people with less experienced were paid more, and people with limited knowledge of animals would get to work the floor before someone who had more knowledge over proper nutrition, proper housing etc."
bad,All computer systems were very old and needed a lot of work. Systems wpuld always shut down amd ran very slow. Bosses play favorites and they mistreated the ones who might need a little extra help
bad,"Everyone there was fun to work with and were more then willing to help out  if necessary. The breaks there were short, but overall just a really enjoyable place to work at."
bad,they play favorites as well as if the manager is having a bad day they take it out on everyone around them also talk to you like you're a child. also if management has an issue with you they cut your hours. pay rate also sucks
bad,the only thing that sucks about being a dog bather is that you have to become a groomer after you been there for 3 months and go to dallas tx something i cant do because of my health issues also the management treats its employers poorly and you are only part time and get paid every week so i dont earn enough money to get ahead in life so over all the job is fun just the management is poorly
bad,I love to work with animals. I was able to cuddle and clean up after them. I swept up and did something I love. I would volunteer there if able to do it again
bad,Overall great job but it's more of something that you start when you're just looking for a job and you're still in high school or if you're looking to learn more about animals and their habitats which I learned a lot from
bad,"I liked working for PetSmart only because of the small animals that I sold.  I got to learn how to take care of exotic pets such as fish, anoles, frogs, ferrets, birds, so on and so forth.  That was probably the most fun part of the job that I enjoyed."
bad,Working in the grooming department was a lot of fun. I liked working with the dogs. It is not always easy to trim a dogs nail but the need to trim dog nails is important.
bad,The job was great for the first year. Then the petsmart hired new management and things changed. Everyone became very hostile and people were constantly getting fired. I loved the job but the people who worked there caused too many problems for the other workers.
bad,This place is only for a last resort type of employment. Not a fun job. Can be slow or it can be extremely crazy. Usually under staffed. Pay is not good. Only good thing about the job was the pets coming into the store.
bad,"Very fun if you like animals, hands on with many animals and in depth training to help make you feel comfortable doing your job. Friendly people to work with and I never felt uncomfortable asking anyone any questions. The hardest part was finding were every product would go on the shelves."
bad,I was a groomer there and been there some time. 10 years. They don't have any loyalty when it comes to senior groomers. Paid by Commission every dog groomed you get 50%. No real raises the only thing I got for 10 years is a little pin. The corporation wants you always but a hundred 10% but they're never willing to even put 50 towards an employee. All you are is number.
bad,"PetSmart has made recent changes to their customer service style that many existing employees are finding difficult to adjust to. The work is pleasant, for the most part. Customer service can be tricky until you've learnt about the products."
bad,I learned the staff at each location really band together to help each other.  I learned the upper management at the company could care less about the safety and day to day workings of the company
bad,"it's with any job that you might run into these issues. I love working with animals and help educate pet parent's on the products we sell. my issue working there is the training in the Pet Care department there is never enough training before they send you off to wolves. Wish PetSmart would get rid of those small ""goldfish"" bowls they are horrible for any fish. I wish also they had better habitats for all of the animals. Also do a 6 month review walk on site surprise on these breeders we get our animals from. I still love the company and each store's management is different."
bad,"Petsmart does not take care of their animals so if you care about any of the animals in their care, you will be stressed and heartbroken, and ignored when you try to talk to management about them. Many animals get sick and die. Would not recommend working at this company."
bad,"I like animals a lot there are so adorable and I think this job I will learn more about animals, and how to train them and I like any animals pet home."
bad,"typical corporate environment "
bad,To much high stress comes with any position working at Pet Smart. Very unorganized and to many disgruntled employees. Ones that worked hard were not recognized.
bad,It was a job.  The company changed a lot after we were purchased by a private investment group.  It is not a good culture at all and not a fun place to work anymore.
bad,Worked here for 3 years. The management skills are nonexistent and nobody works as a team to help one another out. Always short staffed. Favoritism is a key player in who benefits from anything from the store manager.
bad,"I quit because the managers would not take action when i was being harassed and bullied every day in the dog grooming department where i worked. I was not comfortable with whom i worked with and the Managers did not relocate me as i requested."
bad,Petsmart was an amazing place to work. But when the store was bought out the focus moved more towards money in the CEO's pocket than care for their fellow associates and the care for the ability for Pet parents to be able to afford to have their animals on healthy diets for a reasonable price. The higher levels of corporate also started to threaten jobs more and seem to thrive on a fear based work environment.
bad,pay was bad  could never get help from management cant get full time unless management benefits were bad unrealistic expectations of employees
bad,Business has gone down a lot. As a dog groomer you are not always guaranteed to have a full schedule of dogs to groom. When you are fully booked it is a great pay check but when there isn't enough clientele for everyone it is a major struggle especially when you are a parent.
bad,The turnover rate at pet-smart is very high. They consistently show favoritism to the older employees. The pay increases are not accurate .
bad,Too many expectations put on you every day. Every week more added and no resources are given to the store to complete them.
bad,"Interacting with customer, providing information in answer to inquiries"
bad,"Company was sold in March 2015.  A lot of great associates, managers and district managers have lost their careers due to the restructuring of the store operations.  Very sad"
bad,Unless your looking for a part time job or a career in pet goods not a great place to work. Non supportive management and lazy co-workers
bad,Corporate has no idea how to run the company. They over work the employees. They keep getting rid of the product that sells and keep the product that doesn't.
bad,"the company was a good company until it was bought out. now all they care about is money and zero about their employees. great people to work with, just the management was not all that great."
bad,Atmosphere is fun.  Loved working around the animals.  However the policies and procedures that the management team have to follow is ridiculous.  It sets everyone to fail.  You will never be able to complete all tasks in the time given.
bad,For a kid living at home with no responsibilities this may be a fun place to work. If you live in the real world and have responsibilities this is a very low paying job that never gives you enough hours. Not only do they not care about the employees the animal care is very poor.
bad,There was little training provided for this position and the manager was more concerned with what colors of nail polish came in and talking to other employees than actually running a proper department.
bad,"Extreme micromanagement company. Coworkers, customers, and pets make it worth it to work there. As presentation manager you're required to be extremely detail oriented and able to make plans for the day, week, and upcoming months of promotions. Rapidly changing store promotions and company initiatives."
bad,"Many advancement opportunities and some good managers to learn from. However, at a certain point the work becomes boring and there isn't enough to do. Wasn't happy and needed a challenge."
bad,"Not many positive things I can say about this job unfortunately. I was hired as a stocker that was told I would be a FT employee. That quickly turned into PT. When I sought more hours, the manager told he would get me into a program where I would be driving the kitties they have back and forth from the veterinary they get them from. I loved this idea....only to find out a week or two later after calling the actual vet, he made no call to them. I was hurt and disappointed to be lied to. I asked to be put on cashier and they did but barely. I was lied to on multiple occasions and asked them what was going on? They proceeded to cut my hours down to 3 hours per week rather than discuss any problems or issues they had with me rather than let me go outright. They clearly have favorites. I was upset with this place. Giving them a 2 star rating was considerate I felt."
bad,"As an overnight stocker, I showed up to work roughly at 3-4am, hours were steady. I have had all the job experience required for this position when hired however I did get forklift certified for the first time through this company so that was a plus. Management was very lousy to be honest and seemed inexperienced. We had managers show up late to work, and a couple times even forgot to come so I was locked out from be able to do my job. My co workers were friendly, all things considered I only had two I actually worked with but for the most part I did my job unsupervised and in a timely manner. The job was fairly easy, nothing hard about it, pretty basic. I however was personally given the more physically demanding position and I was ok with it. (Stocking bags of dog food and cat litter all day. 40+lbs) The most enjoyable part of the job was I got to focus on my work without the interruptions of customers majority of the early morning, until I spent my last couple hours during open store and cashiered."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,"Poor Management, Extremely poor care for animals. Managers have no problem calling you a liar, & criticizing you for your work or personal choices. Very unorganized,"
bad,Great place to start as a bather and work your way up the ladder.
bad,"Provided outstanding customer service. Greeted and answered customers’ questions about pet and animal products. Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, and automatic debits. Issue receipts, refunds, credits, and change due to customers."
bad,this job is extremely physically demanding. and not ideal for people that have a height disadvantage.
bad,A typical day at work was stocking the shelves of pet food and pet care. I learned that no matter how nice can you be to customers they do not always treat you how you wish to be treated. My co-workers were extremely rude
bad,"I fed, cleaned and watched over animals, I learned to appreciate them more after realizing how loving they are. I worked alongside a woman who talk me how to approach animals without scaring them. She was kind and friendly which made my experience at Pet Smart an enjoyable one."
bad,"Typical day includes the movement of freight from the back room to the sales floor for sales. The stock team focused on minimizing shrink to maximize profits. I enjoy working as a team to ensure correct, accurate, and rapid stocking of merchandise."
bad,"Helped customers, checked out customers, helped balance cash at the end of the day, helped clean, stock, answered phone."
bad,This place was a decent place to work. I enjoyed this as it gave me experience as my first job.
bad,Part time work while I attended college. Pay was too low to justify the long commute.
bad,"not enough work was laid off not a good place to work, i was laid very shortly after starting, i did learn a lot in that short time working for them, that would help me in future jobs,"
bad,"I love working with animals and helping pet parent with any questions they have. I had so much fun working there but the people who were higher than me, were a bit unprofessional. I didn't like having to go to work and have to feel like im walking on eggshells around certain people. And i felt it was time to take myself out of the situation"
bad,"While there I believe the experience could have been better. I would have like to have more hours and more training. Instead, I was tossed into the mix and was expected to do my job as a bather even when I was not prepared and had the full knowledge as to what I was suppose to do. The co-workers seemed friendly enough. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with something I did not know anything about. The most enjoyable part about it was being able to work with client's dogs and seeing them smile about a clean pet."
bad,it was not great. they hold you back and dont treat employees well
bad,"Very fast paced work environment, with high productivity expectations. You work hard when your supposed to and you play hard on your breaks which are every two hours."
bad,"At my location, people are in authority that shouldnt be. There is no real structure or foundation and things keep happening that shouldn't happen there. There is no real precautions for your actions. No one gets fired there, you almost have to kill some one!! They are too worried  about the turn over rate!!"
bad,"Your hours always change, they want you to sell sell sell and if you don’t meet what they expect they say they will write you up. Well you can’t make someone buy something. When your a groomer if it’s the winter you don’t make any money. But near holidays and summer you can make a lot if you put your all into it. Bathrooms are always nasty, there is never the same people there for long."
bad,"The managers in the PetsHotel and store are inconsiderate, underpay their staff and both are easily irritable. The rest of the staff is great and friendly. Work pace is fast, you play with dogs and take care of cats."
bad,"I had a fun time working there at first, but after about 8 months, a lot of changes were being made and I didn't agree with a lot of them. Now PetSmart doesn't stand for what it used to."
bad,"What I love most about PetSmart is that employees definitely have a work/life balance. "
bad,"I worked at petsmart for a year. First job i had ever had. But once I got to my full time position, things changed. I was forced to transfer between stores to actually earn a full time position and after leaving one of the stores, my hours were cut way down to 4 hours a day to barely any hours at all and I was commuting over an hour to & from work. At first, it's a wonderful experience because of all of the animals and it was a super friendly environment, but after my 6 month evaluation, I was tired of it. But i still stuck it out for another 6 months. I had one issue with a co-worker the entire time of being with petsmart and it never got resolved after I continuously cried infront of my bosses and tried to take it up the chain of command because nothing was being done. All in all, if you want something that's fun and involves animals, petsmart is the way to go. Just stay out of the little kid drama that goes on."
bad,Staff members always made my day. I could have used better support and respect from the members of upper management. High turnover rate
bad,The work is hard and rough. Some things feel out of place and procedures need to be revised. Some times you feel like you are a slave working there.
bad,"It took 5 interviews over 3 months to get hired. The Store Manager I was supposed to work for ended up getting transferred 3 weeks after I finished my training. The salary I was offered was way below the minimum expectation I had put out for them during the interview process, I had to counter offer and they still didn't meet my minimum. The District Manager that ""hired"" me I never saw again as he left the company between offering me the job and my actual start date. The temporary DM barely knew me and I was judged harshly based on a disgruntled manager's opinion of me and somehow I was doomed before I started. yes, I made some mistakes. There is A LOT to learn and a lot is put on the shoulders of an Operations Manager. Not really sure what a Store Manager was supposed to do because Operations, Pet Products, Presentation Manager and Pet Care Managers did everything."
bad,The job is easy and customers are ok. Hire external more then promoting inside.  Higher management will cover themselves before supporting you.  Even when your in the right.
bad,I enjoyed working there for as long as I did. I met great people there great friendships there also. I loved the organización we had there as a team..
bad,"I can’t say I had much experience with PetSmart. I only worked there maybe 2-3 weeks and I hated it. I’m moving out of state soon on a short notice and had to quit anyways. But my training really turned me off of it. The guy that trained me treated me like I was stupid. The other guy that trained me was boring and made the job seem super easy, when I’m reality, I only had one day to train in Pet Care and one day as Cashier, so cramming all of the information in my head while being a full time college student was ridiculous and stressful."
bad,"It was a busy place to work and also it was fun but the hours were really bad one week you could be working 30 hours the next one 10., it was very hard to make a living just working 10’hours per week."
bad,"You will have a great time working with the animals. Unfortunately everything else is terrible; the pay, the hours the expectations. You are expected a lot for a dollar over minimum wage."
bad,"at first, a great place to work with great people. but the company is going in a direction that steers away from exceptional customer service and caring. they no longer do what's right for the customer or the employees. hard work only goes so far, as you will be taken advantage of for the greedy needs of the company."
bad,"The more I stayed the more I realized that as a corporation all they pushed for was over working their employees and, expecting to much of them with no options for overtime and no time for lunches. They'll hire just about anyone to fill a position but never fire anyone for not doing their job. advancement is an option for you however you'll never get recognized for doing your every day duties. PS doesn't train you on any animal care they just hand you a paper of how to care or the animals at home and expect you to learn the rest on your own."
bad,Best college job I had. Was able to look forward to my job everyday because of my love of animals. Not the best pay at the time of me working there. Management was very fair and respectful
good,"horrible experience, the only good thing is that I met great customers and outstanding employees that I still keep in contact with. they make you sell everything in store and make your projected sales unreachable at times. as a manager they will fire you for not reaching sales goals, as an employee you have more job security"
good,When I worked for petsmart there was an immediate disapproval with my new location the overall atmosphere was horrible no professionalism whatsoever some of the employees were pretty much in a mindset of I run this place regardless of my position it didn't sit well with me whatsoever
good,"Working at petsmart is okay for a seasonal position if you just need extra cash. Getting paid weekly was a plus, however, management was beyond horrible. Their turnover rate is insanely high and they are never adequately staffed."
good,Productive but poor management the store is always dirty poor working environment when you need help with a task no one likes to help and the working environment is unfair
good,was a great place to work till the gm left and the assistant manager was in control be cautious of the petty childish behavior of management while they are the laziest people you could ever meet you will have no life you will be on call if you do not come in for someone elses call of the will talk poorly of you to other staff members they want to own and control your life its pitiful
good,I worked here for 2 years and loved it but was wrongfully accused of doing harm to a dog. And i know noone will ever believe thats the truth but i would never harm a dog and the only reason this happened was because 3 people got together who didnt like me mainly because they didnt like a girl i was friends with and decided to make an entire story up. It was devastating because i loved my job but childish rumors got the best of things.
good,"If you live nearby its worth it, short 4 hr shifts made my commute pointless. No chance of advancement and no chance at full time. No benefits. Pay was alright."
good,management was hard to please. you really have to have no outside life to make this comany happy. i wouldnt go back to this comany . if inhigh school prob good first time job
good,The petshotel is usually understaffed. Management spends more time onboarding new employees rather than training the existing employees. Promotion opportunities are rarely if ever made aware of to existing employees. If you're not careful to limit how much and how often you pick up responsibilities and skills you can find yourself being expected to cover senior and manager shifts/lunch breaks. Over-promising of services is common and pet parents go home disappointed/dissatisfied with not being able to go home with all the services promised. Being able to play/care for the dogs is nice. Can get tiring to be on your feet all day in a room full of 15 howling dogs.
good,Petsmart is a good job for anyone starting out and looking for work experience. The Company structure makes it difficult to advance quickly and even if you do advance the pay does not make the amount of work needed worth it.
good,Managers are competing against each other and constantly fighting! No teamwork and impossible goals to reach bonus incentives so they don’t have to pay bonuses
good,"Decent job, corporate is making working there difficult for everyone. I like the job itself, but the people are very hard to work with unfortunately. It is very enjoyable to work with the pets."
good,"Pretty straight forward retail. Lots of busy work, and rarely let you go home when over staffed. Typical day involves working overstock, and doing pointless things through out the store."
good,"I work in pet care so my day consist of seeing that each pet has required housing, food, water and if needed medical attention. I answer pet parents questions about their pets needs and concerns and try to assist them with better foods and needs."
good,i had great co-workers management wasent good they try to work you like a slave.
good,The hardest part of the job was learning how to handle poor management and overcoming the issues that would follow. The best part was being able to interact with the animals and the customers were frequently came in.
good,Managment only cares about bonuses not how the employee feels. Certain employees are favored over others and cleanliness is only worried about when the higher ups are visiting.
good,honestly the company is fine we can have fun as a team but with how petsmart is with the mostly only part timers its hard to move up in the system. I'd love to work full time and receive benefits but I never get the chance.
good,"I love what I do but working in a corporate environment is terrible. They suck every little bit of your soul. They don't care about the employees. You are easily replaceable no matter how long you have been there for. They expect us to do a million different tasks while still making them a s**t ton of money and if we don't we get reprimanded. Salon management shouldn't even be considered management. No one likes being there. I love the actual work, grooming dogs and being around dogs is great. The salon is usually filled with drama, feels like I'm back in high school. Oh, and the pay isn't even that great."
good,"It was a great place to work a few years ago, but has really dropped off on the last couple years. Management has little to no training on how to do their jobs and the company as a whole is very against maintaining the store equipment, so the older stores really show the wear."
good,"This was a great job for a while. But not something sustainable for long-term unless you suffer with no benefits and low income until the positions open. Even with commission and hourly pay, you will only be offered part-time at certain locations. Management is unstable and there is an obvious power struggle within this particular location. God forbid you decide to leave this job. You will be treated like a criminal by certain management members. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress created from lack of communication, and also a very unsteady schedule that disrupts the flow of operations."
good,"I had worked for petsmart on many occasions and different stores, it came down to actual harassment from management and other employees to the point of mental break downs. They so treated me very portly refused to provide hours but would provide hours to newer employees even going so far as to give over time to the newer employees. Yet still expect me to show up and happily accept it."
good,A typical day at work is just standing at the register until it starts to slow down. Then emptying garbage and making sure all returns are in the cart for the closing shift. I've learned how to use a register and how to deal with day to day customers. Management is kind of all over the place at PetSmart there's always two on during each shift and they're doing multiple things. The hardest part of this job is standing through the whole shift. The only time you're able to sit is if you have a break of any kind of when you use the bathroom. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all the customers and their pets as well as some of my coworkers.
good,"Terrible place to work! The managers were always rude, the store was not organized, they requested a large amount of work to be done in an impossible amount of time, there was a lot of favoritism and unfairness. The managers date each other and other employees. They do not work around school schedules fairly. They do not accommodate medical emergencies in the best way, nor excuse you for them."
good,this job was decent. i was able to gain good customer service because of the knowledge i have with animals. i was able to help customers a little more than someone with no animal knowledge.
good,Everyone was great working with except the store manager who harassed everyone and made everyone's life very stressful til he got fired and replaced by someone who is even worse then he was. It would be a great environment if they didn't work there. It says something when 5 employees quit in a week.
good,"its an ok job i would never work there again but it good it you are just starting out, the customer are good to be around and you must love pets witch i do"
good,"the mangers are very forth coming with what they would like to see, sometimes expectations are not reality. Many times you will not be recognized for all of the extra things you have done or how you have helped others."
good,"bad management"
good,"I don't have any comments. I don't have anything to say really about the company. If you love animals then go work there. If you are looking for your first job, then go apply."
good,"fast paced work place, a bit chaotic a times. to many dogs in a day for a groomer to safely Do, while giving the quality and care that pet owners expect."
good,"I loved my job at PetSmart for the first year until management changed. There was no chance of advancing my career despite there being openings and myself being qualified.The new management not only does not care for the pets, they also don't care about the employees. I received no consideration following being hospitalized for a week and was scheduled even though I was supposed to be on required bed rest for a few months. I fainted on the floor and at the register multiple times and was still expected to do heavy lifting and was given little to no help, realizing no one cared, I left."
good,"If the managers were more focused on the store and not with being friends with certain employees the whole place would have run a lot smoother. Sadly most employees were forced out at the whim of other employees. It was very sad since "
good,Working in the warehouse was sketchy at best. The amount of hours given were awful and there was nothing management could do about it. You were expected to meet goals set out by management and yet it was never enough. The only reason why I stayed for so long was I loved my co-workers (including a few managers) and enjoyed not fighting traffic when commuting in the early mornings.
good,"Be on time"
good,Every Salon experience is going to be different.  I happened to be in a Salon where I felt the dogs were not cared for but just seen as an income opportunity.  Some very talented groomers but management only saw the dogs and dollars and not family members. Management also pushed groomers past the point where we felt the grooms were getting unsafe for the dogs.
good,"I have worked for this company over a year with the primary intention of going full time from the get go. Yet, at every turn, my request has been denied. I have surpassed every expectation of my skills and met each goal presented to me. Still I am being denied full time and any advancement opportunities. I am disheartened to say the least. I dreamed of working for a company that put animals and theit pet part at the top of their priorities. I have enjoyed what I cpuld when I am there, but with such disappointment I am finding it difficult to maintain my enthusiasm and confidence in the company as a whole. It seems they don't want career minded individuals and prefer to cater to seasonal or temporary staff."
good,Petsmart could be an amazing... Could be! PetSmart offers the best benefits I have seen for groomers. The management however is horrible so caught up in bonuses that they could potentially receive that they refuse to even address issues repeatedly brought to their attention. I feel the safety of the pets is only a concern when not competing with bonuses and numbers for the week. Maybe they should give bonuses based on employee feedback. Also fixing things is not a priority here if the numbers are still up they don't care if something being broken makes your job 10x harder.
good,"PetSmart was a fun and stable working environment, however the pay was not enough to afford to live on, I typically stayed very busy and enjoyed working with animals. The puppies were my favorite experience there. I also enjoyed answering the phones and working with customers. My coworkers, however, were not team players and made the job a little harder than necessary. Overall, I enjoyed working for PetSmart but I am unable to afford to live on their salary."
good,I have worked at 2 different stores. The first was filled with amazing people and awesome experiences! The second drains the life from me and makes me never want to return.
good,"I worked there for almost 5 years and I worked in every department except grooming., I did price changes, worked the trucks, took care of all the animals and I was a cashier,"
good,Won't allow associates to get full time. Abusing hard workers while the lazy workers can do what they want. Management has no care for anyone and just sits in office majority of time on their phones. The pay is not worth the job. Fun working with animals and meeting new people.
good,"I've been working at PetSmart for two years and I wish I still worked with the team I began with. In just two short years, the company has undergone major changes including a buyout. There is no longer managers in our stores. We have ""leaders"". Each leader is different and some more difficult to work with than others. It all depends on luck of the draw and how the changes with the store are impacting them personally. Many expectations have been raised without fixing minimal issues in the store before implementing new policies. Where once we worked for the love of pets, we now work to meet numbers and I believe the company is going through a rough patch. One can only hope the road smoothes over soon. Overall the company is not bad to work for as long as you stay on top of yourself. In the first year you get three raises: three months, six months, and one year. Afterwards you get a yearly raise based on performance. My co-workers are all very knowledgable and the amount of facts and information you come to pick up on is amazing. The hardest part of the job is building a tough skin. Retail can break a person who cannot deal with repetitive actions and sayings and dealing with certain customers who will do anything to get a ""good deal"" while working high volume and fast-paced days. The most enjoyable part of my job is the connections I make not only with my co-workers but with my customers and their pets. I have people who only come back just to see me and ask me about my day. When I graduated school one of them even bought me a present. (Which we are allowed to accept so long as"
good,i dont want to talk about it....
good,If you love animals this is a great place for you. Being hands on and learning about the care of each and eeryone is a blast.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,Have co workers do less dosen't work as a team get paid far more money than you and you  end up doing  more for less bias and favoritism among the managers  if you love pets enough you can overlook the cons if not than I suggest finding something else that will treat you fairly
good,Work would be fun if people actually cared and were willing to take care of pets and each other. I left because I was being bullied and management chose not to do anything
good,"Good place to start a job, love the pets that come in. Often people relax after a few months and their true work ethic and personalities start to surface and for the different age groups, I find many of the older group with childish grudges etc which is annoying to work around.."
good,"Petsmart does not offer fulltime positions. Instead of hiring a hand full of qualified,  trained employees,  then allowing them to do their job. Compensating them accordingly.  Would rather hire part time , unskilled workers , paying them low wages with no benefits or vacations. Often short handed."
good,"Generally I've had a good time working for PetSmart, but I've worked at two very poor salons and stores where the management couldn't care less about their employees. If the groomers had an issue with something going on in the salon that needed to be fixed, the managers would simply say ""there's the door"". Not to mention the amount of added work that corporate keeps adding to a groomers already stressful and busy day, the managers will come in and tell us there is a call parked on a line but won't stop to simply answer the phone call when they're not busy on the floor. The managers are trained to be able to help the salon when we're busy to help keep generating more business but they simply don't do that. Definitely think twice before working for PetSmart, especially on the floor, and ask around the employees of their experience of working at that current store and tell them to be real with you. It's not the worth the stress or mental anguish."
good,"Working at PetSmart wasn't difficult, but oftentimes felt lost working as their lead associate, basically a 3rd key. I was used to close four nights a week and anytime I inquired on products, policies, or opinions it was met with little to no response. "
good,The place is a mess. Managers will sit around until necessary and will blame everyone else for problems in the store. Managers almost never go by policy and give the customers what they want. The pay is extremely low for Pet Care.
good,"1 manager, 1 cashier.....never staffed sufficiently. "
good,I was working here during college and I moved up through the company rather quickly but with no additional pay. Once they heard I was starting my career they just took me off the schedule and never told me I was terminated.
good,"A ton of enrollment videos, then it's sink or swim. No help, stores are functioning on barebones staff so no back up, and long lines with angry customers. Problems also with manager/employee relations, and with management sexually harassing people below them."
good,"Cashier position is great, Salon is very hectic and almost toxic among the other salon members. Great working with the dogs and helping customers find what they need."
good,"I worked for Petsmart for three and a half years and was trained in all roles. "
good,"Working at PetSmart did give me much insight about customer service and about the animals I had to work with there. However, the management at my particular store was not great, and it seemed not very well organized. I wasn't getting the hours I wanted and my paychecks could not have paid my bills whatsoever."
good,"Hotel was both a wonderful, and far too stressful place to work. Loved the animals, loved the people I worked with. I think the corporate bottom line gets in the way of pet care."
good,"Pet smart is a busy store we have people come in all the time with millions of questions "
good,Bad management made a great job stressful. Petsmart is a corporation and It would have been a better place if more care went towards the pets than the bottom dollar.
good,"Salon manager only cares about sales and not about strain on employees. Salon manager not focused on helping others, and only helps herself. Salon manager is also very demeaning."
good,"store was constantly changing managers, key holders were always coming and going. Forced into doing role play exercises - which is terrible for someone with anxiety - like me."
good,Fun Co workers management sucks though and it's hard to move up In the company. The managers didn't always help or know what they were doing. It's hard when they don't have your back
good,As an animal lover this job is perfect for getting to know all the product and what's best for my animals and pet parents animal is the best part. Working with animals of all type small and large happy and feisty is a blessing everyday.
good,"It wasn't foo bad working there. They cut full time hours because management doesn't know how to schedule people there. There's so much favoritism its ridiculous. Its like a high school setting but worse because managers are involved in the gossip. The only redeeming factor was the pups. I worked at the hotel and that's the only thing that kept me going was the dogs. I was full and I closed 4 days out of my 5 work day week. They only let you call out if they like you. I've had to go into working not being able to walk or having fevers and they don't csre, but there were other's that called out because they didn't have rides and they didn't say anything to them."
good,Definitely not a place to stay for a long time. Grooming destroys your body. CORE associates are under alot of pressure as well. Overall i had a fun team minus a few people but it really is a hit or a miss per store.
good,I appreciate working at petsmart and gaining so much knowledge. However I do feel that if management was better and more focused  it would be an overall better experience. It feels as though you are still in grade school. The management is more focused on small extra things rather then us being properly trained and treating customers properly. This is all just my opinion.
good,"overall Petsmart as a company is all about the $ now. their inventory is horrible, never have items the customers need and fish are very poor quality."
good,"I was relocated and not asked or consulted about is. 1.5 house commute each way. "
good,"was not allowed to be a full time employee cause that was only for managers. Managers not always around and not caring of their employees. Lots of hard workers they let leave due to working conditions. I learned and worked every area of the store from cashier, to dog trainer, to the hotel and still couldn't get hours. Dog training was always changing and no matter how good I was could not get more than part time and got cut when they changed the program. seemed like even the newer people had a one up on me. The more areas they trained you the more you get pulled in multiple directions. When I was scheduled as dog trainer I was pulled to register and other places making me late for class or not being able to sit down make my calls and do my paper work. This did not happen to the other trainer. It was just an unfair working environment."
good,"High expectations and store management does not provide materials to achieve the job expected. Low quality work place with little care about employees. Very kind and hard working associates but over all management is poorly trained and does not care about employees needs, they can be demeaning and very rude or they just ignore the red flags and don't do of fix problems that affect one or multiple individuals."
good,I lay be the people I work with I just hate the hours. I would love more hours to work there. Management is fine. I wish corporate looked at up ashore then just workers. Me and a lot of the staff that worked there went through a dramatic change when our store manager passed away and the told us they were not closing the store that we would have to get shifts covered or not go to his funeral and I don't think that's right.
good,"No advancement. Horrific pay. Despicable management. Great job for someone in college with a good personality. Super accommodating with my school schedule. Of course, I had been there since high school. After I graduated with a Bachelor's degree, I was ""promoted"" to $11.81/hour."
good,"the managerial staff expected you to know everything without training "
good,Loved working here but management and some customers made the day difficult. Some coworkers were hard to deal with but the animals and those who loved working with them made the job amazing because you learn new things all of the time.
good,"Store mangers can't tell you how to get paystubs. Don't have 15min breaks. Lots of favoritism!O love the dogs there. But you don't make any money, the management treats you unfairly."
good,Would be a better workplace/company if they cared about more than just profits. Will often tell you your full time or part time then they will short you hours to make sure you stay out of benefit range. They lie to customers and will take money for services they don't even provide. Shady company with shady management.
good,best part was seeing the animals. The hours weren't very great . staff is friendly and knew what the products were and what customers needed
good,"Not much of an opportunity to advance. Manager will spitefully schedule you horrid hours. My co-workers are fantastic, most of the managers are easy to work with and talk to."
good,"I work part time, with odd, shifting hours. I enjoyed it at first, but I no longer do. I enjoy working with animals, but I am ready for a change."
good,"I was an animal care specialist that was responsible for cleaning all the cages and care of all the pets. I really enjoyed the animals and the employees there where very caring about the pets. The company I found in a short time was not aware of the small cages for the rats that are in that dwelling for many months at a time as people do not want to buy them. Also, Petsmart sends more baby rats even though they did not request them. My boss told me she tried to call and write the company about the problem but No one ever responded back to her.  She has been with the company for over 5 years and is great at her job. Bottom line this company doe's not care about the pets or the very hard working employees with a decent pay.  ""Another American tragedy of greed"""
good,working at petsSmart was a great way to build my costumer service skills and learn how to work individually and within a team .
good,"Management is awful. No one is on the same page. Everyone has drama, poor customer assistance, not very clean, poor groomers in the grooming salon"
good,I wouldn't say it was the best place to work but I did have fun working with all the animals and being around them al day. management wasn't so understanding of my medical issue and not very organized.
good,"PetSmart as a company is a great company to idealize, until you work for them. The facade that they maintain is that they are people and animal friendly; however like many other retail giants they only care about the money. Sure they run adoption fairs and community events but the employees are treated unfairly and the politics of the place a something that need to go."
good,"The company overall is on a steady decline laying off 200+ people throughout the network  in the last couple of months with more to come .  a 20% share holder stock from another company is trying to get out of PetSmart because of the decline in sales. "
good,"A typical day would start at 6:00 AM opening the store.  Check company e mails (addressing anything immediate), get cash boxes ready and to registers, walk the store to check all animals first, list inventory holes and other issues involving merchandise. Depending on the day, often there would be a delivery in the warehouse that needed to be received and put out in stock."
good,"•	Tending to all live animals"
good,It is a decent company to work for. It may be different at other PetHotels but the management is very poor. They are very unprofessional and make you do all of their work.
good,"Management is horrible. They tell you they want you to ""grow with petsmart"" but do absolutely nothing to get you there. After the first three months i was there, i was asked to be cross trained in the pet care department, manager said sure, i'll look into it. nothing happened. I asked 4-5 times. still nothing. Asked for extra hours, because you cant work evenings because of school. they chewed me out about it, and ask me why i was asking for hours during the day, when you availability is limited during the EVENING."
good,"manager is easy going, very understanding, made work a fun work place, sometimes felt the managers  weren't fair, grooming area was stressful but doable, didn't receive much help from managers and they expected a lot"
good,"If you are interested in the animal field, PetSmart is a good place to start. Get familiar with a lot of different areas of animal care as well as animal nutrition, etc."
good,"Good place to work but low expectations from me and them. typically helping customers and or caring for animals, at the end of the day you are facing and cleaning the store. Good vibe working there, most managers sit on their butts and do nothing making associates do it. That and low hours would be downfall."
good,"I loved working as a groomer until the management changed. Favoritism seems to be a big part of the store. If you are well liked you can get away with anything. Going above and beyond gets you nowhere.  Grooming coupons are taken out of your pay. The salon environment is extremely stressful to not only the groomers but the animals as well. If you can ignore all the negatives about the job,  pay is decent and benifits are good."
good,"Very stressful, long hours. If you like animals, it can be rewarding, but policy and procedure doesnt always assure they go to good homes.  Its very rewarding when you get to see the ones go to good homes though"
good,They take half of your commission and off discount that comes out of your half of your commission. I felt like I was getting robbed.they did have good benefits and offered groomers discounts
good,"Playing with dogs great "
good,"Was a great job, loved working with people and animals, the wage was not the greatest couldn't really live off it. We often went through a lot of management and I didn't like the way the animal care was handled."
good,"Working at PetSmart started off absolutely wonderful. I had a supportive management team and great coworkers. After a while, a new team came in and everything went down the drain. I had zero support, was expected to expend 150% effort for zero payback. Care for the animals became 2nd to driving sales. However, other locations I've assisted in have been amazing with great leadership and room for growth. I'd suggest talking to people before applying to a specific location."
good,"Nearly 3 years, and i was passionate and amazing at my job. I loved it. It only took the new store ""leader"" a few months and several several attempts to get me cut off. "
good,"Having worked for petsmart for 4 years I have had my ups and downs. Recently there has been nothing but downs. Management in some stores, is absolutely horrible. If you aren't on the store leaders good side she will do whatever she can to get you fired. From having other managers spy on your every move to spreading rumors about you. She will do what ever possible to make you unhappy until you either mess up and get fired or quit."
good,Perfect for an associate that just wants to work and go home. No true room for advancement and no empathy for individual situations. Management either can’t assist with problem solving or is unable to be found to assist in problem solving.
good,i had a harder time working here due to the lack of organization and lack of care placed upon the facility. Pretty much there was a shortage of the supplies because manager did not order in advance. And a lack of proper training in multiple positions.
good,"The management is horrible!! Forcing workers to continuously come into work even if they’re sick and at risk of getting everyone else there sick. Management talks and belittles you - picking favorites and letting things slide where they would micromanage someone else. It’s a toxic environment, petsmart should be focusing on watching their managers instead of shoving expensive dog/cat food down every customers throat. Employee discount at 15% off isn’t worth getting berated and looked down on every single day for 30+ hours a week."
good,"Far from happy workplace where unnecessarily ornery managers with no sense or education thoroughly exercise their control over employees through harsh evaluation, lack of empathy, and no desire to further train employees. very political and nonsensical."
good,"PetSmart is a retail company that offers a lot of quality merchandise for all different pet owners. The culture of the workplace is strained at times due to the demands of the business and management. But if you have a passion for pets this is the place to be. Petsmart has  many tools to offer the new associate to give them the confidence of knowledge from food, product and pets. They also have a great adoption imitative programs with SPCA and PETSAVE."
good,They don't provide the assistance needed by their cashiers when there are too many customers for one person to handle; management was not there to help when needed.
good,"Working with live creatures will always be a challenge, but if you love the creatures you will enjoy it. However, management makes things more dangerous and often the stress of expectations can make every day a struggle. The people you work with and the animals will be something you will always keep with you. However, it is not for the weak of heart, and you will be injured in some way while working. Bites, scratches, and from the strain of lifting and helping with the animals."
good,"Pet Care department is super fun to work in, but management is in way no professional. They pick favorites and treat employees unfairly. Policies tend to be broken and management is lazy."
good,"A very toxic work environment. Managers would play favourites. Others would be doing their jobs, while some were in the break room chatting to the supervisor/managers or texting."
good,"Bad hours, poor management, salary very poor. Unprofessional work environment, stresfful atmosphere, unclear assignments. Confusing pay system. Genuinely not worth the stress"
good,"I don't recommend working at PetSmart if you love animals, because it's guaranteed that people will be mean to their pets in front of you and you can't say anything! The management is poor and doesn't work together at all."
good,"Good as a part time job if your in school if your looking for a career or steady hours look somewhere else. Relaxed environment, hours all over the place."
good,Consistantley ran out of required tools to complete the task at hand. Assigned too many clients to complete within work hours; managment was non existent.
good,"There was a lot of gossip and unprofessional behaviour on the part of some of the managers and some of the employees. Being asked to work 7 consecutive days and then receiving an attitude when I refused to cover someone's shift made me uncomfortable. Young, immature staff."
good,the store was small easy to clean when when had the right thing to clean when mgr was able to get it and the equipment did not keep breaking down. for the work the pay was not there for the cleaning that had to be done
good,"I have learned so much working here from shoppers behaviors to animal care. Most customers are nice and friendly however you will always have those jerks that come in, which is normal. Don't ever expect management to have your back though, all they care about is making a sale, I have a suspicion that they make bonuses from certain sales which is why they push it so hard. They push it so hard that it is almost a threat to the employees which can make it a really stressful environment to work in. However the rest of the lower level employees are all very friendly and nice. There are some managers that are genuinely nice. however those managers receive backlash from other managers. All of this is just at my store. I have been to other stores and employees there look even more miserable than I do when I'm at work, and I'm not the only one that notices it."
good,"You basically greet people, then greet their dog, cat, iguana, or whichever animal is present, and then see what they need. Best part is you get to pet animals ALL THE TIME!"
good,I love the work hours but there isn't a advancement placement for going up in the company. the management is a disappointment and doesn't appreciate their workers
good,"The groomers looks down on every who is not a groomer. They are unprofessional, would bring there drama to work. When costumers were present they didnt care, they would talk about  inappropriate thing. They would always forget to give dogs water. If a dog pooped they would move a dog but leave the pool for somone else to clean. There is mildew all in the bathing room its been making me sick."
good,if you love animals this is something to start with. but if you need money this job isnt the right choice. i would say only do it if you love animals and you have a passion for animals.
good,"the management i worked with was horrible, they either were always late, calling in, pawning off their work on others, not direct when they talk, grooming salon associates were very rude, didnt mind working with the cashiers and pet care workers."
good,"My manager treated the staff poorly if she didn't get her way. She lied about advancement and only used it as a carrot on a stick to get people to make more sales. My last day was spent having a mental break down trying to transition between two jobs and not make anyone fill my remaining shifts. I liked my Co workers but, the upper management expects too much from a minimum wage worker. They want you to prioritize Petsmart over anything else in life."
good,Wasn't bad for minimum wage. Did enjoy all the overpriced discounted products. Hardest part of the job was how quick paced and stressful the management made it.
good,"Was fun, now after over ten years I barely make 12 an hour as a manager.... There is no respect and anything will get me fired. Like not enough emails"
good,No communication between the 6 managers and they all has there own ideas of right and wrong so you always got yelled at for something. And there was so much drama I. Felt I was in highschool
good,The staff are great to work with.  Working with the animals and rescue groups is satisfying and a joy.  It is very easy to change job position if you are unhappy where you are.
good,"Still a good company; but under private equity firm, culture has changed.  Should see huge growth in the future, but could be difficult over the next couple of years."
good,"I was a pet care specialist. I had to feed all animals fish,  birds, small animals.  Check for any sick.  Test the aquariums water made sure all the levels were they were needed.  Cleaned tanks and decors. Restocked shelves. Customer service answered phones.  Did cashiering as well as answering phones."
good,"Very fun, fast pace and energetic environment when working with the right people , the management staff at certain stores have favoritism and don't think about their employees as a person and more of a dollar sign ."
good,This was one of the most un-proffessional jobs i have ever worked at. The managers were terrible and all over the place. They had little respect for their employees.
good,"I thought I knew about dogs, but while working in the grooming salon, I was pleasantly proved wrong. I enjoyed interacting with the dogs and other team members; however, the clients were atrocious. Management was not always helpful in certain customer interactions and was not reliable when it came to backing up their employees."
good,Rarely got breaks because it was always busy at PetSmart. Felt forgotten all the time and wasn't included in huddles. Management wasn't available to answer questions which made me feel that I was being left behind.
good,Okay place to work for a short time but is not a good place if you are wanting a career. You will love what you do but everything else is very very stressful.
good,Too much work for what you get paid plus you have to do maintenance and clean everyone else's mess and on top of that exceed work productivity every day or managers will be on you.
good,This would be a great place to work if the focus was more on the animals than the customers. Sometimes the animals needs were overlooked to please customers or to make a sale. It was really difficult to balance work and personal life and the communication between management and employees was lacking.
good,"Though I loved working with the pets, the manager was terrible.  Did not listen to employees, Was forced to work overnights when I had previously told the manager I could not do to having a family."
good,was hard to deal with the store manager striping your overtime hrs and spreading it over to the next pay week hardest part is when the truck isn't on time to get the product to the floor to be stocked co-workers were a team players and fun to work for.
good,"Don't be fooled with working at pet stores they're not in it for the welfare of pets it's strictly money based and if you do one thing out of line you're gone. Some of newer associates don't listen to you and animals get away. Most people really don't realize how stressful this environment is, expecially horrible when you want to try to help an animal but you can't because it goes against company policy which is BS."
good,I was with the company for 5 years and did managers jobs for them but there is no room for advancement until someone quits or get fired and leaves a huge mess for you to clean when they do.
good,I was  a cashier and a stocker. I didnt mind it when i was on the sales floor stocking merchandise time went by quick because im constantly busy but standing in one are cashiering gets to the nerves sometimes.
good,"A typical workday for me is working the register and playing with the puppies. I learned quite a lot about the products we sell, animals needs and basic ways to train your pet. As far as management, they have there good days and bad days. My co-workers are great and we work well together. The hardest part of the job will have to be our low stock of products for weeks and weeks, and telling customers we still don't have a item in stock. My favorite is seeing all the dogs and puppies enter our store and I love my regular customers."
good,"petsmart was just bought out by a multi-billion dollar company and their plan is to cut the budget $200 million, no more full-time positions and they almost never promote from within, managers gossip and play favorites, everything you would expect from a large chain corporate retailer, if you like animals and work in the back then it is rewarding... but they don't provide the services they say they do which is very sad because its the animals who end up getting screwed over"
good,"Middle Management is ruining this company. Terrible ideas to improve productivity while the pay stays the same. Middle Management comes up with a call center to book grooming appointments, makes the groomers take more dogs than they feel comfortable taking, sometimes the employees cannot take a lunch just to be able to finish someones pet on time. The hardest part of this job is not being able to book our own dogs. Taking away booking our own Grooms takes away our ability to work efficiently. Every Groomer in my Salon has gone down 1-3 dogs. The call center is so bad at their jobs that we now have to work twice as hard to make sure we can groom the dogs they book on us. I love working with the dogs. I like my co workers for the most part. But other than that I would stay away from Petsmart."
good,"This used to be a fun company to work for, until things started to go downhill over the last year. I don't know if it's because the company was bought out or if everyone just stopped caring. The only reason I still work here is because I love animals, a lot more than I love people. It's a job that gives me money but it slowly drains my soul over time. Especially when you find out that new hires are making more money than you when you've been with the company for over 3 years. Yay, Petsmart really cares!"
good,Upper management is very lazy and pawns their work onto other employees. While  another manger comes to work only seeking and fulfilling his relationship with the Banfield Pet Hospital practice manger. Some rude customers but you get that with any retail employment.
good,"I don't really have a review, just a few things to improve on."
good,"Petsmart is a great place to work if you love animals, but does not offer enough compensation or options for career advancement"
good,"Management is disconnected"
good,"Management was a joke, job advancement opportunities VERY limited, and benefits where non-existent."
good,Typical day at work begins with opening the registers and opening the store. I learned a lot about retail management and controlling inventory counts. Best part of my job was helping customers find what they were looking for and meeting their pets. Worst part was when customers would get upset if items were out of stock.
good,"The pay is terrible even the raises are worse."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in and interacting with customers, their pets and your fellow employees. Working here, isn't the hardest, but it isn't the easiest. Communication between employees and management isn't all that great. You find yourself getting bored while at work, rather than enjoying it. I think the hardest part is trying to keep your job and move up in the company. They don't make this easy even for the hardest workers out there. The best part, that will probably keep you going is the pets and customers you deal with on a daily basis."
good,"I have worked for Petsmart for 6yrs. While I love working with animals and what they can do as far as charities go, when it comes down to their employees and advancing in the company it is a waste of time. Seniority does NOT matter in the company. You have to fight for each position posted with everyone else in the company and world. I was lead to believe for two years I was being trained for advancement and even worked supervisor duties for free because of what I was lead to believe. In the end they want to go the cheapest route and hire in new people that they can mold and pay less for then someone that KNOWS what they are doing and wouldn't need to be trained."
good,love working with pets only wish that the management would work as a team all times.
good,I have found a new appreciation towards animals. Everyone's very loving towards all the animals and each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and taking care of other peoples pets.
good,Not some place I would recommend anybody to work the hours are poor there are no benefits and very little room for advancement
good,"I worked nights here while holding down another job and going to school. I loved the animals. Management was alright, but demanded things that were against company policy and therefore ethically wrong. Co-workers are still good friends today!"
good,"I stocked shelves, forklift, and helped customers. I learned to stock, different food for animals. Management was okay, and I liked the stores values. The hardest part of the job was no advancement opportunities. The most enjoyable part was working with animals."
good,"there was a lot of cleaning, keeping things sanitary, answering phones, entering data into the computer, making appointments, give the clients everything they need to be satisfied. Co workers were a little difficult to get along with at times. people were vindictive, and greedy. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the co workers. the most enjoyable part was working with all of the animals and people."
good,"fun, loved the pets and pet parents. staff not helpful, very competitive. no teamwork"
good,My co workers was great but when it comes to the hours it was up and down. But I loved working with the animals and pet parents. My kind of place I love animals
good,"Working for them was difficult as I constantly had to deal with micromanagement and a manager that would insult my intelligence in front of customers constantly. I had applied for the part time ""pet care"" position but ended up being a full time cashier. I come into work one day before I quit to find a brand new associate getting trained for the pet care position. They had made me work a job I had never applied for"
good,"It was a job, not much more than that, the best part about  it was being able to play with dogs. Coworkers were fun to talk to but I wouldn't really say they were good at their jobs, a few exceptions. Management was difficult to work with, they pretty much just sit on the cashier, do some computer work and then sit and not help out with cleaning or anything like that, even if we were busy in the back and they didn't have anything to do in the front"
good,Terrible management and high turnover. It was great seeing all sorts of animals all day but there is not much room to grow. It is boring as you are mostly standing once you have completed your tasks. Easy job but boring and the management does not care about their employees.
good,"Minimal training, I was basically set off on my own after like 3 days to do everything. Their pet husbandry is sub par to say the least. They promote all animal's well being but still sell tiny hamster/ bird cages and betta bowls(aka the devil)."
good,"Again it really dose depend on your store leader. If they are always in a team player mood it shows and the customer can see it too petsmart was all about the pets and guest but in my last 3 years it became stressful, all about making  sales, I was a company i enjoyed to work for. fall from being what they where all about, i loved working for petsmart but I believe my goals where different form them"
good,When I first started the job was fairly good. With the changing of managers the job culture went down to be very petty and difficult to enjoy. By the end of my time there I was dreading going into work.
good,"I was mostly on my own taking care of all the pets in our store, It was fun if you like animals like I do. I also sold the pets and explained how to take care of them"
good,"Poor management, high demand to meet unrealistic goals. Employees are dispensable and are treated as such. Typical corporate mindset where everything is dictated by the higher ups sitting in their offices with no idea how the store actually functions. Would not recommend working for them."
good,"I am not a fan of retail, however this is a good start for a job in animal care. You do learn a a lot about animals and their care needs, the goal is sales."
good,"This job was great for a short time. However, it was not the best place to work. The hours were long and the pay is ok. It is a great summer or college job but it is not a job for the long term."
good,"The store I worked at in Phoenix was awesome! The staff all worked together great. When I moved to the store in Suerra Vusta I felt unwelcome and unwanted from the moment I walked in. The grooming staff was awesome, and most of the floor staff was nice, but the upper management treated me like dirt. I was never fully trained for the position they put me in at the Sierra Vista store, and every time I asked for help I would get ignored. I would get in trouble everytime I would ask for time off to travel to see family,and got denied many days off to the point where they forced me to just call in sick so I could take a day."
good,"Life at PetSmart prior to going Private was fun but we all worked hard and believed in what we did. After the sale, it was a transactional relationship with lack of strong leadership that lead through fear. PetSmart lost it’s identity."
good,"Started out loving this job and company. The pet parents make working here special, because you meet people who care about animals and are compassionate. I love the charities and the good they do for animals. "
good,"Work environment was terrible and there was nothing you could do to fix it. Unprofessional, and just stressful. Some people would just stand around and do nothing while others worked there butt off. You’d have 6 people on a shift and only two are actually working"
good,"The job itself gave me alot of hands-on experience with handling animals but was overshadowed by the terrible management that does not care about it's employees. The hours are long and often unpredictable, having us work on holidays when the rest of the store is closed. Petsmart pays minimum wage for a job that requires you to potentially break up dog fights or get scratched by grumpy cats. For a company that has billions of dollars they are quite frugal when it comes to their employees, the backbone of their company. The only pros I can think of are getting to take care of the animals and making life long friends with co-workers. I won't suggest working here for long as it is a very stressful job and not worth the minimum wage. Again got some good experience in customer service and animals handling but if you're looking for a job with petsmart do yourself a favor, don't."
good,"There is a lack of home and work balance and the store management at the time was terrible. The corp, doesn't seem to care about their employees only the Money they make off of them. Its great if you have enough passion to put-up with that"
good,"Management sucks, they don’t give you many hours or they give you a ton. It’s really busy and stressful sometimes. They don’t communicate very well at all and customers can really suck sometimes. But that’s the usual. It’s an okay part time job. I wouldn’t recommend being a groomer because you have to stay there for 2 years after you’re trained or else they’ll make you pay for the training."
good,"• Provide in store customer service, responsible for the health and safety of the pets. Preformed"
good,"I love this job and enjoy working with pets. The thing that blows is management, they have no compassion for the salon members, hire new people and give them all the hours. Where the people in the salon are forced to look for new jobs and scared away by our managers, at least at my location"
good,great fun place to work but no room to grow within the company. perfect for a part time job for a student that just needs extra money to get by for school.
good,A typical day at work at my location depends really on the attitude of the manager on duty that day and how much direction they want to relay. The benefits aren't really better or worse than any other retail job. If you like pets that's a positive of working here.
good,"Even though my job was to keep the cat adoption area clean, I'd have customers come through the doors multiple times an hour asking if I could leave the cats out and let them play with them. Most of the time, they'd be little kids. It can get stressful after a while when you've told people that you are not qualified to leave the cats out for the tenth time that hour."
good,"I think Petsmart is a good foundation for people who want to groom. They'll pay you while they teach you, they set you up with tools and you get a ""Notes From The Grooming Table"" book. I just advise to get all the learning under your belt then travel elsewhere. Petsmart really sees it's groomers as robots. The salons are run to be competitive. And if any type of incident happens, they won't stop to think on how to improve things. They'll just put all the blame on you then ditch you in the end."
good,Management didn't act like they wanted to help. They asked a lot of you. Didn't really go in depth with explaining. Expected you to know everything. Would not properly train you.
good,"Management and staff were nice, at first.  Then you notice the condescending and snarky tones in management. They tell you to ask a lot of questions so they can help but get an attitude when you do. Not to mention the bad mouthing of others by co workers in the salon. You are thrown into your position with very little training and talked down to instead of being guided. It’s very disappointing and makes for a very uncomfortable environment. I absolutely love the work I do but as I said, the environment makes it hard to focus and look forward to going into work. As for groomers, it is not the bathers job to wash your clients or steer away from our schedules and job duties, in any way, to accommodate you."
good,"It was hectic and the head cashier was verbally abusive ,  there were 4 managers and two were somewhat unpleasant. They only hire cashiers part time you have to wait for  full time cashier to quit to become full time."
good,"I’ve had a few experiences where the managers were not the best. They only care about themselves and their business and not their associates wellbeing. If you are having a problem, the managers do not really care about it unless it is effecting your capability to do your job and then they blame you. If you want a job where your manager actually cares about you and doesn’t put themselves first, I WOULD NOT recommend working at the Hudson location for PetSmart. They are extremely unfair and make promises that they do not fulfill."
good,"Busy work days depending on the season. When it was busy expected to do a lot, when it was slow expected to pick up other work around the store even if it wasn't included in our job description. Never got help from other department even tjou grooming department was expected to provide help. Management appreciated the grooming department when profitable and productive but wasn't influential when profits were low."
good,they will promise you things you will never get. no hours given. benefits are terrible. pay is terrible. no room for advancement. managers change constantly.
good,"I was a bather in the salon and this place works you to death and then tells you youre not working hard enough. They dont give a d a m n about pets or their employees its all about the money. I tried to call in sick and was literally told no. This place is all stress, and when i tried to transfer stores the new place paid me LESS thsn what i started with!  Just stay away if you want a workplace that treats you right"
good,Low pay. Low morale. Poor employee discount. Would have thought that they would want employees to use and support products with honest reviews. Nice to work with animals. Minimal animal welfare standards BUT spent a lot on vet care.
good,"Working here is a lot of physical work, heavy lifting, a lot of work on your feet, and it's a very team-based job. Interacting with the dogs and the pet parents is great and you form bonds with the people there and with their animals."
good,Very stressful workplace. it was fun to work there but it hurt my back and knees a lot. My co-workers were very nice and would help me out in any situation that I needed help in.
good,the overall task are not too complicated and at times can be very enjoyable if you love working with animals however management definitely puts a strain on the work environment
good,"Lots of higher up management shifting around from store to store. Employees dont last long. Alot of straight out of high school, first time job people so lots of lack of experience and management doesnt want to train. Two store managers and two assistant store managers have been fired from my store alone for theft. Overworked while being underpaid. Favoritism is how people get promoted. Not actual workmanship. Too many dogs have health problems in hotel because young adults dont care and managers trying too hard to be cool instead of being a boss. Quite a few dogs have died in the hotel from lack of attention. Theres so much more to name but now ive gotten mad just thinking of this place."
good,"Petsmart was a nice place to work except for the power struggle between management. The management at the Petsmart i worked at had a operations manager and a product manager and they both were grabbing for power so if you were OK with one the other one made your life a hard. Eventually one got fired and the other got promoted and one of the assistant manager moved up and made me train my lead while looking me over. The reason i left was  because my HR manager was having family problems and I called out which put me in her sights so i left. All in all it was a fun place to work but management needs work. So i do recommend working for Petsmart but only if there isn't a power struggle, know who the boss is."
good,A typical day at work was busy. I learned they don't care about the animals. The management needs improvement. The most enjoyable part was when I took time out to care for the animals.
good,"Even the part time employees are stressed and they don't have to endure as many hours as the full time. In fact they aren't really allowed to work more than 28 hours or face consequences which isn't nearly enough to live off of. The ultimate problem here is that cooperate comes out with something new every three months to hound managers about. The managers can't make those goals and face consequences which are then turned onto the employees, who may not have been aware of the issue to begin with, stress levels rise, people get less excited about working, and as a result we deal with grumpy customers because we have grumpy employees. Most employees are not properly trained and instead are just thrown out onto the floor to figure things out on their own (which is not a good tactic in the bird, small animal, and fish department). Every year the training programs get shorter and shorter to provide even less because the turn over rate is absolutely horrible due to how employees just can't handle how stressful it is. It's a vicious cycle. No matter how determined you are to change these ways or make something better, you will be broken."
good,"I worked at petsmart for 6 months in the doggie day camp as a pet care specialist. During the doggie day camp, the workers would have to stand in a room for 3 hours with either big or small dogs. The workers would pick favorites and didn't give the person standing in the room a choice to be with the big or small dogs. Also, we weren't really allowed to play or throw toys with the dogs because of fear of a dog fight, so there are no real activities done with the dogs. For the most part, you just stand in a room for 3 hours straight until they let the dogs out of the room. Communication was not very good and we communicated through a cheap walkie talkie. Also, workers aren't trained enough to be in a room with dogs that need attention. Sometimes workers don't know what to do or what to give a dog because they don't train workers. Overall, management was bad, there is little to no training involved, and the dogs are not treated very good."
good,"You will be cross trained and have to know just about everything in the store. So you can go from taking care of animals to ringing up customers to doing totes. It may sound like an easy relaxed job but, actually it's not. It is alot of hard work and always something to do. Not alot of down time."
good,If you love pets  and you need a part time job an associate is a good job to have at this company if you are looking into management be prepared to lose your personal life. The requirements and job duties for management positions are ridiculous and overly strenuous.
good,"Good for high school students as well as a temporary job for someone who is in between jobs. Easy work environment, must have good customer service skills."
good,"I'm sure other locations had to have been better than mine. However, at my location the salon manager was not given the authority to correct the issues in the salon (ie. issues among employees, broken equipment, etc). The general manager micromanaged the salon and salon manager while showing blatant favoritism to a clique that had dug into that store. Meanwhile new employees were treated like garbage, and the general manger made jokes about it. The culture was all about the bottom line with no care to the pet's or the guest's needs."
good,"Everything about working here was great really, the only down side is that you are easily replaceable to them so don't expect to get any favors. Otherwise the coworkers were great when I worked there."
good,"There is no typical day at work with PetSmart. Some associates know exactly what their job duties are and others don't until they clock in. For the most part, the management team is good. However, they give more ""Atta Boy's"" than raises and/or promotions. The most enjoyable part of working at PetSmart are the animals: dogs, cats, bird, reptiles, small animals, fish, etc. Helping a pet parent find what they are looking for is rewarding."
good,The head manager was unwilling to work with anyone when it came to scheduled hours or requested time off. He made you feel like you were always doing something wrong.
good,PetSmart asks a lot of experienced employees but doesn't exactly expect the same from new employees. The work load is not balanced. Not ideal for a long term job.
good,PetSmart was a great company though it did start to decline once they sold their shares to a private market.  Management was not that impressive but the DMs were great.
good,"For starters the mangers talk to their regular employees meaning cashier like their dirt, the store smells like a barn yard. The computer systems are outdated and will shut down in the middle of transaction"
good,Shifts are usually about 5 hours for part-time. Pay and the hours were decent for the job. Managers are inconsiderate of employees and push petperks too much.
good,A typical day would begin at 5 am and start with checking e-mailto see if there was anything that corporate wanted us to do right away. Then it would be to have a morning huddle to go over the expectations for the day with any team members that might be there. After setting the expectations for the morning it is time for the the morning paper work and getting the store ready to open. Other departments start coming in and I have to make sure they are on task as well.
good,"I was extremely happy with my first 5 years with the company. I was able to advance from bather, to groomer, and than salon manager. The company truly cared about animals and the happiness of its employees. however after it was sold the new company made drastic staffing cutbacks and it lowered its standards for animals care and customer service. The employees tried extremely hard to meet these changes however it's nearly impossible when the hours are cut and understaffing happened, The online booking system and it's misbooking was what finally made me leave the company. I put safety over profit. I also want to provide the best arrive to the customer."
good,"I looked forward to go to work. All dogs should pass a handling test but some bad dogs will pass through due to apathetic management. co-workers WERE great until a ""no fun allowed"" policy was enforced. People who SHOULDNT be leaders end up in the leadership position likely because of brown-nosing. Make sure you set boundaries for yourself even if it is a first or second job. ex: dont let them give you roller coaster schedules especially if it is a part time job. YOU have to keep the upper heads ACCOUNTABLE because not only is your safety in question, but also the safety of other pets."
good,It was fun because I love animals but management was not there for the average worked. There was an obvious favortism to certain areas and no one to answer to other than the obvious corp
good,"Good place for college students to learn retail. Pay / salary is not good for the amount of work required. No real benefits. High turnover, the manager over all of the Austin district was not fair or nice."
good,I worked here for my first job. It was a horrible first job. I was treated like trash by all coworkers and managers. They got mad when I didn’t have anything to do so gave me stupid things to do to pass the time and keep busy. This was 3 years ago so it might be different.
good,"it was very stressful under management. There's a huge turnover and you basically need to kiss up to management to get a decent amount of hours, no matter how hard you work."
good,\i loved working there because the experince with animals and learning things that dog owners don't know on the daily basis. the only problem is that you are not to progress to better performance in a different environment if you don't have a good relationship with your manager.
good,Management is awful. There is only one manager who treats the people below them like they are people and not dirt. There is no chance of advancement if the managers do not like you. Working with the animals is the only thing that makes the job enjoyable.
good,"Terrible work schedule, managers unwilling to work with your schedule and act like they are doing you a favor to answer questions. Only positive was that you get a small discount."
good,Job is easy but very repetitive.  Just stock the shelves with inventory and then repeat the next day.  Some managers are laid back and let you just do the work. Others are on your case about getting things done in certain time frames.
good,"The company is great and I believe in the mission. However, I wouldn't recommend the IT culture too highly. While I was there factions developed that led to many friends and co-workers being moved on in their careers for political reasons."
good,"Unfortunately the management at my location had no communication skills and the rules were constantly changing depending on which manager was ""in charge"" at the time making it hard to do the ""right"" thing. At my location unfortunately the managers there were not very likely to follow the P+P's that the company had set forth. But the customers and fellow co-workers were great people to work with almost making up for the fact that the managers were not. Almost but not quite."
good,I was in pet care and it was great! I learned new things about caring for the animals. this guided me to become a vet tech! it can be stressful because theres a rush at some point of the day so the time goes by quick. and when the day is slow theres always something to do to pass the time!
good,"As a cross trained employee I was able to work in multiple departments. If you're running register though be prepared for the longest shift of your life. Company keeps cutting hours and still expects less people to get the same amount of work done and focus on customer service. This usually means that you have 1 cashier, 1 person in petcare, and your manager. This leaves nobody running the operations on the floor. As a bather you're expected to do all of the walk-ins even though you're behind and still have yet to start any of your dogs for the day. Some days you don't get breaks because you have nobody to cover your department."
good,"I enjoyed being around the animals and being able to take care of them, as well as interacting with people who were just as interested in me about animals. Management is poor and constantly will hunt you down and correct and punish you on any mistake you might make."
good,"If you are an animal lover, Petsmart is a great company to work for IF you have a management team that is experienced and focused on customer service and good work environment, rather than the bottom line of beating the other stores in the district with sales. Unfortunately, our store in Shelby is a mini-store (approximately 1/4 the size of other stores in the area) and has a demographic customer base with not only a larger senior citizen (retired) group as well as a lower income group compared to the Charlotte area larger stores. However, the corporate offices put the Shelby store in direct competition with those stores and pressured employees to perform equally."
good,"required to help all areas of store under request"
good,"Have at least 7 dogs on schedule, sometimes they would over book me. But I didn't mind I love dogs. I learned a lot about how to care for a pets hygene, and why it is important to care about it. The Salon Manager moved away, and was never replaced so we didn't have someone to take over for making schedules or teaching new employees. Because of lack of management the other people in the saloon didn't do there daily duties. The hardest parts about this job was seeing dogs struggle, because they don't like having there nails trimmed. I loved working with dogs, they are beautiful and loving creatures."
good,"Majority of management is favoritism"
good,"The pay isn't the best. That's for sure. The management was tyrannical in the salon, but the store manager was a pushover. No one could agree on anything and if you couldn't ""keep up"" they;d cut your hours. Commision based for the groomers, hourly for the bathers, but hours were not guaranteed."
good,"Ok place to start out grooming but once your two year contract is up its best to find other work. Typical retail environment. Very corporate, not my cup of tea but having health insurance was nice."
good,"If you're looking for a part time job that pays okay, this is the place for you. They were always good about my schedule changes during college, and were pretty good about giving me time off if needed. The pay is not great, but it's a job that will work with your schedules. At the particular store I worked at, the store leader was what caused my leaving."
good,Management lacks communication with each other and all associates in the store. multiple times where I've have to wait for management to show up and then found out we were supposed to be there later. Times where i was told to do to different things by assistant manager and store maneger
good,"too many conference calls, trackers...cant be customer focus with all the distractions from above management.  You can't do everything by yourself, you have to have a strong management team that can quickly adjust and PetSmart lacks the training to prepare management for the business."
good,"they sucker you In with your love of pets when in all actuality its all about them making money, and making people who cant afford the most expensive dog food feel bad."
good,"I was not happy working for this store. The management was a joke. People in their 30's & 40's trying to be ""cool"" and hang out with the high school kids working there. Poor training, how is one to know how to do something if not properly trained."
good,A wonderful family like environment in the salon but the upper management doesn't care about it's employees. They expect too much out of the employees without giving us anything to work with.
good,"the management was absolutely horrible. I was not treated fairly. I only got 4 hours a week if lucky, and i have two children at home, i was promised more hours every week, which never happened."
good,The PetSmart I worked for in Dublin California had the horrible management but the other employees were very likable and easy to get along with. The one in Chicopee Massachusetts had great management with terrible co workers
good,"Company focus has shifted from petcare to customer care; all closing staff is now tasked with restocking the shelves, providing customer service, and little of much else. "
good,"I love working with the dogs and my coworkers; however, management is lacking. The Pets Hotel Manager is lazy and does as little work as possible. She is very judgmental and focuses too much on making money rather than providing care for the animals. The store manager seemed great at first but then he started worrying to much about the district manager rather than his own employees. I am seeking work elsewhere because they started a new computer system that picks our hours and because I have a few hours blocked out for school, the system does not give me any hours. Management claims there is nothing they can do but again I think they are just being lazy and don't want to deal with it even though it is making many part-time employees unhappy."
good,"They did not offer benefits or full-time employment, and the duties in the stockroom were very heavy, involving unloading truckloads of merchandise, which was then unpacked and moved out onto the floors to restock the shelves.  Much of what was delivered consisted of very large bags of petfood which I had to move quickly onto the shelves with little or no help."
good,"Busy atmosphere, helping customers with products. Good team restocking store. Helpful management. Hardest part of the job was the hours. Reporting to work at 3am and no one there to let you in. Very satisfying job though."
good,There was a lot of drama in the work place that management never took seriously. Management didn't treat each employee equally they had favorites.
good,Management could be engaged more in the salon. The salon could be a great place to work with the right attitude. The hardest part is doing multiple task while trying to safely groom dogs
good,I hated this job. I hated dishwashing but I did what I had to do. I dont know why I worked here it was mostly becasue my girlfriend told me I had to have two good job and I realyy ldidnt give a about my job so I lefty
good,"I worked for the company for almost 2 years in two different states as a bather at the start and a groomer after 6 months of working there. They train you completely and expect the upmost respect of safety and always letting the customers run over you. Which then ends in you losing money after grooming a dog if they ""don't like it"". If it's a busy season, it's good money. If it's not, you make your hourly rate if you don't commission enough. My store in Oregon had a few issues with teamwork and following guidelines. The store in Kentucky I worked with had poor management and is the reason why I quit the job. The company was bought out January 2015 which caused a lot of changes that made the job nearly impossible sometimes. If you want a job that will train you to become a groomer, have a place to rely on for benefits, and travel a lot, go for it. Grooming is a hard business sometimes."
good,The only benefit I get out of working at Petsmart is making a difference in the pet owners lives when they have they're dog all groomed nice and clean.
good,I do not enjoy working here or with its employers. I go in every day to stand at a register supplied with nothing to keep myself busy. I love to stay busy and interact with customers along with completing challenging tasks. This employer does not meet that criteria for me. I have asked multiple times to be switched to a different department where there is always something to get done. I have yet to be switched. The co-workers that don't complete their tasks or work effectively are the ones who get praised for everything and looked highly upon which i do not think is fair. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with customers and their pets.
good,"Took over a month to even start working. Everyone is overworked, expect too much for the pay, don't accommodate hours after working there for several months, always dirty and leave cleaning to one overnight. Only good thing were the seniors who were all dedicated and worked hard."
good,"It is difficult for employees to get raises and grow.  Some get management positions even though not as qualified as someone else.  Its politics based.  They have discriminated against my disabilities, since my disabilities are not necessarily physical.  Am tasked to do more physical work because others either complain or claim to not be able to physically do it.  Others are given breaks but I always have to ask for mine since I'm forgotten about."
good,"PetSmart was recently bought out by private investors.  Policies are rapidly changing. Many people are now out of a job. If corporate was as caring as the individual stores, then this company would still be a good one in my eyes.  Unfortunately, PetSmart is taking a turn for the worse."
good,"Since I am the Pet Care Manager I am responsible for the care of live animals. This includes training associates and educating new pet parents about their needs. Care and cleaning are the biggest part of my job. Knowledge about the pets we sell as well as dog and cat needs are necessary to work here. During the week there is usually only 3-4 people per shift to take care of the animals and business, weekends we usually have more staff but hours are very tight. My associates work very hard for me and I am very proud of the effort they put forth. The hardest part is trying to take care of the animals and their needs as well as take care of our customers, it is very stressful because the labor hours are very, very limited. I believe in hard work but sometimes I think they ask for a lot. The most enjoyable part is helping someone that appreciates it. There are numerous customers that have thanked me/us for all the help which helps take the sting out of the ones that are not so nice. I have learned a lot about animal care since starting here. I have also learned (long hard road) how to talk to people about the care and needs of animals. Of course, you can not please everyone all the time. I think our management team is pretty good, we all have our bumpy days but we try to accomplish what we need to do as a team."
good,"depending on the day it is typically slow. the people i work with i like but the customers not so much. they do work very well with me with my school, it is a good job if you are looking for something extra to do but not a life long job"
good,"good company , my store and department was lacking team work with co mangers and employees..."
good,"Cleaning of department, Customer Service, Make sure all products are pulled forward on shelves and restocked. Coworkers are great and knowledgable. No hard part of the job, best part of job is working with the animals."
good,"If you love pets, it's the perfect place to work and interact in a retail setting with out the same type of retail people.  Pet parents are a different kind of people and makes the whole work experience something everyone should experience at least once."
good,I really enjoyed my job. loved it actually. when I was with the dogs that is. I did meet some very nice people who feel the same.
good,"Great Animal Lovers,"
good,"come to work at 3 am 5 days a week"
good,Petsmart had many interesting customers that treated their pets as family
good,"I really liked working at Petsmart. I worked in the victorville location for 3 years and i loved working with animals, but it isn't fun and games. It is a typical retail store that requires a lot of hard work for minimum wage. Management is growing slowly and surely. Communication with your co-workers is key to productivity. I have made great friends and acquaintances while working here."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of:"
good,"a typical day at pet smart would include : helping customers, helping fellow employees thru out the store , helping the cashiers ring on the registers. while giving cash to cahiers if they were low . changing pricing on cat/dog food or other products in the store . and greeting all the animals that would enter the store"
good,"Long hours with short breaks. Starting pay isn't bad, but definitely not worth the trouble the managers put you through. Its still a place that will take care of your pet and give it the love and attention it deserves."
good,"While at PetSmart, I was one of the lead cashiers, I learned a lot about animals, and customer service."
good,"I was told there were steady raises and plenty of opportunity for advancement, unfortunately that wasn't true so i am looking for a position with better opportunities. "
good,Great place to work if you love interacting with pet parents and their pets.
good,"Typically a very hectic work day consisting of inventory control, stocking, receiving goods, etc. Upside is the interaction with customers and forming business relations. Downside is that work schedules are very inconsistent and long with very little vacation and not much in terms of annual monetary compensation."
good,"Although it does seem to get busy on weekends, we generally get the same customers. It is a fun environment specially for young adults, which is the general staff that you will find at these locations."
good,"I was a full time student at the time I held this position and I enjoyed working with the staff and it was enough to get by. Towards the end of my stay, I decided to leave to pursue a job involving computers instead of pets."
good,"Although the idea of a Pet store job is great, seeing cute animals all day; but Petsmart is not the company. My manger was mean and rasis, and sexis, he only hired ""hot""women who spoke spanish. and the district manger did nothing about it. if he worked that day no one was happy. But besides him our store manger rocked, always there to listen to you and help you out. Grooming salon was great, and co workers as well"
good,Petsmart has almost ridiculous standards they expect you to work. I got in trouble on my first day because I wasn't working fast enough. It was my FIRST day! And they wrote me up. That's rediculous
good,PetSmart is a great company to work for if you love animals. However I would be careful with management. They can be pretty unfair with hours but other then that it is a pretty good place to gain some retail experience.
good,We made sure to take pride in grooming and bathing the dogs that came into the salon. We made sure to take very good care of the pets in our care. We tried out best to make sure the customer was fully satisfied with our service.
good,"I personally enjoyed my job wholeheartedly, but management was definitely not the best. I enjoyed taking care of the animals at hand and all of the unique interactions that I shared with the customers, but management had a poor habit of becoming very insulting, unprofessional and short-tempered at times."
good,"The animals are cute and sometimes the guests let you pet them. Management is full of empty promises and they threaten you every day. Aside from that,  they love to shame you in front of the other employees with a chart of how many emails you change. Everyone who doesn't get so many per day has to talk to HR who just threatens to fire you and tells you to ask other employees how they get their numbers so high. Those employees will tell you flat out that they cheat. It's not worth it."
good,This isn’t the worst place I’ve been a groomer at. They focus on quantity over quality and the chance for moving up the ranks is slim and if you do it’s a railroad on you from Corp. good job but most definitely not forever.
good,"It is a good place to work, good first time job. But I want to go further with learning and get a higher position. It's very easy to learn, the other employees are always willing to help you. Good team work"
good,"PetSmart is a okay company to work in."
good,"I, like many; enjoy caring for animals. So, when I applied to PetSmart for a position as a PetCare Associate, I felt eager to work in an environment where I thought my years of experience would be embraced. I have worked in Pet Retail off and on for many years. At one time, I even owned my own store. I understand that the work can be challenging at times. (Trying to complete as many tasks as possible in a particular timeframe.) However, I truly believe that PetSmart has a false sense of reality when staffing for PetCare. Yes, PetCare is given a higher pay rate than most associates. But, be forewarned, you work for EVERY penny you earn.  In any other company within the pet industry where I have worked, care for animals was the responsibility of everyone in the store. However, it seems that at PetSmart, ALL care is given solely to PetCare Associates. That may sound fair to most. However, along with caring for a multitude of animals and keeping enclosures clean; you answer phones, you are a back up for registers, and of course customer service. The store where I am employed is rather small. And with the experience I have in the industry, I still struggle on a daily basis. I can only imagine the level of stress put on PetCare Associates at larger locations. The location where I am employed claims that we work as a team. However, if a particular task is not completed during your shift, it does not carry over to the next shift.  There is absolutely NO team work.  And then the following day you are chastised for not completing a task. I guess they should hire amoebas that can divide"
good,The people who work there are very nice and kind and gave amazing customer service. I would recommend petsmart for any pet owner beginners. They also do grooming.
good,This no longer applies as once my case was investigated the Operation Manager and the Store Manager were both terminated. I absolutely loved Petsmart with my whole heart. It took 1 dirty manager to destroy my job. I had no back up because I was not a manger. I complained of the ops manager coming to work drunk and no one listened. Well now years later I often see her on arrest reports. She’s had 2 DUI’s this year alone. I find solace in the fact I was right. The company could be great if they actually investigated complaints. Trusting in your team is important. They failed by only trusting in management which they eventually saw was corrupt.
good,"Low pay, Bad hours. Management is so focused on bonuses set un achievable goals. False promises made by DM about advancement to keep employees. Needs 150 characters to know its a poor job."
good,"It was fun at first, but after a while it seems like everyone cares much less about you. This includes management, coworkers, HR, and even the people you don't really see that often."
good,Applied for several career advancement opportunities at the other Petsmart stores and was turned down. The store managers are a joke. Poor management. Upper management is not held accountable. Required to work all holidays. Schedule constantly changes with no 2 days off in a row. Hours are always short in retail. Health care coverage is mediocre.
good,"I love working with animals, that's the one and only good thing I can say about working for petsmart. It has become extremely obvious over the years that they are all about numbers and ""the customer is always right"". They couldn't care less about their employees."
good,Overall I exceeded in my job duties and did not receive job rasies or advancement opportunities within the company. I was front head of sales donations received and never received my raise that i was well deserved of that why i left and moved elsewhere but it slowly improved towards the of my job once we got new management in there.
good,"As a first job, it wasn't the greatest experience and there were some really stressful moments. I volunteered there for months before they hired me, it was extremely fast paced and management was harsh."
good,"Unsupportive management styles. From top down, there is no support for management. Work is demanded outside of scheduled hours. Work-Life balance is nonexistent."
good,"Through working at Petsmart, I got to experience a large variety of different dog and cat breeds and behaviors. Sometimes it was wonderful, other times it was stressful. It's fulfilling to work with the dogs and I made some lasting friendships with coworkers and pet parents alike. Plus, close contact with animals!"
good,"When I first started out at Petsmart it was a fun and exciting environment. However, as I have progressed with this job, there have been situations that stuck out that to me. Whether its been my hours be cut drastically, communication problems, and managers not doing their jobs. It has made working there more of a struggle than any other job I've worked."
good,"I worked for the company for many years and under a few different superiors. The most recent DL was too much though. Showing up at the store 3-4 times a week (sometimes more) thus preventing you from focusing on your weekly tasks. Taking up HOURS of your day with the latest ""critical"" issue. NEVER having positive feedback for your previous accomplishments. It sounds like hyperbole, but many of the upper management from various stores have quit or resigned due to this overly intense leader. I personally knew 4 of them and they all said the same reason for why they bailed. The company really needs to stop ignoring the multiple care-line calls regarding this aggressiveness. It's too late for me, but hopefully, others can be saved."
good,It was tough to work with a manager/co-manager that don't want you to advance because of the color of your skin. Never had I ever worked with 2 racist managers before.
good,The job was great loved working with all the animals also loved helping people learn about taking care of animals. The hardest part of the job is cleaning all the animals.
good,"Petsmart is great if you like animals and caring for them. hours are always available and flexible. retail is always tough so this isn't any better than working in a clothing store, customers are just as stressful to deal with."
good,"The general vibe out on the floor of the store is really nice. Everyone knows everybody else, we joke with each other, and we stand by one another. They are well-trained, and they're chill with each other. In the back of house, it's a completely different story. "
good,"Discount is standard 15% except on their rare 30% days, which helps if you have pets. Worked in the grooming salon and most of the people were pleasant and seemed to care about clients and their pets, but the few who didn't got away with a lot before Petsmart finally terminated them. Many groomers treat bathers badly, even though most of us start out in that position before becoming groomers--bossing them around, not wanting to give them space to work, unwilling to help them when they need it, acring better/more important."
good,Low pay for the responsibilities and hours of work. With little to no opportunities for promotion. It was hard to make ends meat with what they paid..
good,"Working here was nice, I enjoyed the customers and my previous coworkers. I went to school as a veterinary assistant and I was working here for more experience working with pets. This was my first ""real"" job so I don't quite remember all of the benefits. I was part time while going to college."
good,"Petsmart was an okay place to work at if you want to do a lot of work and never get the opportunity to move up.they will always pick an outside candidate, so they don’t have to fill in for your job. They give you a lot of responsibility with little pay. And will alter your hours so you don’t get overtime."
good,I'm not sure about other petsmarts but my particular store jad very poor management and communication. The open door policy was a joke the manager are not accommodating or caring of their employees. The only way to get treated remotely fairly or to be able to move up is to stay out of the way even if it means breaking rules and being out of regulation.
good,"You will see all kinds of different things in a day "
good,"I would  like to work there full time with more pay and insurance. If there were more opportunities for advancement, I would like to pursue a management career, as I do enjoy working with the animals."
good,"Becoming a trainer requires additional study and time, as well as patience with animals and people. For those interested in pursuing a career as a trainer, this may be a good place to start."
good,"LOVED going to work for the animals I bonded with, unfortunately it was hard to make the store better for them. Cleanliness and safety tends to get put on the back burner due to fast work pace and lack of staff on any given shift."
good,I took a part time summer job at PetSmart and it was stressful. We were always just barely staffed to the point that there would be 3 of us in the building. The managers were mean and would intimate customers at times. They were very strict about the time off policy even though I would give my requests weeks in advance.
good,"Fast paced, hard work, stressful, a constant battle with the hours given and trying to stay in budget: but on the flip side, it can be very boring at times, slow, and hard to please customers"
good,You get burned out quickly because of sales plans and there is very little room for advancement. Great to be around the customers and there pet/s and they appreciate all your help and come back to see you regularly.
good,Loved getting to supervise and play with dogs during a typical daycamp shift. Workplace culture included extremely poor management. Coworkers were friendly and a genuine pleasure to be teamed with. Managers need to be retrained to refrain from taking their emotions out on their own staff.
good,"I would constantly throw my back out every week because I was always having to lift bags of dog food that would sometimes weigh up to 65 lbs on to high shelves and on top of each other for storage by myself as a small woman. They also do not put effort into finding good quality breeders for their animals, so many sick ones would come in and would not be able to be sell-able."
good,This was a great job to have when I was going through college because they always worked with my school schedule. It was also great to get an introduction into the animal world.
good,"Typical day at work was fun and rewarding, you got to interact with many good customers and very well trained dogs. What I've learnt from PetSmart was helpful to my next step in my career. Management was always there to go above and beyond to help you and teach you things. The work place was always what made it hard to come to work. It always felt like a competition back there and we are supposed to be a team. The most enjoyable part of the job were the dogs and some of your team members. You really feel like a family when you grove with the right people in the hotel."
good,"Most of the time, we were understaffed and it made it stressful for certain positions to get their daily activities done. Also the management doesnt seem to care too much about the animal care as much as I expected."
good,The Work place is very un organized  no communication  between the managers   And there is never enough employees  working to satisfy the amount of customers on any given day  the employees don’t care about their job but management and employees get along great together everyone is very nice to work with but can tell ninety percent don’t like their job to much work for such little pay
good,"My time at petsmart was a rollercoaster. I worked very hard for 3 years and loved taking care of the animals in store. But it's hard to move up in that company unless you know someone. Like any retail store, it gets very crazy and stressful."
good,I was a dog groomer.  I learned many different types of grooming styles.  The dog owners love their pets and I liked seeing happy faces when I brought their finished dogs out to them.
good,Enjoyable work with animals however there is lack of advancement opportunities. After applying twice for a salon leader position but passed over it was made clear that it is not what you know or degrees you possess but who you know.
good,"It was a good experience until, most employees never showed for work. I personally wish they could have let me learn more animal care because of what I wanted to learn and be as a growing associate."
good,"I was in the petcare department, though also trained for cashier and hotel. "
good,"really hard to make enough to survive at only 25 hours a week, workers are really nice though and tend to be helpful. management tries but they can only do so much."
good,Working with management was difficult but working with the animals made it better. Hours were hard to come by as well as a raise in that work environment
good,The store I worked at was very poorly managed. The store manager was very passive agressive and never left the office. The managers would always call on my days off begging me to come in and at one point would tell my friends who worked there to call me and ask if I would come in. Very unprofessional.
good,"This used to be a great place to work when I first joined them! After rumors of a sale and the eventual takeover, things went downhill at a dizzying rate. Things are still confused. It is a very ageist culture, especially their HR Department. If you are not very young, your resume will not even be considered."
good,"Greeting mainly the pets, and pet parent"
good,I feel petsmart does not pay its employees fairly. The people on the bottom usually do the most work while management gets paid to do hardly anything. Has a high turn over rate because people leave unwilling to do the amount of work for such little pay.
good,"If you love working with dogs and cats then you would love it. However it does come at a price. The job doesn't offer many hours for entry level position such as ""Pet Care Specialist"". All PCS employees work part time unless they move up the employment ranks. I thought I could manage with that pay in the beginning, but after 8 months I am struggling financially. I asked upper management for more hours like full time, however, I never heard back regarding my request. "
good,"It was great to learn about the animals. However I wanted to get into the grooming program, which was why I started at PetSmart. Every time I asked to speak to management about this they said they were busy, so I ended up getting stuck as a cashier which was not at all what I wanted to do."
good,PetSmart is an okay place to work if you want to work somewhere that when you put in schedule changes and time off forms almost a month before you need it and they say that they did not see it and then you go and find the paper and show them.
good,"After working there for many years it is very trying on your health asthmas, allergies, back and wrist pains have all developed. Some managers treat you like your replaceable and less than. WE are responsible for so many other responsibilities besides grooming pets and are only paid %50 of our commission."
good,There is never a set schedule for anyone full-time. It seems there is more of a consideration for money than for the pets and employees' decisions rarely get backed up by their managers. There is no annual review unless your lucky and your job doesn't get changed without you knowing all the time.
good,"Applied multiple times (50 or so ) didn't get the position I applied for got stuck in a job that was emotionally draining on me. I have been a huge animal lover my entire life. So NOT being able to help puppies as young as 4 months and grown dogs up to the ages of 12 when all they needed was a personal touch and to know it was ok to be there in a kennel.....just about did me in emotionally.  I worked nights alone so the policies said I couldn't open a kennel or suite door for any situation or issue.for my safety. I did suggest a solution to solve that issue ...just have 2 staff in at night and that would have been better for the animals as they could have gotten the care and compassion they needed. Their comment was they couldn't afford another staff member to be paid at night...I am sorry to say the company cares more about the $$$ than any of the creatures they have in their care...very sad but true...So beware if you are an animal lover through and through you might not like what you see. Oh, and the hardest part of my job wasn't not attending to the dogs it was dumping buckets full of multiple dog excrement into a toilet after a day of daycare dogs. The worst smell you can imagine...wear a mask and gloves Health and Safety issue right there."
good,Great place to work if you can handle the stress of the day to day things. I loved my job at petsmart as a groomer but the salon manager was not the best person. She was constantly cutting the dogs and was very conniving.
good,"The managers were here and there, never really taught you enough to advance, but that's really all that comes with being a stocker. Thankfully my co-worker was helpful enough to teach me things and make the job worth while."
good,"Working there wasn't the worst, but it sure wasn't a picnic. My coworkers were rude and management never did anything about it. Corporate expectations were a nightmare too."
good,"Depending on the day, work can be slow or busy, scheduling is usually ran in 4 hour blocks. Lunches consisted of 30 minutes, and we were given 2 15 minute breaks if we worked 8 hours."
good,"Overall, the other employees are  very friendly and easy to get along. Expectations are very high and very hard to keep up with. Pets are allowed inside and make the job worthwhile."
good,"I can only speak for the Beverly Hills Location. I honestly feel that if the mangers weren't under so much stress from corporate, they can actually treat their employees better."
good,"There are generally no benefits. The best thing my job has to offer is that I get to work with dogs. The only way to have a full-time job in the grooming salon is to be a full-certified dog groomer, and the only way to advance as a dog groomer is to have a 2-year contract with PetSmart, for which you get paid hourly until you groom 200 specific dogs and then go through 6 months of 40% commission, upon which you will then get 50% of commission. My coworker currently making the most there gets about $1200 a week, and that's by taking at least 10 dogs a day, which is extremely stressful--most groomers here don't dare go over six. Is it worth the stress, let alone the lack of benefits?"
good,"I started at PetSmart as a Pet Care Associate, but changed to the Dog Trainer when the previous one quit. It is a very slow location and not many hours are offered."
good,was my first job learned how to deal with the public. Learned how to work a cash register. Management was friendly. The most enjoyable part was working in a pet friendly environment
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with, easy to get along with. There was an unfair push to get people to sign  up for email coupons, and if we did not meet the quota we were put on probation."
good,"Since they went with new owners, constantly changing what they expect. Everyone afraid of losing their job. Everyone out for themselves,  little to no teambuilding."
good,"A typical workday was stressful. I got a bite from a dog everyday. The worst part was management would do nothing about it. I developed tendinitis from my job and pet smart doesn't cover that. They told me that since it wasn't a sudden injury like a break of bite wound, they were in no way to blame."
good,"If your in the clique, then this job is great.  If your not in the clique, this job is horrible..   "
good,"I actually really enjoy working there. Working with the animals is so cool, and you learn so much about all the different kinds of animals they sell. The only problems are that the pay is too low and there is not enough hours."
good,"This is a good first job for people with a strong interest in animals.  Over my years, I experienced some really poor upper management and didn't see women in positions of power although they were the hardest working and smartest ones there."
good,"It's great for the first few years but everyone burns out after two or three years. There's a revolving door of co-workers, nobody lasts long which is depressing. It gets too competitive in the grooming salon, and there is a lot of drama. I'm looking forward to moving on. Oh, and in my three years there two co-workers got arrested for stealing. Shows you the kind of people they hire."
good,"As a groomer at Petsmart We were expected to have a certain amount in sales, we were pushed to get more add ons for grooms, in risk of losing our jobs. The longer I stayed the more it seemed the company cared more about the money the the quality of grooms and care for the customers and employees. Management tried to manage the grooming salon with no experience or clue as to how things actually worked in a grooming salon. Managers pushed us to take more dogs than we were comfortable with and to get them done as fast as possible."
good,"typical day was clocking in and start my cashier posistion, helping customers hardest part was my commute, live in lincoln, worked in sacramento, they refused to relocate me"
good,"Very reluctant to give raises, no two people are paid the same for the same job, and you are not allowed to discuss your pay with your co-workers. "
good,"I worked here for a year and i really enjoyed working with the animals. Coming from germany I found the living expectations for the animals very very underwhelming. "
good,"PetSmart is like any customer service job, it sucks but it has its perks like discounts and cool people to work with. Management is poor and corporate sucks. They don’t pay their people enough and don’t give long term employees chances to advance, they usually just hire someone else. They don’t really care unless they’re making money. They cut back on people’s hours and then wonder why things don’t get done. Poor communication."
good,"Manager did not get the schedule out in a timely manner, constant waves of new staff, lack of communication, a lot of back stabbing when it came to the managers. No breaks, no lunches, constantly doing tasks for other departments."
good,"The job was good, I learned more about dealing with many different types of people.  The downside was that the hours I was called in to work varied from full time to part time."
good,"It is a good place to work, if you enjoy working with animals.    But there is little opportunity for advancement.   a lot of favoritism from management."
good,"The job itself is quite enjoyable. Unprofessional work environment combined with poor management give regular tasks much unneeded stress. Safety policies that are put in place for the safety and well being of the employee or client are disregarded, to varying degrees,  on a regular basis. When concerns have been voiced to management or Human Resources little to no results have been found."
good,"It’s not great, but it’s not bad either"
good,NEW mangement has taken over now so i have no clue how the place is run myself but I hear it is worse than when I worked there 4 years ago. You can see all kinds of animals come in but you gotta clean up the mess if the owner doesnt
good,"The management at Petsmart really needs to be worked on. They promote people and do not train them properly. Managers are fraternizing, discriminating, and playing favorites. They do not follow protocol at all. I have been scheduled so many times with no one to cover my break."
good,Where it's going is in all direction.  Can't hold anyone as an associate because of it dirty ways.  Quick to fire you over anything. Has not maintained the promises it gives
good,"I enjoyed the job and being around the animals, but it was difficulty to focus on my job due to hostility and disrespect from a few certain groomers in the salon. If I could go back and work in store, as an animal care person, I would enjoy it more I believe."
good,"I love the girls I work with. I love what I do that's why I haven't quit in 2 years, but I have been promised for a yr an half to go to grooming school ,but won't give me a good reason not to"
good,"The beginning was great most of my mgr's where good, the mgr was very young and did not like older employees.  Very low pay with minimal raises, good benefits."
good,Petsmart use to be a great company to work for. We were bought out by a private corporation a few years ago. Since then it has gone downhill. Not enough people scheduled to work. Many times you are working alone. I am an opener which means I take care of all the animals. What can take a whole shift to be done correctly is now suppose to be done in 2 1/2 hours.  You can not give the quality of care that the animals need. The corporation only cares about making a profit. Not about the associates or the animals. The hardest part is watching sick animals die. Or having to sell them to a home you know is unsuitable. Most enjoyable is working with the animals. They have made it a very stressful job.
good,"I started with petsmart when the store was new. I left feeling sick with hatered for the new staff/ admin. So poorly managed, you don't get any real training, 1 week dose not get you ready to sell over 20 different types of animals. If the books from head office say it takes 5hrs to do a job, the managment will give you under 1h."
good,Each manager will tell you how to do you job their way. They expect a lot for a little pay. Don't work morning if you cant do well with lifting heavy things in the mornings. The good things are some bosses will give you free lunches/donuts. Get to see dogs every day. But that's about it. The staff is friendly but the company wants way too much done in way too short of time.
good,"I started working for Petsmart when they first opened their store locally about 16 years ago. It was fun and exciting to work there. Met lots of people and pets. Hours were good at first but as the years went by and the company was bought out it was not as fun to work there. I quit a year ago because the management expected a lot of extra things done but no extra compensation. Benefits are very poor with no insurance because they only hire part time except for management. I rarely got a break when working a four hour shift. Scheduling was poor. I never knew from one week to the next how many hours I would be getting, what days I would be working, and it made it difficult to schedule anything else in my life. It is a good job if you are not looking to make a lot of money and are very flexible with scheduling. Really wouldn't recommend it."
good,Will barely give you a raise and they do not advance people who have friends that work with them. They are afraid it will cause favoritism but it means they will hire people who know nothing and you will have to train your boss who will make way more money then you.
good,"its a good place to work. no matter what your position is, you are trained on the registers, so if they need help you are able to. "
good,Working with pets was the best part of this position. I worked as both a support manager as well as a lead in the pet care department. Long days and low pay.
good,"Now, the company itself wasn't too bad. I enjoyed working there - until I got my scheduled hours and paychecks. Upon hire I was promised 35 hours. I was being hands less than, average of 15-20. As well as, I got a promotion with no compensation."
good,Low pay and pressuring employees to get emails into the system in order to not have hours cut or be written up not cool. Definitely not somewhere to stick around for a long time. Management is great and support their staff to the best of their abilities.
good,"My experience was overall good. Management was a bit secretive and it was hard to trust them. However, I loved the pets and truly enjoyed working with them."
good,The job was dirty and I only groomed large dogs. I quit because I was on a weight limitation because I was pregnant and physically couldn't do my job anymore
good,the job was very hard and the pay wasn't good. the hours was the best of all 4 different shifts to choose to work on. Management sucks and some of the supervisors was good
good,"It is not a place fond of promoting within. The management switched to different stores often, so no one really knew about our store. They did give us Christmas gifts and treats in the breakroom. However, they required to me to bring in carts in the summer directly after I found out I was pregnant."
good,"Long hours for salaried management"
good,"Management does not show or  make you feel appreciated. Great employees, with good attitudes on weekend shift. When all is said and done, the company only sees you as a pawn, or a tool"
good,"The communication between the entire staff, especially between the different departments, is horrible. The lack of universal training between people in pet care is very annoying for the customers."
good,"On a typical day I would clean cages throughout my shift because although the management has a schedule for when cages are supposed to be cleaned, did not take into consideration how small the cages were and the number of animals per age which meant that they became dirty faster. I helped customers as much as I could when it came to the questions that I received about different animals but we did not carry necessary things for all of the animals that we stocked. Management pushed us to upsell and always have a customer buy something before they leave. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the hundreds of sick and dying animals in the store but the best part was the actual interaction with the animals."
good,"Working here has been very stressful on myself, there is a very big lack of good management and the employees are hard to work with. Being a cooperation it is very hard to understand some of the rules that are made up by people who haven't ever been in the employers position."
good,I loved working here I believed I was doing great I learned everything extremely quick a majority of the coworkers are nice and there's one amazing manager but besides that I felt like there was a lot of favoritism in the work place.
good,"I absolutely love getting to see all of the animals coming into the store. I love most of my coworkers, but there are a few that can make work a little stressful. 3/5 managers make work miserable sometimes. This has been my first job, and overall it has been pretty good."
good,fun to see all the dogs. customers can be friendly and some less friendly. they genuinely care about the animals. Great part time job for those earning a degree and need some income.
good,"being promoted to Pet care lead was the best part of working there "
good,"my Time at pet smart taught me that not all management is great management, and when you do have good management you will have a happy store. unfortunately our stores management was not the best at the time, and do to that and some unfortunate personal family issues PetSmart was not a good fit for me in the end."
good,Petsmart is a welcoming environment. Fun meeting puppies and helping pet parents spoil their pets. Being a dog bather is great experience getting to pamper pets for their families.
good,"As I spent lots of time in different departments, I spent the most time taking care of the animals and assisting customers with purchases. I learned a lot about caring for animals, and even more with dog and cat dietary needs. It was very easy to adjust with oher coworkers because we were all animal lovers and had their best intrest at heart. The absolute best part of the job was to be able to help customers fix their pets problems by finding appropriate products and fod to fit their needs. It was the best feeling when they would come back later and look for you and tell you the improvments their pets made after using some helpful products. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance multiple customers at a time when working in the back with the fish and insects."
good,"More than any other customer service job I've had, the customers at PetSmart are so needy! Its a headache only the cute dogs you frequently get to pet make it better than working at Walmart"
good,"Pay was good. "
good,"A typical day at work is very fun, when you're working independently. When you have managers and employers, that gang up against you, it's not fun."
good,Working at pert smart was fun but management made it hard at times.  They would make your schedule all over the place from 3 hour shifts or 10 hours a week when I was getting 25 hours.  I enjoyed helping people find what they need.
good,"This is a great job for those who  love animals, the pay is not great though, the hours are even worse. Management is not great, they could be better"
good,"Working for PetSmart was pretty enjoyable, up until the buy-out. Ever since then, it's become all about profit and less and less about animal care and customer service. The management lacks communication and team building skills. Also, it's very difficult to advance within the company. The company does not like to hold associates accountable for their actions, and it appears HR doesn't want to deal with any disciplinary issues that may arise and need taking care of, hence driving all the good employees out and ensuring the unsatisfactory ones stay."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was that no two days were the same. I enjoyed meeting every pet that worked through the door and speaking with Pet Parents regarding their fur babies needs.
good,"The job itself isn't bad, if not enjoyable most of the time. However, there isn't much, if any, room to move up in the company. Unless you can stand getting paid minimum wage and only working 20-30 hours a week. The company doesn't have many full time positions available, and the few it has are more than likely going to be filled by people who are more than comfortable in it. With persistence, patience(Like a lot), and a good attitude, PetSmart seems to have promising corporate careers."
good,"Shaving and general maintenance of dogs"
good,"A great jumping off point to make your way into animal related fields. Different stores will have different experiences. Some are great, some not so much."
good,"The workplace is made fun and we work as team. The hardest part is the schedule, never the same. Best part is the constant movement."
good,"it start out great with an awesome hotel manager but once she moved up in the company we got a new manager which the first few months the manager started 5 people quit in one week, the manager doesnt seem to care at all. the manager takes vacations even when we DONT HAVE ANYONE to work. the manager is hard to get a hold of. seniors will work long hours because people get sick. No overnighter stays too long. its not the great place. the only highlight is the dogs. those dogs are the best to work with."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced and stressful. Interacting with pets is great when tension is low. Co- workers were great, worked as a team. Management didn't seem to be on the same page."
good,Difficulty getting a full 40 hour work week. Not much room for advancement. Insurance benefits are expensive. Not very flexible in request for different shift.  Overall the work itself was enjoyable. I learned to operate newer machinery which was interesting and exciting. A typical work day starts with a pre-shift meeting & stretches to prepare for the workday.  We receive our assignments and off to work we go.  Once the assignments are completed the work day is done.
good,"Difficult to move up to different levels.  Management worked well usually, but would get difficult when staff was ill and couldn't come in. No benefits for part-time staff, only 30min for lunch.  Not allowed to sit for any thing.  "
good,"A typical day at work requires strong communication skills and multitasking to meet sales goals, engage with customers, and motivate associates to perform to the companies standards. What I have learned is how to approach sales goals and financial boundaries to meet needs for the store as well as make demand for the customer. Management is a true skill set that over time and dedication can be learned. Each manager has a friendly, can do attitude essential to customer care. Associates are always engaged and ready to help, and very informed about the animals and product that are sold. The most difficult part of the job is having to make sacrifices for the overall success of the store. Sometimes desires are not immediately available to associates but are put to consideration and discussed to determine what the next best step is to resolve such a need. The best part of the job is the team work and attitude of the environment. Everyone feeds off of the energy that is present throughout the store and deliver the best version of themselves everyday at work."
good,I learned how to properly reserve reservations for pet parents and how to assist them properly. The co-workers I work with were friendly and supervisors were helpful.
good,"Well, I started off at Petsmart really happy to work with animals, I took care of my own pets so I figured I may as well get a job doing what I am familiar with. I was rushed through training, so I don't feel I was properly trained in caring for the sick pet in the ISO (Isolation) room. Some of my co-workers were just as passionate about animals as me and gave me little tips. A typical day at work was cleaning pets cages or fish tanks, keeping shelves stocked, keeping isles clean, making sure the animals were fed. I would also take any sick looking pets to the Vet in the store, so I was definitely in constant observation of the pets while not working with the customers. I enjoyed speaking with customers, and answering all questions, making recommendations, and  helping them choose their new pet. Management could have been more professional, and that is all i will say on that note being that I want to remain professional."
good,"days at work were long, co-workers were amazing, manager was horrible, hardest part of the job is when there were no customers."
good,Management really has no idea what they are doing. The scheduling is horrible. Most of the time it smells bad. People there do not know how to train new employees.
good,"Policies and Procedures are continually preached at you, however, rarely adhered to.  Qualified employees are given menial tasks, while inexperienced people are promoted.  The only time any work gets done, and the store looks presentable is when the District Manager comes for a visit.  Animals aren't looked after, and fish and reptiles are continually sick or dying due to new employees being put into Pet Care with no experience and/or training whatsoever.  Store is under-stocked and filthy.  Sales are the primary focus, not the animals.  Employee turn-around is incredible, and no one seems to stay employed there for long."
good,We remodeled the whole store. Restocked the store and setup new displays for the whole store. Co-workers were great to work with.
good,"A typical day at work would be standing at the register ringing out goods for customers and assisting with returns, facing the shelves (making sure the labels are facing the correct way, making sure the product is pulled forward and making sure the UPC code is in-sync with the product lined above) or customer assistance (Walking down isles of the store asking any confused looking customers if they could use your assistance). I've learned many things about pet food that i did not know before. Such as, Blue Buffalo is the only brand Petsmart carries that has Life Source Bits. As a customer, the management is always willing to help find a solution to any problem you may be having. Petsmart provides an open door policy (If your having an issue or need to talk to a manager about something and the manager you chose to talk to does not help you with whatever issue your having, you can go to a higher up manager for help) so as an employee, if your trying to get cross trained (trained to work in more than one area of the store) it seems almost impossible to get any one of the managers to try and help you with that. The co-workers were very nice and helpful with my training and all questions i had. The hardest part of the job, for myself, was to get a manager to cross train me to work in more than just my department. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the customers who came in that you could have a conversation with and relate to since they were pet lovers as well."
good,"I'd have to say a typical day at my job is stressful. It is so fast-paced and there is never a dull moment. I am looking for another job because I barely get time to breathe. It is supposed to be a ""team effort"" in the salon but it hardly is. Sometimes I struggle with aggressive or uncooperative dogs and nobody is willing to help. I am a team player and I always help others out so it's frustrating when I don't get that in return. Aside from all the drama, I do enjoy my job for the most part but it seems like most of the time the bad outweighs the good. I just wish I had a job I could be glad to go to."
good,Made some money but not enough. Friendly co-workers. No communication between management.
good,"I loved working with the animals at PetSmart. Especially the cats and dogs that come in for adoption. My co-workers were great, but management was mediocre. The work was fun though and I loved having guests that would come in regularly and talk to me about their pets."
good,"PetSmart was a great learning experience for me. I had to take on all sorts of new tasks being the dog trainer there and gained mountains of sales experience doing so. "
good,"A decent place to work, can feel like work is more important than you or family at times"
good,You'll enjoy working at PetSmart if you love animals and you are a very friendly person.
good,"Start the day by clocking in getting started with all the task, I had a routine I would do to get things done I know I did my job good my previous Job at the city were the supervisors there always let me know how much help I was, so this job was no different.  The management wasnt always together but I didnt let that get in the way of my job duties without any struggle.  The most enjoyable part of it all was just being productive."
good,"I absolutely loved working here, but the management was horrible, they scheduled me little to no hours and the pay was less than acceptable."
good,I really liked working at petsmart but unfortunatly had to quit due to personal problems. Management was willing to work around my second jobs schedule. They let you take your time for training and certification. Staff was fun and happy. Many of the pets did not like the services provided but most customers where understanding.
good,"A place with no real advancement. Ideal if you need summer income, but as a long term, it would be wise to search for something a little more substantial."
good,"Get ready to be over worked and underpaid."
good,"I use to love grooming now I hate being at Petsmart.I use to be able to groom 6 or more dogs in a day, but the company really broke my spirit. Management goes overboard to try to make themselves look good."
good,"Great part time job, was fun working with Animals. Ran Cash Register, Stocked Store and maintained all store Animals. Management was great, Co-workers were great. Downside would be that there was no flexibility with time off or no opportunity to grow within the company or receive any raises. Also conflicted with my schedule at the time.   "
good,"run shifts AM/PM shifts.. i learned a lot dealing with boarding cats&dogs,giving meds to pets.. Management was good until they changed the head store managers and wanted to change the hotels rules that we all have been use too for over 4 years.. I got along with all my co-workers except the one that got caught hiting a dog.. The hardest part of my job was to call a petparent letting them know that their dog was in a fight or got hurt during doggie daycamp.. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know all the petparents /being able to watch all the cute lovable pets..Puts a smile on my face"
good,The management was not good and the company as a whole is very centered on money. As an employee you are not really scene as a person your scene as a tool for them to make more money
good,"This is a fun up beat place to work, but that's only 75% of the time."
good,too much work not enough hours.overall good people and good environment.
good,"Taking Care And Supervision Of Other Owners Pets Was Fun , The Only Problem Was The Managment Team and Badly Organization , communication."
good,"Best job I ever had. Learned much about management. No commission on sales, but sales were easy especially for animal lovers."
good,"When I worked there I was a college student. I enjoyed my job but some of the people I worked with just were not interested in being part of a team. Lots of gossiping, back talking, and just overall a dreary environment. I always try to find the good in a job and like I said, my actual job was great but I'm a firm believer that the people you work with can also make or break it. For me, that was the case."
good,"I worked as a cashier at Petsmart for over three years. I loved working with animals, and any obtuse customers were forgotten when I got to see my four-legged friends. However, beyond that, it was a little lackluster. I was devoted to my job, and spent countless unpaid hours at home learning all I could about our products to better serve my customers when they had questions. I expressed interest in moving up in the company several times, and was always passed up, most of the time for outside hires which sometimes didn't work out anyway. It was frustrating to love the work but not have the work love you back. Had mildly flexible hours for us part-time associates, but I know for some full-time lower management employees, they were threatened with termination for trying to go back to school. For other part-time employees with stricter schedules, like those going to school or who worked another job, they were offered four to eight hours per week, which you can't live on at all. All that aside... I do have very fond memories working there, and loved working for a company that is so involved in charity."
good,"The job itself is fun and energetic. This job shows you how to improve your customer service, people skills, animal skills, and social skills."
good,I enjoyed the daily encounters with my customers and their dogs. The fast-paced environment kept me healthy and fit. My co-workers and I would have a lot of fun together. It was really hard to get some customers to understand that I would try to give the best haircut for the health of the dog (matted dogs had to be shaved down so that it wouldn't hurt them to pull out the mats). When the dogs would have a great time and enjoy being groomed made my day the best day ever!
good,i loved working with the animals but the mangment in dallas the one i was in was un willing to help me to sucsed to be a groomer i was being held back no reason why.
good,"management does not care about the employees here. the most enjoyable part of working here was the pets i got to deal with regularly. all they care about here is money money money. it was very comon for them to expect us to take on more than the required amount of grooming apointments, even though they ""promote"" safety first. they will throw you under the bus to save themselves."
good,"The management is great, great co-workers , but corporate is no help, they come out with ideas that required more payroll and more budget but want the store to deliver with out payroll and budget."
good,"if things weren't so micromanaged, it always feel like the corporate level is very disconnected, they do know what real expectations are at the store level. management is not that flexible with scheduling."
good,I did enjoy the job itself but I cannot say the same for management.
good,I enjoying working for Petsmart. It was a great place to get my foot in the workforce.
good,"I started this job as a seasonal working and quickly advanced to an assistant management position within a a few months. After that period of time for training had passed, I noticed a lot of other employees weren't holding up their end of the employment agreement, and had to act as a manager should. Ultimately the workplace was acceptable, if not small, and inclusive of its customer's values as well as the employees."
good,"I love working with animals and helping people who are passionate about their pets and helping them. The job is very stressful, as you are expected to help every customer in every department, especially with small animals and for phone calls."
good,The job itself is nice and its decently easy. The issue is that the managers expect too much in too short of an amount of time and don't care about anything else. There is one manager specifically that will do anything in her power to ruin your day.
good,Great customer relationships good relationships with management. Coworkers work together in order to efficiently get work loads completed. Get to work with many different types of animals.
good,I was able to gain a lot of knowledge and experience from this job. For the most part it was fun to help customers take care of their pets. You have to be on your feet a lot and have a good amount of strength for this job. They give you the opportunity to work in other parts of the store as well.
good,"Been with PetSmart for almost a year now. Your experience will definitely depend on your store. Some PetSmarts are thriving and others are going down the drain. Being a Bather is a difficult job. You're responsible for lots of things and sometimes treated like less since you're not a groomer. If you love animals, you'll be fine."
good,"After nearly 2 years with the company, I've applied to at least 3 different positions (1 position twice) and was declined each time with poor explanation. It seemed that the leadership wasn't interested in me advancing, despite saying otherwise. I am a consistently reliable and hard-working employee who gets along with everyone there, so it seems suspicious that leadership doesn't want me to advance."
good,"Some aspects of working at PetSmart are really great. I have learned to be the best possible pet parent I can be, and I love that. I know so much about food, litter, etc. that I likely wouldn't have learned otherwise. It's also a huge relief to be able to spend my days with coworkers who care about animals as much as I do. I would also note that management at this location is very good about working with your non-PetSmart schedule. So if you've got school, another job, or just a life to live in general, they're good about giving you the space for those other things. Plus, you also earn vacation and sick time-- not a ton as a part-timer, but it's something."
good,"At PetSmart I was a senior pet care associate, my main responsibilities were the well-being of all the animals sold at the store. The care consisted of feeding watering and a general health check of all animals on the floor including rodents, birds, reptiles, and fish. I also completed nightly checks on any sick or injured animals and administered medication."
good,"The hours were very flexible with my school schedule but that's because they hardly ever let me work, I was constantly making less than $100 per week and have to constantly handle and provide customer service to people that spend more than my pay check every time they come to the register. My paycheck wasn't even worth two bags of dog food."
good,"This was my first job & it helped me learn what a busy environment is like. The management was very bad. Coworkers were okay. Usually one person is at register, one at the fish section, and one doing stock so when it got busy it was horrendous. Pay is awful, hours are awful."
good,I have been to 5 different petsmart locations and its always management that needs the most improvement. I have seen many managers get away with harassing and bullying employees here within the company. Also the way that they trained me to be a groomer is ridiculous. They now have a more extensive training and pay for the new groomer tools.
good,"When I first got this job, I absolutely loved it. My managers were phenomenal and there was a lot of promise of myself moving up in the company. However, we had new management come in, which completely changed the moral of all the workers in the store. I have almost walked out of the job on multiple occasions due to demeaning behavior by the highest paid managers in the store and I plan to put in my 2 weeks the moment I have another position lined up. Its amazing how much of a difference good and bad managers make in a small store such as petsmart."
good,At my location we went through 12 store managers they always have their own agenda. The company continued to change their mission statement and the new owners are all for profit
good,"I was a part-time pet care associate. I was usually scheduled for two days a week. Which ended up being 10-13 hours a week. Pay was weekly. My store did not have A/C at all, and the store leader did nothing about it. It was over a hundred degrees outside. Pet care always ended up with so many customers. And there was only one pet care associate per shift. It was overwhelming."
good,"At the time I was at Petsmart I honestly didn’t like it . The pay was poor, and the management wasn’t up to par . We always had very little time to finish a nice amount of stuff ."
good,"I loved this job at first, but as I continued to work there, Corporate added more and more rules to follow that made the atmosphere less fun and taking care of the animals more difficult."
good,Was training a dog class and a women punched her dog and nothing was done about it. I decided I didn’t want to do the classes anymore because of her hitting her dog more than once and I got told I was wrong for it and I could either quit or work less than 10 hours a week.
good,Animals are not truly valued as much as they seem to and people are valued even less. Unrealistic expectations and unhealthy work environment. Seniority and management popularity contests present.
good,"Hours were all over the place, closing manager over plan-o-grams was great. Helped us learn new things and kept us up to date on everything. Co-workers were great and willing to help each other."
good,you must be hard working and try to avoid drama as there is quite a bit of it in the store.  must have knowledge about alot of animals and how to take care of them.  each animal has specific needs and if you dont know it you can sometimes ask for help but not always
good,"PetSmart was okay to work for. I was hired to be a care associate, but was told I had to train on the register for a week before they would move me over. I worked there for 6 months and never once got moved off the cash register. Salary is minimum and not a livable wage."
good,Very stressful place to work with not good pay. I made many great friends there but the work place itself leaves a lot to be desired. Not a good place to work long term
good,"Management wouldnt listen to what was going on behind closed doors. i was once threatened by an associate for following the proper feeding guides for the animals because i did not feed the fancy food that she had brought in to provide for said animals. I was uncomfortable and when brought to the manager i was told ""Well thats how she is"". so i went up one more level cause it was super unprofessional and she was dealt with. I left soon after as another associate tried to make it look like i had stolen a snake and tried to frame me for it, even though the night the snake went missing i was not working, he was."
good,"I worked at the PetHotel part for 3 years. When I first started I was promoted to Senior in 6 months. The difference between my starting position as a Pet Care Specialist (daycamp Associate) and Senior Pet Care Specialist is a set of keys to access the medicine cabinet, numbers to log onto the register,  and dealing with customers more. I needed another job to help with bills and unfortunately, you can't be a Senior AND have another job because it messes up your availability. So I stepped down to be a daycamp associate again. Anyway, unless you want to work in the store, there really is no room for advancement. But it was nice seeing all the pets."
good,management was terrible the bonuses were great but the supervisors never did things they were supposed to do and if they did it was way late for the most part of the job you never saw them anyway
good,"I worked there for a good few months before I got told I needed surgery. I told my manager this and went off to get my surgery. I wasn't given time off, I didn't receive workers comp. They terminated me for not being able to work after surgery."
good,Little to no support from management staff. Management has difficulty keeping employees information confidential with other employees and management staff. Huge turnover rate with employees and managers. More like a high school than a retail corporation
good,"Fun place to work.  I really enjoyed working in this store learning all that I did. My only complaint is the Management is very poor. If you are not in the cool kids circle you won’t be promoted. I spent 5 years there doing my very best keeping all customers happy, and doing the managers job. Yet I couldn’t get promoted to a simple managers position. Instead they gave it to the new people who were younger and had no experience at all."
good,There is always something to do at Petsmart. Very little downtime. I haven't learned anything new at Petsmart in regards to my role that wasn't carried over from my previous employments. The hardest part of the job is lifting fish tanks that weigh over two hundred pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with dogs and cats as well as other various animals.
good,"Petsmart is a good company, overall.  Recent years management has changed several times.   It is my opinion that management is slowly ruining a great place to work."
good,"It’s not a hard job to do and can be nice to work with a lot of animals. It’s fast-paced on busy days and can get stressful, but the slower, more relaxed days help balance. The people you work with can truly make it or break it. Those pretty much become your support system in the work field. The manager is what forces all of you to cooperate, since all they did was sit inside the office. The assistant manager was no help to that at all. They definitely play favorites and you can tell pretty easily. If you’re trained extremely slowly, then congrats you’re at the bottom of the pyramid. You want promises of promotion dangled over your head like a dog? Then it’s the job for you. The company itself barely cares too. It’s all about image."
good,"PetSmart was a fun place to work, if you're an animal lover. Management was relaxed. People are nice. They rotated people to work the register, so one person wasn't stuck there all day. Pay was on the low side, just above minimum. No real benefits. Nice discounts."
good,The pay does nothing to compensate for the amount of stress leveled on the employees. That coupled with inconsistent hours made me want to leave this position.
good,"When I first started there we had an awesome mix of customer service and service to the animals; taking care of them and ensuring clean habitats. Slowly over time whether it was corporate or our managers they've told us that customers matter more than the safety of our animals and that we should do just as the customer says. If that endangers an animal I'm very against it so I won't sell it if I feel they won't treat it right. However it's still a very nice place to be, mostly very fun and nice people to be around; my managers have always backed me up to those rude customers."
good,The manager was very nice but he allowed other workers to not finish tasks and to push them off onto others. People who worked hard just ended up with more work. Those who were lazy got away with it. Starting pay is 8.00 an hour. After working there for two years and with positive reviews I still only made 8.65 an hour.
good,"I enjoyed my experience working with other clients pets, but I struggled with some of my employees. They were not always appropriate at times, but I knew it was a temporary job for the time."
good,Hardest part of my job was getting people to do there job. Sounds simple. My last year the company went to self reporting style system. Associates would use this to get out of their responsibilities. This made my ability to do administrative paperwork difficult because to often I was picking up the slack.
good,"The store I worked for had poor management, horrible scheduling, and a huge lack of teamwork. I came in to my position hopeful and happy to work with the animals, but most of my other employees did not have their best interest in mind. However, I was able to spend some time at another store in the area in order to fill some hours, and they were absolutely wonderful. The management was understanding and willing to work with you, the other employees formed a wonderful team, and the health of the animals was at the forefront of the group's concern. I guess it depends on the store you wind up at."
good,"Enjoyable workplace if you have a love for animals. "
good,"During my time here, I did learn a lot and had great coworker experiences. I had great clients that would only request me but I still left due to management. I wanted to advance into grooming but nothing happened and they kept making mistakes in the process. If you really love washing dogs all day, then this is for you but the bathers get the most weight on their shoulders with the always changing policies. Daily tasks on top of being overbooked most of the time, just wasn't worth the stress."
good,"Expectations and coinciding limitations (payroll especially) prevent you from effectively running a store. They don't care as much for the animals in the store as they want you to believe. When I started, it was all about culture, but became all about numbers when the company was bought out by BC Partners."
good,"This job wasnt what it was all cracked up to be.  The management expected way to much from us, and in order to put stuff out on the store floor, there were a lot of safety hazards.  one manager didnt show up on time to start working, but the other managers were awesome and understanding.  must be very physically fit to do this job, and no a lot about dog/cat food and other products.  bonus was seeing the kittens/lizards/frogs/snakes/hamsters and fish every work day."
good,"Most of the dogs are good (except some who might nip and fight for the nail trims which is pretty ""normal""). "
good,"I have worked for multiple PetSmart locations and been in many different positions. That being said, the culture is good most of the time, but unfortunately the company, in general, does not provide enough support, training, and in general, money to help the stores succeed. Management in general scrapes to get by. They are very overworked, the expectations are really stupid, and corporate is not in touch with reality at all when it comes to working in store. They could be great, but continue to make bad business decisions, and this gives the store, in general, a high burn out rate."
good,"PetSmart was, until a few years ago, a best in class place to work.  They had excellent training, succession and mentor programs.  Hiring was typically from within.  The company was successful most years.  Pay was decent and bonuses were quite good.  "
good,"I've been with this company a long time and the managers come and go. They're cutthroat with each other.  As long as you stay an associate you're fine. It's really hard to get full time, and if you do you have to have open availability.  There are good vacation and sick time for full time and the money is fair for retail, but you're not gonna get rich.  There's some pressure to sell (coupon books, upselling, etc) at the cashier level especially.  Again, the pressure depends on the manager.  It's nice to be around animals, it stinks to have to deal with angry customers and grumpy managers."
good,"I work in the salon and it’s not what many people think it is. As an entry level bather it’s pretty difficult to have between 4-8 appointments and expect to do all the walk in services (mainly nail trims), but if you stick it out and become a groomer it’s pretty rewarding especially if you’re able to sell stuff. We get 50% of our sales so the more you hustle the better the pay check.  It gets chaotic on weekends when you’re trying to work on your appointment that you need done by a certain time while answering phones, checking in pets and taking them out, sweeping, etc.."
good,"Was there off and on for 5 years. No raises, no moving up. I worked over all the time and no getting over 20 hours a week. The discounts were good and flexible hours. I trained as a bather as well and still did not ever get full time hours. It is a great job for part time but you can not move up! I am diabetic and my sugar was getting low. They made me wait an hour before I could even eat something. I was furious! They kept saying I had to wait on another manager to come in, knowing they had someone to cover my break. If you do not work over 6 hours you get no break!"
good,"When I first started my job at PetSmart I was incredibly excited to work there because I love animals, and I couldn't wait to take care of them. As time went by I realized that a lot of my co-workers wouldn't do their jobs properly and all of their slack would be left for me to do, and I felt like I was always under-estimated. So many customers would come in and talk about their negative past shopping experiences there because the employees were rude and disrespectful to them, but they would always say how helpful I was and always thanked me. I learned how to take care of many different types of animals, and that was the most enjoyable part of my job. If it wasn't for some of the rude and incompetent co-workers, I would still be there because I love animals."
good,"If you like caring for animals it can be good, but unless you move up the pay is pretty low, even then not that high paying. And some employees did not take care of the animals as best as possible."
good,"It was my first job working with animals so I was very grateful for the opportunity. I did pretty much everything there, overnights, daycare and bathing. The hotel manager was a little crazy, super nice one moment then psychotic the next. Weird rules such as not being allowed to interact with pets until someone else was in the store around 4 am..which made no sense cause they were nowhere near the petshotel anyway. The grooming salon was your typical salon..insanely catty. Second id walk in the room half the time they would just go silent when I had done nothing wrong. Really liked the manager but most of the ""stylists"" thought they were so much better than they were. After working in real salons I realized they were such a joke. They do take abuse seriously there though, one woman got fired for hitting a dog in the bathing area. I don't regret working there because it presented so many other opportunities for me, but I could never work there long term."
good,good for someone who only needs a few hours a week and is really flexible with hours. for how hard you work you don't really get paid very much. they don't give you the same amount of hours every week so planning my bills was very difficult and caused me to be late a lot on them
good,"Immediate boss loved all the animals in the store and made sure that we(her team) felt the same."
good,They did give accurate information to me about how commission works and they underpay their staff. Manager is unorganized and hardly ever gets the schedule out on time.
good,"As a dog trainer I was fortunate to always be able to break away and make personal connections with my students and their dogs. Hardest part was being so short staffed all the time, and management not working well together."
good,"A ""typical day"" at PetSmart does not exist. Obviously weekends and holidays are busiest because most people are off from work. Other than groomers, management are the only full time employees, which sometimes can make things difficult. The most difficult part of my job is the never ending additional responsibilities, policies and procedures, and communicating all of these changes to staff. "
good,"I applied to be a stock associate, but was trained to basically work at ever part of the store. The hours are pretty inconsistent, so you won't make enough to make a living and probably want another job. It is pretty fast-paced. My managers haven't been bad and my coworkers are friendly so it isn't all bad. "
good,Ok starting job. On my worst day I get yelled at scammed and clean up after dogs in the store. On my best day I am greeted by puppy kisses and cute kittens as well as new pet parents. This is a great place to see if you want to stay working with animal's. I'm currently in school for my veterinary certificate. The reason I'm choosing to leave is because it's very hard to become full-time here. In order to get my benefits I need to be full time
good,"There's a lot of maintenance one must do for this job, but it was very fun and worth while.  The managers were always approachable so i felt like I could ask questions without feeling down.  The co-workers were really cool from what i remember."
good,"Enjoyable parts of the job: Tons of pets to greet and interact with"
good,"If you enjoy working with animals, and with people, this is an alright job if you can handle stressful situations well and have a small amount of basic knowledge of owning a pet. However, if you REALLY love animals, and are a strong advocate for their well-being and proper care and treatment, this is probably not a good fit for you. You will witness some ill, injured, and poorly cared-for animals in store as well as customers with pets kept in below-standard conditions. You will have to advocate for the sale of impractical and too-small animal habitats, unhealthy food, and support impulse-buys of live animals."
good,"Great team"
good,"I worked as a product associate (stocker) and cashier for a little over a year. My typical day consisted of coming in at 4am (sometimes earlier depending on holidays) and leaving around 10am, after working as cashier once the store opened. I learned a lot about inventory control and management, as well as strict time management."
good,"The salon is notorious for being super stressful. The money is good of you work hard, but management makes life miserable. The management is so concerned with pleasing the clients that they spit all over the groomers and force them to do tasks that aren't safe. They are more focused on the amount of dogs groomed rather than the actual quality which upsets the groomer who take pride in their work. There was a previous salon manager that went out if her way to try and fire people for no reason."
good,They don't offer many work hours. Not enough to balance life or make ends meet. The most I've worked was 13 hours a week. The least was 3 hours. The new employers never get a chance.
good,"Pet Smart takes  a lot of inspiration from our pets. Their companionship, intelligence and energy are what motivate us to bring the best of ourselves to work each day. As our associates are focused on ensuring pets’ lives are happy and healthy, we’re busy making sure every corner of our organization is a happy and healthy place to work, too."
good,Too corpritsized! Did not care about the employees as long as quota was met and stock was placed on the shelves. All Dogs must be groomed and you must be clocked in and out according to time clock times set by corporate which made it very hard to do your work. Very hard work environment! Cared more about paper work then pets!
good,This job is stressful and not for those easily overwhelmed on weekends and holidays. During the week it dies down and is generally relaxed and easy days throughout the week.
good,Offer very poor pay for my area Mcdonalds hires for more. Can't keep employees so the ones they have are overworked constantly trying to call people in.
good,Takes advantage of groomers. They make the groomers in academy pay for all of  their own equipment and pay for their blade sharpening throughout their career.
good,"Fast paced ,good place to work in for the schedule , not great place advancement. Overall wouldn't recommend if your looking for long term stay. Was dedicated to this company for 14+ years then managment changed and seemed racists againts certain people. Got terminated for an issue I kept bringing up to them , altho they didn't give a real reason to terminate me I had proof for everything they tried to use against me ..."
good,as far as a company  in the years u worked there they went through a lot of changed some i did not agree with what so ever. they   need to get there stuff together.
good,"Poor managers, a rotating list of coworkers, little to no hours, and low pay in addition. Management will push policies that are not to the animals' benefits,"
good,"I have worked in two PetSmart locations. The first was a dream job. I loved the culture and the managment style. I loved the job/life balance. I loved the close nit community feel we had. "
good,advancement was based on how well you were liked by store leader and not on job performance. feedback was inconsistent. so many task and not enough bodies to accomplish everything.
good,"The hours were low, along with the pay. Management was unsupported and employees treated unfairly. Bullying occurred occasionally, and the store is filthy."
good,I worked in the hotel and the job itself is awesome and the people that the company hire are pretty awesome too but the company as a whole is terrible. all they care about is money
good,The PetSmart I worked at tended to over work their good employees and just let the lesser ones slide. The newest manager chose favorites and bad mouth those he did not care for.
good,"No Comment to this work place, so not leaving a review.  Each place is run differently I am sure."
good,"I loved my job until they gave my boss a promotion. The new manager lets a lot of in-fighting happen and it's become increasingly uncomfortable. No one likes getting yelled at. If I could have a calmer team, it'd be a fantastic place."
good,At the time the managers where ridiculous. One was sexist. While the other was very controlling. The other employees where very awesome and understanding. Decent work times though they wouldn't  work with your schedule. Well at least my schedule they didnt
good,"Good place to work for anyone in school, who's looking to work in a fun atmosphere. Helping pet parents find everything they need for there new family members."
good,It was a long time ago and I wasn't there long so I don't remember too much. It wasn't a bad place for a first job. Though it did instill in me a lifelong hatred of cleaning animal tanks/cages.
good,"I absolutely loved the interactions with customers and their pets. Fellow employees were amazing and helpful, even when the management was not. If I was offered a job back, I would definitely take it"
good,"While working with the dogs is a lovely experience, there is a lot of running around and difficult hours with low pay for the work. Nice place if your looking for something seasonal though."
good,Very high pace stressful job which would be tolerable and even fun sometimes if management had any care for our personal needs. You cannot work a stressful job and have it put your personal life in jeopardy. Asks to put job over kids and medical emergencies.
good,"The job can be boring or very stressful. The people that work there for the most part are all nice and it can be a lot of fun. The manager can be a jerk sometimes, just depends on his mood."
good,"I loved my job and being able to see and meet different animals and different types of family pets. The hardest part of my job was when I became pregnant and couldn't perform all of my previous duties. a typical workday for me was checking customers out, helping customers find certain items, giving customers advice and answering questions by the customers."
good,I love my job and the vast majority of my fellow associates. You get decently good customers too with the occasional ones with entitlement issues. Pay is pretty blah considering we care for live animals and are subject to injury on rare occasions. I thought there would be room to grow here and there might be but I cannot stand my managers. Mostly just two. They're enough to make me feel like they really don't care for us or the pets we strive to help.
good,"It was a great job until 2016 when the company was bought out. The turnover is bad, always people leaving. The corporate offices are increasingly adding more responsibility, but refusing to pay for the increased work load."
good,"Minus the love of co-workers and pets, everything else pretty much. The clients always had a attitude and the manager will always try to overbook you. They expect you to do 15 dogs in 5 hour. The reason I left because the page wasn't worth it. I spend more money going to work then making it."
good,This corporation probably isn't unusually awful but it was a stressful time in life. Advancements are mostly based on personal opinion. There is constant changes to corporate policy that you can be terminated for not keeping up with but there isn't a way to keep track of it all.
good,A typical day is rather stressful to do constant pressure for email capture. Typically short staffed and in need of management every two minutes due to the website being cheaper than our store.
good,PetSmart has its ups and downs. Associates were great to work with. Managers could use some work. Especially when it comes to there policy. Typical day at work can be slow if not given a list of something to do even when you had your basics. I had a poor experience with management. Workplace culture was fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job was knowing I was being singled out in harassment. The most enjoyable part was working in my department and seeing reoccurring customers throughout the week and sometimes even throughout the day.
good,On a typical day of work a lot of business was taken care of. The work place was comfortable and all co workers worked very well together. The job itself though was a bit too much for what the pay was.
good,"I love this job, I love working here but I just wish for more. More hours, more opportunities for advancement. I feel like its hard to get noticed and move up."
good,At work is tending to customers/pets. We are low staffed so it can be stressful. I learned a lot of ways to care for pets. Management is not always reliable.
good,"Petsmart use to care about it's extended family.  Those days are gone with the new owners.  Work hard, hope for the best.  Not a lot of room for advancement with the majority of positions being PT, very hard to grow the staff as most associates have another job or are students with a different career path"
good,"PetSmart does a great job in teaching their associates CARE and how to extend this to our customers. The stores with good leadership, foster growth and individual development in their associates. It is a great place to learn customer servicing skills and learn about animals and how to care for them."
good,Did not have a very good experience with this employer regarding how the employees were treated. My employment ended with the assumption I quit because I had to miss one day without confirming it with me they just removed me off the schedule
good,"Working here was okay, for the most part it was pretty relaxed, got to spend a lot of time with dogs which was fun. The only real downside was the manager who micro managed everything. But other than that the job wasn't a hard job it was relatively simple, and not a terrible place to work, just didn't pay all that well."
good,"The culture here is great, the training is adequate. There is not much room for advancement, and the corporate management style is a little hard to deal with."
good,Pet Smart is a good place to work if you are just trying to get by. They DO NOT hire full time because they do not want to have to give benefits to their employees. With that said they will not let you work over 25 hours and if you do they will cut your scheduled for the next week. If you ask for a certain time off they will cut your hours. If you can only work certain hours of the day you will have less hours. The people who are 100% available all the time will get more hours then you. It just a very unstable job if your looking for something to really get you by.
good,I enjoyed my job more as an associate.  I love my fellow associates and then manager as all nice and helpful. It just feels like a ton of work and I feel burnt out.
good,there are some really nice people who work here but there's one that can make your life hard. the company is constantly changing and improving so the 5 managers aren't always on the same page
good,"It's a nice place to start, but they tend to take advantage of good workers after a while...you begin to get overworked and under appreciated. Although everyone is nice, not everyone does their job well."
good,"Where I worked it was very unorganized, I was told to watch videos and followed coworkers around to ""understand the experience."" However, the ""management"" I followed around, had pink hair, piercings, looked unprofessional, and had showed me all the short cuts to get things done, rather than the correct route to follow regulations. She showed me poor manners and hacks to beat the system and pure laziness. I had no respect for management, they were always late, and often times forgot I was around so I had no one to break me. I learned things everyday and felt like I didn't have the full knowledge to communicate well with customers. And I learn quickly, I quickly found another job. Maybe if they have other managers, maybe it will be better. For me, it was a terrible experience. I just hated how lost I felt everyday."
good,"A typical day at work consists of cleaning, handling animals and providing the proper care for them, helping customers with various questions and issues, cleaning, and organizing. The workplace culture at my particular store was nice, we are like one big family. We all get along for the most part but can push buttons on occasion. Management is good but there is a running theme of communication problems between them and the associates. I learned how to handle rude, impatient, and flustered customers. I learned that its better to go to a manager when there is a problem rather than figuring it out on your own. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything stays clean for the health of the animals. The most enjoyable part of the job is a tie between playing with the animals and getting to work with friends that I made at work."
good,"The PetSmart I worked at was great at first. The people I worked with were awesome, but corporate will fire you over the smallest thing. I don't feel they give their employees a fair chance."
good,"They will have you doing all of the jobs, regardless of what you applied for. you will be doing stocking, cashier, pet care, pricing, and any other job they can come up with. Be prepared to be at the store at 4 a.m. some mornings or 12 a.m. some nights. Managment will give you a small amount of time to learn something and if you don't learn it quick enough then they will become frustrated with you. There's multiple managers so you may miss learning some things because they don't communicate with each other. Nobody follows the lunch schedule so you may have lunch scheduled for 12 and not be able to go to lunch until 5. Also, a manager may let someone go ahead of you, even if you've been there longer than they have. It's possible on days that you don't get to go to lunch at all, and when you tell a manager they just shrug it off. And don't even bother with the ""15's"" which is supposed to be a 15- minute break while remaining at the store but you rarely get to take those. They work you as many hours as possible while still trying to keep you ""part-time"" so they don't have to pay you more or give you benefits. You most likely will never get to advance in the company as the people who are there have been there for years and will probably work there for the rest of their life. One of the head managers would go into the grooming salon to gossip to the groomers about which employees she liked or didn't like. Managment isn't happy with you when you ask for time off and they make it known. The hours are completely sporadic and some weeks you might work 6 days out of the week and then"
good,"While I loved working for this company the GM at the time was horrible. Sexist and lazy. Worked approx 3 hours a day and was paid for 60. Would go on a firing spree when bonus times came around. He is now gone so I assume the work environment has drastically improved, however I cannot comment on that in full."
good,PetSmart is a great place to work. It has a very flexible schedule system however I would like it to have a set schedule. It could definitely be improved.
good,"If you work at this particular petshotel, don't expect to be given the position you applied for. I applied as a GSA, and was thrown in the back and told ""you'll be back here for a few weeks, and then we'll move you up front."""
good,"A typical day at PetSmart is very laid back. It's great for a first job, but definitely not for people who are looking to advance any farther than just a part-time job."
good,"I loved working here when I first applied because I love pets and educating people about them. My coworkers were always great, and management was hit or miss quite often a miss, they either fraternized, weren't treating employees fairly, not getting lunches squared away timely, were too lax or on a power trip. You don't get strict but fair anymore in retail type of environments. The rules changed and soon nobody had time to spend with any of the small animals and birds. There is no longer FT offered unless you're a manager or in grooming, and benefits are not worth it as PT employee. Sales were being pushed upon management daily which stressed everybody out, but that's business. Some stores are good, some stores are not. Not a bad company all in all, just get the work done you're supposed to get done and go home."
good,The overall work environment was good and the customers were great! Great discounts. Good products very educational.
good,"This job is NOT what its described as. Please do not apply for this position unless you are physical fit, you will be moving non stop for 8 hours on hard concrete bending lifting scrubbing etc. You will be exposed to a lot of chemical fumes.This shift is non stop abrasive cleaning. You do get to feed the dogs and have some interaction but you will not have time to stop and cuddle and pet the animals. You are a puppy and kitty maid. You will scrub all sides of the kennels, playrooms. All glass in the hotel, mountains of dishes, prepare feedings, dust mop, run a auto scrubber, do non stop laundry, prepare all carts with the proper dayshift chemicals, clean out special gutters and drains where all the water goes when you clean rooms and  playrooms, dusting ventilation, magic erasing walls to remove any spots, scrub out mop buckets and fecal buckets. This is a high demand position do not be fooled. You must be a strong person. There are no breaks, yes that is legal you sign a agreement upon employment for this position this is the only position that does not get breaks. You will be doing 2 shifts of work a night. You can not leave any work for the morning shift. Everything has to be perfect and clean and organized before first shift comes in. No matter how bad it looks when you come in for your shift it all has to be done. I have trained many people over the years and they all seem to think coming in its a fun cuddle job. There is no at your own pace!!! It is very fast pace work with a lot of detail. Does not sound bad to you, while doing these tasks and more that are not mentioned"
good,"I am currently working in one of the busiest salons in the area as the ONLY bather. This means, I'm pretty much fully booked every day and STILL expected to take walk-ins because I am hourly, while the groomers are commissioned. This job is particularly physically exhausting and honestly not worth it. I got pneumonia from the horribly humid conditions (which they don't want to fix) and stress. The managers are taking their sweet time hiring other bathers which are DESPERATELY needed."
good,"I liked working here, but the hours are not guaranteed and I was just expecting a nicer environment than what I was brought into. I did enjoy the job but its not something I wish to further and living paycheck to paycheck with a part time job while supporting two people is very hard."
good,"This job is good for people to want a first time job or part time job, if you love animals. However, this job is only good for temporary employment in most cases there is no room for advancement."
good,"It was an okay job to work for, but the change in management made it hard for me to like working there. Helping customers and their pets was a great opportunity. With the changes made at Petsmart, most of my workers seem to be unhappy at what they were doing."
good,"Good for students, few hours but great for experience. Worked here five years now and it's been great since I'm a student. Flexible hours and great teamwork."
good,Petsmart is a nice place to work. You must be ready to except the fact that they opperate in the retail Stone Age. The process for ad set is in serious need of a overhaul and streamline.
good,"I loved my job i worked there for 2 years was hoping to move up i always was told i was going to and i was the best but it was not true they would not even give me full time but then got mad when i quit they were mean all the time soooo much drama and theres a new person everyday HORRABLE JOB DO NOT WORK HERE!!! "
good,Management at store is condescending and verbally abusive. Other than poor leadership and scheduling the job is wonderful.
good,"... for reasons that this job didn't produce. I loved working with the animals, and I loved taking care of them and the customers, but the amount of stress in this establishment was overwhelming to the point I was physically suffering from it."
good,"To be honest, the workplace is alright. I loved working with the animals and it was nice to meet and greet the pet owners. The hours were not very good. They could not give you more than so many hours in a week, because they didn't want to give out benefits and so  no, there were no benefits. The opportunity for advancement is almost non existent because the managers there are not going anywhere. "
good,"Job was ok but management seem to watch you undercover all day. They give you 3 months then they hire you into the company haha yeah RIGHT, don't be a fool haha."
good,great company but associates in certain stores can of course hinder that. ive been with them for a year and have been listed as a part time employee but I work full time hours and don't get the benefits and haven't been elected for an advancement despite my extremely hard work. im cross trained in almost all departments. there is a high turnover rate so it can be frustrating because there is so much to learn.
good,Working at Petsmart is awesome because I love working with my customers and seeing different animals everyday. I enjoy working with my co workers.
good,I loved petsmart until they were bought out. It turned into a purely sales environment and became less about the animals and the customers.
good,"A typical day at work included barking, messes and lots of water. We had to be a team player to cooperate and share our work space as a whole. We cooperated and took turns answering the phones, helping customers and inputting information for the clientele and their pets. We dealt with rabies records, as well as clientele files for the sake of their vet visits. It was rowdy and loud, but fun. There never was a dull moment when we worked together. I learned to quickly input information, to multi-task with the equipment, and to restrain pets while interacting with the other employees or with clientele. I also learned what hair splinters were and what being covered in fur felt like. The hardest part of the job would be having to tell the pet parent no on a groom, especially when their dog so desperately needed it. We had strict policies against doing certain things, even if the pet or client needed it greatly. The most enjoyable part of the job was to admire our work and how greatly it helped the clients and their pets."
good,"Working at Petsmart really is just too demanding for the compensation. You make slightly above minimum wage but do a lot of work. Ultimately, it's okay for a part time job while in high school or college."
good,This started out being a great place to work.  A great place to work if you want to learn different jobs in a DC/Warehouse setting.
good,"Was understaffed a lot of the time. The management was good, Most days ended well. Seasonal position. Work here if you have a passion for animals"
good,"its a decent place to work, very fast paced, a good work out especially at 4am, store management can be fickle with lots of demands from district managers and trying to balance workload with understaffed stores, customers are generally pleasant to deal with, after all they are shopping for the animals they love so they tend to be happy, the staff tends to be very transient, but the core management team stays in place and is crucial to success, the hardest part of the job was being at work at 4am"
good,"managers are difficult and under constant pressure from corporate. so many changes in the company and management cant handle it, it was rough the last 2 years"
good,Love my co-workers but lots of turnovers lately so hard to see them go. Management is sometimes difficult to approach but lots of changes lately due to a new owner. I love the customers and their pets.
good,"The grooming salon is almost always busy and hectic.  There are lots of people and dogs in a small space.  You learn a lot about different dog breeds and how to sense a dogs body language and what it means.  Along with those things, you earn how to groom and different style of grooming.  Salon management is good and they take care of you and your schedule, however, store management and cooperate could care less about you and the issues you have outside of work including health and school.  Co-workers can be very catty and there is usually a lot of gossip throughout the whole store.  One of the hardest parts is staying calm and patient, especially if there is a rude customer or the dog is horrible for you.  However, you get to hang out with dogs all day and be social with everyone."
good,"I learned a lot working with petsmart. But the overall culture is'nt very professional. Management training is very good at all. I worked for the company for 4 1/2 years and as soon as i made some mistakes they fired me,"
good,"I love the tasks that my job entails: working with the pet parents, providing the best information and product reviews to assist parents on their journey to happy healthy pets, and taking care of the selection of pets we do provide. However the culture of the workplace is off, there is no sense of real teamwork, there was no real training and no consideration of the skills that I have and how to use those skills to make the environment a happier place, Management takes no responsibility for the lack of training and mistakes made but instead blame the new people for mistakes made in the work place. there are benefits but they are only provided for those who work full time and the ones for part time workers do no apply to me( I know I sounds biased). When I first started my co workers were not helpful in assisting my learning the new rules of the workplace, when I asked questions I was bounced from employee to employee and in the end had to help the customer off of the limited knowledge of pet specialty items that I already possessed."
good,"The people that work here are absolutely amazing. Most of the management isn't bad but they seem to hit a ruff patch when it comes to general managers. Petsmart Also seems to have a problem compensation benefits and raises..... If you want to move up the ""corporate ladder,"" don't start here"
good,"There were too many managers in such a short amount of time (8 months). There was too much change, and it was too hard to adjust to. The customers were great though. If only management treated me fairly and didn't lie to my face multiple times about advancing with the company. After several meetings with the store manager in hopes to advance in the company, 3 years later nothing had happened. They led me on and kept my hopes up, and weren't even disappointed that I resigned."
good,Management sucks. The only reason i stayed as long as i did was because of my coworkers. They all feel the same way-they dread going to work.
good,"It was a very difficult job, very stressful, a parent parent asked for 1 thing, you do it and that really wasn't they wanted. Too late to fix it, but some how  I would make it better for them. I never did have an owner bring a dog back for a redo."
good,I learned a great deal about dog training and gained valuable experience. I enjoyed working with dogs and their owners.
good,"I love working with all the animals and the pet parents who come in to meet and buy the animals. The company itself is great, but with my particular store, management could be a bit better. However, I love everyone I work with and their way of making my job fun."
good,A good first job for anyone looking. Not very good pay or benefits but they did at least have benefits after 60 days. Busy place but good experience.
good,"Job itself is not bad, for the most part the dogs that come into the salon are very sweet. the job is not as glamorous as people think! friends always think groomers play with dogs all day, but you need a strong stomach to deal with half of the stuff you see come through the salon doors. also, be prepared to deal with the mean dogs too. management will tell you when you get hired that you have the right to send any dog home you feel unsafe grooming, then when the time comes they pressure you to complete the groom anyways. management is all money hungry, and our own store manager seems clueless when it comes to dog safety policies, yet he spends all his time worrying about the stores satisfaction ratings and sales plans. if you have any type of problem, don't expect help from your managers. they seem to promote the most unqualified people, leading to a management team that is disorganized and all over the place! also, say goodbye to your weekends (all of them!!) while you are prepared to work here. also, the manager turn over rate is astounding. we had an awesome store manager when i was hired and then they transferred him. on a final note, can i mention that they apparently want to start doing salon schedules a YEAR in advance"
good,"Typically was scheduled 20-30 hours which was a good amount while in school, but was still given 20-30 hours once I was available all mornings after graduating. Didn't see many full-time employees during my time there outside of managers, and didn't see many full 8-hour shifts given for part-time employees. Wasn't worth being scheduled 4 or 5 hour shifts, and I had to find a second job."
good,"I love the animals and I love my coworkers. Other than that, there is no ""pros"" to this job. There is no way to get full time or to even get a review to get a raise.  I've been there for 2 years and have got a .10 raise.  I'm done with Petsmart!"
good,"I was hired as a part time associate therefore I did not have benefits. I learned a lot about different animals. The management was that very good expected too much from the associates. The customers were sometimes very rude. I am very nice and caring co-workers, which was the best part."
good,"Worked at quite a few stores in my area, Ontario (California) Pets Hotel being the best, Corona's Grooming was a great experience overall, but Eastvale's Grooming was by far the absolute worst. "
good,"Managers are usually late to work every morning. My commute is about 30 miles to and from work, and I always arrived 15 minutes before the shift starts. "
good,"Petsmart is a very positive work environment. I love working with dogs! "
good,Learned setting up surveys and learned SOC regulations and details aa they relate to organization of major corporations.
good,Petsmart has changed in the 12 years I worked there.  Some changes were for the better others weren't.  I liked that the job of a Petstylist was both hourly and commission based.  You would receive which ever amount was higher.  It just got to be too much with all the rules and regulations changing all the time and new ones being added all the time.  It was more about the money then the employees.  I understand wanting to make money but not at the cost of safety and the petstylists sanity.
good,I went into work and learned how to train dogs. I enjoyed my management team but wish I would have gotten more hours. Most of my co-workers were fun to be around others were snide. The hardest part was when I was losing hours.
good,Retail jobs aren't for everyone.  Management doesn't make the best decisions and expects a lot out of you for very little pay.  My co-workers were one of the benefits of the job as they were great to work with and helped make everything better.  There were some customers that you just got excited to see on an everyday basis.
good,"People are great. But I guess if you're not pets don't expect too much. Unfair choosing of advancements. If you have a lot of pets get this job, if not stay away from it. Especially if you're looking for fair hrs."
good,"Petsmart provides a variety of opportunities, the best one is being able to interact with a variety of animals throughout the day. There is a lot to learn and jobs to fit a variety of interests. I was able to expand my knowledge of a variety of animals as well as fine tune my knowledge of small animal care and husbandry. The downside being that along with any retail job there is very little room for the individual. Once they've trained you in the area they want there is very little wiggle room for personal interest. I am looking for a job that will allow me to expand my knowledge."
good,"The management team isn't any good here, the have favoritism"
good,This company accommodated my school schedule well. It felt good to help people's pets live a more healthy and happy lifestyle.
good,"The job is quite fun and active, always something to do, never a dull moment. The management is terrible though."
good,"very fun place to work, everyone was nice and supportive. very understanding staff"
good,Enter data into the Event Management System software where all the individual discounts are entered on approximately 200 SKUs.  Insuring the discount were margin neutral and present any issue to the buyer.  Review the bi-monthly circular for pronominal accuracy including the retail sales and regular price.  Work closely with the replenishment manager to respond to store inquires of any point of sales issues.  The hardest part of the job was working on two to three promotions at a time.  The most enjoyable is learning about the products and working with other departments.  What I learned the most is how to use outlook to organize my task.
good,"Loved working with all the animals everyday and most of the customers were great to work with. I think there are way to many managers, things get messes with too much to accommodate their personal needs. most of my co workers were great and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to work around each manager telling me something different. I loved working with the animals all the time and the people were fun."
good,"Good place to start out if you're interested in working with animals. Great co-workers, all around, and lots of interesting clients."
good,i really enjoyed working with the customers also enjoyed working with some co-workers
good,If you love animals this company can be a very fun job to have. Working with the pets is what keeps us going. The charity aspect of the company is one to admire. Ive worked at two locations and have been promised advancement and nothing to show for it. Ive interviewed at five stores and always get told im perfect for the spot but someone else has manager expierence with/without petsmart expierence.
good,Worked there for almost 3 years and had no career advancement.
good,Working as a manager for this company is a great learning experience and I have grown with what I have learned from day one. I just do not see myself with this company ten years from now. The co-workers challenged me everyday but it made me tougher and able to succeed.
good,"Petsmart was a great company to work for as a single person. Once I started getting more involved with activities outside of Petsmart it became hard to manage my schedule effectively. They were very constricting with 10 hour days 5 days a week with bizarre time frames. I was unable to hang out with co-workers and I was unable to participate in any other animal/pet related activity for sake of conflict of interest. It did however offer me unbeatable health care benefits, 401k and pay. "
good,"A typical day at work for me would be taking care of customer's making sure the store runs smoothly. I close the store and open the store. I have learned cash management, leadership skills, and planner setting. I love working with my co-workers, and some of the management team. Management can be hard to talk to, and when in need of something it always seems difficult."
good,I would answer calls and set appointments. Wash dogs brush their teeth and shave them if the had bad knotts i could not calm out and also trim the dogs nails. Management was great they were very good managers. My co works were friendly and helpful. The hardest part was trimming the dogs nails. Enjoyable part about the job was seeing the happy pet parents face after their dog was given back to them look nice and clean.
good,"reasonable hours, unorganized management they were often confused and thought lowly of their staff."
good,"This was a great place to work, even as a stocker. It allowed you to meet and greet customers and their pets in a friendly enviornment."
good,"My manager was inappropriate at times and I worked there with other friends who were not looking out for my best interests. the hardest part of the job was the heat by the broiler and the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I learned proper equiptment maintenence, customer service, and food prep."
good,"the animals ALL come from animal mills so they come in sick or infested with some type of illness or infection, the small pets and fish are not really cared for or about, the management is corrupt, and there is a high turn over rate of employees"
good,This job was very stressful and was not very rewarding. Pay wasn't very good and management didn't really care for it's employees.
good,"It was usually slow in the mornings but I didn't mind. I kept myself busy by helping those around me or simply keeping everything neat and tidy. I absolutely loved talking to the customers and how they became a family with their pets. Many of the stories were so unique and full of love. My co-workers were greatly helpful towards me when I was in need of it. The management was a little hard to deal with but It really didn't bother me a bit, but my co-workers said other things that I personally thought was childish. The only reason I quit was to go full time in college."
good,"I would normally start at 7 a.m. set up all the camp rooms and check on all the dogs. While I'm doing that I also help with checking in dogs that are going to stay with us or come in for doggy day camp. Then from 9-12 I would be in Camp playing with normally 16 large dogs, making sure that they dont play to rough but at the same time making sure that the dogs are socializing well. I would normally end my day at 12. I've learned many different things while working at petsmart including how to tell dogs behavoirs and there tendencys. The management on the other hand is good but not great by any means. They are very unorganized and they are extremely bad at trying to remain calm when things get crazy. The hardest part of this job is trying to deal with all the grey areas this company has. I would prefer not to go into detail about this because it would be easier to explain in person. The most enjoyable thing about this job is being able to be with all the animals."
good,Management took frequent smoke breaks but it gave me the opportunity to show I could multitask. Moving up in the company is difficult if you are unable to make your hard work noticed. A positive aspect are the people who come in loving the environment of other people with beautiful pets as well.
good,"My experience at Petsmart was an average one. Didn't really learn a great deal, management was good, co-workers were good. The hardest part of this job was cleaning up after the animals."
good,decent place to work but zero opportunity to advance and supervisors are incompetent at best
good,Best parts of the job was working with the animals and local children.
good,"Love the job but not the upper management. Co-workers were great to work with but sometimes certain managers are not fair and can be rude often. When I first started there it was the best job I have ever had and being promoted 3 times was great, but then my manager went to another store and our store was being run by a manager that does not seem to care about the staff or the animals which is very serious to me!!"
good,"Management wasn't very considerate of personal issues. PetSmart was supposed to be first, not family."
good,"If you love animals, Petsmart will be wonderful for you. You get to interact with all kinds of different animals and pets on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day here consisted of the few people that actually did their job, doing just that as well as everyone else's. The store manager refused to fire poor employees, even if they were stealing from the cash registers and were caught on tape. I learned a lot about caring for animals and compensating for people's poor work ethics. I worked very hard at this job and because they did not want to pay benefits, I was never officially made full time, though I did get scheduled 36 hours a week. I greatly enjoyed working with animals and helping the customers, but was not impressed with the companies ethical values and poor management."
good,Managers think they are running a prison there is no fun or animal loving here they are a just full of childish antics and rage of a villain.
good,Company has great potential to be an amazing place to work but management consistently hinders that. You will see this with the high management turnover rate over the last several years. The benefits are good and so is the pay.
good,"Not a place for advancement. Store managers come and go quickly, however, if you need a summer job, it could be fun."
good,"I had a manager that was unfair towards me, but in general I would recommend PetSmart to those who have a love for animals. The job can be among the most enjoyable job for pet lovers out there."
good,"When they hired me they where over staffed, so i never earned the amount of money they said i could earn. so i could not work there very long. Their safety guidelines are  better then any other salon i have work at. the best thing was they had a vet right next to our salon if we ever needed them,"
good,"The company truly does care for pets and does a lot of charity work that benefits pets and pet parents across the nation. In terms of the work environment, leadership is promoted apparently on favoritism and not necessarily skills. My leaders are not good at communicating, listening, and developing others. These are skills necessary to any leadership position."
good,"It was unorganized, the management doesn’t care about their employees, they rude and hateful to them and call them names behind their backs and to their face. Not every Petsmart is the same, just the location I worked at."
good,If you are a child then this is the place to work. You can learn about animals and then grow up and get a real job.learn every chance you get it comes in handy down the road.
good,"Coaching and teaching associates to bring the best experience to our customers while upholding the values of the company was my highest priority. My customers, their animals, as well as my associates kept me with the company for 17 years."
good,"They treat animals very bad at the pet hotel,they have not patience for them and the animals are always on distress "
good,I have a passion for dogs but they have so many rules that it ruined the experience for me. As well as management really wasn’t good. Our boss would come in 4 hours late everyday and then would yell at you for being 10 minutes late. They scheduled me everyday 10 hour shifts except two days a week
good,"Over all the company is great for pet parents. Very informative and good at problem solving. However, it is a big company and the environment is overwhelming in the retail and customer service aspect."
good,The most enjoyable part about working in the salon is my ability to interact with the dogs and the pet parents when their dog's service is complete. It's always nice seeing people's faces whenever I give their fresh and good-smelling dog back to them.
good,"The working culture of Petsmart is dedicated to customer service and care of a myriad of pets with a focus on dogs and cats. I felt very welcomed at first but as time wore on, the hours and opportunity for advancement seemed to disappear. I mean at first I was told I would get at least 35 hours a week so paying my bills would be satisfied but the longer I've worked there the less hours I am being given. I was also told that I have an chance to go to grooming school but nothing ever materialized. I feel like I got baited with a non existent chance for advancement."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Management is poor. For anything to be done it has to go through the chain of command and sometimes up through corporate. All associates are just a number. If you don’t reach your weekly goals you’re humiliated sometimes in front of other workers, threatened with write ups and or put on paper. This job is a great as a stepping stone but nothing permanent."
good,Petsmart doesn’t pay its full time employees enough to make a living. They are overworked due to how labor strict corporate is. Made major labor cut this last year and expect improved performance with less labor. My two in-store managers only care about themselves and give themselves the best shifts and don’t hardly work when they are there
good,"Although the job was fun and easy to achieve, the willingness and readiness to move up left more to be desired.  If youre looking for a first job to get to work with animals than this is for you"
good,At first the job was great they made lots of promises. There was advancement and it was quick depending on the worker. Over time however the promises made were taken away and management was rude and not great.
good,"Some great managers, some terrible ones. Pay unfair: full-time as a manager I was making $14 an hour then I dropped down to part time after I had a baby and only made $10 an hour as a stocker. Then when I was ready to go back to management they could only pay me 15, although when I left, my assistant who didn’t know anything about my position was promoted to my spot and started at 1717"
good,"Workplace culture is stressful and feels like corporate is constantly breathing down your neck. Feels less geared towards helping customers and more towards selling, selling, selling, rather than a fair balance of both."
good,Good place to work if you like to be around animals but needs a lot of improvement. The pay is minimum wage and isn’t worth the money as you are ALWAYS busy and working understaffed. Constantly called to work on your days off because there is not enough staff.  There is a manager at Wellington store that has been working there for a long time that bullies all the younger staff and management does nothing about it.
good,"Very High stress, extremely fast paced, very competitive, with room for advancement. Not a bad environment If you and your co workers are a team and get along."
good,"Working at petsmart was okay. Not a very exciting place to be. You will feel like your going no where in life, but interacting with different animals can be exciting. Until you have bad seeds."
good,It started out great and then after a couple years animals won’t get in as much well cared for when they went down to one staff at night they couldn’t go in the rooms so if a dogs  had to  relieve themselves  They would have to sit in there own feces and urine until 6 o’clock and sometimes it was 12 to 10 hour days they sat in it. Management would   you for sometime uncontrollable
good,"A typical day at work with PetSmart would start at 4:00am with stocking all products so that the customers had a large variety to choose from within the store. "
good,"There were some decent human beings at my store, co-workers and managers alike."
good,"The best part of this job is your coworkers and the animals!! It’s pretty much your average retail job with more responsibilities and very face paced. "
good,Petsmart is a good company to work for. However it doesn’t make time for people that have families. Especially when it’s your personal life and your step kids that you only get to see twice a month.
good,"Customer driven focus company, short work days. Great for starting a career. Open management environment, cares about their workers. Every month you learn something new about the company culture through mandatory videos."
good,It can be a great job for high school students and for anyone that is in college but management isn’t so great. They really need work because some of their attitudes are making the place a bad place to work. No room for advancement. I can say a lot more but I’ll keep it to myself.
good,They expected you do groom 7 to 8 dogs a day average in and 8 hour work day 4 dogs in the morning with an hour lunch in between and 3 or 4 dogs in the afternoon. Averaging about an hour for each bath dry and cut per dog impossible. Estimated pick up time was 2 to 3 hours of a dog but when you have 4 dogs to do in those 3 hours it’s impossible. I often would not eat lunch and would just clock out and wash dogs on my lunch hour
good,"Petsmart has a good balance for the first time employee. The part time hours allow you to still have a social life or attend school. The advancement may take a while to obtain and the work load on certain job areas can be very stressful. The management through corporate made getting the tasks assigned to specific shifts difficult to complete and put undue pressure on other employees/management. Management staff are stressed and can be abrasive when dealing with employees or customers."
good,"PetSmart can be a fun place to work at depending on your position and your management team. When I worked as a PetCare Associate, part time, my biggest complaint was that the training was virtually nonexistent. The manager told me that I would have 2 weeks of training, which from my previous employment, that meant 10 days or 14 days, PetSmart meant your first 2 weeks regardless of days and hours worked. Despite the early hours, when I was part time, and later full time, stock my manager was amazing and the best manager I ever had. I worked hard, but it felt relaxed, though the pay was terrible and I was a bit sore that the new hires were getting hired in at more than what I was making even after a year! When I got promoted to the Merchandise and Inventory Leader I was excited, but didn't realize that I could be as stressed as I was. I started with no stock team and went through one team before getting a solid team I felt confident in. Just so those reading know, a Merchandise and Inventory Lead at PetSmart means that you are a Receiving Manager, Stocking Manager, Inventory Controller/Manager, Merchandise/Presentation Manager, and an Assistant Store Manager all in one so you're responsible for almost the whole store and depending on your manager depends on the help you will get. My manager, I felt, was not too great and the District Manager/Lead was not much help in promoting teamwork. My manager would often ask me what I needed to help get things done better and more efficiently and often my answer was that I needed more help whether that was more team members or help from others"
good,"Turn-over reflects the negative atmosphere, a place that pays well SHOULD be able to keep employees"
good,I worked in the grooming salon and it is great becuase you get to work with dogs but the owners are a bit nutty. This salon is aslo very busy and quite demanding of their expectations of you.
good,"PetSmart will work around your school schedule so long as you can still make it to your positions starting time.  For my position, all early morning stock team leads had to show up at 4 am generally speaking.  You'd then stage the truck by putting the items from the truck close the their respective departments and begin working them.  Once the truck was finished, you'd generally be opening cashier until you were relieved.  The issue with this company is that the many tiers of middle management you have to deal with for a simple stocking/cashier job. If you made one mistake (or had to watch a training video) you'd hear from multiple managers throughout the day reminding you of such.  Generally speaking, the harder you work the less you get paid here.   Finishing your work early yields nothing in the way of financial or any promotional incentive.  They push customer service and selling puppy kits or other deals more so than anything else.  Great short term job but don't get comfortable; its not good for you health."
good,Everything was unfair. They allowed bullying. They wouldn't help. The older employees were rude and did not follow rules and regulations. Management favored workers who were there longer.
good,"Most days were fine, and plenty of furry customers to spoil. But other times there was a lack of communication and support. It is also hard to accept the idea of disposable pets. That it is better to have an animal sold to a bad situation, than to not sell it. Also they had a employee of the month board, but often didn't bother to use it. Same with their birthday board. It was often times not updated or they just failed to include everyone."
good,The company expects too much from associates. They give very little hours per week to get task done but expect it to still be done. Most of the time there is 2 associates and 1 manager working.
good,"Have worked for better companies as far as management.is concerned."
good,"Love my job, co-workers.  Manager very nice, flexible, accommodating.  Poor training.  Unorganized.  Not enough hours. Grooming salon needs more help."
good,"Petsmart Petshotel is a fun place to work at, the dogs and petparents you meet are really nice. There are some management problems though. But overall a good place."
good,"It was a good job to begin my skills and learning dog care/grooming but I didn't receive much support from management and no benefits like vacation offered, they try to keep your hours under full time. The vibe in my particular location was not good and when brought to management attention that I was being targeted nothing was done about it."
good,"The company has very good ethics on paper, but these don't seem to be upheld at the store level. It seems like stores that can cover up ethics violations are the ones that succeed."
good,"My job at PetSmart as a groomer was a very mixed experience. There was some on the job training, but mostly the other groomers seemed reluctant to come over and help. They definitely made it clear who was the ""low man on the totem pole"""". Plus, when one of the more senior groomers complained to a manager about not liking me and not wanting to work with me, they simply let me go without giving me a chance to explain my side of the situation."
good,"The most enjoyable thing about working at petsmart was meeting all the animals and different personalities. The position has very high turnover which makes climbing up in the company more difficult. You also must be able to work with feces, urine, slobber, vomit, hair, and other gross conditions as you are working with animals."
good,"Great place , with good people but management  is always over your shoulder unless your a favorite.  Even if they like you,  if your not working every single day then you will slowly slip down in there eyes even if your using your own paid time off. If you work all the time and only take time off when they VTO then you can expect to advance."
good,Was overall a great environment just had poor management. the hardest part of the job was when you didn't have a solution to a customer's problem. Most enjoyable part was in the success of helping customers.
good,Petsmart doesn't exist in the UK anymore...Pets at Home took them over...SHAME. Was such a pleasant atmosphere...everyone had their own sections to work and cared about their customers.
good,This job really teaches you what its like to work in retail. I learned many things while working there while i didn't have the best coworkers or managers.
good,"over time, as our management changed, the culture just got worse. especially with the merging of job titles and responsibility, never-ending decreases in labor hours for the team, and ever increasing number of tasks handed down from corporate. In reality, corporate is drowning their management team slowly, things roll downhill so naturally stress rolls over onto even part time associates causing all decent workers to flee. tack on the basic realities of customer service and you have an insufferable work environment."
good,"Advancement is difficult because management find their spot and never move again, in turn the company has a 5 year role that they try and find a way to fire you if you haven't advanced. Pay is minimum wage, so you better have a roommate to pick up the rest of rent and/or other house bills/luxury goods."
good,"Working in the hotel is a job for someone with eternal optimism and a large amount of patience. It requires teamwork and communication or else things get very difficult. As long as you're the type of person who communicates clearly, timely, and effectively, you shouldn't have any issues."
good,"Used to love the environment and that job, management changed over the years and in the end i did felt like i did not deserve to be treated the way they treated."
good,stressful as a groomer; expected to make money; less care about animals and more about numbers; working above and beyond and putting employees on money into supplies and materials needed for job
good,"After the company was bought out they stopped caring about the workers. I loved my job, until they were no longer flexible with scheduling or supportive of their people."
good,"The people i worked along side with were very easy to get along with, on the down side, management was very poor, which is the reason I left this job. Management in the store I worked at, lied about several things."
good,"The work environment was not stressful, and the work given to my position required minimal effort. The practices of the company, such as the treatment policies for the animals were poor, but the associates took the liberty to give the animals proper treatment. The practices of the lead management towards the end of my services was very poor."
good,Title says it all. Management fluctuates often. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone I know for the sure reason they would be let down. Pay is fair for my location
good,Petsmart's goal is to treat every pet like our own. There was a lack of love and care for each animal and was about money instead. Do not recommend!!!
good,"Great stepping stone to receive knowledge about animal husbandry and customer service. "
good,This was a fun place to work. The pay was good for a reatil establishment.  Management was not the best. Hours varied a lot. And not much career growth from this company.
good,It’s retail what more could you ask for. Not great not bad. Pay is normal and nothing special or exciting. It’s a job and that’s about all it is and will be
good,"Again, I loved what I did. Informing pet parents on the proper products was satisfying. But once the quality of pet care declined, and the favoritism showed admits the work environment, the amount of hours and pay wasn't enough to simply living standards."
good,A lot of turnover in management within the stores.  And tons of change on a weekly basis from reporting to methods to do things.  Job is very inventory based for counting products daily for about 4-5 hours and that's 4-5 days a week of counting products..
good,"At the time that I left the company, the focus shifted away from genuine care as client assistance to pushing certain products or services even if it was not apropriate."
good,PetSmart was fun but corporate made it difficult to work with living animals.  I worked there for 4 years and never had any major issues until I became a manager.
good,Expected way to much out of just one employee to run the whole side of the store. They put way to much work load on the Pet Care associates and expected everything to be 100% perfect.
good,the management is horrible they dont care if you have a family you get wrote up if you call out twice a year they see you as a number they dont care about You they only care about the company they dont care about customers only the money
good,"are constantly caring for animals coming in, must be a fast worker and should be good at multitasking."
good,"So my experience wasn't a bad experience. The first few managers I had, coming into the job, kissed corporate's butt cheeks to make themselves look good. They were good at bending rules to make sales, they were good at spoiling customers to the point of no respect for the workers and always assuming they got free handouts or special discounts because the managers did it every time they were around. Might as well not even be a retail store, but a goodwill. "
good,"If i had stock i would come in about 3 in the morning and as soon as we opened i was in the salon doing anything i was needed for from just clipping and filing nails to full bath, blow out, and brush. If the salon was slow i would condition shelves, help customers, run the registers, and clean anything that needed cleaning"
good,"There has been a lot of change and uncertainty. The next  two to three years will determine the future of the company. "
good,"PetSmart as a whole is a great company. They work with lots of rescues to find homes for homeless animals, they take great care of the animals that they do sell, and they treat their employees and customers well. My location had an unfortunate management team that failed to supervisor, encourage, or assist their team. I’ve had friends who have worked at other locations and had the exact opposite experience."
good,A great place to work if you are looking for something part time or a stepping stone to retail.  Hard to advance and poor pay for lower management. The pets and customers is what makes it easy to get through the day.
good,"Every Monday and Thursday we received a freight truck that needed to be unloaded and stocked. I was in charge of unloading the truck with the forklift and stocking the product. Management was always claiming we were not fast enough, when all employees stocking were doing about twice the speed we were required by the book. It was a very tiring job, many of the items were very heavy (fish tanks, stands, dog food, etc) and there were a lot of items to be stocked."
good,"Pet Smart was a fast paced sales environment. The work was pretty easy, but the pay was not that great and they don't pay enough, or provide enough benefits"
good,"PetSmart is a great first job to get your feet wet in the ""retail"" sales positions. Retail is all about basic product knowledge, while respecting the customer and having and maintaining a great attitude."
good,"Wake up have to be at work at 4am, at my store we had to get started right away, we had the biggest store in the district, but the down fall to that was we only would have 4 hours to do our work just wasn't enough time to finish so we would get in trouble for unfinished work after shifts mind you we didn't take 15 minute breaks because literally every second mattered, management throws blame on you behind you're back to the store managers so they don't get in trouble for work not being completed but they fail to properly train and coach employees Management TERRIBLE but this is at the Lancaster Ca PetsMart, Most enjoyable part stay busy usually get out before customers come in so you wont get distracted customers are really kind, worst part the environment stressful,micromanaged,hostile blame gets thrown around behind your back...Co workers were really cool made the job that much better"
good,If you love working with animals this is the place for you. A typical day at work started with checking all the animals and making sure that they were all alive and healthy. If they were sickly they were taken out of rotation until we could get them healthy. Of course you fed them and cleaned their cages or aquariums as well. We also had the privilege of finding each of our animals a home. Management expected you to work hard and would teach and correct you when you made a mistake. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was to see the animals you had grown attached to go to their new homes.
good,The only upside is being able to be around animals all the time. The management doesn't really seem to care for the employee's very much. But some of the people that work there are great.
good,"Poor leadership and constant change has left the company in constant flux. There is a lack of work-life balance negative morale with high turnover and layoffs.  PetSmart has lost a lot of great talent and has no training/growth initiatives for internal associates.  Company lacks long range vision and strategic footing creating an environment with lots of re-work and rides on consistent poor execution. Company needs a CEO and management team that will offer structure, vision and speak to the mission of the company.  There are a lot of amazing people that are very passionate about this company which makes it a supportive environment within the local teams."
good,"There is no such thing as a typical day at work. Every day is different, which keeps the job interesting. "
good,"Petsmart is a great place to work if you want to earn extra money."
good,It was relaxing at first because i started off as a bather. Then when i became a groomer it got a little harder. But i have come a long way from that now. The hardest part of the job was transitioning from bather to groomer. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people i worked with help me get thru the transitioning.
good,"While I respect my old managers as people, I have a harder time respecting the store. I do whole heartedly believe the company takes precautions and cares for their animals immensely. They are well taken care of and there is no neglect. Other pet stores don’t take as good of care, from my experience. If you can handle the hours, the fast paced environment, and the pressure to meet the demands of the store, then it’s a great place to work. Due to personal experience I ended up leaving. Not a bad place to get your foot in the door, though."
good,"My manager is awesome, but my coworkers never want to work and it causes a lot of issues with scheduling and can make work more stressful. There is more to the job than playing with puppies, but it is still fun."
good,"Typical work day consist of cleaning, bathing dogs, cleaning ears, clipping nails. I learned how to cut nails. Workplace was fast paced and fun very social. Most enjoyable part of the job was the animals."
good,"Was okay job.  Easy to get in.  Learn the ropes, and then go somewhere that pays more.  Constantly changing atmosphere.  Learn as you go.  Easy to move up as well."
good,"I liked working in the Pet Care department at Pet smart, but it defiantly can be stressful. I enjoyed working with all the other employees and managers.  I defiantly learned how to communicate with other employees, managers, and customers efficiently."
good,I loved working here. It was a good fill in job. It was nice to get discounts on pet food too! I just wish the pay was better and cashiers could walk around more.
good,"Being a cashier at Petsmart is exactly as you'd imagine. You bag groceries, help customers find what they need, clean up the store etc. At my store, we were often understaffed and I was a hard worker so I often had to pick up other's slack. On more than a few occassions my manager and coworker would go out for a smoke break and because I didn't smoke, I would be left inside taking care of the whole store by myself. (We were required to have a minimum of three employees in the store at a time -  a cashier, manager and petcare). "
good,some people who come in are rude but thats retail. the animals are great but we do the dirty work. not for the squeamish. i love the customers mindset on animals. we all had that one thing in common.
good,Most people who work here either are just too comfortable to leave or make enough money to justify it (a.k.a store managers). Also they have way too few employees working on the floor.
good,"Very Stressful and fast paced you must be able to manage your time wisely and not cut corners. I've learned how to manage my time better. The management is terrible, there is a major lack of communications between departments and their expectations are unreasonably high for the department I was in. The hardest part was keeping up with the higher ups whims on what they wanted you to sell next while trying to get all your work done and dogs bathed. The most enjoyable part was the animals and interaction between them and the customers. Transforming animals and developing a close relationship with customers."
good,My experience was pretty average. It had ups and downs. Some days were enjoyable because I got a lot done. On other days I could not get hardly anything done because the store was busy.
good,"this job was a fun one to work with different kinds of pets but not have to take any of them home. i started as a pet care associate and did a lot of time wasting when it was slow. most of the chores are done in the first hour of your shift or the last hour, otherwise its keeping busy with customer service and stocking shelves. lots of pet parents had lots of questions, but when you try and answer them, they interrupt you because they think they know something. i was then promoted to the only dog trainer in the store. that was stressfull. i had the store manager always breathing down my neck making sure i had control of my department ( which was just me). i trained dogs for a year and asked to move up to an assistant manager job but they wouldnt give it to me. i got tired of the same drama everyday and left"
good,"Store Manager with 10+ years of experience.  Typical retail environment.  Tough home, work balance, and they always expect you to do more with less.  Pay was above average from an industry perspective though and benefits were OK, not great, especially medical, high deductibles and premiums."
good,"Enjoyed working with all the animals, but management was not the greatest. Didn’t get my hours at all as there was to many employees. Was ganenteed full time but was bearly getting 15hrs a week."
good,Wasn't a bad place to work. For the most part was a friendly place to work at and was pretty flexible with hours requested to work. Just not room to advance in company
good,I enjoy working at a place where customers can bring their pets in with them. However the store is poorly managed. You work hard and go above and beyond and you are not appreciated for it.
good,"Low pay and no benefits for Bathers, but if you want to be a groomer there is potential for a decent income. The employee discounts are nice if you have a pet as well."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Petsmart until it went through new managment. I feel allot of times issues are ignored in different areas of the store and some of the managers act unprofessional. I worked there for 7 years and didnt even reach $1.50 more in pay raise from when I first started and I was even promoted to a higher positions that took on allot more responsibility and people hired in were hired making more an hour than I was. I feel Petsmart should give their employees that put in the time and years working there more benefits, higher pay, and more respect."
good,I work mostly at night and in the morning certain days. it is constantly buys and when it's not were cleaning. the stores are usually dirty and the back of hotel is disgusting. most people who work there are really cool and I love the environment but the management constantly changes as people are always leaving because the pay is too low for the amount of stress that comes with the job.
good,"In life you stride to be the best ""u"" you can be, when giving opportunities what you do with is totally up to you, me personally I like to achieve and go beyond any of my potential traits,never get comfortable with being content......because life can change in a blank of a eye."
good,"Overall it was not a bad place to work for it is part time so no benefits and there were a few duties that they did not describe when they hired me. The scheduling was the main issue it is never consistent and i frequently had to work days that I said were unavailable. However, we did have fun especially when we had events at work and everyone was patient when training me. The overall work environment is fast paced and can be stressful especially during holidays."
good,people are nice and inviting management was similar. customer can get very difficult and information on dog and cat food isn't exactly readily available
good,Working there was always working up a sweat. It always felt like a huge part of the day was just stocking the bags of food and there was no satisfaction doing it. It does help lose weight though!
good,"I learned that the only  employees with the company that are expected to show authentic customer service within each store location would always and will always be managers on duty and leaders of  departments that are on duty. The only expectation of any other associate is to show up for work which in my opinion is not conducive to the growth of employees who aren't already motivated to become better for the company."
good,If your looking for a Corporation then Petsmart is great. It has wonderful health plans and great overall benefits. If you have a more creative side or like to think outside the box this Corporation has very little wiggle room. Other than that it can be a nice place to work.
good,The Grooming Salon is a well oiled machine when all parts are working together. Certain store managers believe input into this is necessary when in reality it throws off the entire system. I left due to management blatantly ignoring my requests for specific days/hours off due to having an additional job with set hours.
good,"Co-workers and management are all great people. Very poor advancement and compensation. Consistent as far as what to expect from a retail or customer service environment. Typical day includes stocking, merchandising, ensuring freight/ product is available for customers, and product knowledge to assist customers with all their needs. Only difficult part of the job is you must be able to lift dog food bags for up to 8+ hours, if your physically ready it will be a breeze. Helping customers is the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"very customer oriented, customer service is a main objective, very fast paced, multi tasking job, have you do more than one department, cross training, hours are kind of flexible at this one store."
good,This job was very much an anxiety attack inducing task. Bad employees and drama made it even worse to handle. I don't recommend working here. Management doesn't know how to handle any problems or concerns.
good,I had a difficult time with the petsmart location in Vaughan the management was not very good. They would say one thing and do the next. when I was hired I was told I didn't have to work weekends because they knew I would not have babysitters because I had just relocated. two weeks in they booked me for a Saturday and sunday. I hear the location has new managers now. I also did not like that I was told I could learn to groom in the salon I was in and the next day I was told I had to relocate for a few months to attend the petsmart grooming school. My son was in school and I was not able to relocate at the time so they moved me from full time shifts to very minimal work. I was given one shift per week.
good,My managers are sometimes hard to work with and the pay is poor for the work required. The customers are also very difficult to deal with but I enjoy the animals in our store and the care I do for them
good,Was a fun job but no hours and very low pay!  Enjoyed cleaning the cages and taking care of the animals while also administering medication to the sick/unhealthy pets.
good,This job is part time with little room for advancing. Management is hit or miss. If you like working around pets you may like the job but don't expect much of a future with the company.
good,"Getting full time is impossible. There are very few opportunities to advance yourself and even though you'll only be part-time they manage to take 6 days out of your week for work. Some managers are great and others are terrible, they aren't grateful for their employees and treat you like you're expendable."
good,"It's fun to see all the animals and their people. Pay was fair, and I was always happy to help the customers. Other coworkers were pretty happy as well and management was pretty good overall."
good,"Usually a day at work starts at 9am, I get the register area organized and cleaned up after the night before. The doors also are opened as customers enter I proceed to greet them as they make their way through the store to locate the items they need and if at any time they need assistance locating something I am always happy to find them the help they need and a timely matter. As customers come to the front of the store to purchase their items I will process their transaction. I will also process returns and or exchanges for customers answer phone calls and send them to the right location or I will take a message for someone to get back to them. When not at the register I will help stock the sales floor with new merchandise. My day is over at 4:30pm"
good,I think that the seniors do not treat everybody  the same. I learned to just follow what they say and do what they want. The management is okay. The hardest part is to be patient and use your muscles to lift dogs. The most enjoyable part is playing with dogs.
good,"management changes a lot. i liked working with others. pay not  great. hours are random. it doesn't matter if you work there a week or three years, they will pick who they favor to move up."
good,"I have been advancing through every department of non-management within PetSmart for 2 years.  I have accomplished everything there is to accomplish at my level.  I have made myself a well-rounded associate so that I might be promoted to supervisor. Everything would be bliss except everything is terrible.  Yes, I meant to make it sound like that.  The customers treat us like children, management is never really happy, and the pay is terrible.  So if you're ready to work really hard for ""competitive pay"" (15 cents over minimum wage), then this is the place for you.  I am looking for work elsewhere because climbing the ladder there is like crawling through unappreciative glass."
good,Not so bad for a first time job. The pay isn't much and the hours depended on wether or not your colleague arrived or not so that you could end your shift.
good,"It is fun if you are young. It's a stepping stone. Work there while going to college. Management can be tough as they take out the animal prospect of the job and focus more on business, which makes sense but some people have a hard time converting."
good,"After being bought out by a British firm in 2015, the company has taken a down turn. With only caring about profit, the associate benefits and incentives habe gone out the window, and with Amazon becoming the great force that it is, retail as a whole is going down."
good,Overall there is no focus and communication between upper management. Most enjoyable part of job is actually feeling a sense of accomplishment after a day of work.
good,"when i first started working at petsmart it was great until things changed. management changed, lack of career for the animals changed. we wasn't provided the right tools to do things with or proper training. i loved working with the animals, but when they are sick and we have to handle them for a while without gloves its not okay, because other animals can get sick and we can get sick if humans can get what they have. Also when someone needs help like an employee, no one is willing to help."
good,"I enjoyed my time at PetSmart very much. The only reason for my resignation was because it fell under new management that was not fair to certain employees in my personal opinion. They did try their best to be fair towards customers however, when it came to he employees, i felt some were favorited and given certain treatment that others were not."
good,"You have to really be an animal person, want to work hard, and be rewarded.  The job itself is really great.  Management is old school and does understand proper motivation and how to get the most out of the teams, they just drive for results."
good,fun place to work at if you love dogs and other small animals. i typical day for a cashier is near the cash register all day. i learned to help customers with the troubles they may have finding products.
good,"The character of Petsmart has changed since their buyout. Too much emphasis on formulaic approaches, metrics and branding over proper care of animals and giving employees reasonable time, tools and compensation for their jobs. Rewards for years of service eliminated. Positions and bonuses eliminated. The job satisfaction I enjoyed is slowly withering under all this corporate pressure to sell sell sell."
good,"Just like every place PetSmart has its positive and negative qualities. However, over the past few years the culture has suffered with multiple layoffs and few compensations."
good,Working at petsmart has it's perks I love being able too work with animals. What I have learned working at petsmart is how too make making appointments. The hardest part of my job is having some dogs that do not like too get groomed and like too bit us at times. Our management does just fine at times.
good,There are many different departments within the store so you have options to choose from. However advancement is almost impossible and highly unlikely. Its mainly a job for students and older people who are looking for a little extra cash on the side. Its not a job you can live off of and be satisfied with. But if you like animals like I do you may be able to enjoy it a little.
good,"Hard to gain hours, pet care manager was not concerned about welfare of animals. The store itself was nice, but the term, ""I hate my job but love the people I worked with."" was never so applicable."
good,A typical day includes opening up the salon every morning making sure everything is cleaned and sanitized in between. Checking in our appointments as they walk in and provide the services the customer is looking for. Iv'e learned to have patience and handle a stressful situation with a sense or urgency but calmness.
good,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart and really cannot think of anything that I would change. I simply had plans to be in a professional field, so it was more of a resume and skills builder."
good,Great company to work for but the amount work that is put in doesn't reflect in ones own paycheck. It is hard to get equipment fixed properly. and the store is constantly struggling for supplies.
good,"-A typical day at work was pretty normal depending who I worked with, things usually went pretty well. I'd do my appointments by washing the dogs, drying them, clipping their nails etc. and get them done in the proper time to go home."
good,I thought I would retired from this job was i there a long time then they where baught and everything changed I have been a manager for 10 years and the way there paying a can't pay my bills
good,Fun place to work if you love animals and are older than 17.Management at this place sucked watch out for store manager and assistant manager.Willnot work with school schedule.
good,"The company itself is very bottom dollar and the store I worked at had a revolving door of managers that left the store in complete disarray. The employees were all lovely and everyone had a real and genuine passion for pets."
good,the place is constantly under a state of change! The animals and customers do make it a fun daily environment. Hopefully it will return to a more stable environment.
good,"You have to know what tasks you are supposed to do and have a time frame to get them done. If you are a stocker you have to work one pallet per hour. If you care for pets on the floor you are responsible for making sure they are healthy and giving medical care if needed after taking them to a vet. In the hotel you have to clean up after and take care of dogs and cats. Management depends on what store you work at. They have to know the numbers for sales and numerous other things. They take the fall for anyone not doing their job. "
good,This job is very demanding and most of what you do is timed. The management can be friendly but they also are very strict and take the job extremely seriously.
good,Petsmart was a good place to work unless you were management.  While I was  regular associate it was enjoyable to come to work and be there helping customers and their pets.  As soon as i was promoted to management however that all fell apart.  They have a horrible training module for management and I had no one to help back me up when I needed it.  However it is my understanding that things have changed now so I hope they do have a better training situation for manager.
good,"I enjoyed meeting the different pet parents that came in and being able to assist them in their proper selections for their pets.  It was a great adventure when helping the parents with difficult needs for their pets."
good,"I loved that I was always able to be running around, I was sweating basically everyday from the work I did which I absolutely love. I knew I worked hard, and I deserved the credit for it. I never really was appreciated here."
good,They do monthly events for pet parents and the animals. Sometimes they don't answer their phone. Grooming is always packed. They have vet clinic theee and basic dog obedience training.
good,"pets mart is a fun company to work for, always busy especially during the weekends and holidays. Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to play with all the dogs."
good,"I've worked at two PetSmart locations, but I was at the one in Kalamazoo the longest. I loved my customers, and it pained me a lot to lose my job here. Management went downhill fast in my last few months, and definitely didn't pick up in the six months following. (I have pets, and it's the closest store with their food, so I see the managers often.) I was going through an issue with medication and chronic illness, and it's because of that that I lost my job. I would like to work there again, honestly, but only if management has improved dramatically."
good,Greta job if all your trying to do is get by financially and don't see yourself staying in this position forever. Good interim job while your getting an education to have a real career
good,"Overall PetSmart was a great place to work for. General managers are required to handle the front end while department managers are in there departments but 9 times out of 10 you end up covering both front end and your department. They also hardly ever give you enough hours to preform your task so I would end up covering 2 departments and stocking all at the same time."
good,"Working for petsmart or corporate companies maybe great for some people, good benefits and flexible hours. However the higher ups put a lot of pressure on store level employees to make certain sales ($, puppy guides) and push products or promotions. Company can be hypocritical, telling us to do something a certain way then change the rules around."
good,"its just another retail job where the customer is always right, the wages are not at all competitive, (unless you're the manager) and youre definitely not going to make a living if youre anything but the manager or someone in corporate, but there is room for advancement if you stay there long enough, good part time job if you're in school to cover expenses, and you only get 15% on merchandise,(only good if you own a pet),  worked there two years and got less than a dollar raise"
good,"Loved caring for the animals, that's why I signed up. Typical day is cleaning habitats, feeding animals, dealing with customers who can be very pushy or angry; and take it out on you, dealing with coworkers or bosses who demean all of your work. That was my typical day. Management was decent, and tried to help when they could. Other managers turned a blind eye to how animals were being treated, and how their employees were being treated. I got along with most of my co-workers, but some I couldn't even fathom why they worked at PetSmart. The hardest part of the job was definitely when I had to deal with one manager, one of my bosses who always put me down and reminded me how to do my job. Most enjoyable of course was the animals. Some days it was really good, some days it was awful and I had multiple panic attacks before/during/after working. PetSmart is definitely a hit or miss, 100% depends on the management."
good,It was fun ! loved the animals and my GM was very helpful and kind even during rough times with pet parents. Great location and benefits of getting to go to groomer school
good,part time- sometimes I cashier and some times I do stock. I would like to be able to learn more than what they have allowed me.
good,"Usually understaffed. You will learn quick how to help out in all departments. Depending on your availability you can expect to work back to back shifts, aka ""clopen"". Hardest part of the job is dealing with lazy co-workers and crabby customers. My favorite part of the job was interacting with the animals, whether it be the ones we sell or pets that people bring in."
good,"This was a good job to start at for a just out of highschool animal lover. You learn a lot of basic skills that you need in the world, such as customer service, workplace politics, sales, and responsibility."
good,"the job is easy, the location i was at was a smaller store where they cant afford to hire people to stock or do the carts so i found one of the hardest things to be stocking the shelves and rounding up the carts (as a female not always easy picking up a pallet of 40lb liter boxes or bags of food), i was able to learn how to do inventory and price changes."
good,"Will fill out later. At a Diffrent Time. asdad asdaf awawe. Duties: Cash register operations, sales assistance, merchandise stocking and pricing, customer service"
good,Working at Petsmart is a very fast pace for work there is always something to do. there are a lot of good customers and some employees that come go to the store and they make work very enjoyable. There i have learned how to manage my time and also interacting with what the customer needs and wants. The management that i received at my store was good but there were other managers where i saw they did nothing at all but sit in the office or hangout. The co-workers were very lazy due to the new generation of kids that do not have the ambition to do anything at all. They think that everything should be handed to them. The hardest part of the jobs that are there is that you do have some rude customers and also the managers do not actually manage (some). The best part about working there if you are a people person is that the customer base is awesome i have interacted with some amazing people and learned new things off of them. There is always room for expanding you're knowledge.
good,love the job but i have to say bathers should be pay more for what we do its hard work sometimes and most days are very stressful the co-workers and my manager are all awesome people to work with very kind and help when you really need it what keeps me going for this job is only the animals i really love animals if i had all the money in the world i would probably try to own every animals there is
good,"This type of job is best suited for those looking to build their resume, like High School and new graduates. I had started working there because I needed a job after just moving to Missouri and losing my seasonal job. I had gone into the job knowing I wasn't there for the long term as I was looking for something within my field. However, I really did enjoy those I was working with which made coming to work so much easier. The opportunity to move up was never presented to me, even though I possess a degree in which I would have qualified to do so. I showed the manager several times my abilities to help out where needed but was not given such opportunities. It is difficult for one to want to excel at their job if they are not only not told how well they are doing or what they can do different to improve but also if they are not presented with opportunities to grow and learn more within the company. It was more of where you are placed is where you will stay which doesn't suit well, especially if you are running short handed and if nobody else has been trained in those departments how can you expect to give accurate customer service."
good,As a stylist you need to be able to handle time management very effectively by basically being able to groom dogs one after another. Working on commission kind of means you need to deal with naughty dogs or you don't get paid. I find myself overbooked at time because the scheduling platform is not the best. You do make a lot of money if you can over look the stressful environment.
good,"Young management staff with low life experiences."
good,PetSmart is not your normal retail job. It is not all puppies and kittens. There is a lot of responsibility that really is not worth the pay that most receive. Barley any room to advance in the company.
good,"As a Pet Care Specialist, I learned that people can really be a drag on your day, but if you find that one thing that keeps your spirits up, all is good. I am mixed, because on one hand I loved it, but I know I also couldn't stand the way things were done."
good,"PetSmart is a corporation who operates on the basic principles of keeping worker wages low, but given the ease of this job, they were justified in doing so.  The sanitary conditions for some of the animals showing up was less than preferable, but they do have a good corporate responsibility of only adopting out cats and dogs.  "
good,"work with my partners its good, im always positive and happy no matter what happen in the day, the oportunity in the company is there is no consistency in what to do on the day, they crate something new every day and when already has procedures to make every especific job and the next day they changes, put more work and recently they cut off the hours of members of the managment team and they dont reduce the work, a used to be a salaried manager and im always have the time to do my job and help others, but the company change my position to hourly manager use a time card to punch in and punch out and right now i do my job and the job of the other manager that they decide to put partime so there is no time to do everything in 8hrs, In the past the company has stockholders but they sold the company and right now someone boutgh he compny and we lose someon faith"
good,"Positive work environment with lots of friendly and helpful people. Always something to do so you never have to worry about being bored. I most enjoyed working with the animals and educating customers on proper care of their new pets. Not an outstanding management team, there was lack of professionalism and lots of mingling with their employees."
good,"PetSmart as a whole is a nice place to work, aiding customers and their pets was a blast. I learned the differences in dietary needs for certain animals and even how to react towards certain animals to make them more comfortable."
good,"The work place is very supportive by management, dealing with animals and pet parents daily. Work flow is basically  a yo-yo effect. During the day the flow of pet parents can go from extremely slow to very fast paced."
good,This company is great to work for IF you have a good store manager.  A bad one kills the entire team and the higher management doesn't seem to see that.
good,"I loved working with the cats and dogs, I started out doing overnight in the hotel which I didn't mind, and then got switched to day shift which I was pretty psyched about. When I first started, I would wake up looking forward to going! It all seemed almost perfect at first, but I realized that was because the hotel manager wasn't there pretty much my first 4 months there, she always called out with some reason or another, and right when I started was when she promoted one of the employees to assistant manager, and pretty much made the assistant manager run the place the whole time I was there, even on days the manager did come in, she did nothing and more often than not, ended up crying and/or leaving. Then to make things better, I got my 3 month review finally (during my 5th month there) and even the assistant manager reminded me when she handed it to me (bc of course the manager wasn't there) that she didn't write it, the manager did, which immediately made me uneasy. Once I read it, and got my oh so amazing raise of 10 cents, I, and my coworkers, noticed that she pretty much just guessed on the majority of the review because she wasn't there to actually properly observe me, which was her job. And now to get to the nitty gritty: the holidays....the hotel and management was so unorganized, they expected things of you that you had no clue how to do bc you were Never trained for it, management would get so overwhelmed that they would turn nasty and more often than not they would tell at us when they lost their cool. At times, when we're almost at max capacity (which is 200 animals"
good,Loved my job until the new corporation bought us out and now I'm out of a position.  Sad that they can't keep management and those of us that truly enjoyed and felt passionate about our jobs.
good,"The job is probably the best job I have had in my young life. You supervise the pets of Customers during your shift. Always making sure their rooms are clean, their water is fresh and comforting any dogs or cats that miss their owner. You will be on a walkie talkie at all times with your Petshotel Co workers so you can communicate problems. The earliest shifts start at 7 am and the latest shift ends at 9 pm.There is also Doggie Day Camp. You supervise the playroom for 1-4 hours making sure the dogs play safe, and under control. It can be loads of fun interacting with loving animals but the trade off is you're always cleaning up messes and the smell can be overpowering. Sometimes the room is relatively inactive and lacking stimulation so you can get very bored during the 3-4 hour room supervisions. At times you have to break up dog fights which can be hard to read, and can catch you completely unawares but coworkers do a great job coming to help you so you're not on your own. You also have feedings morning, noon and evening which you prepare among your co workers. Owners will come to pick up their dogs after their day of work so for about 2-3 times a day you will be hurrying around answering calls for a dog and bringing them to their owner."
good,"Petsmart overall as a company is not bad, however upper management issues cause problems in the company to trickle down, communication and responsibility of store managers sets the tone of the entire store, many pets arts vary so much from store to store. A lot of store manager from Office Depot especially in the south Orange County district are terrible. A typical day at work may be constitute a write upabout Something pity. I learned grooming as a valuable trade, however there are people like every where else that aim to cause drama. The hardest part of the job as salon manager was trying to coach everyone and still have mounds of stuff to do on my plate. The most enjoyable part was seeing my associates succeed and the life of the animals be influenced for the better"
good,"enjoyed working with the people there.  good accomodations, the hours and clientele were not enough to keep me there as I need more money to live on."
good,"At PetSmart I worked as a cashier. This gave me a lot of customer service experience because I worked at the front of the store. I was the first person customers saw when they walked in and last when they left. Leaving a good impression was important to me. In general, however, I do not want to work in retail again."
good,I love my job at PetSmart. Animals are my passion and being able to work with them is an amazing opportunity. My co-workers make the day go by faster with their lovely outgoing and interactive personalities.  Customer service is something I truly enjoy; being able to interact constantly wit customers is what motivates me to work every day.
good,"PetSmart cuts hours to satisfy stockholder's wallets. Under staffed trying to make customer's shopping experience great. To me customer service starts by showing that we care about the associates. That feeling will snowball down to our customers making their shopping experience a genuine and truly remarkable shopping experience. I have experience with Micro Soft office suite, registers, symbol guns, payroll budgets, schedules, P&L reports, audits, price integrity, shrink, theft, presentation, forklift certified, hiring, coaching associates and manager, customer service the ability to combine common sense and listening to all sides before render a decision to solve the issue staying inside the company expectations and standards. I have over 15 years of retail managerial experience, along with 14 years of service managerial experience providing security to the Pentagon, Naval Observatory ( United States Vice-President's home) and 26 military bases. Couple that with 4 years as an electrician on F-4 fighter jets in the Marine Corps. You have someone like me, that is dependable, self motivated, quick learner, flexible and reliable."
good,"As a Cashier at PetSmart, I absolutely love my job.  I get to play with all the pets that come into the store, share stories with Pet Parents and provide some insight to help their  Pet Experiences be good ones.  Many times I have had new Pet Owners come into the store saying they're getting a puppy and they have no idea what they're doing it.  Nothing makes me happier than taking them through the whole store and explaining every single part of bring a puppy home.  I learned a lot about customer service as that is our biggest focus.  We also went through training about once a month to ensure that the staff had up to date information about specific products we sell and what they do.  We also indirectly learned about Marketing, Stocking, and Pricing.  My co-workers were all wonderful.  The best thing about working in such a tailored store is that everyone shares the same interest - pets!  However, my managers weren't the best.  We had one manager that was so lazy that it was a running joke at the store that he doesn't do anything if he doesn't have to.  We also have a top manager that always talks to people like she is disappointed in them or upset with them.  I pitched an idea to sell donations more efficiently.  She said we couldn't do it and then a couple months later pitched the idea and took all the credit.  She also gives very little credit where it is due and penalizes the slightest mistake.  The compensation is also mostly unlivable.  Managers that have been working there for years make only $12 per hour.  There is very little room for growth, not willing to move part-timers"
good,"The first store I worked for was fantastic. No complaints really. The hardest part was just dealing with stressful aggressive animals every once in awhile which would set me back in time and I would have to catch up. It was definitely worth it though because I love working with animals, and I also worked with fantastic people all day long. The second store was completely different. I had to adjust to new people, new rules, and new attitudes. Sometimes it was challenging, but my clients we were wonderful, and I had such a close bond with them and their animals that it made everything worth it."
good,"A typical day at PetSmart consisted of filling orders for stores all over the U.S. and Canada. Very fast paced and hard work. This job was hard to get used to then turned out to be quite easy. The hardest part about this job was the weather. Very cold in the winter and very hot in the summer, but I enjoyed every aspect of this job. My coworkers were some of my best friends."
good,"On typical day at Petsmart, I come in greet my staff members and check my appointment book to see how many dogs i have in a day. I start washing the dog that was checked in and work my way down the line. My co workers are a lot of fun we help each other when help is needed and we make the workplace as enjoyable as possible. Everyone get along so well. My managers are hardly around but they are pretty cool and chill. They always check in on us every blue moon to make sure, everything is ok and to make sure we have all the products we need. The hardest part about our job is when we get aggressive dogs, sometimes is a challenge to deal them with so when have to send them back home. I just enjoy working with a great team."
good,"Stocking products was the hardest part of the job."
good,Ringing up people at the cash register can drain you especially if you do it for 6 hours straight. Hardest part was standing around doing nothing for a couple hours. Most enjoyable part was getting to talk to fellow co-workers.
good,"Typical day you are on your feet your whole shift and you are given task to perform while performing your positions tasks and assisting customers."
good,"I washed the dogs and kept the back area sanitized so no animal would get sick or flees from Petsmart. It was a really hard job, bending over all day washing dogs, answering the phone and making appointments. At closing time I had to wash the walls and the floors and the  kennels with a special cleaner so in the morning everything was good to go."
good,"too much work required, not enough time to accomplish it in."
good,"Greeting and assisting customers, stocking new products and cashier duties."
good,"I learned how to take care all different animals from cats and dogs to snakes.  I helped customers find what they were looking for either to purchase an animal or products for animals.  The hardest part of the job was having to cleanup after the animals but i grew to acclimate to the ransad smells. My job in petcare aloud me to work with all different sorts of animals and leanr about things like their behavior, how to take care of them, and what to do if something was wrong with them. I enjoyed it! Very educational."
good,"I've worked here for two years. Not once have i been notified of raises. I love the people i work with but they will not offer full time unless you want management. It was a great place to work when i was in school but now that im not, i need a more stable job."
good,"You will be promised advancement opportunities but as you work there you will realize they do not promote internally, that is why I am leaving the company."
good,"I came in early everyday I worked had two day off. My day begin with paper work, to find the negatives in the store inventory and correct this. Then had a holes report that had to be done three day s a week. You would go around and shoot the holes on the shelves the work the pallets and fill the shelves. Three day a week I worked the trucks that would come in  they had to be done in  timely manner had to be off the floor by 9:00 am, there would be times we could get up to 19 pallets at a time. I  had four people on Mondays to help with truck, the other two day which was Thursday and Saturdays. I would have one person to help on these days. The hardest part of the job, was that I did not have the proper help for three years, so I had to do double the work in short amount of time. I loved my customers I got to know, they became like family to me, and I truly miss them"
good,"made you feel guilty when someone else called out and asked you to come in"
good,"I applied for a long-term cashier and it was going well for a couple of months up until I realized the management is awful. Especially, the supervisor manager is nothing but a trash-talking, two-faced person swollen with pride and will get you fired for anything. All the other employees I have not had a single problem with along with any customers. The weekdays are very tedious. However, the weekends are the times when it's fast paced.  I admit, it's a fun place to work at and I loved interacting all the cute pets that walk in the store."
good,"was a fun place to work, was told things and management never kept their word. if you got sick they expected you to be there even if its phenomena. if you missed over it with a doctors note they threated to fire you"
good,"PetSmart was a fun job to work at, but at the same time , I didn't receive enough hours and I also wasn't getting paid enough an hour."
good,Management doesn't acknowledge much of what the employees do right its more about pointing out what is wrong. they only follow the policies they want to then make a big deal if someone else breaks a policy. Over all it is an unfair work place in my opinion.
good,Nice place to work.  I learned to manage time and learned to keep the inventory up.
good,Working with animals was the best part. You get to meet new animals every day.
good,"Petsmart is a jump in with both feet kind of job and if you need time to learn well don't count on it! I learned that while working for petsmart the employees are quit bitter when it comes to ex petco employees who get hired so beware if you used to work at petco cause the employees will not treat you equally. Management will bring you back to your child hood days of cattiness and gossip, don't rely on them to help you out when you need it since they are to busy trying to bring each other down."
good,PetSmart was a great place to work until a lot of the management was changed.  I worked there for 4 years with no issues till my fourth year when we had a large management change over.
good,"As any retail environment, it completely depends on your management staff.  I have worked in several stores and some are fine and some are awful.  You need to have a passion for pets to want to remain there."
good,I enjoyed working w/the dogs and their pet parents. It was fun teaching them and seeing progress at the end of sessions.
good,"I worked in the specialty departments, which is the animals sections, and I was responsible for cleaning, feeding and selling the animals, and any needs for those animals."
good,"Retail is retail no matter where you are. If you LOVE animals, it doesnt really matter not one store manager had a cat or dog. Most people are nice, you learn A LOT about animals and types of food when you work there."
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Definitely a fun job if you love animals."
good,enough jacks to choose an up to date voice pick system but the pace they want you to work at isn't justified by the pay
good,I worked for this company for 13 years. I moved up through the ranks fairly quickly. I liked helping the customers and their pets...
good,"-Caring for fish, birds, reptiles, and many types of small animals. "
good,"I worked in the grooming salon where a typical day was grooming pets and working with their parents. I learned a lot of the things i know about grooming and animals. Customer service was the most important part of this job. I had great co-workers and salon manager. The reason i left this job was because of the corporate politics. It seemed like the store and grooming salon were never on the same page which caused a lot of conflict. A good part of my decision to leave was to continue my education. The hardest part of the job was trying to handle scared and aggressive pets in order to make their ""parents"" happy. The most enjoyable part of this job was building relationships with repeat clients and their pets. My relationships with my co-workers and salon manager was great...in fact I am still friends with a couple of them."
good,"At work I would answer phone calls, usually to book an appointment or to give quotes. During a check in, I would look over the dogs coat, skin, teeth, nails and ears and make suggestions\express concerns for grooming. Example, If a dogs coat is matted and I have to shave him\her I would explain to the owner what matts are, what matts do to the skin, how it effects the dog physically and emotionally, what to expect and how to prevent matts in the future. Then I would suggest special shampoos and conditioners to help the irritated skin. During check out I will go over what the dog coat was like, how it is now, what to expect and how to maintain skin\coat at home. Other duties involved cleaning, helping other groomers if they have a difficult dog, showing customers the products we sell, training new employees."
good,"Working in the grooming Salon is not for everyone, I am one of them."
good,"I enjoyed working with the general public but the main goal of the company was making a profit and not the welfare of the animals being sold there, which conflicted with my own convictions and beliefs."
good,"A typical day at work meant grooming 6-8 dogs a day under our block scheduling program. While we groomed, we had to answer the phone, make appointments, check in and out customer's pets, and complete any walk-in services right away. I learned quite a bit about managing my time and how having a routine really helps increase my efficiency and quality of groom. My management was alright, but issues started arising towards the end of my stay with them. They started over-booking the groomers with more dogs than they could handle, and berated us when they weren't completed on time or a customer complained because the quality went down a bit. My co-workers all worked extremely hard, and they were a joy to work with. They were one of the only positives about continuing to work there. The hardest part of the job was juggling all the different tasks we were charged with and trying not to fall behind on time or grooming dogs. On the other side of that, the best part of the job to me was the interaction with the dogs, and the actual grooming. I found that I really enjoyed grooming, and I love dogs, so this was a good match job-type-wise. I could have done without management not listening and continuing to make our job harder and blaming us for it, but overall, I liked it quite a bit."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of daily opening & closing procedures. You can work as early as 7 AM or as late as 9 PM. Also need to be able to acquire great customer service skills. Determine the pet parents needs for their pets grooming and to actually conquer what they want, with them leaving 100% satisfied. You must have a passion for dogs to be in this field of work. Aside from grooming and bathing the dogs you will also need to answer phones & monitor front desk for customers. Picking up and dropping off must be done by yourself. Weekends are REQUIRED that you work."
good,hours were inconsistent. Managers were nice for the most part. Benefits we're useless (10 cent raises)
good,Was able to meet allot of new people and work with animals. However the maturity level of the upper management was mediocre at best. For the most part I loved my job and enjoyed the time I had there.
good,Petsmart was fun to work at because of the animals and the chance to get to learn about them.
good,"Primarily responsible for training pet parents to achieve wanted behaviors from their pets. I also assisted customers throughout the store with questions about food, brands, potty training, ect."
good,"cashier, use customer service skills by helping ""pet parents"" find what they need to take care of their pet. Ive learned the importance of customer service. management is good, they are flexible and work with the scheduling. the co workers are friendly and welcoming. the hardest part of the job is when the days are slow and the business is not busy. the most enjoyable part is seeing all the animals and interacting with them."
good,"the work was fine and the customers were fine but, the coworkers were hard to deal with. they had a hard time working as a team."
good,"This job was fun, I met alot of wonderful people and pets, however the pay was not that great and advancement was hard."
good,"I loved the job itself, being able to work with animals and educate people (especially kids) on how to take care of those animals. The management however was very careless about taking proper care of the animals and was very slow to resolve issues between employees. They did a poor job at promoting team work. If you like animals enough to look past the blame games, then you will enjoy this job."
good,Working for PetsMart has been a good experience. However the management needs work. There is not much care of their employees or how their employees feel.
good,Taking care of the customers and there pets. Tuesday and Thursday are truck day. Help put away all the dog treats and pull over stock. The most enjoyable part of work is watching all the dogs coming to the counter to get a cookie.
good,I love working with animals and the customers are great. A typical work day for me is 8 hours. I start at 4 or 5am and I'm done by noon. That way i can spend time with my family.
good,sometimes the corporate offices are hard to handle and the changes that come with such a big company are difficult to handle or are not always the greatest and good changes tend to not last long the people in the store are friendly and fun to work with but sometimes the pressure corporate puts on management and the employees is very frustrating and can easily lead the person into a bad mood or depression
good,Great place to work at. Some of the employees in the grooming salon were difficult to work with and management had very little control over what when on.
good,"i really enjoy this job and have enjoyed working my way up the ladder. store leadership has been rough but all the other departments are ran well. "
good,"If you love animals or wanna know more about them, then apply. Pretty chill environment. Gets busy occasionally but nothing crazy. It’s like any other job"
good,"I worked at PetSmart while being a full time student. They would work around my school schedule, but would always call me during class to see if I could cover people all the time, even though I told them many times that I had class those days. The people working there were crazy and insane. Alright first time job, but definitely wouldn't recommend working there full time."
good,The management needs some work but other than that I loved the job the employees weren't half bad. The pay wasn’t good so I couldn’t afford to stay there so I had to relocate.
good,I enjoyed my time working at petsmart. I love working with animals and the staff made coming in everyday welcoming. It was a great place to work and would do it again.
good,"Typical day is Customer experience is a priority,  checking  daily / through out the day  ensuring all animals have food, water  if  illness occurs to  immediately be  taken to a veterinarian.  Daily product  shelves full  and abundant for the customer, Workplace Culture  recognition of associates, hardest part of job lifting large items, tanks , kennels, 30+lbs of food. most enjoyable part of job pets."
good,"It's not a hard job but it can get busy at certain hours depending on the location. I don't want to shy people away from applying to PetSmart, just know who the managers are and talk to the employees. It heavily depends on management. Some managers from personal experience are more relaxed and give you more leeway in terms of how you can operate at work. Some managers will change things around to favor their own paychecks at the expense of the animals and/or the employees. Overall it isn't a bad job, but it can be based on location."
good,"An average day ranges from busy to hectic at PetSmart. No matter what, there are always more tasks to be done, my superiors find something to be dissatisfied with, and I feel a lack of overall fulfillment. ""It must be so nice to work here, you get to play with animals all day!"" In truth, there is not enough time to interact with animals for more than a few seconds at a time while still accomplishing all expected tasks. Furthermore, it is fundamentally a retail environment. There is an expected death rate of all animals housed in store. Fundamentally, if you are sensitive to the welfare of animals, you are a poor fit for the position as you will become upset either by the standards kept within the company, or the countless customers you will experience who outright neglect or abuse animals while you observe powerlessly. There are constant expectations to be more productive, make more sales, convert more shoppers into buyers and buyers into members, get donations... It is a sales position, in a customer service industry, and all aspects related to animal interaction are rushed, minimal, and standardized. This workplace is a good fit for some people, but not for most I have personally experienced in my five and a half years of working there."
good,"A lot of time on your feet. PetSmart will send you to grooming school, all paid. They will support you as a new stylist and do their best to help you with difficult tasks."
good,"The job itself is hard work unless you're strictly a day camp associate. Even then, being stuck standing in a play room for 8 hours with sometimes very little human interaction can be taxing. The health of the dogs in our care are highly dependent on our skills of observation and care taking. Yet, working as hard as we do and with all the responsibilities we have, we still are only paid minimum wage or slightly above. "
good,"Overall, it had its ups and downs, but I very much enjoyed working for PetSmart. I enjoyed being around animals all day as well as being able to work hands on with them."
good,"My personal experience wasn't great, but that had more to do with the employees and management and less to do with the company itself. There was a lot of two faced silliness happening, especially the managers. It wasn't uncommon for them to praise you then talk bad about you behind your back before they finally tell you that you're not doing x,y, and z. Not a lot of trust to be had in that specific store. That being said, I'm sure not every PetSmart has this problem, and it can happen in any job."
good,"When i was hired as a pet care associate, i thought there would be a lot more information given to new recruits on how to actually care for the animals. I was told to read pamphlets and learn from my co-workers. if i didnt have super knowledgeable co-workers, i wouldn't have know that goldfish don't go in bowls, bearded dragons should not be housed together (even though the store books say otherwise), that bettas need at least a 1 gallon tank and so much more. when i switched to dog trainer i went to another location for 1 week to learn how to train dogs. 90% of which was in a book that i read before i even got there. honestly they just wanted to be sure i remembered to push sales and encourage people to join the next class even though the next class was a new trick and more of the exact same thing but in a slightly different order. my coworkers were great, and the wage was alright but the corporate nonsense was awful."
good,"As a company this is a great place to use as a stepping stone while you're going to school or looking to get into your preferred field of work. I had the opportunity to work out of a couple stores and they all tend to be the same. The staff you work with are great and there is a lot of fun to be had while work is getting done. However some of the management staff I encountered were hard to get along with. If you're the kind of person who can take it on the chin and still get your work done, this is a great company for a first job or a ""wait until I find something better"" job."
good,"Advancement appears to be non existent thing new staff is not trained properly and learn while on the job, staff safety with animals and injuries should be coached when incidents happens what to properly do"
good,"Company overall good management?? Had good crew, good customer service,  handle inventory and as reset well, schedule was good flex hours full and part time"
good,"In my opinion, Petsmart was not a good place to work at. You never really feel appreciated by management, customers are almost always rude, and they don't pay you enough for everything you do. Associates are the foundation of a store and Petsmart does not treat them as such."
good,I learned different things at Petsmart a typical day to wear the headsets sign in and wait for introductions pick a task finished and deliver and keep picking another task and depending of time some task take longer than other one
good,"Petsmart is a great place to make money and they give you great benefits but in my personal opinion after working there for 3 years the money isnt worth it. You get treated like a slave and nothing is ever good enough for corporate. Corporate puts a lot of pressure on management which i feel, causes management to make you working there super stressful.the joy of grooming was quickly takeb from me."
good,All in all if PetSmart compensated better I would have stayed with the company to grow and gain experience with. They had a good work environment and made me feel at home at times
good,You are given the opportunity to learn a lot if you take it. However the stress of being a manager with them is not worth the what they pay. They also are going through a lot of changes at the moment and are starting to put employee's on the back end of the list
good,"Loved my manager, very reliable and caring. But the hours weren’t worth it. The way the company higher up was ran wasn’t that well thought. It was about the money more than about the pets and customers"
good,"typical day at work: stressful, especially if scheduling hadn't been properly managed, due to short staffing. emotional, some tension with passive aggressive coworkers. the dogs really were the highlight, but it becomes repetitive to stand in one space for x hours. "
good,No raises. Cannot talk about your wage or you'll be fired. Management is relaxed and recently I had trouble with some manager. Everybody that works there are super nice and understandable.
good,"-understaffed and heavy workload for every individual"
good,"Managers are more focused on selling products to customers and bombarding them with questions as soon as they get past the door. Many times if an animal is very sick and needs special attention management says no and pulls you to do other tasks without a second consideration for the pets life.  Cashiers are tasked with the job of 3 people, pet care can hardly ever fully get their daily tasks done due to management pulling them away to do other peoples jobs. Salon is over booked constantly and stressful to begin with without being rushed to get 5-6 dogs done in an 8 hour shift when each dog is booked a 2-3 hour slot. "
good,"I do not prefer to be negative but ,It was a great learning experience for me in the animal world.A few nice co workers .I liked the idea of getting a pay check every week."
good,"Good place to work if you like keeping busy, lot's of customer skills are required. Not a good place to be if you have any allergies to dust and or animal fur, but is manageable"
good,"I worked as a bather in the salon for about 9 months. It is extremely stressful as you're expected to do walk-ins even if you're behind with your appointments. Some days you'll be overbooked and have 6 people wanting nail grinds, and others you'll have 1 appointment and no walk-ins. The holidays were especially stressful, I was overbooked for 3 months straight. The tips were great during the holidays, but I got next to nothing otherwise. If you don't plan on being a groomer, I wouldn't even bother working here as a bather. I quit because my hours were cut so bad that I couldn't pay my bills, while the girl who was bad at her job but planned on being a groomer was nearly full-time. My manager also slowly was starting to have the girl who has been there the longest work in the store unwillingly instead because she didn't want to be a groomer either. The new computer system does not limit the amount of dogs you can get booked like the old one did, so you can be stuck with 4 great pyrenees and a gsd in a 4 hour shift if it so desires. It's always very gossipy. You will get bit, peed on, clean up diarrhea vomit and blood, get sprayed with a*al gland fluid (really Indeed, this is inappropriate language?)...."
good,"I was hired as a cashier and then they changed my position to pet care without telling me. Was expected to clean all the cages, care for sick animals, stock items, customer service, cashier work, care for all of the animals, for only 12.50 an hour. I requested for my position to be changed due to misunderstanding and it was denied. I left because of the horrible pay and enormous responsibility. I would have stayed if it was 15 an hour for all of those responsibilities. I also had to recommend food i knew was not good. Hours were good  especially if you are a student (although early, mostly 7-1 or 7-3) or closing shifts, but pay sucks. If you work as a cashier, then work for petsmart, dont do petcare unless you want enormous  responsibility  for horrible pay. Cashiers are paid to practically do nothing."
good,"Only managers and groomers are full-time. Employees are typically treated fairly. Managers are put under lots of stress by district managers and higher-ups, which stresses employees. You have to work OVER 9 hours to get an hour lunch break, or else only 30 minutes (so no one gets an hour break). Corporate does not support their store managers decisions regarding customers, even when store managers are putting corporate's policies into effect."
good,"I worked in the Salon. The culture was about animals, but there was a not-so-subtle undercurrent to push them through fast to get as many clients as possible. And perhaps I didn't have the proper mentality for the job, but my priority was first to build a relationship of trust with the animal before handling them or forcing them into the often unfamiliar position of grooming and bathing. This was never fast enough for management, yet I somehow was assigned the ""problem"" dogs. If I could manage an extra five minutes with them, I usually got them to allow me to clip nails or kennel them whereas others feared getting bitten. I understand that they make more money pushing through more customers and they always stressed safety of the animal and employee, but the main priority of sales seemed to work against what was stated."
good,"The job itself and the people I work with are great. Being with dogs everyday is truly wonderful and brightens up your world. Unfortunately if you take away the pets, and the people I worked with the job is overly demanding and highly stressful."
good,"Great place to interact with pets. Working well with others, builds strong relationship with employees and customers. Great opportunity to learn and grow."
good,"There was way too much work given then there was time to complete it. If you weren’t literally running, you weren't fast enough. Each of our pallets were supposed to take about an hour to work. How do you get 12 pallets done in an 8 hour shift, don’t ask me. The corporate it’s self gives management tasks to do but there isn’t enough time to do it. On top of it the plan-o-grams were always wrong every time. I loved the animals but, they just was just way too stressful."
good,Management could have been better but overall a fun work environment for all.  I enjoyed being able to learn and grow with the company.   Petsmart location is under new management.
good,"Not too stressful since there are always multiple employees around to help, flexible time schedules, good hours. They do not put enough emphasis on their living animals  but it could be worse."
good,"This location specifically does not have a good store manager.  Company sets high metrics that are very difficult to meet and prevent you from the quarterly bonuses offered. Customers can be the hardest part of the job; but the animals are definitely the best.  They do not give you all the tools needed to complete projects on time.  I would feel as if I was being set up to fail.  However, each store is different."
good,"Everyone going in and out of the store are amazing to talk with and the animals you get to interact with make the job great. In the end though the management were very competitive and rude, putting a lot of pressure on staff making the environment overall not the greatest to work in."
good,Nice first job. But nothing I’d want to be at for a long time. Staff is unprofessional and can’t keep homelife out of work life. They are very easy to who they hire. People can’t and don’t show up to thei shifts.
good,PetSmart is very competitive with advancement and low in pay. The coworkers are wonderful most of the time but the company expects you to do a lot for a very low pay.
good,"As with most retail, positions are part-time only unless you become a manager. Lots of favoritism from managers, if you weren't in the good graces of a manager, you would know it. My General Manager was awesome and was actually a competent manager, she did her best to treat everyone equally. Some advancement opportunity but not a lot"
good,"Personal opinion is that the quality of care for the animals went down. Absolute bare basics only."
good,"Too many tasks to get done without enough help - very stressful."
good,I’ve worked with petsmart for about a year and from what I learned is that they tell you that you’re special they tell you you’re doing a great job but in reality they all talk about you behind your back for not doing the best job.
good,"Petsmart was a cool place to work.  My only issues were the lackof help, and every few weeks there was a new thing to push sales which puts a lot of pressure on the employees.  Management comes down on employees for not meeting goals, but they don't do as much as the cashiers, and petcare."
good,"Part time shifts are usually only 4 hours a day and can vary from 10 hr/wk up to 32 hr/wk never a guaranteed amount. Full time it's 8 hours every day and non stop work always 40-44 hr/wk. It's not all about the animals, very customer focused place. No incentives for loyal employees, they do accommodate school schedules but with try to call you in every day your off. It's a decent job if you stay as just a regular associtae, once you move up it's very demanding with little to no support. Staff is usually nice and good to work with."
good,"I worked at pet smart for a year and I'm afraid to say that it was very stressful.  The women were horrible to eachother.  They complained mostly about wages and of eachother.  I got faced with too much stress on a day to day bases.  It sometimes felt like I was stuck in a children's playground.  I wasn't happy there so I had no choice but to leave."
good,You have to love animals and bave to open to having defferent roles and be open to what they ask you to do. The people will alsways make quite the difference.
good,"I worked at the PetSmart Hotel in Cambridge and when I started to work there, many of the other coworkers were disrespectful and did not even help me out when I needed it. There was also a few racist  coworkers as well. If they wanted to be lazy, they would dump the work load on me. I even told my manger and she didn’t even do anything and basically told me to deal with it. Word of advice, if you want to work at PetSmart Hotel, just don’t unless you want to be pushed around because your new."
good,"It’s not a job that I would recomend to anybody who has a family, hours are inconsistent and pay is to low to survive. Management was great but career opportunity wasn’t available"
good,"I'll preface this by saying that the Store Leader was more than capable and was a very effective leader. On top of that, the geographic area did not make it easy to find quality help. However, the other 3 managers were absolutely atrocious. horrible at communicating with each other, let alone the employees. Frequent mistakes by closing managers led to me having to stay longer while they cleaned up their messes. They did not motivate or train well, and unless the Store Leader was working, could not answer ANYTHING having to do with product since they were all outside hires. Horrible leadership and management at that store, and without the Store Leader, it would undoubtedly fail."
good,Part time is the only option unless you are a manager or a groomer. Management plays favorites and does not follow through with advancement promises..
good,I would not recommend working for this company. They do not care about the safety of the pet just bringing in revenue. I saw so many pets get cut and hurt due to the stress of trying to get as many dogs groomed in an 8 hour period.
good,"As a corporation its intent is good, It all depends on management at store level. There is no reinforcement for doing a good job. There are some great leaders and then there are BOSSES that ONLY care about how THEY look! They push harder to get you to work more for less pay and will bully you if you don't."
good,Fun and energetic team members help make the work and day go well. Although leadership and technology are stubborn and old. Management has stern rules and ways to do things while refusing to listen to suggestions for improvements towards efficiency and productivity.
good,"It’s not bad if you’re young. It requires a lot of standing, lifting, and climbing of ladders. Depending upon which department you’re working in, you may or may not get all of your breaks or have any help during the busiest time."
good,"PetSmart is not a company that values its employees over sales. Even after achieving your individual goals (add-ons, average tickets, productivity of 8 hr shift), they continue to push you until you're burnt out. You can succeed for three months in a row, but if you slip a little for a week, they hound you about ""what you can do better."" "
good,"My salon manager was amazing but store managers are not understanding or supportive and do not treat salon team well. Loved the actual position, but lack of support from store management and low pay for how much work is done makes it not worth it."
good,better management help in the salon would make it less stressful and more enjoyable. Hardest part was not having help from managers. I enjoyed working with the salon staff and the dog clients that would come in.
good,Really depends on who is running the store could be someone who is fair and treats everyone equally but there are more managers who have their favorites making the work place unfair.
good,"If you're looking for a part time job with limited hours and you like animals, this job is for you! The petshotel is definitely the best department to work in. You get to play with dogs all day and there's limited interaction with customers."
good,It was an excellent way of learning how to delegate tasks and manage time. My main downside however is that any mistakes are usually suffered by innocent animals that cannot help themselves.
good,"I love the co-workers and the pets. The store provides free lunches. The chances for advancement in the company are rare and you must be patient. The raises were annual and barely covered cost of living changes. If you were low balled in the beginning, it is very difficult to make a lot of money."
good,Management was decent but they did not want to deal with conflict and the other employees working at the store were absolutely horrible and unmotivated.
good,The environment in the store is very welcoming. Its a nice calm environment to be in. The management needs to better organize the store. Nice associates
good,Great place to work whenever you remove poor management. Very employee friendly and follows through with benefits provided. Any position held within the store is an opportunity to gain ample amounts of knowledge concerning the pet world.
good,"If you love pets, it's a cool retail job. Other than that it's not worth it. The pay is far too low to live on in NYC. As with most retail jobs, it's only worth living here if you have some other financial support"
good,The job was overall a fun environment. The animals were wonderful and entertaining to work with. The employees were not as fun and entertaining to work with but overall bearable.
good,"Compensation is great if you work in a busy store that sells a lot of classes simply due to the volume of people that pass through the store. For slower stores, compensation is poor since it's hourly plus commission. In slower stores, even if the trainer is part time, they are expected to be on the floor selling classes if they are not in class; the problem is that in a low volume store many classes have 1 or 2 dogs in them and there are few people shopping at any given time to sell classes to. "
good,The company is continuously changing policies. They continue to add on daily tasks but take away the time available to do them. The employees are awesome.
good,This is a great first job to have. if you take it seriously you can take a lot a way from it. i was able to climb the ladder a little bit and used this job to get me into another pay bracet
good,"I got to work with animals, most of the time. Everything was so chill, but I wish I would get more hours or better pay roll. There was favorites but I went to work not be liked."
good,"Busy days, learned how to groom and bath the pets.  poor salon management,  lack of job security and some benefits. The work was very hard to do and poor hours."
good,"A typical day at PetSmart is usually pretty busy and fast paced."
good,Fun place to work and always a friendly pet to brighten your day. A lot of work to be done keeping up with cleaning each area as well as attending to customers.
good,"Morning duties to be done by opening included feeding and caring for all animals (giving medication or special attention where necessary). By opening, we were expected to be ready to receive customers as they came. I learned a great deal about the care of small mammals, fish, reptiles, birds, and even the insects utilized to feed the reptiles. I also learned about different types of dog and cat food and products designed for each animal's comfort in a given situation. Management during my time sought to maintain their effectiveness in the eyes of the customers, but lacked in the cohesion they professed behind the scenes. We within the working force were cordial and helpful to one another for the most part. The hardest part of the job were often relationships with difficult repeat customers or new customers uninterested in our advice. Still, he most enjoyable part of the job for me was watching the animals grow and flourish under my care. When those few customers that did surface with the want to learn and properly care for their new animals."
good,"at petsmart, the grooming salon fluctuates on the actual pace of business and it is pretty competitive since you want as many appointments as possible since you make commission. I don't believe the commission was enough or was fair"
good,"Pay sucks, the rules change every time a new DM is hired, and there is no place for advancement. My manager is wonderful and really cares about the employees, but corporate does not. The job was fast paced but fun. The best part is definitely the relationship that is formed between you and the pets and their parents."
good,"On a typical day the staff was limited. Only one petcare associate, one cashier, one or two managers and no customer service associate. As busy as the store gets at times, the lack of staff really becomes a burden on other associates especially when there are multiple tasks that need to be accomplished."
good,"Decent place to work. Although corporate tries to get the job done with as little people as possible. Often understaffed,and the work life balance was not great."
good,Only way to really make money is being a salon groomer who breaks their backs and over work your self. You don’t get paid enough for the hard labor you have to do. It’s a very tough job. Management Is hard to deal with since you never know if they are lying or telling the truth .
good,It was a very good place to work. However I would much rather tell you in person of the experience that got me here and I can assure you that it will be easily understood.
good,"They work you hard, and expect you to help customers constantly. But half the time customers only ask things that you don't know (things a vet or manager would). And they don't train you to be able to answer those questions. It would be a much nicer job if they just let you stock shelves without having to worry about being ambushed with nutritional questions that you aren't qualified to answer."
good,"I really like the management and people that I worked with, although the evening shift was difficult. A lot of stocking and restocking and sealing with new/old customers who had relationships with workers- which allowed them to get unallowed discounts"
good,"Overall the only thing I appreciate from Petsmart is me going to grooming school and getting paid to learn a skill. Other that that management sucks, but it does all depend on store and team of course"
good,"This is a great place to work for if you have a love for animals, or if you're a student that just needs a job and something to take the stress off of you. Can be relaxed at times, busy and fast paced the next."
good,"Might work for them again. Possible advancements. Some managers were okay, while others I worked for I wouldn't work for again. Interesting place to work."
good,Be patient patient so you can get the job done at a reasonable time. You can get very stressful but just take a break when you start feeling overwhelmed. You can have fun at the job especially working with animals and you can build great customer relationships. You learn more things about animals then you probably didn’t know before. And watching the dogs play at the hotel is also great.
good,"I have worked at PetSmart for nearly a year and a half now. Despite several mentions and conversations about advancement I have in essence been demoted. For reference many of the management at my location were promoted within a span of 3 months to 3 years (with the three year being the ASL). We have changed upper management once (SL and ASL) and adapting to their vastly different styles has been difficult but understandable. I was hired on as a petcare associate working part time during my student semesters. During my final semester I had been reaching towards an available position as dog trainer but after weeks of trying to keep my foot in the door, the position was given to a new hire because they were unwilling to deal with my student hours during the training. I was then told they would train me for management upon receiving my four year degree. This was simply to appease me. After graduation and the start of the new semester not only was advancement out of the question, but a large majority of my hours are used covering daytime cashier shifts that were left open after Christmas break. Anytime I would bring up the subject of getting hours in pet care I would be told that I was lucky just to get hours."
good,"you learn alot about fish, dog, cat, diets, habits, techniques of approaches different people. starts day by opening registers, front doors, organizing merchandise in your department, ringing people up on registers, helping coworker out with task, email captures, selling puppy guides, talking people into getting dog training lessons, collecting online orders, meet and greet with customers and their pets. then closing the store by putting away go backs, fixing shelves , collecting shopping carts."
good,The company seems to hire external candidates instead of qualified internals. The hours are good and the bonus program was nice because it included everyone
good,"If you have a good management team the company as a whole is great. However as with any job, poor management in a location can ruin your experience. Best of luck."
good,"A typical day as a Pet Care Associate includes assisting customers with questions regarding the care of fish, small animals, reptiles and birds. You will be bagging and selling crickets, bagging and selling fish, ensuring the well being of all store animals,  be responsible for properly filling out paperwork for adopting out animals, adopting out other animals from local rescue agencies that are partnered with PetSmart and much more. There is a lot to remember with policies (it seems to change frequently) which are not always made clear to you by management which can make things difficult at times. This is not a cushy job, be prepared to get dirty and work hard as you will be constantly cleaning animal habitats, scrubbing fish tanks, cleaning up after peoples' pets, (etc.). You do get to meet a lot of cool customers that share a passion for animals, and sometimes you get to interact with their pets (be sure to ask owners' permission first!) which definitely makes the work day more fun. Be aware that there are short time constraints on daily tasks (there is A LOT to do) and if you don't meet those management will come down on you, so good time management is a must for working here! Some days are absolute chaos and customer flow is non-stop; be prepared to be the only one in Pet Care department for your shift most of the time! "
good,"The job typically included making your own appointments with clients to bathe and groom dogs. I learned how to interact with animals in a professional environment. The management was decent, not great because it didn't seem like there was a lot of control over the environment of the salon.  The workplace culture wasn't that great because there wasn't that much job security, but the ethics and expectations of the company were very high."
good,Good job. I enjoyed learning about different kinds of animals. I also enjoyed taking care of all the animals. Working for a cooperation is terrible. All they worry about is selling. So I took care of animals to the best of my ability with the lack of supplies and support from some of the management.
good,"It's of course not playing with puppies all day. There's more cleaning up after animals than that. You do get to visit with the pets though when they're at your register. They give paid training in the products and services so you know what to recommend. The pay is somewhat good, depending on your manager. What I mean is that depending on the manager, your job is simple if you work hard, or no matter how hard you work it's impossible. The uniforms aren't bad, and you're allowed some movement through positions if you ask. The hardest is cleaning the whole store at the end of the night and dealing with bad customers. At mine, we frequently had fake receipts or people we had to ban because of aggressive behavior or trying to get out of paying for services. People expect you to be an expert on every animal and product even though it's just a supply store, so if you don't have pets you likely won't do well in customer service. Every day is basically bagging fish, recommending products, dealing with angry people, and meeting fun people/pets."
good,"Provide lots of customer service "
good,the place had a nice environment. Management could use some work. I loved working with the animals. A typical day involved dealing with moody managers.
good,"For my petsmart, a lot of the regular workers were lazy so when I would do work it would just really pi** me off that we made the same pay. There were like 4 managers when I started and a lot of them change store locations but I don’t really have a problem other than the occasional attitude. It’s a nice work environment in general, but staying at the cash register for 7+ hours is super draining and annoying."
good,"lack of communication between managments to coreworkers. Due to the lack of communication , created high tensions which would make it stressful to work at times."
good,Difficult to work as a groomer. Very high volume. Difficulties in time management due to at hand tasks being constantly interrupted and very stressful.
good,A good company to work for just not enough pay. The lunch break is not long enough for a 8 hour shift staying on your feet. They are flexible with have a family.
good,"I have been with the company 2 years and although i love my job and would love to continue working there, the pay and hours are making me leave because i will never move up in rank and am used for my advanced knowledge as an associate."
good,"I was employed part time as customer service/cashier.  I also have shoulder replacement surgery during my employment there, and they were very helpful in finding me jobs to do while I recovered so I could continue working."
good,"PetSmart was a great place to work.  Most of the people were awesome to deal with and overall it was a great experience for me and my career.  "
good,"I've worked there for a year, it's gotten so bad. They're cutting hours terribly but hiring more people. There's no room to grow. Management sucks. I'm only there for the puppies and my co workers are great. Pay is about $10/hr and weekly. But once again, management is poor. Very understaffed due to hours being cut. Mean customers, store director is rude and doesn't care about employees nor cares to listen to what they have to say"
good,"I love the people I get to work with on a daily basis. We are a solid team and work wonderfully together to execute great customer service and quality grooms. A typical day is pretty busy, but I have learned to manage my time wisely to be as efficient as possible while working safely. The hardest part of the job is when we lose senior dogs. Its always tough to lose friends. The most enjoyable is working with request clients that I have bonded closely with, and I intend to bring their business with me."
good,"Typical work day was coming in checking what the priorities were for the day, checking to make sure the morning paperwork was completed and price changes were completed. Checking with the salon to make sure their were no issues and the pets were safe and no issues, .making  sure the day to day processes were getting completed, giving the direction to  sales floor  associates and department leads and follow up with them. Working on schedules and payroll is done."
good,"A lot of the managers disregarded policy rules, whether it be about cleaning/stocking or pet care. Also a lot of workplace drama and gossip among managers and associates.Not enough hours either."
good,"I guess it all depends on where you work. Some stores don't focus on the happiness of their employees. ""Thank you"" and ""Good Job"" are phrases always welcomed to employees who put forth effort and do excellent work on a daily basis."
good,"when i first started working at petsmart it was as a dog bather part time.  After about 2 months I was offered the position of lead associate.  I enjoyed my time in that position as I wasn't management technically but I was given plenty of responsibility.  I worked hard and enjoyed my job for a time.  I was then offered the customer engagement leader position, but had to transfer to a another store.  I only lasted about 4 months in that position before I quit and found better work.  The scheduling for me was unfair and I was left short handed without any other manager to ever help me.  Persmart is a good place to work depending on what store you're at and what your management team is like.  I made"
good,"Fast paced and busy. Not enough payroll to have more than 5 associates, including management, in the store at a time which makes tasking and customer assistance a hard but not impossible task. If you are looking for an easy retail job where you get to play with animals all day do not apply. this company requires talent and hard work."
good,A great place to work if you love animals and very minimal pay.This was a great company to work for until they were bought out in 2015. Now its pure disorganization and chaos.
good,I was ok with working here for the most part. I enjoyed my team in the hotel but didn't care for the rest of the store. regional managers could've picked better in store managers.
good,"The job was fine initially, though it was slow to gain business. Hours depended upon how many dogs were booked but it was anywhere between 7 to 10 hours. "
good,"On a regular basis, I am working non-stop from clock-in till clock-out. My schedule usually changes frequently throughout the week making it difficult to manage time outside of work. I've been working (slowly but surely) on being cross trained to take on other roles. Most of our managers are relatively new, so things don't seem to run nearly as smoothly as they should. One of the newer managers hasn't let up on giving me a hard time making what could be an enjoyable job, a burden. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to take on multiple tasks, assist customers, and work as a team player."
good,Working at PetSmart was a good job when I first started working. Its a good place to get work experience. Not a lot of opportunities for advancement with this company.
good,"I came to Petsmart because I am a lover of animals, and I wanted to surround myself with fellow animal lovers. The store is filled with people passionate about them in one way or another, be it a specific type or all. If you do not like animals, I do not recommend PetSmart. You WILL have to handle animals."
good,PetSmart was a great company to for.  They have since gone downhill.  The company has set such high expectations for all their upper level management that at most times it is unattainable. The work environment is usually great for the part-time employee.  A typical day of work is going in with a plan of what needs to be accomplished and only getting part of it done due to other pressing matters sent down from corporate office.  The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers and seeing all the new pets that are brought to the store.
good,"I took this job to get involved with animals because I've always loved to be around animals of all types. So that was a pro for this job but the management was not good, there was maybe one or two good managers at my location."
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work if you love animals, and if you dont need a lot of income.  The upper management is terrible and treats others with little respect. The pay is terrible, and most people management included did not stay working there to long."
good,You really need to have a love for pets to work here.  Whether it's stocking or pet care as long as you have the set mind for animals it is a great place to work.
good,"Staff is very friendly and are glad to train you. Nice place to work. But the pay is pretty bad, you have to push to be paid what you are entitled to."
good,"Overall, it was a good experience. There were somethings that about working there that definitely would make it hard to want to stay there for a long time. For example, scheduling sometimes seemed disorganized and many people's availability was disregarded. Managers were respectful and goal-oriented. I learned how to focus on the goals that management set as well as accomplishing my daily tasks."
good,"it was a really good company to work for until they change company hands, then it went sour, the management didnt really care about your other obligations you have outside of the job"
good,"great place, got to great people and their pets. most people are kind. needs better management, they are pretty good but do have favorites like most people."
good,"Working at the PetsHotel was a fun and rewarding job. The animals are pretty much the most positive influence there. Management is great, and even though the work is a little hard, they make it fun. An average day consists of cleaning and watching animals, to make sure they are safe and well taken care of. As the night watch, it was a lot of cleaning and making sure the pets were safe and comfortable. But it was a good experience. It taught me to be self-motivated, and to complete tasks autonomously."
good,"Decent place for highschool students to work, high turnover rates.  Management when I was there was not great but maybe it is better now.  Pay isn't very good for the amount of work required as a manager.  Definitely not a long term job"
good,I learned everything I know from Petsmart. Working with pet parents is the most rewarding part of the job. Management training could use a lot of work. Management is not consistent throughout the workplace.
good,Petsmart has been a decent place and has done quite a bit for me to expand my skillsets. However the work itself is often hard and requires a great deal of speed and physical strength. As a manager there is never enough time to get company projects completed.
good,"It's a good first job, particularly for people who love animals. It's one of those places that depends entirely on the blend of personalities to make or break the job. If there are intelligent, knowledgeable people in the top positions in the store it can be a great place to work. When to top spots are inadequately filled it becomes a place you dread having to face every day."
good,"Management was very rude and it seemed like their job was to make your job harder than it had to be."
good,"Overall, a relatively easy role in the retail world.  Large management support team in relation to other retailers.  Very little need to work over scheduled hours."
good,I worked for this company twice and the first time was back in 2002 and i enjoyed it very much... The second time around I did not enjoy it as much. The moral and management just went downhill and it was not the same environment as before. Managers cared more about overworking there employees for profit... Not working with employees on days off or request off days etc. Just very unpleasant environment at the end. If you take care of your employees and show you appreciate them can go a long way...
good,"Like a typical retail chain, Petsmart holds their customer satisfaction as the highest priority. Unfortunately Petsmarts biggest downfall is just this. They uphold their ""Look Great"" guarantee at the expense of their employees. In my last 7+ years, I've had my ups and downs with the company. The worse of which was going through harassment by my Operations Manager and having HR turn a blind eye. "
good,"Working at PetSmart was not what I thought it would be. However, it has taught me a lot as far as working with the public goes. It's rewarding to help a pet parent find the right product for their furry friend."
good,"Petsmart is a great first job if you are wanting to work in customer service as well as with animals, it is a very happy environment and you can tell it is all about the pets!"
good,"Some managers are easy to work with and others are extremely difficult. As a company, PS would rather make the associates look bad/unintelligent for simply following their ridiculous policies than admitting their policies are in fact ridiculous."
good,"Pet Smart gave me a great opportunity, I was trained and became certified as a dog groomer. This job was great with a good chance for job growth. The only downfall is work place drama."
good,"I find it hard to leave a positive review about this company."
good,The culture of PetSmart changed and more so after selling to a private company.  In the Norfolk market I saw 4 different district leaders (that have left for various reasons) but the instability negatively effected the culture and the demand with the management structure (not to mention the reduction of labor) made it extremely difficult to successfully complete your job and have a acceptable quality of life outside of work.
good,"I've learned a lot working for this company in the year and three months that I've been employed there. It's a fun and safe environment to work in and it's a job I would recommend to people in high school or college. A typical day after clocking in is first checking on the animals, making sure they have everything they need and if they are all still healthy, a to make a list of all that they need. Go around the store, making sure that customers are finding everything that they need and how I could help them. At closing time, going around again checking on the animals and giving them food and water for the night, on the floor and back rooms as well."
good,"Fast paced work environment. Extremely close working environment. Must socially fit in with other groomers. Team respect and cooperation and socially fitting in with the close friendships is a must to perform job well, all share common bathing, drying and kennel spaces as well as  computers. Very hard physically and demanding."
good,"I've been working with PetSmart for a year before I decided to leave. My biggest concern was that I would be the only cashier up front and my other coworkers would play with the animals. Most of my customers would ask ""why are you the only employee in the store?""."
good,"Had very limited time to complete all of the things they want you to get done. Most management, including DM, had no background in per care and had no idea how to do the job of an average employee."
good,"When I first started this job it was great and I truly loved the job. There are some aspects that I do still love, specifically dealing with the pets that come in daily. I have worked for petsmart for four years now and over the last year the company has gone down the drain. Pushing unrealistic expectations and being more about the money instead of doing what is right for the animals who come into our stores. Manager positions have been taken out of stores to reserve money, which in turn puts more of a workload on the rest of the team. Over my time in being here I have sadly seen this company turn into a place I loved into a dead end job that I dread going to."
good,"It is a really cool place to work but some of the staff (managers, etc) are very rude and do not follow the policies correctly. They will change your numbers, etc to get you fired like they did me. If you have children do not work there, unless you have an abundance of family that can help you if your child needs to be picked up due to sickness."
good,"Petsmart was a stepping stone into the grooming world. I learned the basics from their grooming academy however anything beyond that was left up to myself to learn by watching other groomers I worked with. Luckily the other groomers were eager to allow me to watch and learn from them. "
good,"This job was physically exhausting but could be very rewarding at times. The amount of work one person was expected to do was very unrealistic and didn't always appear to have the pets' best interest in mind. Working with pets was fun and incredibly educational and customers wer generally vet pleasant and happy to share stories about their "
good,long shifts in doggy day camp. co-workers were all very close and hung out often outside of work. You get to meet a lot of really awesome dogs and a lot of really terrible dogs. Hardest part was breaking up dog fights and dealing with aggressive dogs and owners. Most enjoyable part was seeing your favorite dogs and treats brought in by pet parents.
good,"Great to get your start in grooming and build clients, but wouldnt stay if you plan on  making anymore money than you start out with. Due to constant flow of hiring its hard to keep the books full."
good,"I loved working with all of the animals.  I was in the petshotel and it was my favorite thing ever.  "
good,"A typical day at PetSmart is really staright to the point, either your on the floor, the resigter ,or Pet Care. You learn tons and theres growth in the company."
good,It was a good place to work after school. Animals at work was great and the customers were awesome. Coworkers were fun to work with and friendly.
good,My co-workers were all really nice so where the managers. However I don't feel the management did the best job they could have they didn't pay much attention to what was happening unless you called for them. personally ruined it for me
good,The Managers there do not care about their employees as much as they should. The salon manager is very rude and doesn't take the time out to work with people. She came in trying to change the way that it has been done there for as long as i can remember and i would prefer one of the old managers over her and i am not the only one to say this about the conroe location which is sad.
good,Everyone is pretty professional and does their job. Employees do not seem to get caught in drama. Always able to leave on time or early.
good,"The overall day at PetSmart was spent running around trying to do all the work that you had on your agenda as well as the work that was on the other managers' agenda.  Upper management was constantly trying to implement new processes and new product display ideas, but they were all very last minute changes.  So it always felt like you had to work overtime to finish everything on time."
good,This is a good place to work. I love the people i work with. Management is terrible though. They still haven't paid me the first 2 weeks i worked there.
good,"The job itself handling customers is exciting and easy going. Weekends can be a bit hectic. In my experience more than half the time there were never enough cashiers scheduled on the busier days or in the evenings. Their training program does not prepare you for most common questions about products. Definitely an ""on the job training"" type atmosphere."
good,"This company use to stand above it's peers in many respects but due to a buyout months ago, the company lost what made it different but at least you get paid weekly and get to see many cool animals enter the store."
good,I have been working there for almost 5 years and I usually won't talk negatively about a company especially since I'm sure many of my issues are custom to our location. I do recommend entertaining the idea of getting onto anxiety medications.
good,You learn a lot about patience at this store. there are many different areas of the store that you can receive training in. there is however a general lack of motivation that can be related mostly to management and the attitude of the emplyees.
good,"Not a bad place to work.   need to understand people have lives and that world does not revolve around work.  when i first started with the company it was all about the animals,  now it is more about money"
good,"Petsmart has become a very stressful place to work.  The hours are being cut and management has taken on a lot more responsibility with no increase in pay. I do feel that I would miss working with others who are passionate about pets.  The people that I  work with   are awesome.  The company values are now lacking. It is all about the money and not the services.  I feel that if you give great customer service and meet the needs of your costumers, you will exceed as a business.  I do not like that we are forced to meet certain metrics and try to become sales people."
good,"I worked at Petsmart for 3 years and have gone through 4 store managers.I was also a dept manager myself and received no support from my store manager with employee issues. Petsmart has an anti bullying policy that is basically a joke because there is never any follow through. We had an employee who was a cashier and she was rude to Management, customers and other employees. Reguardless of how many complaints she has had she is still there due to her threats to corporate."
good,"If you are opening the pet care department you are supposed to do everything in a very short amount of time and it proves to be very difficult and if you don't finish fast enough then you get 'talked' to about it. "
good,Fun college time job if you like animals. There is some room for advancement depending on your time commitment. You just need to make sure you don't have any issues cleaning fish tanks or pet allergies.
good,"They pay isn't great, but otherwise not a bad place to work."
good,Learning how to groom dogs was such a wonderful experience there. The hardest part of the job is the constant switching & fluctuating rules.
good,My over all rating of this company is good at best and they really need to work on there work and life balance. Also there job security and advancement is minimal at best.
good,The corporate side of the company is completely disconnected from the actual in and outs at the store level. Constantly making mistakes that store management is responsible for fixing.
good,"I found that the environment of working in a pet store was once that I employed, however there were issues within the structure of the system and daily tasks that led me to leave this position."
good,I've learn more about dogs then I have ever known in my life. I also learn about the different types of dog food they sell what you should by and shouldn't buy your god.
good,10 hour workdays with overtime opportunity management is pretty laid back as long as you get your numbers hard to get fired as long as you show up to work 2 weeks vacation
good,"Fun place to work. I love working around animals and this job had every kind, even exotic. I wish the pay had been more and the hours so that I could have stayed longer. I love animals and working at Petsmart just made me want to go into some animal career even more."
good,Petsmart is a fun place to work because of all the exposure to many different kinds of pets .  My management style does not mesh well with the store manager's.  Training is poor.
good,Its a pretty decent place to work at once you exclude certain personel and the cliques and the drama
good,"I worked almost every posistion ther was "
good,"In general, I really loved working for the company. As long as all managers and staff were on the same page, which varied in each store, it was generally a pleasant place to work. Depending on the position in the company, it was usually standard things except being a pet care manager, which entailed knowing the in's and out's of the particular care of each species. I learned a lot about animals and business in my tenure with the company. The hardest part about this job was having to integrate business with animals, which I think have completely different values. I did, however, love being able to interact with all kinds of animals and see all sorts of pets come in, like goats and pigs."
good,I would work with customers to set appointments and to go over the groom they wanted for their pet. I would bathe the pet and groom the pet as discussed. I went to school for this trade and I enjoyed it for 4 plus years but it is not the job I want to retire doing. I worked with some neat people and love the animals however the risk of getting bit or hurting an animal is not something I want to continue to work around. I found that pet grooming is not just playing with puppies or animals all day. It is a very tedious job but when the customer loves the groom it makes it worth all the hard work.
good,"My duties as an operations manager were to oversee the day to day operations of all parts of the store along with managing customer issues.  I had a working knowledge of all areas of the store from Pet care to the grooming salon.  The most enjoyable part of the time I spent there was working with individual pet parents and their pets.  The most difficult part was working swing shifts throughout the week.  Having to be there at 3am one day then close the next, and back a 6am the next day was not the most conducive way to work."
good,"My boss in particular was very flexible and worked with me to find a good schedule that fit my school schedule. I enjoyed working with all of the groomers in the salon, but tensions did get high sometimes. Depending on the day the influx of animals would range, some days there was hardly time to breathe and others you may not have any customers. The hardest part of the dog was coping with each individual and learning the attitude of each pet in such a short period of time. I learn a lot about animal handling, how to dealing with customer complaints, and most of all how to multi-task."
good,"i was tossed around the work place every week until i was fired for ""working over time"" i started as a cashier than was moved to the salon than to the hotel than to fish birds small pets and reptiles and each area lasted one to two weeks, obviously in their minds i just ""didn't fix anywhere"" but everywhere they put me there was drama between the workers and hearing about that didn't make my work time enjoyable and it was a shame because my heart is with animals, but it was more about work drama than caring for the pets."
good,"Working cash register, when slow I worked the floor. I enjoyed that a lot. Helping customers & keeping the store cleaned up."
good,I worked at the register and assisted customers with inquiries and transactions. I learned a variety of facts about dog breeds and food there which helped in informing people. The scheduling was a little scattered at times but the people made the experience fun and of course meeting a variety of lovely pets added to that.
good,My job was a good job it was not fair the way management treated me was the only down fall. I loved talking to the customers and working with my co-workers. it was just management that was the main problem.
good,I liked this job. it was easy and great pay. Was a lot of lifting so you got a great work out while working. It was just hard working 15 hr shifts with a new baby at home.
good,"I worked there as an order filler and RSR (reachtruck driver) associate. I learned how to fill orders and drive a reachtruck. I learned about warehouse operations.Typical day at work is: start up meeting with stretches, supervisors going over daily info, then working until it is break time or time to leave. Management is decent. Weekend shift supervisors are great. Weekday supervisors however, made you feel like you were the subject of a witch hunt. Coworkers on weekend shift were awesome. They really came together as a team and got along. The majority of weekday associates complained all the time, were rude and nasty, and tried to find a way to get you into trouble. Hardest part of the job is meeting your productivity numbers or EP in RSR. They took away travel time, They took awaytime to unwrap the pallet for replants, shaved the time to complete tasks, then deny a majority of your downtime for excessive traffic or houskeeping (a requirement of the job). Best part of the job is the team in general and the nature of the job makes the day go by."
good,"I watch the dogs and tend to their needs.  Not what I had expected, I do not look forward going to work.  I have learned a lot about managing 5-17 dogs at one time.  Some of the associates could have been more sociable and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is getting used to all of the different types of duties."
good,Cool place to work with some mellow people but at times can be filled with drama from co-workers seeking favoritism from managers.
good,it was a good place to work. got let go because I missed a week while sick with the flu. got a doctors note and everything.
good,"I worked as a Night Pet Care Specialist for 1 1/2 years. Working nights you need to be independent and do what you know needs to be done. Your night will mostly be filled with cleaning and checking on the animals and in the early morning preparing and passing out their food."
good,"helping various customers with their merchandise"
good,"Although this job is repetitive and very simple to master it has been a blessing to get a break from arduous and mentally exhaustive work. The tasks are simple and easy to complete so the focus is on being accurate and efficient. Although working with the pet is not a hands on aspect of this job, talking to pet parents regarding their pets can be very fullfilling."
good,A typical day starts at 6 a.m. I stock from 6-9a then proceed to customer service when the doors open. I enjoy my co-workers very much are a pleasure to work with. The management is iffy at times and no one ever seems to be on the same page. The most enjoyable part of my job is socializing with the customers and their animals. It's a rewarding and flattering feeling knowing they trust me and that I've helped them the best I could.
good,Greeting and helping customers. Grooming pets and creating an efficient environment.
good,I enjoyed working for petsmart.  Many learning oportunities that enabled me to share with customers and in my personal life.  The pet care associates got along well due to a common love for animals.  The most important part of the job was to educate pet care owners in ways to ensure happy/healthy pets.
good,"I come in and clock in. Then i mingle with my manager and co-workersand the customers. Then I find me something to do rather it was help a customer, greet there dog,stocking, or cleaning up a mess that was made."
good,"good job for part time work, not the greatest management for hanging onto good employees."
good,I had a good experience in the first 4 years when the store manager changed it was unbearable.  The last year we never had enough people working the floor or registers.  Dog training was the best always.
good,"Crazy customers really bring the place down. the money is very good, the technology avialiable is terrible."
good,Progressed quickly and only spent a short period here after college. They were an up and coming company and have continued to do well.
good,"On A Typical Day , I Would Go In And Multi-Task. I Would Normally Start In Stock Then Be moved Around As Needed. I Would Either, Pick, Pack,Load,Receive, Quad Pull, or Material handle. Management Had Its Ups And Downs Through All The Management Changes That Took Place While There. The Adapting To The Different Management Styles Was Probably The Hardest Part Of The Job. Everything Else Was Based On Numbers Which I am Really Good With.Most Of The Co-Workers Were Not Very Knowledgeable, As There Was A High turnover Ratio. I Got Along Fairly Well With The Experienced Group."
good,"I am very proud to have this as one of my job experiences. I learned a lot of great practices here. Although, the work could be stressful, it was nice to see a cute puppy come in to help manage the stress. The company has some fair practices and overall tries to do right by their employees. However, it is retail and the work/life balance can have you sometimes eating, sleeping, and breathing your work."
good,"Generally everyday I would stock shelves. Learned how to operate a fork lift, inventory management, and other various ""warehouse"" elements. Management wasn't that bad, allowed you to do what you generally wanted to do. Co-workers were great for both stores, but that will vary store to store. Hardest part was maintaining the designated time they wanted everything done and put away."
good,i loved working here the co-workers were so nice and loving never had a problem with helping you with anything needed.
good,"Freight is freight, you work early in the morning to get all the items stocked in its right location and we do it very fast and very effecient. Corporate office is across the street so we would have to be 110 percent in all of our tasks all the time. Customer service was provided to everyones needs we held a bar for all the associates to follow by and we would always exceed them. All around it was a fun place to work mainly because of the animals."
good,A typical retail store environment and operation. Able to enjoy working with pets and handlers.
good,"Working there was really great, I had a lot of fun, but the management was terrible, and they didn't care about the animals at all."
good,"A typical every day at PetsMart is a very exciting and fun day. I normally would work in a different department of the store each day. I loved working in the Grooming Salon because I was able to interact with the dogs my whole shift and I really enjoyed bathing them. The part that was the hardest for me was the competitive environment in the salon. I felt that there was a lot of tension between everyone for the most appointments a day. They did not have a scheduler, so it was very difficult to have a full day booked. Another part of the job that I felt was very hard was walking into work to look and see that I did not have one bathing appointment for that day. I am a person that likes to stay busy. My overall opinion of working at PetsMart is very positive. The environment was wonderful and I do not think that the customers or employees could be any sweeter."
good,"Not a fan of most of the managers during my time there. After working there for three years I made fifty cents more than when I started, and had not advanced at all. Employees without completely open availability were shorted hours every week (when I limited mine after starting college, I went from thirty hours to ten hours per week), and full time status was almost impossible to attain."
good,I enjoyed the work. Co workers were great. My manager was very different. I worked 74 hours a week and became pregnant while working there. I became very sick from the long hours. I ended up in the hospital and was told if I didn't take at least a week off I would loose my baby. I sent in the paperwork from the hospital to my manager and she said if I wasn't back in 2 days I was fired. I told her I was to take a week off. She said fine. I called about 5 days later to get my schedule for the week and I was no long on the calender. I had been fired for not showing up after only 2 days off.... And now since I wasn't there for at least a year they will not rehire me.
good,This was one of the dirtiest hardest jobs that I have ever had. I learned a lot about a bunch of different animals and worked hard for my money. The management were pretty accomodating with the schedules and the coworkers were generally friendly and nice. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor and cleaning animal waste/The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching people that wanted to listen about responsible pet care.
good,This was a fun job to have. I really enjoyed working with pet parents and working directly with animals and fish. This was a great job to have during my college days. The only negative aspect is that they pay minimum wage or barely above.
good,"Able to work when you can work, if hours available. Very structured to a point, that sometimes they forget the associate is the customer impression."
good,Provides lots of opportunities to learn new skill sets and fun atmosphere.
good,"Overall this was a get back on your feet job, or just starting out while in school. Seen a lot of turnover while working here. Hard to get your scheduled breaks if your not diligent. Pay was OK, but when on commission it fluctuated greatly and made it a pay check to paycheck living."
good,"I enjoy working at Petsmart because the tasks I perform in the hotel are rewarding and fun, but the pay is so-so and the hours shift all the time so it's hard to plan anything."
good,The company sets you up to succeed. They offer training with no experience and tons of opportunity for growth. This particular location had a tough management team.
good,It is an ok organization to work if you like stringent rules and executing exactly as told.  Position leaves little room for strategic thinking.  I loved seeing the animals everyday.
good,"As a whole, Petsmart is a good company to work for.  They offer IDP (individual development program) in order to progress associates' careers.  "
good,I was with petsmart going on 4 years loved it until the store I moved to manage a store was full of lower managers that came from gas stations and had no experience and terrible people and had it out from me and ended up getting me fired for coming in and trying to train them on store policies
good,"They can afford to pay their managers a decent wage , but they don’t . I would recommend this job as a part time job, to gain experience in a animal care field ."
good,"Working as a dog bather and groomer is one of the toughest jobs I've ever had. When pet parents come in with their fur babies for the very first time, they are reluctant to leave them with strangers. I like to put them at ease by showing them a clean and beautified animal when they come to pick them back up. So when it's time to get another groom, it's reassurance to the pet parent when their fur baby is ""happy"" to see their groomer, instead of being completely scared to death.    The hardest part of the job is stocking the merchandise. It can get heavy.  Managers are some of the most fair and reasonable I've worked with."
good,The dogs were great to work with but it felt like management didn’t care about its workers or the dogs at all. The salon leader would go against policy and refuse to take dogs to the vet after they’ve had seizures
good,"Not a lot of understanding about work life balance, weird hours for grooming salon, when it's slow you make no money, floor management is more understanding than anyone in the salon"
good,"I liked working for Petsmart, i learned a lot about different pet products. The management at my store wasn't that great. I was a closing manager myself and sometimes it felt like i was the only manager working all weekends every week, while the other managers took at least one weekend day off a week. Store managers try to push you hard to sell things to customers and sometimes that feels uncomfortable trying to shove products to customers. The discounts were great."
good,I appreciated my time working at petsmart but the hours and location were a conflict for me. my education and safety are my top priority and clashed while working here.
good,"Fine first job or summer job, but when it comes to caring about it’s employees, Petsmart could learn a few things. Hard to move up, a whole lot of favoritism, and good luck trying to get a raise or hours."
good,"You have management in each department.  Everyone is trying to backstab the other one.  "
good,"Working as a pet care associate is a rewarding job and the best parts of my day are taking care of the animals and talking to customers about the animals. There is a large focus on customer service and you are usually expected to learn cashier, stocking, and other tasks outside of your job title. Management was usually poor and does not do a good job of keeping up with inventory and also does a poor job of scheduling while our store has a chronic issue with being severely understaffed. Management expects associates to work like robots despite the fact that animals are unpredictable and customers can take large amounts of time to help. The largest issue with PetSmart and the most difficult part of the job by far is the source of the animals, the breeders, which constantly send sick and dying animals who are doomed to live in cramped bins for up to months until they are healed or die. PetSmart's culture on the other hand was enjoyable, with a diverse array of people from different backgrounds which made the workplace more enjoyable. Some stores are busier than others from what I've heard, but be prepared to juggle many tasks at once while helping customers and learning new things every day and definitely tone on some time management skills!"
good,Nice people to work with but the customers could be difficult to deal with. I struggled with getting enough hours to pay my bills and raises were almost never given out even when positions changed within the company.
good,"Helping customers check out when shopping is complete"
good,Petsmart is a great place to find the needs that suite your pet! they offer just about everything you can think of and pet care is the number one priority
good,"Checked in and out dogs, cut nails, bathed and brushed dogs. Made appointments in person and via phone. Printed invoices and updated or created accounts for customers. Handled tip money for myself and others."
good,"I was brought in and trained to be a groomer. And all was fine for my first year with the company. The management however was too concerned with themselves, do not stick up for their employees. And i was ready to leave come year two. The company is fine but after making complaints to corporate about said management they did nothing."
good,"it was a great job to go to school and not have any responsibilities other than that you will not survive in the real world, not many hours they do not pay much and if you advance to be a low end manager witch is very hard to do you will get pay almost 11 witch sucks because others pays more than that"
good,"Working here is pretty fun don’t get me wrong but wanting to have holiday vacations, this job won’t allow you due to black out dates. Also if you have a manger like mine you get bad people who work with you and are unreliable. For this reason is why they call me in ALOT to cover shifts or do jobs that are not even in my title. But if you just do one minor thing they get mad at you. But you can be late everyday and not show up and you will be okay"
good,Management is poor and no one cares. I wouldnt recommend working there if u dont likje drama but for the most part everythihgn is ok i guess. i just dont liek how thungs are ran
good,Great pay but not worth your health Or well being. They don’t care about any real personal matter and kind of focus you to continue to work there. Not a job for someone small or short.
good,"Loved working with animals but hated working retail.  Most important for them was earning the dollar, over employees. Facility was terrible, dirty. Lack of sufficient lighting"
good,"Very fast paced from open to close. Checking in dogs, making appointments, wash dry and groom dogs, clean between each pet, provide great customer service. The management was good at times but the company is going through so many new changes to the point that the salon is left to work without upper management help. Every company does their best but I feel there needs to be more changes in store rather then just on the corporate level. The hardest part of this job was lack of management assistance and volume of customers with no staff and little space to accomplish the amount of dogs required to get done in a shift. Although I did love my salon team. We all had each others backs and we worked extremely hard to get everything done each day."
good,I believe Petsmart should pay people with lots of experience a little more than they do. Then they only want to give you 20 hours a week. I believe they should have more training and maybe just one person should do the training so everyone is train the same.
good,"Just your regular retail job, the most annoying part was not scheduling enough people. It wasn't always super busy but when it was, it was hard to find someone to come and help back you up."
good,"Management was a little bit too sales and quota focused, didn't get to know their employees very well. Place was clean and organized however and had a good way of running things"
good,"They offer a lot of benefits that were really great (for example, their health insurance listed that they would help with medicine and surgical procedures to transition mtf/ftm) and they do try to make sure their employees are compensated. Discretionary and sick pay, two weeks paid vacation as a full-time groomer, an hourly base rate as a safety net if you didn't reach your commission. However, they are a corporate business, first and foremost, ruled by profit growth and appeal to buyers. They emphasize safety and avoiding getting overstressed, but push to make more money, take more dogs, sell more things. Do all these extra things to make the customer happy but continue to do your regular duties too, in the same amount of time. They churn out commercial groomers, and it's more about the money of grooming than about the skill and art of grooming. Groomers get a crash course in grooming and then they're sent back to groom under a more experienced groomer, but the more experienced groomer isn't given the extra time to teach a newer groomer. They create groomers that can groom, but not groom /well/, and the pet parents don't know or don't care about the difference. There also tends to be a LOT of drama in the workplace, though that's bound to come when you have multiple people together working long hours with stressful conditions in a small space. It's good for what it is, but for people passionate about grooming, they might be better off at a mom and pop grooming shop."
good,It’s a good environment. If you like animals it’s a job for you. The people are very nice too. Everyone is very helpful. Makes things easier for everyone.
good,"If you work in the daycare/hotel area it’s a really good job interacting with dogs all day long. I think the only thing I enjoyed about going to work was seeing all the dogs and taking care of them while they had fun with others. The only thing is the employees and management, they don’t care about your life outside of work even if you’re struggling to juggle parts of your life. I think management is poor throughout the whole store. There’s a lot of drama and  fake ness with the employees and managers. I don’t think they know how to really run a positive work environment."
good,"In the 10 years I have worked for the company, there have been ups and downs. Unfortunately, more downs than ups. The company is not family/home life oriented at all. You are reprimanded if you ever have to miss work. They do not reward much for the good things you do. There is a lot of bad things going on in the company."
good,"They're a corporation, you know? They're about quantity over quality and it shows once you start working in the grooming salon. It's a pretty stressful environment and you have little control over anything"
good,"Challenging place to work. Assisting parents find their child's first pet, assisting customers maintain and care for their furrry friends, Petsmart is the leader in the pet industry and their company standards set the bar for others in the industry."
good,Not a bad place to start out at if you are new to the working world. Not the highest pay and no benefits unless you are in management as well no paid vacation but the job had a lot of learning experience for me and was a good introduction to the work field when I was 18 years old.
good,"fun place to work but stressful and hard work"
good,work there if you enjoy animals. I was a groomer for 3 yrs and t was a great career to have and I made life long friends. a lot has changed since I worked there tho.
good,"At PetSmart I learnt a lot of new things I didn’t know about animals and the coworkers were great... however..... it wasn’t what I was expecting. The animals live in cages that are way too small, not only are they small but also living with more than one animal and sometimes they don’t sell and they grow too big and they are still stuck in these tiny cages. The management is awful. Don’t respect the employees and when complaint to HR nothing was done about it..."
good,"I used to work in the salon a while back, and management was never any help. We would ask for items we needed and would never get them or would have to wait months too. One manager in particular cared more about other unimportant and immature things, then her actual job. Pay is low for the amount of work you do, and again management does not care about you.  Customers that"
good,Busy day in and day out. Expected to always attend to customers and ask more than once if they found what they need or need assistance. Always asked to up-sell.
good,"I left petsmart because of the career I am studying opened a door for me. Also, the particular petsmart I left got to the point they'd sell an animal to anyone to make money regardless how it was treated, and to keep customer complaints as low as possible."
good,Relaxed environment and easy work but room to move up or advance. Part time never gets more than 28 hours a week. No benefits. Early mornings and occasional nights.
good,"It was a great starter job when I worked there. Toward the end, the store I was at started to fall apart in terms of management. They wanted you to know more roles then what your job title was for the same amount of pay. I only made minimum wage. Raises were not even a dollar."
good,My supervisor micro managed me to death..Hated it...My commission also went down after becoming a privately owned co.. Then they were making changes to their work environment also. LIKE A BOILER ROOM TYPE ATMOSPHERE
good,"overall not a bad place to work,"
good,"My boss in particular was very flexible and worked with me to find a good schedule. I enjoyed working with all of the groomers in the salon, but tensions did get high sometimes. The hardest part is to stop what you doing while grooming a dog when checking the clients in and out, also having to answer the phone. It can be stressful when it’s busy on weekends and holidays. I enjoyed making clients and their dogs happy! It is a great place to work if you like to work with animals."
good,"As a groomer, you mainly work on commission. However, the rules and regulations are extremely restriciting and unrealistic just to cover the company within the media. Groomers are under appreciated and usually work more than what they are scheduled (taking an actual break is rare). The company pushes for numbers as if you're a machine and does not care about your humanity. Only giving three stars for safety, being able to put up a good front, and the money is decent."
good,"Love working with the dogs and their owners but the management teams usually suck, they tend to hire managers that have never worked with dogs before."
good,"Working with animals and customers who love animals is fun, but PetSmart has few opportunities for advancement and you're expected to work too hard for what you're paid."
good,"I  started off in the grooming salon, random 4 hour shifts here and there because they weren't busy. Worked my butt off for minimum wage but at least there are puppies"
good,The main reason why I left was due to the poor management skills at PetSmart. Not to say the managers were bad people or treated me unfairly its just that they were always late to do things/forgot.
good,"The flies and other critters in the store are enough to make you think twice. Do not expect validation for hard work. Do not expect compensation for being the hardest working. Any way Petsmart can avoid giving you money; example, not offering full time, cutting hours during slow seasons, cutting pay increase at time of pay review, managements inability to acknowledge your hard work to people in authority. They use bug zappers and fly strips instead of implementing healthy cleaning routines. And when someone tries to go above expectations with cleaning, coworkers take advantage and leave a lot for you to clean. Not a team environment at all, with no support system from upper management. I was super disappointed after working there for more than half the year."
good,company used to have a good management set up but it has been restructured and they dont offer enough help to management or current employees in the workplace
good,"I have learned a lot about the PetSmart company. I have learned different job function while with the company. While, its great that I know these job functions it also has drawbacks. The culture at petsmart is very customer oriented."
good,company is great to work for gives you alot of working its fasted paced and also lifting alot of heavy food and dog food. you get PTO and all of the other benefits
good,My situation at Petsmart was not typical. They are clearly trying to weed out and get rid of full time workers. I only had full time because of my former manager. The current one would not have given it to me. Customer care is all the company cares about and it is very stressful to find the time to accomplish other work tasks and have the managers be happy with your balance between customer assistance and work efficiency.
good,My salon manager was not very fair with all of the people and had favorites and booked more appointments for those people. Upper level management was not willing to work with staff when they needed time off.
good,"There was a lot of pressure to make sales goals, and if you didn't you were threatened to be fired. But the flip side of that, as a dog trainer you got to play with puppies all day."
good,I enjoyed my job and the team I worked with. the benefits and hours could have been better. I took pride in being apart of the PetSmart team. The only negative thing I can think of is there wasn't an opportunity to work full-time at the location I was employed.
good,"I learned a lot about animals, from how to take care of them to basic biology. I learned how to sell products and ensure customers of the facts they require. The employees were friendly and well mannered, and respectful. "
good,I give working here a 5 out of 10. There's alot of miscommunication. Low pay. The overall atmosphere asides is great. Working in a pet store if you love animals especially is a great time.
good,It's a relaxed job does not pay well but it's more for kids or adults with no responsibilities or worries but coworkers are great and fun to be with as long as the job is done and in a fast pace your fine.
good,"I worked in an entry level position in the grooming salon.  It is a lot of hard work, but there is opportunity to become a groomer in a very short amount of time, if you would like."
good,I loved working with the dogs and the people but sadly you're underpaid if you work there and the raises are a joke. you break your back for the company and you end up not getting a 7 cent raise because you called out once the whole year.
good,I had a bad experience with a bad manager. Management should be interpersonal and be able to relate to employees. Not tell them how bad they’re doing every day.
good,"I liked working here a lot, however being a student in college and needing time to do my school work and take mental heath days because of how stressed I was, management was not understanding at all. I liked my actual job, but i didn't like how I couldn't even drink coffee in a non-spillable mug."
good,"I came in as an experienced bather, was told that promotions were an easy thing and that all I would need to do was meet their requirements then they would train me fro grooming. After I met my p[art it seemed like everything they could do to keep me from growing, The store manager was way better than the salon manager who was barely there to know what was happening, and handle some of the in house issues. I would definitely go back just prob not with the same manager."
good,Typical retail. Had fun with customers and their pets. Had many nice co workers. Learned a lot about many different pet products and food. Wished they were better with the promise of full time and advancements.
good,"PetSmart is the largest pet specialty retailer providing best-in-class products and solutions for pets and pet parents. They also offer a wide range of pet services including grooming, dog training, PetsHotel and their Everyday Adoption Centers."
good,"Basic warehouse job, lots of physical activity and lifting. Good discounts but management sucks and every day was the same. Couldn't stay there long.."
good,"Good part time job while in school. They would cut hours quite often to where it basically was barely any money. Day camp breaks for associates became fewer and fewer. Discounts were good. The regular"
good,If you are a pet lover then PetSmart is the best place for you to work at . You get to meet many people and pet owner who love they're pets you will get learn what is the best pet food to feed your pet
good,"Despite the support of coworkers, upper level management holds our department with little regard.  Combine this with increased burnout and increased demands on the limited time to complete tasks, Petsmart may not be a top company to work for."
good,It was crazy to me that one person can work alone in the building while taking care of a lot of animals. Just didn't seem safe to me.  I think at least two people should always work the over night hours.
good,"Worked lots of varied hours during different days of the week depending on need. It was fun to see all the animals brought into the store. Really busy days though, and often short staffed. However, this was many, many years ago."
good,"The way you see this job is based on what position you have. As a cashier, you are either overrun with customers (many of whom are rude and demanding) or you have nothing to do and the hours stretch out in boredom. As a pet care associate, there is almost always something to do, but sometimes there is so much to do its stressful and overwhelming.  The pros of pet care are that you might deal more with animals (who are mostly very sweet) than with angry cat ladies. If you're looking for something part-time, its a great job with nice co-workers and relatively cool managers. The inconsistent hours and low pay are sort of a bust, though."
good,"Customers at PetSmart were always nice, except a few, which is normal with any job. Fast paced environment, management was nice, yet sometimes, they did not see the underlining problems."
good,It's alot of hard work and not enough pay. When I was there the magement was rude and unhelpful except for one person. It is not all puppy kisses and giggles. It's tears and blood and alot of helping other people.
good,This was a seasonal position.  So I do not have alot to say about the company. the tenure was not long enough to truly give insight into the company so I will not be able to comment.
good,"Petsmart was a bit slow paced, I worked there mainly because I loooove animals. Seeing animals every day and caring for them was what kept me going. I absolutely loved working around them, but the management wasn't always good, they barely taught me anything.. I had to learn everything myself."
good,"I enjoyed working with the animals, I took care of the snakes and feed them. I also worked in receiving on the night crew, it was good steady work. I got along with all the employees."
good,"Management was never really involved, coworkers were awesome! Great tips and they worked with schedules for the people that were also attending school."
good,"Since I was in management, always worked long hours. I learned a lot about planograms. Everyone was nice to work with. Some managers did more than others. Enjoyed stocking and creating new displays."
good,There are opportunities for advancement and on the job learning to help you.  You get to know the regular customers and build a rapport with them.  This helps to increase sales.
good,The money is good but you have very high expectations which would be fine if they did not take away every tool you needed in order to reach those expectations. They (Petsmart) do not really care about anything except for money. I do not blame management for being the way that they are (uncaring) because they get an incredible amount of pressure from up top.
good,this was my first job in the animal field. I learned a lot of things. Good and bad. i remember how annoying they are with selling extra things to customers and meeting quotas.
good,I always enjoyed my job very much. Love working with the dogs. Appreciated the job security. Wasn't a lot of teamwork in the Grooming Salon. I didn't feel like upper management was on our side most of the time.
good,It was a good place to work nice environment and nice people to work with and it was fun because of the competition that went on bout who can pull the most product before break
good,"Never ever fear about being hungry at work, they have free food in the employee room not to mention free water you really can't get any better than that!"
good,"Long stressful days. Can be super tiring, you have to push yourself to get the numbers, if you don’t get the numbers your supposed to get, you get warnings before getting fired."
good,Willing to work with your schedule but does not pay well. The only positive I can think of is that they pay weekly and offer flexible hours. Management could always use improvement
good,"This job is very physical and requires a lot of hard work. You learn as you go. When it gets busy you are expected to go fast pace and when it is slow you are expected to find something to do (clean, top stock, etc.) Do not work here if you think you just play with animals all day."
good,It was a decent place to work at management there was okay did not have the answers sometimes the people there were helpful but constantly on the move
good,"Workplace culture just depends on what salon you work in. Ours isn't bad for the most part. Most of us girls get along swimmingly. The pay is hourly + commission. You have the opportunity to make decent pay...if you work very hard. If you feel like having a lazy week you will have a lazy paycheck. (I have been there for 4 years and only make just over 10 an hour). Full time benefits are not the greatest. The health insurance isn't great. You have two weeks of paid vacation until you hit 5 years and then it goes up from there. Management is abysmal, you're just a number cruncher sadly. It's a good starting point however, especially if you want a career in dog grooming. I can't say much about the store since I worked in the store for maybe 6 months."
good,"I started as a stocker and was trained to run the register, this was one of my first jobs out of High School and it really didn't feel like anyone cared what they were doing, just treating the job as a stepping stool to pay for what they needed until they could find a new job. In the 6 months I worked there before moving on, I went through 3 Store Managers and my direct Manager was switched 4 times."
good,Loved the people i worked with. Didn't always enjoy how slow it was or how some of the managers were but it was enjoyable to work at . Loved working with animals
good,I started as a cashier then moved on to a stocker. I ended my employment as a groomer. I enjoyed most of my time at petsmart. The benefits were great and i enjoyed my job.
good,I loved and treasured the people that I worked with. these are great folks that work very hard to give their 100 percent at all times. too bad that it wasn't recognized.
good,"I would check the appointments for the day. Prepare the salon and my work space, prep shampoo system, check in my clients, bathe and groom the pets, check out my clients, manage walk in services, and print out my end of the day paperwork."
good,"I did not feel like i was doing much on the job. I wanted to be able to help around more, but i do not believe that i was there long enough to  be of any use"
good,The position of early morning stocker required you to be there before the store opens and break down the stock and place on the shelves. IT is generally non stop from the time you get there.
good,Productive and fun workplace. Only negative was not much Advancement opportunities. I would recommend a friend or family member to work here in the future.
good,This was a filler job. I needed to fill in the time until a new position at a different buisness opened up. I think the techniques and procedures for training here are out dated.
good,Was an enjoyable place to work and interact with pets and their pet parents. Physically demanding cause stocking pet food is heavy. But really enjoyed the work environment.
good,It was very high strung and could get very stressful at times. However I did learn how to trim nails and that has helped me with my own personal dog when she needs her nails done.
good,Company sold to consortium. Over 30% of corporate terminated. They also cut back on animal Care. They also terminated 40% of in store management. new owners not informed of pet requirements. M
good,"I have worked at multiple locations and after 5 years with the company, the management is one of the primary motives for me leaving. I have worked under awesome and supportive management, and I have also worked under management that spent more time trying to micromanage it's employees and tell them how to do a very skill specific job when they themselves have never performed the job. No matter how much work you do or how well you do it never seems like enough. PetSmart also changed the pay structure for its trainers, in theory it is supposed to equal out to the same amount of pay, but I am unable to pay my bills under the new structure all while doing the same if not more workload as before. I'm sad to leave because I truly have loved my job and would consider myself good at it, but this is not a company I can be confident in anymore."
good,"overall the job was ok. I did not really intend on leaving, But they were not understanding with my situation at home. Great job, great co workers, very bad management."
good,"I worked with the company for many years. Im not sure what it is currently like, as rite before i left the company changed ownership and they started making a lot of cuts. I was the full time pet trainer, and they kept taking my days away and even started laying people off."
good,i understand work is work but some times you need a break from the norm and beable to talk or sometimes its just a little overwhelming ................
good,"Most salaried associates work 40-50 hours per week, if not more."
good,"I haven't worked there super recently, but I have worked for them 3 times, none of which were terrible. The last time was alright except for expectations had been driven through the roof for minimum pay jobs"
good,"helping customers getting supplies for their pets "
good,"Great people to work with, fun to interact with customers and all great see different types of animals to learn about. It’s never a dull moment at PetSmart."
good,It is a fun place to work; however corporate puts a lot of pressure on you for certain goals to the point where it is ridiculous and frustrating. I would recommend working here for the benefits and the actual job though.
good,"PetSmart, Inc. is the largest pet’s specialty retailer, with more than 1,210 pet stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, over 189 PetsHotels, dog and cat boarding facilities, and Doggie Day Camps."
good,"Stocked shelves, learned different foods for pets. Management was ok. Co workers were fun. Christmas and Thanksgiving luncheon. Nothing hard about the job"
good,Wonderful place to work. I had a wonderful time working here. The environment is fast paced and competitive. The staff is hardworking and very knowledgeable.
good,"I worked as a Bather for about 10 months. The interview process is pretty easy. The first interview I did was with store managers then the grooming manager. I was getting paid minimum wage but at the time I was living with my parents so it didn't matter too much. I was the only bilingual speaker in the whole store which sucked because I was constantly being interrupted to translate for everyone. The reason I quit was because I was getting paid less than another bather that started with me and she only spoke one language and once all the managers switched locations, my new manager didn't respect my sunday availability. This is a good job for a first job if you live with your parents but I decided to get a different job that didn't pay me 8.25 an hour and then expect me to stop working to help everyone else. The best thing about this job was working with a variety of dogs."
good,Okay for a high school person but not recommended for a adult person. Manager was great alway willing to help in store when needed . Benefits were good .
good,Your days will never be the same! You will have your Regs who come in monthly or weeky! You will be given the chance to be crossed trained but only do it if you can handle a fast pace!
good,"I was on the Early morning shift Instock Team, stocking the building from 1am-8am, cashier helping customers with products, team building skills and good communication skills"
good,Working at Pet Smart was an excellent experience. Overall management was very helpful and knowledgeable of the warehouse. I was able to learn Pet Smart computer system.
good,Do not expect to be promoted - management will lead you on and not follow up with promises. Management is typically hired from outside and not promoted from within.
good,"I enjoy working with the animals and helping the pet parents make their pets happy. Overall PetSmart is a great place to work for a retail job. I feel they should give more overtime opportunities and give fair raises on hard work, not favoritism. Majority of my team are fair and hard working individuals. IT is also a nice welcoming environment that judges you on your work ethic not your appearance, race, or ethnicity and I love that as well."
good,"hardest part of the job, is the rollover in team members, store leaders and district leader. I had 4 DL in 4 years. Work place culture was a good one. most enjoyable part of job was interactions with pets that came into store."
good,"A while back i worked here and i enjoyed it because i was able to help cats (feed them and clean them), that is the main reason I took this ""job"". It was also a great experience to see how many people were helping as well"
good,"The petsmarts in Oregon that I worked at were great! They cared about the animals more than sales. But when I transferred to Washington, the Petsmarts here are very opposite. I saw so many things that made me cringe. That is why I left."
good,working with animals is wonderful  the customers are great as well
good,"The management is nice and accommodating to your personal schedule. However, the pay is on the lower side and there isn't really and growth opportunities in the stores."
good,"Address urgent emails"
good,Was a great place. i loved going to work every day. the staff were friendly and management was nice. hours were decent. nice clean place to work with plenty of growing capabilities
good,It has been a constant battle to have hours to live off of. They always worked with my school schedule but corporate doesn't care about its employees.
good,Management is ok. Mine don't do much. They have been there for awhile and are too comfortable. It would be great if they cared a little more. I am just too old to work with teenagers
good,"It was the average job. I was responsible for the care and cleaning of all the pets; cats/dogs/reptiles/birds/rodents, and all of the feeder insects  ."
good,"I actually have one of the best jobs in the company. But unfortunately, I have reached the top of my profession and have no room to grow. I love my managers, but just like everywhere, there are great managers and poor ones. But if you are a hard worker, show up on time and be happy at work, you will do well."
good,"Hours sucked, pay sucked, managers sucked, paperwork sucked. Only thing that made it bearable was that my specific store was close to hibachi take out"
good,Fun place to work for petsmart great company good benifits great place to find your next best friend friendly faces great people employees get one hr for lunch great way to relax and eat
good,"Definitely a corporate run business. Impractical ideals for position held. Poor management. Too much workplace stress. Too many hours worked, especially around the holidays."
good,It’s a good job for kids coming out of high school or a part time job but it won’t support your monthly bills and I don’t really think it’s a career job unless you’re a part of management
good,"orderfilling for pets. i learn to work smart and not hard by making it easy for my to pick my order but also following the rules. management was different every 3 months, work place unorganized, hardest part you had to make 100% everyday, enjoyable was lunchtime"
good,Its a good place to work due to the fact you have weekends off and alot of vaction days lng as yu keep your number up 100% you have little to nothung to worry about
good,I liked working at the groomery. It was a new concept and I was happy to be chosen to start as a bather. They worked with my schedule being part time and understood my needs.
good,Great benefits minimum wage pay. In the current position that I hold there is no opportunity for advancement. Management doesn't seem to care about much just following the procedures not open to suggestions from employees on better ways things can be done. If you contact PetSmart with the issues they will not respond to you. If you are a good organized worker it doesn't matter because there are plenty other people who are unorganized and you end up getting screwed over. Workload is way too high for one person especially in summer when you can have up to 75 pets that you have to monitor by yourself which means that you aren't able to actually spend that much time with them because you're so busy getting everything set up for the next shift and trying to minimize their work. They keep piling on work and encourage Associates to do more jobs without increasing your pay.
good,nothing worse than a high turn over rate. good company but should focus on employees better. and keep a better eye on their store leaders. but to do that you would have to have a consistant district leader. someone just needs to crack the whip and hold people accountable for their actions
good,Petsmart is definitely not a place for people who've never worked in service before. You need to know how to communicate with each other and the clients.
good,I liked Working there for the first year. The management was terrible. It was nice starting as a cashier then getting promoted to a dog bather and from there get sent to grooming academy and becoming a dog groomer.
good,Extremely disorganized with no management and this is the reason I am quitting. They do not treat their employees right. They paid me decent but all of my peer were not.
good,very much enjoyed working with Petsmart. good place to work. fun and friendly environment. would recomend to anyone looking for a good entry level position
good,Used to be a wonderful and family oriented company. After selling Petsmart to investors 2 years ago they lost their core values and beliefs in how they treat associates and the atmosphere they create. They are now just another brick and mortar as opposed to the once amazing company they were prior to the sale.
good,"I honestly didn't have a good experience working at petsmart. I was big and pregnant but still had to lift 50lb bags of dog food, get on my hands and knees to scrub dog feces off of floors and display cases, and didn't really get breaks."
good,Typical retail work environment nothing more nothing less.  Clear communication depending on management and personal feelings get confused with professionalism
good,"A typical day at work consisted of mostly tasking. Team members, including myself, would spend our time assisting customers, putting product away, and fixing up the store at the end of the night. In between breaks from classes I would assist my coworkers in these tasks."
good,"The rollover is ridiculously high, especially Store management. They have little to no communication skills. Plus there is no gray area for termination. sometime it takes months to fire a bad employee and a few days for a good one."
good,enjoyed learning about exotic pets help me find a job with lionville  vet hospital because I use to take sick animals from petsmart to them.  left to work full time at lionville vet hospital.
good,PetSmart was a rewarding experience in learning about handling pets and properly taking care of them. I also interacted with many people from many different walks of life and learned a lot.
good,"I started as a cashier and was promoted to management. My store manager was terrible and had a 100% turnover rate. The pet care department is fun to work in, but corporate demands so much but gives you so little to do it with. It's really not about the animals but how much money you can make them which is sad."
good,"PetSmart, Inc. is the largest pet’s specialty retailer, with more than 1,210 pet stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, over 189 Pets Hotels and boarding facilities."
good,"the co-workers are pleasant, the facility was always nice and clean. They provide all the tools needed for grooming and bathing animals. The management need training on motivation and professionalism."
good,"Yeah, its always retail. Do it all with little support. I learned a lot but it can be very little gratification depending on your manager.  The people are the best part, as well as the customers"
good,"I did not enjoy working at this job. I did; however, enjoy working with the animals and getting to take care of the clients' pets that they would bring in."
good,"I was a PetCare Associate and a Bather at Petsmart and I feel like, under the improper management, it's very stressful. The company wants you to get so much stuff done in such a short amount of time, and it's only one associate per shift so everything is up to you. My store manager was very rude and didn't seem to care about anyone at all. Many times I debated contacting HR and now I'm regretting that I didn't."
good,"It was interesting to work here, as I was constantly passed up for advancement from bather to groomer. There isnt' much more to say about it, really..."
good,I would come in around 5am Friday Saturday and Sunday and stay for 12 hours. Make sure you eat cause this is defiantly a job you can easily work up an appetite
good,"work was the same every day. I bath dogs did there nails  showed member servies. chashier, clean up after my self. helped others with there dog. clean the salon"
good,"It is a pretty typical retail job with added responsibilities and benefits that come with working with animals and animal lovers. If you are a hard-working person looking for retail employment that loves animals, consider working for PetSmart."
good,working at petsmart was fun but it could be overhwhelming at times specially during the holidays but overall enjoyed the time I worked there and I learned a lot.
good,"Great teamwork with other associates, and most managers were decent.  The pay is low for what is expected in the job."
good,"Was not a fan of new management and could no longer tolerate working at this location."
good,"No too much comment to make for this. Very hard job place, a typical day as like everyday, not changes. Only continuous process, less than 40 hours per week."
good,"My hours were mediocre in had to work 4 am to 1 pm 3-5 days a week, the people I worked with made the jkob tolerable nothing else get a feel for who is around you if you take this job on."
good,"The job pay is sad, health care, what is that lol, only thing I like is working with the adorable pets. The people at the job are so cutthroat its crazy!....."
good,"provide great customer service , make sure pet parent gets what they need for their pet, groom dog or cat, provide the right service for the dog, and make sure all pets are safe."
good,"The beginning of the day is exciting and they keep you updated, along with your daily stretches. I learned how to pick and pack at an exceptional rate. The management lacked in many areas and only came around under pressure of their bosses. Employees there were standoffish and uninviting at times. The hardest part of my day was trying to get the hands free headset to hear and process what I was saying. The best part was the exercise."
good,"Good place to work at, good environment and good benefits."
good,"Competitive salary, continued education, good benefits, good employee discounts. Great customer connections. fun place to work especially on weekends with all the dogs coming into the store"
good,As a newly experienced dog groomer/bather alot was expected of me  and individuals who had been employed at this petsmart made it difficult for new comers like myself to feel comfortable.
good,"Loved the challenge of the workload and type of work I was doing. I was not passionate about pets, and this fact alone drove me out because of the pressure surrounding ""being an outcast""."
good,"I started there with a vision of becoming a great Pet Stylist. While I love the message of the company and their vision, the team leaders that i worked under were very catty and liked to have cliques and choose favorites like it was high school all over again. Even during my grooming school , I noticed this was an issue at other stores we worked with in their teams as well. The job itself wasn't that hard. I loved establishing a relationship with the clients but the expectations of how many dogs per day i had to do was more of an assembly line where it was quantity over quality. You cannot have that attitude when dealing with living beings. I left on a moral ground."
good,"I was employed at Petsmart Company for just under two years. Overall, my experience at the company allowed me to grow as an individual with my communication, team building, and customer service skills. A typical shift at this company consisted of monetary transactions, stocking products, answering customer's questions, and referring specific products to satisfy customer needs. The workplace culture was enjoyable and appealed to my interests to supporting animal lovers/families. The hardest portion of this job was the large amount of tasks that were asked of employees in such a short amount of time. The most enjoyable portion of this job was knowing that I was helping owners/families have better care for their pets."
good,"Working at PetSmart is productive there is always something to do and you can grow up in ranks, by learning from all the departments that's the good think and with having good associates and depending on the managers in the store its great. The only downside about working at PetSmart is the lack of hours and that on busy days we lack associates there isn't enough associates to help out on the sales floor, help in each department and help customers. The other problem is the struggle with the registers they tend to be slow, freeze in the middle of transactions, out of all the phone usually one or two work, the company takes for ever to fix things. The last thing would be how the company demands a lot of sales from associates and the managers are non stop on top of associates pushing for sales sales on specific things because of Corp. and in return the associates just get a recognition."
good,"PetSmart is a fun place to work. They're a bit rigid in terms of ideas and implementation. Shelves and product placement must be precise; according to the guide book. PetSmart is the type of retail that emphasizes specificity and direction. Tasks must be completed a certain way, which should yield a specific-looking result."
good,"Management positions work 10 hr shifts that tend to be stressful but great if you can juggle the hours. If your part time, the discount is great if you have furry friends at home."
good,Good benefits good people but the pay is very low if PetSmart pelota more I think people will stay longer that was an issue with me good environment good management good lunch hours they treat their employees a lot better but the pay is very very low if you're into animals and other positions it's a good place but they must pay a little more to keep people there cuz what you do with animals and everything should tell you that you care about your company and your employees
good,It was a very good job by I was only there on temp to hire status. The job was good I drove the forklift there and made good money with good people. Unforgettably I didn't get to stay on full time.
good,This company was alright to work for. They were a relaxed environment with basic retail expectations. However they did not pay very well and the raise options were minimal at best
good,A usual shift at Petsmart for me was mostly talking to people and scanning their items on cash. On the odd shift I would be walking around the store helping customers find items and answer any questions they had.
good,"The dogs and animals in general make Petsmart a great place to work.  My co-worker are very nice and most of the Pet parents that shop in the store.  However, I often joke that the people mess up the store more than the dogs.  And, for some reason, they think we are there to clean up after their dogs.  We provide Oops stations for them to use to clean up dog waste.  But, often get attitude from customers when we politely tell them to do so."
good,Very fast paced environment learned how to operate all forklifts . Able to assist a great team great team spirit i loved this place i helped a lot of people
good,A typical day at work can be very unpredictable. The atmosphere is very much set upon the managers and how they are feeling. I loved working there at the beginning however slowly decreased in my desire to work there.
good,"Love the interaction of the dogs but disapprove of the policy of being pressured to cut so many dogs in one day. Its a stress hazard fro you and the dog., Many of the haircuts we did there were necessary to keep the day flowing. We did not have time to demat or untangle dogs coat due to time constraint. I hated that!!"
good,"I had this job while in college to make extra money. The job itself was exactly what I was told it would be, and I had zero issues with the actual store management. Where I had issues were with the supervisor directly over our department and the way in which he operated. Overall, it would make a great job to teach those just starting in the workforce responsibility and how to begin to manage and balance a work, school, and home life."
good,I loved working at Petsmart because of the animals. It sometimes did get very stressful when watching dogs in large groups in the Pets Hotel because you never knew when a fight would breakout between the dogs. That was really the only downside though.
good,"Nothing to say, I did not enjoy this job. We were taught one thing and told to do another. I left as soon as I figured it out and was heartbroken by their rules."
good,"Management couldn't communicate with each other on what the store needed, causing me to be transferred to a new store and then have to leave two shifts later because they ended up realizing they couldn't work with my schedule."
good,Petsmart is a relaxed atmosphere however there are some rules that get made by corporate that are hard to understand. You have to enjoy working retail
good,management not helpful or supportive
good,"overall a good place to work. The people were nice, management was professional and trained well. The benefits were nice. They were flexible with hours."
good,"This was a fast paced customer service that handled inbound calls for the hotels , and grooming services. One of the easiest jobs I have ever had. When management changed incentives changed and was very hard to adjust to lower incentives but metrics expected to be increased . Change was probably hardest part of this job"
good,At Petsmart you are always learning something new about different animals and their behavior. The most enjoyable part of the job is the animals themselves
good,"Was great for a first job.  Competitive pay, flexible in positions you work, and pretty low stress for a retail job.  Would recommend this for high school student trying to get work experience."
good,"it was a clean work environment where I never felt pressured to do anything that I felt uncomfortable with. The people were nice, the atmosphere was nice. I do not regret my time here."
good,"Pet smart was a fun environment to work for, but it dose lack in a few places, the culture of the store slowly was lacking when i was there. management did not keep there word when they said they were going to do something and they also never wrote anyone up for verbal harassment. Typical day could take you from cleaning cages to stocking shelves or even on the register."
good,"It was okay for something temporary, unfortunately I had to leave due to pregnancy complications but I loved working with the animals and educating customers about them."
good,"I loved working for Petsmart, I just had trouble as a new manager to the company trying to fix the rules that no one ever followed for the past few years, since i was new, no one took it seriously when i got my higher managers involved in the problem"
good,"Made lots of empty promises, often screwed up my schedule and then blamed me for it. Management picks favorites and insults employees. Discriminated against a pregnant coworker. The manager never actually did any work, only ever sat in his office on the phone gossiping. Often called employees incompetent. Pet care manager does not do her job. Often kills fish on purpose or just let's them die. Needless to say this place is not worth it."
good,First off I worked for two locations. My first Macedonia was nice but my managers were not as fun and the store was small. The last one Fair lawn was mostly fun but very large and required a fast step to keep up or your left behind.
good,Company was good and it was also a good old boys club but mangers were a little better than most. There was advancement if you were a male. Females had to work twice as hard
good,"I worked there when it first opened. It was fun while I was there. I heard after I left, a few more employees also left because they hired new management and it wasn't the same."
good,It's great if you're ok with being overbooked or pushed to take on more than you want. I would get stuck with too many appointments most days and left to find something different.
good,"Although I enjoyed the satisfaction of making the dogs look wonderful, the job is very physical. Manipulating heavy dogs is demanding on the physical body."
good,"Working at PetSmart was overall fairly easy and relaxed. However, I did not like how the animals were treated sometimes. It was very difficult to work with people who did not seem to care at about animal well fare, specially managers. Also, at times there was a shortage of employees; I was constantly asked to stay late."
good,"PetSmart was not a bad place to work. Hours werent the best, and sometimes there was drama. Even though i love pets, i would not work there again if given the chance"
good,"I worked In petcare , in petsmart. And with all the knowledge and love I have for animals, Working here was a bit challenging.  Due to the fact that i  DO  know a lot about animals, and have owned pretty much every type of animal they even sell at petsmart, It became more of a tedious battle with management and everything else due to the fact that they often wanted things done that was NOT beneficial to the animals in their care. So I would do my job as asked, it just didn't sit well with me, when an  animal could have been easily prevented from becoming sick, but it was ignored due to "" by the book"" guidelines for care on that animal."
good,"There was hardly any staff available to cover shifts. Supervisors and staff are overworked but required to do the jobs of 3 people. When management changed, the values of the company changed as well."
good,"A fun environment to work in. You are hands on with animals everyday! PetSmart appreciates employees that work for them for many years and gives opportunities to advance. However, salary is not enough to support an independent lifestyle."
good,"Ours is a busy store and oftentimes we do not have the hours to grant to associates to enable us to take care of not only the animals in our care as well as the customers. They provide training, but it is very minimal and all associates will benefit for a more thorough training process. It is enjoyable creating relationships with the Pet Parents and seeing our regulars come through. There isn't as much animal contact as one would think unless you work in the hotel or grooming salon. Full time associates are also few and far between, but there is lot of flexibility for students"
good,The poor upper management can cause some uncertainty in the work place but other than that the pay and hours your are expected to work are average. With that in mind it is a unique place to work with various pets coming through the doors. Overall it is a good place to start working out during or out of high school.
good,I enjoyed working at petsmart at the time but realized how much they don't seem to really care about animals like they claim to.  A typical day working there consisted of taking money and making change. Taking care of the animals.
good,"Work experience will vary depending on which store you work at. Hires mostly part-time positions working 20-25 hours a week, 4-6 hours a day. Great for animal lovers."
good,"The DC has an easy going atmosphere at times. There is a ping pong table, basketball goal near the break area. The main break room has an assortment of items you can purchase and kind of reminds you of a convenience store."
good,Neat place to work. I'd recommend it for someone looking for a part time job. Or maybe just a job while they're going through school. Although there's a handful of places I can list that have part time jobs that pay better.
good,"I love working at PetSmart because of the people I work with. BUT, it seems like a complete mess further up. They have no clue what they are doing and are basically making everyone who once loved their jobs hate coming to work everyday. They have cut hours and made getting our quarterly bonus impossible for all management."
good,"Working with animals was aawesome, and the other employees where the best. I wouldn't mind working for another PetSmart company or store. Great customers."
good,"Love my coworkers and managers, the work environment is fun, helping customers is satisfying. However corporate's limit on hours and having schedules with no available overlap causes a lot of strain in various departments, we are often stretched entirely too thin across the store as a whole and it impacts our ability to help all customers and complete all assigned tasks."
good,I still think this is stupid and dumb i should not have to do this. I am going to close my accunt with indeed because og how dumb this is STOP THIS NOW
good,"Doing what used to be spread over 3 managers by myself, this became increasingly difficult. Honestly CEO really needs to reevaluate what they think people can do by themselves. They are asking way too much without any resources."
good,"My typical day at work was fairly relaxed and easy going. The customers are great, you get to see all the pets that walk in and out the door. I learned many things in PetCare such as caring for the animals, medicating them, showing them to customers and educating them in a new future pet they be interested in buying. Hardest part of the job was probably the facing of the store overall not something to struggle with to much. I enjoyed the environment, my coworkers, the customers, and the many different pets!"
good,"Worked as a bather for about a year and had plenty of opportunities to advance to a groomer because they're always looking to get more and they offer a paid training program after you show that you're capable, but it's a 2 year contract and you don't get any raises or bonuses, even after working for 10 years like some of my coworkers have. You can still rake in some really good money as a groomer if you actually work hard, but with dogs being unpredictable and often violent it can be a very high-stress job."
good,I washed dogs. I answered phones. Checked in and out dogs.  Light clean up.  I had allot of fun and met some of my best friends there! I also learned to work customer service at the register sometimes.
good,Petsmart was more of gaining experience in a workplace and earring  little bit of cash while I was in school. I meet some cool peeps along the way. Fun work place as a teen.
good,"Alot of salon drama. Very little recognition. However, they have paid training and the money is good. Good benefits , too. Alot of favoritism goes on, but , hey if your one of the crowd you will love it.  Best part: they pay you to go to grooming academy."
good,on a neutral ground training can be good but it depends on who you get as a trainer because not all trainers or technical trainers are good. they have bad turnover ration  so a lot a people don't last very long. If you are looking for help try to ask people who have been there for awhile. You need to have a strong work ethic to work here. If you are willing to work around problems on the floor and follow safety rules you will do good at this job.
good,"a typical work day"
good,Offers part time and full time employment opportunities. Also offers advancement opportunities to those that are will to work for a it. Great career starting point.
good,"Started working as a dog bather and was sent to grooming academy via PetSmart to become a certified PetStylist. "
good,we were stuck in a little glass room sheltered from the other workers and it seems as though they were always talking about someone that worked there that was outside of the glass.
good,I enjoyed every minute of this job especially when your an animal lover. Loved my customers and I always took care of their needs for their lovely animal.
good,"Room for advancement is there, new management has zero experience in the pet industry, only care about how to make sales, and lack communication from upper management"
good,working at petsmart is fun and the employees are very nice what I liked the most about petsmart is that I could bring my pug with me to work also employees get a discount on the stuff they buy at petsmart
good,"Working here has always been nice. But sometimes the customers get to you. You need to have patience, keep the store nice and tidy do what you're supposed to do and you won't have any problems. I worked stocking/cashier"
good,I love working for  petsmart I have been working there for years .. grooming dogs is what I love to do the company overall is pretty decent ..........
good,I enjoyed working there got bored at times can be a cliquey environment amongst associates. The animals that come in are very cute and the customers are pretty cool also.
good,I typically answered phones and set scheduling up for clients. You do have to do quite a bit of up-selling in person and over the phone. I would bathe and blow dry pets according to the package purchased sometimes dogs would have specified grooming instructions. There is clipping and filing of toe nails which can be harder for some dogs than others so you got to be confident and know how to handle animals in all sizes and behaviors. There is some cleaning involved and animal waste pick up. Then you might do some light hair trims around the but and feet areas. You will have to squeeze glands periodically. It is not a pleasant smell or comfortable for the animal but it is necessary. I loved some of my return pups and seeing them often. It is fast paced when busy.
good,"This is like any retail job, they will work with you however the compensation combined with the opportunity for advancement are minimal and hardly forth it"
good,"Its been quite a few years since i worked there,  however,  when i did,  training in animal care was minimal.  We were to sell animals to anyone and everyone,  without proper knowledge.  Fish were sold to improper tanks,  hamsters constantly killed each other due to overcrowding.  This could have been attributed to the incompetence of my animals care manager,  but nothing was dobe about any issues and i wad made to feel like i didn't matter to the company."
good,Typically good because of management team. Upper leadership doesn't care for employees. The hardest part is the racks. Moving up is not as easy. The most enjoyable part are coworkers
good,It's a good job if you don't need a lot of money and you love dogs. The hours are inconsistent and the management can be poor but overall it's a decent place to work.
good,Productive Place To Work At. Could Be Slow On Some Days Workplace could be more fun. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the unpleasant customers
good,"Having gained my first work experience PetSmart, I was able to learn how to interact/assist with customers (pet parents), coworkers, and management. I have learned a lot, most of which, although unrelated to my field in the arts, granted the interpersonal skills of communication in person, through telephone, and so forth."
good,I took care of animals. Could be stressful dealing with management but the overall job was fairly straightforward. Customers are typically animals lovers and a pleasure to be around.
good,A typical work day included bathing and grooming dogs.  If you were a groomer you were not allowed to just bath a dog.  You would only bathe dogs that you were grooming. PetSmart did send me to their grooming academy where I learned the grooming techniques that PetSmart approved of.  Attending seminars on my own gave me the opportunity to improve my grooming and learn new techniques.  The hardest part of the jobe was that if I had no dogs to groom I was required to work on the sales floor and/or fill in as cashier.  Working out of a satellite store I did not get to know any of the upper management.  I only worked with store management.
good,I loved working with the customers to find their forever new furry family member. I was in charge of opening the store and making sure our animals had all their needs met before we opened our doors for customers.
good,"A typical day at work was kind of like ocean tides; it was either really quiet and calm, or chaotic. As far as retail jobs, the best part was that I learned a lot about animals and the best part was seeing the same lovely dogs every time I was scheduled to work. We even had regular customers stop by and say hello a few days at a time. However, sometimes I found myself doing a lot of duties that I was not required to do as a cashier. Nonetheless, I left because I felt like I deserved more pay."
good,"I enjoyed grooming and working with animals, as well as having a creative outlet. The job can be stressful and demanding, but also very rewarding as well."
good,"Greeted incoming guests and checked pets into the PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp. Communicated with pet owners regarding each pet's unique needs and monitored activities to ensure a safe and healthy stay. Provided daily care, including feeding, exercising, bathing, dispensing medications, as needed, and facilities maintenance."
good,"Enjoyed working with reptiles, birds and a variety of different species. Greeted clients in and out. Cleaned fishes tanks which was different something new i learned."
good,"I go in the mornings and open pet care and love what I do. However, when it comes to working the register I am beyond exhausted with nothing to do on a slow day. I love working here, but retail is not for me at this point. I am currently looking for a receptionist job. Somewhere that I can make a more personal connection with my customer base."
good,Mainly spent my times stocking shelves. Interaction with customers was focused on finding what they needed. Transitioning them into better quality of products to better their pets lives.
good,I enjoyed working at PetSmart.  I was promoted very quickly from an entry level associate to third in charge of the store in about nine months. My store management was amazing and the the team of employees I trained were incredible.
good,People would come in and get very little training for registers/policies/etc and within a week they would be gone which meant the more experienced workers were constantly covering shifts and getting called in.  There was a lot of drama in the grooming salon that filtered out onto the floor which created a negative working environment no matter how positive I tried to stay.
good,I always loved the variety of pets and people that would come into the salon and in the store. Grooming taught me patients and creativity. There was always changes in management but all seem to follow the same guide lines. The hardest part of the job was working weekends and not having a set schedule. I love the people and the variety of pets. Always a new challenge to face made my job interesting and educational.
good,A typical day would include checking customers out as well as providing helpful information about pets and their needs. Cleaning animals cages as well as feeding. Stocking and facing all consumable and non-consumable items.
good,"I liked working for this company but when I left they showed me that their employees were not their concern they had great benefits and made sure you kept to your hours,  I loved grooming pets I met new people and animals daily"
good,"Working at PetSmart in the petcare position has its perks and disadvantages. A normal day consist of making sure all animals have fod and water, scrubbing fish tanks, and helping customers make the best decision for their animals."
good,The jobs themselves are great. It is the corporate BS that you must deal with on a day to day basis. Somewhere along the line Petsmart stopped caring for their employees and pushing unnecessary sales onto clients.
good,Enjoyed the animals management was easy to work with.Was nice to learn about the different habits and temperature to keep fish and reptiles.Great family environment.
good,I was sent to groom school through Pet'sMart but that was back in the year 2000.  The structure has changed especially with management.  Their is way too much management that was over-bearing.  I started out as a bather and became a Pet Stylist through Pet'sMart
good,I love animals and enjoyed working there taking care of the different animals. My boss was very laid back. I met a lot of good clients and learned a lot about the different animals
good,Typical retail work. Not too demanding and can be a fun place to work. Management is fair and the work life balance is fine. Pay and benefits are fine as well.
good,petsmart was not the best job. It was an entry level position and I was a cashier. I worked 8 hour shifts standing at the cashiers booth greeting customers and ringing people up.
good,"It was an okay place to work. They love to call you in on your days off and give you as little hours as possible, but expect you to be ok with it. Loved working with the animals."
good,I love working with the dogs. We have day camps and then we walk dogs after camp. Pass out food maybe give baths. I've learn that there is always room for advancement if you really want it. Management is pretty good. People are friendly and that's a good thing to be around.
good,"Petsmart has pros and cons, good full time benefits for groomers, but pressured to groom many dogs with not enough time to groom them. One location forced me to groom six dogs when I only felt comfortable grooming five dogs. I left petsmart because I did not like the fact that they ordered me to do a number of dogs I didn't feel comfortable doing. I also greatly disliked the online booking system for groomers, as well as the call center booking. It gives the groomers zero control over the appointments. Petsmart needs to hire receptionists."
good,The corporate requirements on staff is ridiculous. Sales of irrelevant items is mandatory. Pressure on management to achieve unobtainable goals. Treatment and expectations of the employees is sub par at best.
good,"The management could definitely use some work. Favorites are played and that's not very ethical in my opinion. Some managers are more lenient towards certain employees when it comes to policy and procedure and harder on others , creating a grey area for rules in place by the company. The job itself is very rewarding if you love animals as you develop relationships with them and their owners. I loved spending time with the animals and there was never a time where I dreaded going to work with the animals it was just the people."
good,Fun atmosphere and nice employees. The days go by fast and the work is overall fun and easy. I would recommend this job to someone who loves animals and enjoys working with the public.
good,"I would not work at a petsmart again, not entirely because of the job itself, but it is draining working with customers, at least at my location, who were irresponsible and would constantly bring in sick or injured animals and arguing against advice."
good,"Very fulfilling work,"
good,I enjoy most days because of the fun atmosphere with mostly great employees who help each other with new tips and tricks to make things easier and safer for a better work environment.
good,"I enjoyed training pets and their parents. I learned how to do all aspects of working in retail including pricing, stocking, and more."
good,I loved working there because I love animals and always begin able to play with them everyday is fun I learned a lot working there it give you great customer service skills
good,"I have worked at Petsmart for nearly two years now, and to my knowledge, I've only gotten one pay raise, and the pay isn't great to begin with. I also can't go full time or get benefits unless I become a manager or a groomer. Scheduling is really inconsistent. A couple of weeks, my schedule will be nearly full. The next, it's three days at best."
good,"working with animals."
good,I began working as a stocker and they trained me to be a cashier. My job description kept changing and it became difficult to adjust to. They were always adjusting hours and never were consistent with maintaining suitable hours for each employee. There were some weeks where I was not scheduled at all.
good,I loved working for Petsmart! I love meeting and communicating with the customers and there pets! There was some issues with management but other than that it was a wonderful company to work for!
good,very flexible with schedule. just needs more staff to cover needs of business. very nice place to work for overall. I love it.
good,"Low paying"
good,"Taking care of pets daily was a usual until we got new management within our district and higher, They focused more on retail and stocking and my team and I couldn't focus on the pets as much as we used to. That had to be the hardest part, not being able to care for them as much as they needed."
good,Not many hours. Management not to good. Need to have store cleaned. Pet parents are great. Training not where it should be. Prices to high for the products sold.
good,"I loved my job and I have met many great people through my job at Petsmart BUT the ultimate decision to leave the company came from the ""set in their way"" managers whom were inefficient and burnt out on retail work. They are more concerned with how much money they can put in their pockets than the well being of the company and customer base. It's sad because greed will break the spirits of some amazing employees and I had seen it happen way to often with absolutely no remorse."
good,Hard/long hours for not enough pay.  Can go somewhere else and do a lot less for more pay than what they are willing to dish out.  Good luck during holiday season.
good,"Greeting pet parents and their pets with a smile. Answering questions customers have either on the phone or in person. Co-workers are lovely, however, the management team needs work. Hardest part is definitely hearing about a pet dying. Most enjoyable part of job is definitely seeing puppies and kitties."
good,"My typical day is the same every day, I'm a MOD picker. Picking different pets foods or shampoos and fragrances. PetSmart is very big on production so we must meet a production average of 95% every week. the hardest part about this job is actually production and staying committed to making my goals for the week. also the MOD is a very tight space to work along with other employees you have to remain clean and also aware of others space. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting paid every week but its not something I plan to do for the rest of my life!!!"
good,"I worked for them for over 5 years, and met some great people. I made some life long friends that were co workers and also some that were clients."
good,"if you truly care about pets, trying to care for 100+ dogs can be stressful. if you're lucky you'll have people who work there who also do. "
good,Typical day is picking up after customers making sure the store looks good. Management is ok and customers complain about cat cans lol
good,"Depends on jobs you was assigned to do,. Temp work, like warehouse, office, schools, or even field work. Sometimes it was hard cuz you had to wait for a phone call to see where you can be put for an assignment"
good,great customers very high energy. wonderful experience to always work around animals and give great customer service.
good,Cool place to work at. The location couldnt been better. It was nice to learn about different animals. Co-workers were cool. Reccomend this job to animal lovers or anybody that is interested in learning about animals.
good,"I worked for PetSmart for two years. During that time I cycled through several different managers, each worse than the last. "
good,"It' a good company the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers. Management team needs to have more training, however they are trying to set up more training for their management team."
good,The day was easy to stay busy and you were never bored. I worked in the Pet Care Area so I took care of the animals. I found it fun and stress free most of the time.
good,I was able to learn and advance my career with petsmart in a friendly work environment as well as interacting with customers on a daily basis
good,"I started as a cashier for a part time job to work my way through graduate school. This was a fine as a retail job can be, though being a cashier does get mind numbing after a while. I was asked to go through the program to become a dog trainer because they needed one and agreed that my personality was a good fit for it. I was reluctant at first because I did not want to get too involved there and then leave after school. They assured me it would not be a problem so I took it. Our store manager then quit and we lost two more managers over a period of a couple of months without replacing any. It was very stressful and the corporation would not accept any reason for why the store was struggling. It got better for a bit, but then it started getting bad again and people were quitting left and right."
good,I love working with animals and this job gave me the perfect opportunity to do so. I enjoyed the store and the team I worked with.
good,"Good starting point for a career.  Tend to customers.  Ensure everyone in the store is doing what is expected. Accomplish tasks that are required, even if it is not yours."
good,Petsmart was a fun place to work if you like taking care of animals.  It was a great job to have in college because the hours were flexible.
good,I worked at petsmart for not even a month and it was horrible. The managers were very rude to me and the employees that worked there were very stuck up. I could never get my job finished because they kept throwing me on a register.
good,"typical day at work could be loud and noisy with dogs barking, excitable kids, training classes, cleaning up accidents on the floor, customer interaction,organizing and blocking shelves, listening to workers complain, listening to satisfied customers, customer compliments and appreciating the assistance given to them by employees. listening to customer complaints. resolving customer inquiries and complaints. research customer problems, analyzing customer problems  and solving the problem in a timely manner. offering the best solutions possible to the customer. selling puppy starter kits, signing puppies and older dogs up for training classes.  accepting payments for products purchased."
good,"What I learned  from my time at pet smart was that a lot of people that i worked with came over different back rounds, but we all got a long. i learned to take my sweet and helpful side to help the customers find what they need."
good,"Typical day at work would be 6AM-2:30 Mon-Fri, early morning stocker.  Now it's ""hey you're coming in on this day and you don't get to say no.""  I have no hours and they expect you to live off two or one shift a week."
good,Typical day of work was steady-paced. I learned how to proper take care of many different species of animals. Management was great (for the most part) and always holding training sessions. Co-workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was getting over my fear of rodents. The most enjoyable part of the job was spending time with the animals and learning their different personalities.
good,I worked there for many years and loved what I did.  As most people agree the corporate environment can really drag a person down.  My coworkers were amazing and also really cared for their jobs.
good,"I liked the job functions but the managers at that time were inappropriate in their comments to some of my younger, pretty staff members."
good,The Company is always changing and that is good for the business and people but not for the employees of the company since you had no Idea how it would effect you as am employee. Always on pins and needles working for this company. Company is out for the company not it;s employees.
good,"I learned more here then I have in my previous job about the inner workings and computer programs for businesses, but the management became very inconciderate about techniques developed that would allow faster paced movement in restocking. Some management helped no matter what."
good,It is a good place to work.  They are willing to look at what you have going on in your life and work around it.  The biggest thing I have noticed is that store hours are being cut but more is expected of the associates.
good,"not so many customers, customers were nice and friendly location good excellent services provided grooming stocking was easy but filling in time requirements was a challenge some inappropriate comments by a boss slight discomfort but a good job and good people besides that and a great place for animals and animal lovers all alike a day at work is like coming in and do stocking later on in the hours helping customers who ask a lot of questions about dog food and such"
good,I worked here for a short period of time. It was overall a good company to work for. If I need another job I would consider reapplying at my new location.
good,great co workers great people just the management team is not the greatest. they are very picky and they pick and choose who they like and favoritism is terrible there
good,"Petsmart was a good place to work. I felt as though I was undermined, like I was not capable of doing some of the task they gave me. I did enjoy and loved being a bather though."
good,"Typically you'll be understaffed in most departments.I've learned a lot about animals, mostly aquatics.  Most of my co-workers are in high school and don't really care about the quality of work they preform. The hardest part of my job is seeing animals viewed more as a purchasable commodity then a living creature that deserves respect. That being the main reason I don't like working there."
good,"Built a stable customer base and strong operation standards."
good,I love meeting new people and I am an animal lover so meeting other animal lovers was very rewarding. This company treats their employees great.
good,"Loved being able to interact with all different types of dogs and even form bonds with some of them. It was hard to leave because I had such great fun working there and even though some days were slow, I always enjoyed working with the dogs."
good,i work in the hotel and i love working with the dogs. i have made connections with many people who frequent the store. management could be better.
good,"While working with animals is always wonderful, management soured my experience. Despite the lack of support from upper staff, my days were filled to the brim with sweet animals and kindly patrons of the store."
good,"Typical day at petsmart was clock in and check the schedule to see who was on the schedule for the day. Run register and straight store for closing on a typical night. When store was closed make sure the whole store straight , empty trash and if you were in the fish area you  had to take  care of feeding animals and watering them. But once store was straighten we could clock out..."
good,Work hours and schedules are hard to come by if you are a family person. Hard place to advance if you have no education or exp. But pay was comparable to the work load.
good,"It was great to learn how to groom various size animals, from a 10 pound dog/cal to a 150 pound dog.  They would always assign the hard to deal with dogs or those dogs or cats that gave issues when bathing or dremelling nails.  I never had any issues with them and enjoyed every minute"
good,"This was an amazing place to volunteer at until they switched who was in charge of cat adoptions. I then was told I had to fill out a volunteer request form and if they needed me they would call me. Being in high school, I was not able to just wait for them to call me, so I unfortunately had to stop volunteering there."
good,"- working with employees to further their growth"
good,"While going through change, PetSmart is a place any passionate pet lover would enjoy working. The campus is very pet friendly as you can bring your pets to work everyday and there is a dog park outside."
good,Typical retail environment. They were recently bought out and made private and there are changes coming down weekly that make it difficult to keep up with store focus. Associates have opportunities to grow by applying for lead positions in multiple departments. Pay is decent and flexible depending on experience
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the things that I did.  I however did not like the companies need to hold people back.  I was stuck in one position and not allowed to transfer I feel as though there was favoritism as well. When I applied for education leave I was denied and eventually had to quit my job because they would not let a trainer take leave.  I asked many months prior to my leave application to be transferred to a bather and while I was told this would happen it never did!
good,Arrive to work. Greet my co-workers and Cut on all computers. Greet first costumer and check them in with their pet by there side . Take the pet to its kennel make shore they are secured and comfortable. Clean the pet. Send them home with a smile. Clean the store before going home.
good,"Best as an entry job unless you want to end up as a manager ( better than food industry). Usually very nice management, associates, and customers."
good,"It was a lot of fun getting to see and know the animals that would come in the store with their owners. It made the work place a fun place to be in. Plenty of work to be done, and always busy."
good,"I enjoyed my job grooming animals and being around good people. I unfortunately had a terrible situation arise during my time there and was doing my best to work through it, I was doing my job very well even with my situation but that did not matter, I feel they could have been more understanding."
good,very flexible with my school schedule and easy to take time off if needed.  Get along with most of the people that work there.
good,"Usual duties are running the cash register, using an iPad/cell phone, assisting customers, and store recovery. Also keeping records of shrink/safety procedures. I have learned the bare minimum about basic pet care needs and new promotions through the company. "
good,"All my co-workers are fantastic and easy to get along with. Though some days it might get overwhelming and crazy, we make the best of it."
good,"Pretty slow from time to time if you enjoy that than you will likely enjoy working here. The customers are the best part, you get to meet others who share a passion for animals like you. Management was flexible with shifts and vacations."
good,"Pay:Great"
good,"Petsmart was fun to work for. I enjoyed working with Pet Parents and helping them find something for their pet."
good,"Typical retail job. Not willing to move to full time. Lack of training. Half decent management."
good,"I have an amazing manager in the salon, but being a retail oriented company it's impossible to get weekends off with family, and during holidays when it is most important to spend with family, that's when thy want you to work the most and you end up staying late and see your family less during holidays.  Also worked Easter every year, even when asked for it off for religious reasons, and they don't even pay holiday pay for it anymore.  Late hours too, so late dinners.  However, overall moral of my store was high and loved everyone I worked with."
good,"Petsmart has different departments to choose from. You could work in grooming, pet care, cashier, or early morning stocker. They have a lot of variety and I never got bored on the job. There is always something to do."
good,"Working for petsmart is a good time. Aside from the occasional glad from management for asking a question about a procedure, Petsmart was a good place to work."
good,"As a manager there are many challenges that you face on a day to day basis. The typical customer in your store is looking for very specific products, ones that they feel very passionately about. If they are unable to find the products they will react very emotionally. This leads to a lot of interactions that require time, empathy and a real focus on developing a relationship with them. The company does not want it's associates to be order takers - they want associates that are willing to invest the required time and energy to authentically connect with customers."
good,"Working with animals is awesome, until you're dealing with hormonal cat ladies over 10 cents or the endless amounts of pet parents that never clean up after their pets and expect you to do it."
good,"I love my job it's just dealing with respect issues I don't enjoy, not  disrespect from co workers but from costumers and the managers and higher ranking people not understanding what we have to deal with in our everyday job lives."
good,I fill orders for the pets mart stores and I have learned how to be proactive in my assignments management takes the time to understand the staff my co-works are team players and the hardest part of the job is no AC in the warehouse is the recognition of the employees
good,"Come clock in and start working on tasks in the fish department that needed to be completed like dishes or cleaning. Closing tasks included change of food and water and giving medicine to the sick animals in the back."
good,The workers are great. Everyone gets along with each other. Good place to work if you love handling animals or if you are looking to further your horizons in the animal field.
good,Long hours and demanding work for not enough pay. Started work at 4am everyday until 12pm. Boss was not very understanding about me having a new born child.
good,"If you love pets and have a strong passion for business PetSmart might be the place for you. Typical day consisted of following up on work delegated, verifying standards of the store are being upheld, delegating new work, district wide communication, customer service a must in the afternoon. Oversight of the multiple services (salon, training, hotel). Store managers typically have enough staff but if you think that you won't have to scoop some fish or bag some crickets every now and then you are mistaken. Especially during breaks. Customers are generally nice but there is definitely the customer every now and then who comes in that probably spends too much time with their pet and should maybe spend more time properly interacting will other people."
good,"my typical day was working with and cleaning the animals habitats, had to be knowledgeable about what that animal requires to strive"
good,"Nice environment to work in"
good,I enjoyed working at Pet Smart It wasn't enough hours and days. I feel that it was a great experience for me.
good,"The job is enjoyable overall for a retail job. Tons of customer service. Hours fluctuate depending on the business. Mandatory overnight shifts if needed. Tons of responsibility. Depending on which store your in, management could be great or bad. If management is great, the job is easy-going. If management is bad, they could be a bit annoying about policies and procedures and really stuck to the companies' rules and regulations."
good,Very good job to work for. Co-workers and managers are very helpful and fun to be around. The only downfall is the hours for a cashier.
good,Pet Smart DC is a place where you can accomplish things that you set out to do because they allow you to make as much money as possible as long as you're a good worker. Its tiring but at the end it'll be worth it.
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers and running the registers. I learned the best way to market a product to customers and up selling using product knowledge. The management was to say the least, lacking. Over the course of me working there I had a manager accuse me of stealing only to have to begrudgingly appoligized after finding the money in the safe room. I had a second manager, in the pet salon, who replaced the prior salon manager. the prior manager was working tword sending me to grooming school and training me  how to groom. when the new manager came in she systematically eliminated all the staff of the prior manager, including myself with staff of her choosing. for the most part my co workers were amazing. The hardest part was the physical labor as a member of the salon. I was the only male in the salon and was able to lift the larger dogs. The most enjoyable portion was the animals, by far."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of loading and packaging pallets within an allotted amount of time."
good,"the workplace was fun,i learned alot of things about animals"
good,"For a retail job, Petsmart was a fun and entertaining place to work. Great for teenagers on their first job experience."
good,The overall job as petcare associate is great but be prepared to clean a lot and you maybe asked to show up very early or stay late.
good,This was something I took on while looking for other work.  I had shown and worked with dogs for 25 years and thought it would be a great experience to learn to groom.  I quickly became the customers favorite groomer because of my attention to detail and my gentle handling of their beloved pets.  Unfortunately it was not financially rewarding so I had to move on to something else.
good,The day would usually start very early as stock work would have to be completed before the store opened to the public. The skills I acquired from this position would be employed as I would stage the store with overstock pallets to be worked with the walk-behind forklift. I would then lead my team to work the pallets by accurately stocking the product on store shelves using sku numbers. I was also responsible for receiving and processing new shipments in a similar manner.
good,It was my high school job was offered a management position after i left but didn't pay enough to leave the current job.
good,"As far as first jobs go, this was an excellent one to have. I started when it opened so i was privileged in being able to make friends with my co-workers before the store actually opened. My bosses where wonderful people who seemed to really care about their employees as well as the store."
good,"I enjoy my hands on work when I groom the dogs. I learn how to communicate with customers as well as schedule appointments! Despite what people think when you say you are a dog groomer, I do not play with the dogs but on some occasions I do get a snuggle in and sometimes play with the other criters in the store as well! the hardest part of my job just like any other customer service job is you cant please everyone no matter how hard you try."
good,"There was a big work load for the little amount of time given. I enjoyed working with the animals and helping the store gain credibility by higher ups. Management seemed all over the place and depended a lot on the associates. I had the opportunity to gain new skills and knowledge which is much appreciated. It was a fun environment and everyone was, at times, very relaxed and easy going. You are never not doing anything. Every minute of the day is busy and if you think you're done, think again."
good,"Good company, hard work but rewarding really great people working here."
good,"As a manager, my day would consist of the supervising the day to day functions of our stocking team, the pet care department, grooming salon, as well as cashiers and other managers.  "
good,"Working at Petsmart, you interact customers on a daily basis to provide great customer service."
good,"lots of customer interactions, sales driven store, decent hourly pay, fun coworkers and managers, fair management."
good,"My typical day of work would include making sure the dogs and cats are well taken care of.  These tasks include checking water, feedings, bathing, making sure their healthy.  As well as watching over them in doggy daycamp.  Being with the animals is the most enjoyable part of my job.  They make all the other issues of the day wash away.  One con is the only way as person can become a full time associate at my location, is by becoming as senior supervisor."
good,"Great place to work during school. Easy to advance, generally speaking. Pay is lacking until you find yourself in upper management. The higher the pay, the more stressful the job."
good,"busy, learned about different animals, okay, fine, tending to the animals, in sterling heights michigan"
good,the comapny was ok but the mangemant sucked it needed more gudieness there really wasnt support in the comany and mangers
good,"fast pace job,lots of work out, 4 day work friendly co.workers"
good,They need to worry more about quality instead of all quantity. I the merchandise is damaged due to rushing you can't sell it anyway.
good,"PetSmart is a fun job where you get to meet and play with animals. You gain experience for customer service and learn about products and animals from staff and from customers."
good,"I learned how to do every position in that store except for bather and groomer, I just wasn't interested."
good,"My duties consisted of the oversight of inventory, forklift driver (certified), daily operations, floor manager and customer service, as well as serving as the Presentation Manager and Pet Care Manager as needed.  Responsible for proper staging of floor and oversight of employees distributing freight.  Forklift  Trainer (certified) and trainer of employees to understand and comply with standard operating procedures. I was responsible for all inventory and handling of the product and distribution of freight.  Unloading of freight via forklift."
good,"Keeps you busy, working with animals always a plus with me, keeps whats best for the employees in mind"
good,"Petsmart is a great company to get hands on experience and to grow your knowledge of sales, professionalism, and resume. "
good,Great place if you love pets. Hard to advance. Management may not always be on your side.
good,I miss my clients. I could have done without the fishbowl type atmosphere.
good,"Was for the most part a fun place to work at.  Not without it's difficulties however, lots of heavy lifting and uncooperative dogs.  Sometimes working with the customers got to me."
good,Overall work enviornment is pleasant.  The hardest part of the  day is learning to find a compromise of customer satisfaction and policy.  The most enjoyable part of the day is helping a customer who truly wants to hear the correct advise.
good,Not enough chance for advancement. Only if you know the district manager do you get to advance. Hire people in higher positions that aren't qualified as oppose to letting people who work hard there and know the business get a chance to move up. Can be fun at times but not much money in it at all.
good,"Decent company, nothing extraordinary.  Management is great and flexible."
good,"My days at work are very busy. I run the front end, and make sure all our customers are satisfied,and are able to find the products they need. I have learned alot since I have been here, but was told there was alot of advancement opportunities within,and none have come up since Ive been here at least. you practically have to beg to be cross trained in the store,.There is a wide variety of management personalities,which is good,and also clashes in store at the same time. There are a few managers and employees that really have gone out of their way to show me as much as possible, and others that could care less if you learn, or want to advance,unfortunately. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job, is working and visiting with the animals,IM an animal lover, so its great to spend time with all sorts of them. Being on the front end, Ive also developed some great relationships with my customers/Pet Parents, and look forward to seeing them come into the store. Theres nothing better  than seeing the happy face of a dog come running up to you,tail wagging and excited to say hello. :)"
good,"The workplace was okay. I liked my job. The management wasn't applicable for the job, though. They didn't preform their duties as they should. But they tried. Everyone was respectful."
good,Great position that married enjoyment of pets with the challenge of managing in a corporate climate.
good,Typical customer service. Went to grooming school through this company. Hours are the only bad thing to job. Any where from 7am to 9pm
good,"depending on the specific job your doing, petsmart can be really easy or somewhat stressful. "
good,Support Manager - Great for first time leadership position! Pay is not great but it gives you a chance to help lead a team while helping pets.
good,"Fun job working with animals! Met new friends, got to experience new things."
good,I started out as a cashier when I was a teenager and eventually ended up in the groom shop because being the lover of animals that I am. I started with just the title of bather brusher and quickly wanted to learn more. The amazing teacher I had at the time helped me along my path and I have never looked back since.
good,I enjoyed my time there. I was able to learn and work in many areas which helped me move up quickly. The pay was ok.
good,To work there you really need to like pets. I have learned a lot about what you need to do for all different kinds of pets that I didn't know when I started.
good,"I became a single mother while working this job, and was made to work every other Sunday which were the weekends I had my kids. People were not flexible to help even though they had no reason not to trade. I was left to manage department by myself on Sundays as a brand new groomer right out of school."
good,"Petsmart is a good opportunity to explore working with animals in a retail environment.  The day starts by taking care of the animals; making sure they have clean bedding, food and water. I also make sure that we have everything prepared for the customers.  The managers can be helpful if needed and are there for the associates.  I like coming to work and talking to my coworkers about work and what they did on their day off.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers, who say they aren't satisfied or are upset because they didn't find what they needed.  How ever what I like most about my job is working with customers who come in with their new pet or even an existing customer.  Working with a new pet parent is great because I get to show them all the things that they would need for their new pet and let them know how much fun they are going to have.  As far as working with existing customers its fun to give them what I like to call ""lovin"". I give them treats and pet them and play with them will their pet parent shops."
good,"If you enjoy helping out people than this is a good place to work, always something to do."
good,petsMart is a typical retail store. They care about your pets but care more about what your spending.
good,"I learned a lot but at the end, agreements where made with the GSM and I, and she did not uphold her side."
good,"This store is one of the slowest in the district. However, that means more emphasis is placed on the individual customer or the task at hand. Less volume requires that employees be given more responsibility than in other stores as well as be cross trained in multiple departments to fill in any gaps. However, given the location it does receive higher sales per transaction to compensate for the less foot traffic. Store management is results driven and strictly adheres to policy. Associates are generally pleasant but as in most jobs there are the few that require patience. Long drive for anyone not living in the area. Commute over the bridges is trying during rush hour."
good,"My typical day at work involves, bathing and brushing dogs, nail trims and ear cleaning, along with answering the phone and making appointments. My job is very customer service focused. I love working with both dogs and people. I really enjoy the interactions with people and their pets in my job and the ability to aid them in finding or doing what is right for their dog."
good,I enjoy working with the public Manager are treated as numbers not people.
good,"working with pets and people were very fun"
good,"good company, very active in the community with charities."
good,"2 dogs almost every hour that I personally had to bath clean their ears and clip their nails. some where great others were very bad. we had to have them done in three hours or less. at night I would have to clean everything up before we left. "
good,A typical day at PetSmart is enjoyable. I've learned about animal care and I've interacted with customers. The management at the company is wonderful and my co-workers are pretty easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the animals and interacting with the customers.
good,"Managers more interested in gossiping than taking care of the animals."
good,"Fast-paced, great customer service, but wages aren't that great"
good,Playing with dogs all day! Learning different breeds and behavior.
good,Enjoyed learning about dogs and their different breeds. it was a great first job.
good,"Competitive Price shops"
good,"The management team truly cares about their associates, but the work is physically demanding."
good,I bathed dogs and helped customers with grooming questions.
good,assisting customer on what items they may have in mind. cleaning in storing new items in the store. 
good,petsmart is a diverse employer that caters to pets and pet parents. very informative and up to date on pet health issues and preventatives.
good,With everything you deal with in retail this is a genuinely good job because you get to handle different amounts of animals and gain knowledge every day with something interesting about one of the animals you see. 
good,There were several times when we waited for a manager to open the store (sometimes and hour late).  There are no standards for managers and no consequences so store morale really suffered.   
good,It was not a healthy work environment.  The management cares more about making money than caring for the animals.
good,"Petsmart was a nice place to volunteer for the time being. Cleaning after to animals, feeding them. If you love animals its definitely the place to be."
good,Was cashier and I had a great time working there I learned a lot and was able to help the customers to their satisfaction
good,"The customer service aspect of working at PetSmart is wonderful. The people, both as frequent customers and coworkers tend to have an almost familial relationship. The problem is that the store manager at my particular location doesn't leave the office (or do anything terribly useful) and there is never enough hours available to provide adequate coverage during any time of the day. You spend most of your shift running through the store, trying to help everyone. The lack of people makes it extremely difficult to get your own tasks done. Part-time employees usually have at least one other job because they don't get many hours but, anyone who is full-time and cares about the store gets burned out quickly because there's a serious lack of support from the upper levels of management.  "
good,- i baby sit animals
good,this place gives you a lot of hours but has strict policies that need to be changed
good,"a typical day at work - opening or closing procedures for a few hours, assisting customers, working stock and overstock, pacing constantly, checking on animals, catching animals, maintenance on habitats and systems."
good,the pay is not the greatest but the discount is great. the store makes a lot of money but we are still VERY under staffed. so it is up to you and a couple of others to get done way to many tasks and procedures.
good,"Get close to customers, their pets witch some times it might be a pet for some people but it might actually be more then a pet, it can be a family. Lot to learn at this company."
good,"Assisting customers with purchases, returns and exchanges of merchandise. Provided assistance to customers when needed. Responsible for daily price changes making sure shelves are fully stock with merchandise. Check for out of date and rotate merchandise when needed."
good,"taught me about good customer service, and how to commincate effectly"
good,we all worked as a team and helped anyone who needed help. they teach you how to groom a dog and work with you till they are sure you know everything you need to know. being able to work with the animals was the best part of the job.
good,Fun place to work if you like pets. Very strict work environment. Long hours for management.
good,I loved working at PetSmart until they switched the general manager. What used to be a fun and safe place to work became stressful when you suddenly couldn't trust anyone.
good,"I enjoyed working at Petsmart, it was fun and I love animals. Being able to be there working around different animals is the greatest feeling and enjoyment. Great part-time job."
good,There was alot of favoritism displayed at the farmingdale location. Mangers would go out with employees outside of work and would favorite those employees over others. Mangers would also promote those employees they would fratinize with outside of work. The interaction was best with the customers.
good,It was a fun and fast paced job. They are very friendly there and a good place to work
good,"I worked at this job for 16 months. While others were promoted and treated with respect, I was not given a fair raise or even the opportunity to apply for better positions. I was often given the most physically demanding tasks while my coworkers often sat around in the manager's office drinking coffee and enjoying donuts."
good,"This is where I began working with dogs, this was also where I as given my first opportunity as a managerial figure. Here it was my responsibility to manage shifts with 4 to 5 staff members on."
good,Working for this company is fun in so many ways. You get to meet great people who love animals as much as I do and you get to meet some of the customers pets. The people I work with are fun as well we all get along and for the most part are a big happy family. The only bad thing is our work schedules because they are done by computer and not by people so they really don't make sense. The hours and shifts are way off and a few of us are just really unhappy about it and the managers really can't do anything about it.
good,"not a bad company long as u get the right store, having the hotel in store is a plus and minus. alot of extra money comes in but a negative only because of the liability and having to deal with some unknowing over protective pet parents."
good,"Perform Empty shelf Audits, Stocking merchandise, Rtv, Receive merchandise, daily use of forklift and pallet jacks."
good,I was a cashier. I loved all the regular customers. The management was kind of lazy.
good,I was only a cashier so I did not get the management experience. Most of the managers that I had cared about their employees.
good,It's an okay company to work for but the management and leadership could definitely use some work.
good,"Walk around, front and face shelves. Help any customers with any needs"
good,"I've heard different stories from people, depending on the location they work, but personally, I love my store. The people are sweet, there's never any drama between coworkers, the customers are friendly and down to earth. It's honestly one of the first places in years I've enjoyed going to work for. I constantly see people moving up into management at my store, or transferred to others to move up, even in the grooming salon. The only thing is hours and pay. If you're full time, the pay probably isn't so bad. I'm making the higher-end of non-management pay, and that, combined with my hours, hardly cover my bills (not including gas and food)."
good,"My entire day consists of either moving merchandise from one location in the warehouse to another via powered industrial equipment, or cutting open boxes and placing them in mods for order-fill associates to pick and send to shipping. I've learned that I have no desire to work as an entry-level warehouse associate under the current circumstances. Management is not always as well informed as they should be, but they do well in relaying the information they do have and quickly resolving issues or concerns with associates. My co-workers are the best part of my day, most being friendly, very helpful and informative. The hardest part of my job is the drive to and from work and the long hours put in each day. All in all, with the drive(s), schedule, sleep, etc. I'm afforded 2-3 hours per day with my family. It has become unacceptable, especially with a 1-month old baby at home. Sadly, while life isn't about the money, the pay is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Lots of freight and no where to put it and no hours to work it all. Love working with all the live pets.
good,good job for students and thoughs looking for supplemental income. not good for those looking to establish career.
good,this is a great company to work for if you are not a temp. Please make sure the when you fill out the application that everything matches cause if you get one little thing wrong they will not hire you. everything has to match your employment history
good,"Cashiers process sales transaction, answer phones and direct questions to the proper associates. Easy job, and easygoing people. Some drama due to the age and maturity level of other associates and managers."
good,"job duties were fun, everyone was busy, management shouldnt hire so many people when employees ask for more hours"
good,I did not mind this job. There just is not enough growth I want to expand my wings.
good,getting to know the animals was fun and so were the people. i always had fun meeting new faces and learning all about how to clean and feed all the animals there.
good,It was fun because you got to play with dogs all day and got to make people very happy when their pets were taken care
good,"Worked as an Operations Manager in the daily business of petcare, and vet care."
good,"Was able to play with the reptiles, animals and birds in the store. Got to interact with customers and their pets on a daily biases. Management let you know what was expected of you and helped out in difficult situations. Most co-workers were willing to help out others and pleasent to work with."
good,Petsmart does have better guidlines for the employees and a much more structure policy as a company.
good,This job is very detailed. Every morning a mandatory stretch is preformed after the start up meeting.
good,"Work environment is Fun. Unfortunately, a lot of unhappy customers that must be tended to."
good,"For a pet shop in Longview, Tx that has only been opened for about 4 years, Petsmart is a very well maintained retail store with a limited, yet varied selection of purchasable pets. For me, picking a part-time job was just for a source of income so I could afford the gasoline to get me to school, but once I started learning the responsibilities of a petcare associate, I began to thoroughly enjoy my job. The most difficult part of the job is educating potential pet parents on the maintenance and care of pets they have never owned. The reason it's difficult is because sometimes pet parents don't realize that pets, especially reptiles, require a lot of attention and habitat equipment. However, unfortunately, since Petsmart has been going through management changes these past few months, it has become inconvenient, and wearisome to have to remind them on our schedule availabilities. On my finals' week, I had requested off for the week a month prior, yet they had forgotten, and I ended up having to work the week that I had asked off."
good,"Working at PetSmart taught me a lot about customer service and problem solving in the workplace. It's a great first job and a good place to work while in school, but there is very little room for advancement."
good,working at petsmart was a very fun experience i got to learn alot about the hygiene of my pets down to important office skills the environtment that petsmart supplies is a clean lively environment customers get to walk in with their pets and shop and everyone was always happy i cannot remember one time that i had seen a customer upset or angry.
good,"Job was just an ok job. Paid the bills. Job was fun at times, but very stressful and somewhat endless."
good,Petsmart was a fun place to work. I enjoyed taking care of the animals. My petcare manager was supportive and often listened to my input on areas that could be improved. Upper management often had to high of expectations of job performance due to other employees improperly doing the same job. I learned a lot that I did not know about the various animals sold by this store.
good,"PetSmart treats their employees well. There are a few down-sides to working there, such as during the holidays you are on ""blackout"". This means you cannot request days off, including Thanksgiving and Christmas day in some departments. If you are willing to learn every aspect of the company you are able to move up within the company, but it can be difficult."
good,"Had to take care of dogs and cats,I would feed them,get to play with them,had to walk them,enjoyed spending time with all of the pets"
good,"It was fun to work here. I loved seeing all the animals that came in. Every Saturday, a group came in to adopt out animals. It was a wonderful feeling seeing those homeless animals go home with a family."
good,I enjoyed working there around the animals and most of the customers were enjoyable as well.
good,Great place to work but the hours varied and it made it tough to balance a family life
good,"Play the game, do the work, brown nose a little and be-friend the right people and you will do alright."
good,"Flexible hours and generally good management. Promotions within are pretty scarce. Wage and benefits are basic. Corporation implements very outdated information to share with customers, mostly to sell more products. Training is minimal and based on pushing half truthful information to push products. Stores with Banfield locations tend to be pretty dirty, they have a lot of dogs with communicable illnesses like Parvo go through, then don't sanitize properly. Very family friendly company, but turn over is high. As far as retail goes it's one of the better jobs I've had, but nothing I would plan on doing for a long time."
good,The best part of the job was all the different aspects of pet care and learning about the different products. You can certainly get lots of puppy/dog love.
good,"I was hired to be Pet Care but at some point without being notified by management, I was never scheduled in Pet Care ever again. Only cashier or customer service. When I asked about it to management, my assistant store leader said that I was under-qualified. I was so confused and angry. "
good,Great job but I’m ready to move up I’ve been there for 3/years great place to find your self nice place to work but I’m just looking for a new and more meaningful job
good,"Groomers have a appts scheduled  available for the day, week ,month  for each worker, You must have good customer service skills to take phone calls, answer any questions and book appts for pet parents.  Check in pets and have good listening skills to understand what they want for their pet and also be able to communicate well to explain options and expectations. Offer our services and recommend  products that could benefit their pet.  Groomers get paid commission and hourly pay,   Bathers are only hourly and mostly part time. But you have opportunities to advance to a full time groomer by taking the company paid groomer academy classes. Its a very fun experience but the only downfall is management that  play favorites or other issues that result in low productivity and results due to mismanagement."
good,"A typical day of work starts with the sanitization of habitats, ornaments, etc. Feeding and watering of animals. Medicating of animals. Scrubbing of tanks. Keeping the place clean. "
good,Employees not held to the same level.  Management stayed in the office on their personal phones on personal calls 90% of their shift.  Employees constantly no call no show and still had their jobs.  Always had to pick up others job duties because management was very hard on a few and over lenient on most.  Customers were great.
good,"First couple of weeks or so will be working in the camp rooms where you watch 1 - 15 dogs. Normally start in the small camp and if they are comfortable and you are comfortable with handling the bigger dogs then most days you are in both camp rooms for most of your shift. Overtime, you'll learn how to walk dogs from one place to another, care for cats, check ins, check outs of boarders or day cares, basic bathing duties, food preparations, and cleaning rooms. "
good,"Fun place to work, never boring but some of the employees were not very patient with me being a new hire and not understanding what to do. Other than that great place to work"
good,"Ideal for a high school student, but they hire at 18. You must work full time if you’re looking to advanced, and they don’t pay well enough to make it work without a second job."
good,My team was amazing and was having the animals around all day is always a bonus. Some other management was not open to new ideas and not as hands-on  as I would expect.
good,"Was fun working there but severely understaffed, management was very nonchalant about it. "
good,"Fast paced, hard grunt work in a pet hotel. Pay and benefits weren't that bad for retail. You do have to work on Xmas and Thanksgiving. Can be stressful."
good,Corporate  has no ideal what happens at the store level. Expectations are to the extreme.  Company has had to make extreme cuts in the last few years  due to internet companies and online ordering. That does not leave enough staff or time to complete tasks that are to be completed.  If you dont mind half ASSing your job because you dont have time then this is the job for you.
good,Safety first !! They are being on being safe and following the processes for accurate picking of product. The employees are closely knit together and make the day go by
good,Good place to work. Everyone is nice and friendly. Management trys to work with you on the work schedules. But only management gets fulltime hours and benefits unless your friends.  Wink ;) ;) Wink
good,It was a good place to work at. The pay was decent. Management wasn't all that but it was a great job to have while in school and paying minimum to no bills.
good,I would come in unload pallets from merchandise truck from there i would stock products from pallets to sales floor and i would also assist with ringing when requested to do so.
good,PetSmart is a good place but there are drama with coworkers. The hours are inconsistent. You sometimes get good hours and sometimes you don’t. This place is good if you like animals but isn’t a career. Only temporary
good,"Not really sure what else to say here, I loved this job but the management was an issue along with those I worked with. I was let go 2 days after I was injured and my bills weren't covered and actually still aren't 3 years later. Depending on your store and location I would look into the store in depth before working there."
good,"Grooming at PetSmart is just numbers. Almost everyday there I couldn’t even take my 30 minute lunch due to poor management and over booking dogs. There are days I would come home and couldn’t even walk from the car to the front door with out feeling like my feet were numb. Not to mention they allow two 15 min breaks but you couldn’t even take those either. There was never any room for moving up unless you became salon manager and even then your groomers would make more than you. After 4 years, my body and mind says I’m done."
good,The environment is pretty relaxed but they don't give you many hours and the benefits are below average compared to the costs. employees get 15% off and free nail grinding in the salon.
good,"As a bather at Petsmart I hated it. Salon manager was not fit for a leadership position and told me that her and some  of the other groomers would be mean to new employees on purpose so that they would quit. I know that the grooming environment can be stressful but a few people in there were hostile and inappropriate. "
good,For the most part I enjoyed PetSmart.  I enjoyed the opportunity to work with pets and learn more about them. Typical days could be slow or fast paced.  Like most jobs they each have their ups and downs but nothing drastic.
good,This place is always booming with customers. Even slow days feel jam packed. Just come to work and don't get involved in the drama and you'll do well.
good,"Overall it was ok. Just watch who you pal around with. If they ask you do you want overtime, make sure you're going to be there cause they will point you out."
good,"I like grooming because I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping the dogs stay healthy and watching them grow. I have customers that come to see me on a regular basis with their pups because they trust me. Whether they are tough to deal with or perfect angels, I love all my clients. The most enjoyable part of my job is to bring dogs out of the kennels to walk with their heads held high to the parents and see the owners strong loving reaction to their freshly pampered pups. However, some dogs come in who are obviously neglected. They are matted, covered in urine in a crate, and some owners even hit them in the lobby. It is hard to explain to the pet parents that what they are doing is harmful and having them walk out or ignore me only to continue neglecting their dogs. The environment is hard to deal with as most employees would rather be anywhere else. The employees always joke about quitting or going on lunch and never coming back. Most days go smoothly though, usually I have lots to do or keep myself busy by cleaning, maintaining equipment, and/or helping out in other departments."
good,"Pet stores are strange mixes"
good,Store Managers are micro managed to the fullest.  Keep given more to do each week without the hours to complete the job.  Job could be great if they would just stop micro managing
good,The overall job is great with the basic expectations however there is a knee jerk reaction to chase whatever hot button a senior leader deems as the next must comply item.
good,"PetSmart has allowed me to grow in the grooming industry by offering on-the-job training with grooming academy. However, I feel as if the company is asking too much of the salon associates making it hard for employees to be fully committed to the pets in their care. Having full-time benefits is a perk along with the ability to rise more in the company."
good,"Pet Smart is a great place to work at, you just have to have a lot of patience, especially with the pet parents. Customer Service is extremely important to your manager(s). Working here can be overwhelming especially when you may be the only one on the register and there's a whole line backing up. Otherwise, it's fun."
good,"This job is nothing more or less than the bane of retail. You deal with the same retail villains from years past. They Who Arrive Before Opening and Those That Come 5 Minutes To Go. The management doesn't know how to talk to people, often addressing you as if you are not a free person. And the work will be more demanding than the compensation is worth. But it's a job. So if you need it take it."
good,Constantly on the move and caring for the animals at petsmart is your number one priority. Customer service can sometimes be a bit demanding but with great knowledge of the pets and products we sell you will be extremely helpful to customers.
good,A competitive work environment that changed daily. The focus is on the customer and ensuring the best experience possible for each customer. Each day brought different priorities based on the needs of the business.
good,I did cashier for 3 years there and it was pretty laid back and was good schedule for a school schedule if you have one. Animals that came in were the best.
good,I enjoy working here I just don’t appreciate the fact that I only work 5 hours a day for four days a week. I’m a college student who has things to pay for I’ve been asking multiple time for more hours and they denied it and instead hired more people which led to me getting less hours.
good,"Could be great; poor management, training, and stress make it a poor choice with high turnover. For starting out it is a good place to get experience. Not a great long term job for me."
good,"You get to work with animals, if you're an animal lover is a great place to work because you get to care for them first hand, not very well paid specially for part-time employees but it is fun."
good,PetSmart is a fun place to work if you love animals. You are constantly helping out pet owners find the best products for there pets. the hardest part of the job is the rush periods and the slow times. the most enjoyable part was getting to see all the dogs and help pet owners find the best product for their pets.
good,"Petsmart was a fun part time job for me while I was in school. I loved seeing the animals everyday, there's a little bit of drama in the workplace, especially in the salon but besides that, the job is good. Seeing dogs everyday is definitely a good way to stay in a good mood."
good,"The company is great to work for in many ways. Getting to be around animals was a big plus for me. They also offer decent benefits. However, in the last few years the support from the Phoenix home office has declined. There is very poor communication from corporate to the store level and training programs have been cut. They have also cut labor down to a level that makes it nearly impossible to run the store."
good,Petsmart was a great place to work. I loved working with most of the animals. The staff was all like family. We as staff members all have become very close even to this day most of us are still close.
good,"Shampooed, groomed and cut the nails of the dogs. I also booked appointments for the guest dogs to be groomed. The Pet Salon is very busy. It was a fun place to work, the pay could be better."
good,"Worked for them for 10 years, quit because of managenent. Too many rules,  too much pressure and not enough praise or thank you for going above and beyond."
good,"i was a cashier and a pet care associate."
good,My experience working at petsmart it had its ups and downs but i enjoyed working for the company. They taught me alot to be a better person my communication skills went up. Management was on and off some days they would be strict the next day they are calm. i enjoyed the laughs which was the best part about the job.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Petsmart, but I definitely don't view it as a career place. The burocracy of corporate sometimes got extremely annoying when they put a lot of pressure and focus on things that are sometimes out of our control. The customers in the pet industry are exceptionally dense and resistant to change, but some are willing to listen to reason and truly want what is best for their pets."
good,"Since PetSmart was sold, the culture has changed from being about the pets to being about the money.  Managers are overworked yet not given the props to want to work harder.  Only part time employees are hired including managers in some stores which effects the morale and work ethic.  Low pay is a problem as well for associates"
good,"A typical day would be coming into the grooming center, putting on the smock, checking the system to see who we have coming in for the day and who is already here, checking to make sure crates are ready for impending visitors, making sure current visitors are well taken care of with water and a urine gate, checking in a new visitor, checking with customer that the services listed in the system are exactly what they want or are expecting, checking for up to date rabies vaccination records, lashing the dog and taking them to the back. Depending on the orders in the system, I would either begin bathing or begin a simple nail trimming. This continues all day while going through at least 12 dogs on your own."
good,"The work you did was fun and fulfilling."
good,"A busy location and lots of customers. The day usually starts with customers waiting outside the doors. Most customers are regulars and when you get to know them, it's a big bonus to your day when they come in. When working with the same staff regularly, the shift becomes pretty predictable and fun. overall, as a part-time job, it is very satisfactory."
good,"It was an alright place to work, I worked the weekend shift so I worked 3 days and had 4 days off. The schedule was perfect but the job itself was boring and repetative."
good,"it definitely was a lot of physical work being in the pet department. Lots of demands and we would have occasional visitors that would judge our store and they were very picky. This always caused a lot of stress among all the workers. Otherwise, it was a laid back place. I loved my team and the people I worked with."
good,"Empresa familiar boa para trabalhar, tem flexibilidade em sua politica interna."
good,"Pet Smart does not take proper care of their animals.  They are often housed in too small homes, and they are not treated well. This place is a lie, hidden behind a veil.  animals should be treated with respect; their hearts beat fierce and free."
good,This is a good company to work for if you are passionate about animals and want to make a difference. There are lots of opportunity for advancement and the ability to work on your own development.
good,Associates are friendly but being understaffed by just one person in a department cripples efficiency and morale by putting more pressure on others. The technology used to track and manage inventory is decades old and does not function well with new software updates. The amount of space given to backstock product in very limited resulting in clutter and damaged product.
good,The benefit to working for a Pet Store is most customers are generally happy given they have an animal to go home to. The job can be repetitive but there is always work to be done.
good,"It was a fun place to work, but very hard on stocking, no A/C until the store opens at 9am. It was a workout for sure. But there was little to no help, as I was the only stocker for a large scale PetSmart. (Trucks were anywhere from 11-21 pallets constantly)."
good,"The best part about this job was seeing all of the different types of dogs that were brought into the store. Some days you would spend about 8 hours standing in the same spot, as a cashier, which was annoying. However, if you were able to stay away from being a cashier, the job is fine."
good,"It wasn't bad for a part time job, it just wasn't enough for me to live.The company and environment is great. I love all the charitable donations they make."
good,"The turnover rate is a bit high and it shows. There's someone new fairly consistently. Having new people so often is very emotionally taxing, as well as taking away time to get things done when they need to be shown how to do everything. "
good,Groomers are paid on commission and PetSmart keeps hiring more so there is not enough dogs to make a livable income. There are days where you do nothing but sit and there are days where you get so overworked you want to cry. The pay is very inconsistent and poor. You are forced to bend over backwards for every customer no matter what because they hurting for customers so bad. It’s a very stressful situation to work in. You get yelled at by customers and management on a weekly basis. Not fun at all.
good,Most of the managers were good the work environment was good maybe some work on more education for care takeing of animals staff should have more knowledge by corporate
good,"Good place to work for college students. very willing to accomadate your schedule, but the pay is minimum wage and doesn't ever really improve.  But you get to spend the day with puppies so that's nice."
good,"I wouldn't make it a career, but PetSmart was an excellent place to make some money. They are willing to work around your schedule, usually, and the job is not difficult."
good,not enough support from management. corporate has unrealistic ideals for management and associates to handle for the rate of pay they get. they continue to add on more and more tasks with no additional hours or help allowed. there is a general 'money hungry' feel to the corporation now. a lot of their services can't match with new and up and coming companies because they refuse to spend money on updating things or fixing things that are not considered safety issue.
good,"As an associate, it is a great place to work. Most managers will work with you on scheduling. Depending on what shift you work, the day is super fast. The best part is taking care of the animals and helping people with their pets, to better their lives."
good,Fun place to work and management is great.  However there is never enough staff or hours given for staff so employees are expected to do the work of 3 people.  Staff is so over worked and burned out that turn over at this store is through the roof. New district leader puts so much stress on staff and management that everyone is always overwhelmed and exhausted.  Don't feel like managers get paid enough for what he puts them through I feel sorry for them.
good,"I enjoyed my time here but no matter how hard I worked, I felt that many policies from the corporate offices are outdated or ineffective. A lot of the policies regarding animal care could be improved upon. They work for now, but many stores have old and decaying filter systems, as well as broken enclosures that are difficult to access. Could be improved"
good,They refuse to hire more employees for full time so it's hard to make rent every month with the amount of hours I get. Plus we are low staffed so opening pet care can be a challenge and not everything always gets done. The managers are very nice though and working with animals is great.
good,"I learn appointment scheduling ,grooming assistant techniques ,peoples skill and most of my customer skills here. i had to up-sale products or services to try to meet the clients best interest."
good,"Each day is different, meeting new and exciting people and grooming a wide variety of dogs and cats. We all work as a team to accomplish multiple tasks."
good,Very great place that makes you feel welcome. Very competitive so a lot is expected from employees. Does not have very flexible schedules or hours. Does offer a great amount of room to move up in your career.
good,Working at petsmart is fun because of the dogs. managment on the other hand is not great. they dont seem to care about their employees. and make them feel bad for being sick and having to miss work.
good,"I was a cashier for just over a year. I loved my co-workers. it's your average cashier job. You are asked to do additional tasks, such as help with pricing, stock, etc. It was always fun giving a dog a treat at the cashier. It gave decent hours for part-time job."
good,Being a dog groomer is messy but it has it's perks. Have to be tough to be able to handle anything that comes in. Works closely with a small group of people so you have to be easy to get along with.
good,Satisfactory atmosphere and environment. Working with others interested in helping others and their pets. It is wonderful to learn about other animals.
good,"PetSmart is a fun place to work if you have a love for animals,  It;s one of the few jobs where playing with puppies and kittens and other animals is a daily occurance.  The work itself can be mind numbingly boring to downright stressful."
good,"Petsmart is a quick paced job and not for the average bear. You must have the ability to multitask, have initiative, and be thick skinned. It is NOT for those who want to just play with puppies. If you stick through the hard, its very rewarding."
good,Loved the people i worked with and the animals. But corporate was very pushy. You make your sales and its still not good enough. Used to care about employees and pets but now they just care about sales
good,It was a good job. I enjoyed working there and helping the pet parents get everything they needed. Asst.mgr and I didn't see eye to eye and I figured it was best for both of us if I left.
good,"This company does not stand still. Every 6 months they change what is most important and tells everyone to focus on something new just as you get comfortable. Every year the managers in our district would  switch to new stores to ""try and find the perfect combination"" to make the stores more successful. You can have a lot of fun with your coworkers or you can have a lot of stress, it all depends on your management team."
good,"I applied for a part time position because I already had a full time job, petsmart was supposed to be for just extra income. When I told management I could only do 20 hours max a week they were mad and didn't lighten the schedule. I did love the discount and answering customer questions. Management were all a group of friends so the bad mouthed employees that weren't in management"
good,Fast pace environment. Lots of pets everywhere. If your an animal lover than its perfect for you. They care a lot about helping pets and contribute a lot.
good,"If you love pets, don't mind working hard and being under paid this is the place for you. Most employees are genuine pet lovers. Environemt is fast paced."
good,"Great place to work. must be able to lift 50 lbs. many times per day. Not a fast pace place except during the holidays. Very early mornings, 5:00am. Nights are not too late, 8:00pm - 9:00pm."
good,"5 am start time 320pm quit time everyday, i learned how to pick at petsmarts how to drive a pallet jack and some what of a forklift, great workplace culture"
good,I have mostly enjoyed my time at PetSmart with respect to the actual job. What made the job difficult is all the expectations that corporate places on their associates without truly understanding the impact on how we are able to do our jobs.
good,"Giving some credit to the company, it was an excellent job when I started there I learned how to deal with customers and fine tune my skills without the badgering and time consuming retail up sells."
good,"The managers vary form store to store but they generally don't have empathy for associates. Also, working on major holidays are almost always mandatory whether you have a family or not."
good,Worked mostly in warehouse and customer support on the floor. managed all truck deliveries and coached employees on how to overcome any issues they may have on improving at there position including any knowledge of products petsmart carried.
good,"Honestly not a bad place to work at, especially if you love animals, my only complaint is getting paid weekly instead of bi-weekly, I guess I just prefer getting paid every other week instead of every week, plus working as a cashier can get kind of boring, slow days make a 4 hour shift feel like and all day shift. In conclusion petsmart is not a bad company to work for"
good,"if your an animel lover pet smart is a fun place to work for."
good,"The salon has a great manager, there is a sense of team with everyone working to better the petsmart brand and give excellent service. Opportunity for growth."
good,"it was very fun at the beginning, I enjoyed coming to work. In the pet care position, you care for animals and sell them as well as customer service. Over the years, there were more restrictions on timelines for your duties which were seemingly unrealistic at times. Overall it is a great job if your availability is decent and you have the right management. The pay can be better, but for a first job or a temporary job, maybe someone in their first years of college, it is a good job as a basic associate. Yearly events are fun and if you love animals, it is a great environment."
good,"Hickory NC petsmart was a great job. Interact with pet clients, dogs, cats, and outgoing staff. I am an inwardly religious person but it shows in how I dress and there was no room for that in the grooming salon. I was continuously subject to improper language, behavior, and insults. Manager was great but didn't take much action to correct any of those issues. Overall a good and fun job but super hectic, busy, stressful... All of the walk in nail trims were given to the inexperienced/new bathers which made the workload worse."
good,"early morning shifts"
good,"store level was fine. corporate level had very high expectations while taking away hours."
good,"it was a fun working environment, with a good opportunity for advancement. The best part of the job was being able to learn more about the animals and building bonds with them."
good,"I work as a early morning stock its a good first job but if you need to pay bills i would def not recommend (barley making $200 weekly) i have to wake up and come in either 4 or 5 am which was great at first since i would get off around 10  the job requires you to lift and stock 50 pound bags of dog food which is not that heavy but it takes a toll on your back, My managers and co workers are cool but for the pay i would say try a different  position"
good,The staff here was very kind and open. Everyone there loves to help each other out. The hotel stinks at times. You break up dog fights all day long along with cleaning up after animals. if you love dogs you'll be happy but for sure stressed out. It takes strong people to work there.
good,"too much staff and management rotation, otherwise it is fine. Learned the basics of pet care (rodents, fish, reptiles). Management is mostly nice. Nice to work with pets."
good,the associates and the animals make the job. most of the managers ive dealt with are a pain and customers there seem to be a little bit crazier than most. but its a pretty decent job over all.
good,Overall it was a job that paid never really had any problems with anymore all my managers were very nice except one but you just had to take his ego the best way you could.
good,A lot of new and fun initiatives being rolled out by the new owners. The job itself is exciting and always keeps you on your toes. Great workplace culture.
good,PetSmart Pethotel  has its ups and downs. The management team is very understanding. The consistency in hours is lacking and promotions aren't very frequent
good,"It's a good place to start off, but as you get used to the job you start to realize how unfair petsmart can be. Supervisors like to slack off and management says they will listen to you but they don't."
good,"Been 18 years since I worked for Pet Smart. I enjoyed the benefits and felt like I got decent raises. I learned a lot while working there, did several different jobs. Feel like there's a decent chance of being promoted if you work hard and are qualified."
good,Petsmart is in transition but I highly enjoyed my time there. In the last several years they have been purchased by a hedge fund (BC Partners) with several RIF's and re-organizations of departments injecting a lot of change and stress. The changes are needed to keep Petsmart competitive but change can be difficult.
good,"Nice place to work. Management could be better. Stocking hours are really nice, you're done with your shift and still have the rest of the day to enjoy."
good,This is a great job if it's your first time in the work force. Perfect for teens while they work through college. Not suitable for long term though. The company has changed a lot since they were bought out.
good,"Very customer-oriented. It's a fun job that pays fairly, but there is very little room for growth or advancement in the company. The company strives to constantly improve employee education with monthly videos."
good,PetSmart was my first ever job and I really enjoyed working there. It taught me customer service skills that I still use till this day. The store I worked at had a great management team.
good,Days are very simple at Petsmart. The customers are really nice compared to other retail companies customer base. The culture is great and you don't go home stressed out. The hardest part of the job is having to cut part-timers hours. The most enjoyable is being able to interact with the animals and help people with their needs.
good,"Petcare is fast paced and can be stressful. Things have to be done specific ways to ensure the health and safety of animals and yourself. Not everyone wants to play by the rules and not everyone is going to care as much as the next person. This is frustrating when you work very hard. "
good,As a pet care specialist you clean all the habitats of all the animals in the store. You are also trained in every section of the store in case a co worker can not make it into work.
good,This workplace was a good learning experience.  There were many opportunities to develop good relationships and learn many skills related to the sales industry.
good,"management communication is somewhat inconsistent. Longer shifts are difficult due to constant standing at register.  There is ongoing need to call a manger up to the registers for such things as opening the cash drawer so that a customer can have money to tip the groomers.  Also, any specials on merchandise are difficult to obtain once a customer is checking out and questions the price on an item or whether there are deals on that item."
good,"Although I wouldn't say PetSmart is right for everyone long term, the job offers many part-time opportunities for new entrants to the work market. The work is mostly fun, and managers get to know each associate and do their best to work your shifts around your schedule and preferences."
good,You pretty much do everything cashier cashier stocking and clean all the cages as well as customer service.  It is extremely hard to get full time of any type of benefits
good,Petsmart has a fun work environment. There is room for advancement. You meet some friends that will last you a lifetime. Not too stressful unless you are a groomer or bather.
good,"Assisting customers in finding proper toys, foods, supplements, grooming equipment for their pets."
good,I loved what I did ! Definitely a lot of fun and can get a little stressful when overbooked but the dogs make it fun and interesting.
good,Great place to work and learn some fundamentals. Have learned a lot and had freedom to control my career. Great environment where you can pause and take a puppy break (i.e. find a puppy to pet for a few minutes).
good,"I learned a lot about dogs and dog care while working at pet smart, the management was decent and enjoyable to work with prior to managers changing. it was a great experience when i first started working at pet smart, my favorite parts of the job were spending my days in camp with the dogs and being around the associates that were working there."
good,"Its a good place to start your employment on a beginner level. The Day would begin with calling clients making sure appointments were being kept, changed, etc, washing dogs can be a challenge but upon comfortably and consistency it got easier. Hardest part, was washing drying, and clipping claws. Easy part was making calls."
good,At first this job seemed great. People were willing to help me out with any problems I may have had. I liked there was a probationary period long enough to give me time to make daily expected quota. Then the company moved to another state.
good,"My experience was 50/50. My SL was very condescending and was the reason I left the company. Also, even if you have a lot of background in the well-being of animals the customers will not listen to your advice even if it has worked for numerous others. or they just act as if you're just another dumb retail worker. Some do listen and it's a great feeling to know that there are some who care. Working with the animals is by far my favorite part of this job."
good,If you are a cashier i think the job is great. As for being a pet care associate... The animal loss at the store is baffling. You must have very thick skin to work in pet care.
good,"I never had a typical day at Pet Smart. I did everything from cleaning, pricing, scheduling, empty shelf audits, shipping, receiving. cash. Really any thing that I was able to learn I did. The upper management was good. My co-workers were younger but always willing to learn. The hardest part of my job was trying to always stay on top of  rotating products. Always enjoyed seeing the customers with their pets."
good,Coworkers all get aking and treat eachother very well. The DM works well with the district and HR takes everything you report very seriously. Not much for movement. Raises and pay are not very good.
good,"Petsmart taught me a lot about animals and it is a great beginner job for someone who's going to college, especially someone interested in animal studies. Expect to encounter customers who are gracious and also difficult. Some managers can be difficult too but overall an enjoyable job with flexible hours and advancement opportunities."
good,"Typically my day began by going to the manager on shift to ask where they needed me. Could be anything from stocking shelves to running the cash register, or just walking around answering questions. I learned a lot about pet care and pet owner needs, as well as how to operate as a team. The hardest part of the job is simply getting restless stuck on the register for 4+ hours at a time. The best part is seeing all the dogs and developing relationships with regular customers and their pets."
good,"I really enjoyed working at petsmart, I am just looking for something more long term and pays more. I am a college student and would like to start focusing on jobs that will help me in my future career. I learned a lot about how to take care of animals. i loved my coworkers. I really enjoyed getting to meet all the different types of animals that came in."
good,"As a retail company goes, PetSmart is a better one to work for and certainly is better for work/ life balance than others."
good,"vast changes over the past year. very limited growth potential, Districts every changing alignments of stores. Great staff in stores, knowledgeable associates."
good,Trying to change too quickly with wrong management structure at the store level and too many tenured associates and leaders that are not on board with the changes.
good,"At work, I learn a lot from my team. The associates and other managers make to workplace fun and exciting. However, the new store leader has been creating problems with myself, other staff members and customers. Her coarse attitude and harsh way of speaking prove as a hindrance to a harmonious work and shopping environment."
good,PetSmart is a great company to work for. I love my job however direct supervisor can make it tough at times. Customers are typically fun and happy to be shopping for their fur-kids. It is hard to keep passionate associates due to limited full-time opportunities.
good,A good job if you want to make decent money with little to no previous work experience. Not much room for advancement however.
good,Fun place to work. Very fast pace envirmoment. management just needs to get things in order and it will be a great place. Every day it was something different. I loved this about the company.
good,"The overall environment was good, past-paced, never without something to do and a lot of opportunities to get ahead. However, the management allowed certain employees to slack and behave completely inappropriately because they hired friends. There was a lot of drama too. A decent place as a whole."
good,"This job was a great experience for me when it comes to understanding different people and helped me become more sociable in the work area. Throughout time,management wasn't the same when I started. But overall I enjoyed my time with this company."
good,When I first started working at Petsmart . I was told to chat with the customers as much as possible. If I got backed up on the front end not to worry call for back-up. The training was better. The only thing that we pushed on sales was a coupon booklet for puppy's. However things have drastically changed since then. The rules keep changing. It seems that the program on the register keeps adding new things. There never seems to be enough hours in the day to get things done. There is even an Urban Legend going around the store. If your running around the store in circles from department to department eventually you'll run into yourself again. You're first self will wave at you're second self and maybe even point and laugh.( that is my creative way of saying they are a very busy store) If you apply my advise is to try and get into the salon.
good,"Petsmart is a fun first job. I worked there for 4 years. However, working in the Hotel can be very stressful. Dog fights do happen. Dogs get sick or refuse to go to the bathroom. We had some really great clients and I loved the people I worked with. Upper management was a joke though. The store manager was rude and the district manager wasn't any better. As with any corporation, there were frustrating flaws (e.g. throwing away perfectly good food and slicing up beds that had minor flaws to be thrown away instead of donating)."
good,"My job is to make sure the day runs smooth. I am in charge of making sure that we as a team stay on track because we have a schedule to maintain. I also have to work with difficult costumers at times, making sure that they leave happy. Problem solving s a big part of my job. I make decisions based on my best judgment and have to think fast on certain situations. My co-workers are a huge part of my job. I make sure that we are always working as a team. The hardest part of my job is that it can be hard not to please every pet owner during their pet's stay with us. The most enjoyable is when we can accommodate them and we can help people when they need a place where their pet can stay where they don't have to worry about them. When they sincerely thank us for our help is the most enjoyable."
good,"Overall good place to work that actually works to satisfy both associates and management, though not ideal for individuals interested in quick advancement/"
good,"I learned how to care of animals, how much to feed and water them, how to clean their habitats. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the animals did not get away because some of them were hard to catch."
good,A typical day at PetSmart usually is pretty busy and through that my customer service skills have gotten so strong. Management is good they try and work with you the best they can. my co-workers are all very helpful and nice people. The hardest part of my day would have to be dealing with the more aggressive dogs while grooming them. The best part is to see the customer smile and is happy to see what a great job I've done.
good,"A typical day as a Petcare Specialist involves consistent moving. Also, you are required to multitask."
good,Petsmart has become the Walmart of the pet industry. The company wants highly trained people that love their job and want to help the customers but they only want to pay $8 a hour and everybody has to be part-time. They are so poorly staffed the managers have to run the register and do the stocking and even then its a struggle to get everything done each day. This companies expectations are way too high for the workers. Luckily you get to play with animals or I'm pretty sure nobody would stay for any length of time. It definitely take a certain type of crazy to stick it out here.
good,The only complaint i honestly have with petsmart is their desire to not hire full time employees. no human can survive on 20 hours a week.
good,I love my job for the simple fact that I love animals. I have some great customers that ask for me each visit. While this is great there are some major downfalls to working for Petsmart. It has recently been bought over by another company. There have been some major changes that have been brought on resulting in poor results. Nobody is happy anymore. The pay sucks. The managers do not manage. It is a chaotic mess.
good,The most enjoyable part of the jobs was being able to see and enjoy the customers pets. The hardest part of this job was not having a significant amount of  people available for every shift. The co-workers were always very enjoyable to be around.
good,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart.  I learned a lot about how to care for the needs of multiple animals."
good,"Store is much more relaxed environment, the PetsHotel is high stress, high turn over rate, but less customer interaction and more puppy love."
good,"I started working there when I was young and single. Fast forward a few years: I'm not anymore and it's challenging to make it work because of the hours. I was a department manager so the store manager (who would not work weekends or nights) would typically schedule me for closing shifts and weekends (which makes taking care of children and spending time with family a rare thing). The overnights for setting up new merchandise plans also pose a challenge if you have kids because you'll be working until 2am or later. Hopefully you have an understanding and patient spouse."
good,Don't know why they put were hiring for stocker when we have enough already. It use to be a fun place to work at until they sold the company. It's a ok job to start at but not enough hours to get.
good,"There was no typical day at PetSmart.  Everyday came with different challenges and different daily task.  When opening I was responsible for getting the store open for that days business which included stocking and recovery, receiving trucks, opening the registers, reviewing the daily and weekly reports to be able to address any issues.  Overall setting the standards for the days business and controlling the outcome.  When closing I was responsible for shutting down the store.  This included having an afternoon meeting with the associates, reviewing paperwork, and making sure the customers were being assisted in everyway possible, promoting store programs, and closing the registers.  The main responsibility of being an operational manager was to run the day to day business of the company.  Being in control of inventory and cash flow, Receiving, personal, safety, schedules and policies and procedures.  I really enjoyed the close nit family type of environment that PetSmart had and the people I worked with. After becoming a privately owned company I was required to work longer days, and giving up my days off.  And bonuses being cut."
good,"PetSmart is a fun environment to work in. The company offers lots of perks to its employees. It isn't the greatest creative environment if you are looking for a job in a creative field, however."
good,"The job it's self is good, the upper management team is not so good. Lot's of non communication with the management team."
good,"PetSmart is a good first job, but it isn't one that you can keep very often. Management is not organized the way it used to be, and people are hired but aren't trained sufficiently anymore causing the Hotel to be chaotic."
good,"While it was wonderful to make a difference (sometimes small, sometimes substantial. Rescue dogs were my favorite) in the lives of pets and their owners, working as a dog groomer for a corporation is extremely stressful and physically taxing/damaging. Company policy and quotas are set by people who know nothing (or don't care) how things actually occur in a salon. Groomers are pushed to do as many dogs as possible, sometimes even more than what is safe or proper as far as quality goes. It usually comes down to what kind of manager you have. Petsmart does put pet safety first and they take care of any injuries that might occur, but they don't seem to realize that burning out groomers and bathers can put the pets at risk too."
good,"A typical day in customer service comes with it's own set of challenges. It's fun to help people find what they need even if they don't know exactly what they're in the market for. I learned a lot about the importance of maintaining accurate counts on money, checks, coupons etc. I learned how to accommodate various individuals as their needs arose. Management was always nearby to assist with tasks that required higher clearance. My co-workers were always typically in high spirits. The hardest part of the job was learning that ""the customer is always right"" even if you know that to be false. The most enjoyable part of the job for me personally was that I got to work with a lot of different animals in the process."
good,"my managers were great, I succeeded and advanced. They gave me almost all the tools to do this, you occasionally had other employees that didnt try as hard but there isn't anything you can do about that. Overall, a great experience."
good,"Good company.  Great benefits and lots of room to grow.  I got  a lot of encouragement from management and learned how to better complete paperwork and stay on target.  Spent most of my time training, meeting and greeting and customer service to potential clients.  I loved working with the clients but found the fronting and facing of the store in the evenings tedious."
good,"Filled orders for demanding stores, I learned how Pet Smart operates. Management was motivating and my co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part was working at such a fast pace. The best part was being acknowledged for your  good work."
good,"A day with a dog is a great day, everyday is a great day to groom! Dogs bring so much joy into my life, and even more joy when I see their parent happy with the service they have received from me! This is what makes being a groomer enjoyable, and its a everyday basis. I  learned to communicate more efficiently and dissect a parents comments and body language and tone of voice to give them what they want, even if they are unsure.  Pets have given me more patience then I thought I could ever have, and the ability to forgive then they stir up a bit.  The hardest part of my job is that I cant groom more then I already do, due to time limits on my work day. Management in the store is efficient, but management outside of the store fail to see the flaws of regulations they have laid down for their employees."
good,"Working as a pet care associate you have daily duties to accomplish. Medicating animals, watering and feeding them, and informing new pet parents of basic animal care taking skills to ensure their new pet has a happy home. I learned about different animals care taking and illness they can get, also how to treat them when they become sick and what kind of medications to prescribe to them when they fall ill. The hardest part of my job is watching an animal get sick and not recover. What I love most about my job is seeing pet parents share the same love for animals as I do, and getting to really connect with them."
good,"This company is a great company. If you love pets you will love petsmart. Retail is hard because of the hours. Especially if you work in the hotel. As a manager you are on call 24/7. "
good,"The day at work all revolved around the management. Management when I was hired in was better than when I had left, store management was great Salon Manager was a nightmare. She no longer works at that location."
good,"-My typical starts with checking up on all the animals (health, medication, food, water, etc.). Through out the day I check on every customer and help them with their animal care while also keeping up the maintenance with the fish (water balance, feeding, clean tanks, changing filters) in between customers. At the end of the night I face the department. There is never a dull moment at work. "
good,"fast paced"
good,"Good benefits, forget getting the schedule or time off you ask for though. I hope management has changed since then"
good,It was a lot of fun working with animals on a day-to-day basis.
good,I worked for PetSmart for 3 years. They trained me to become a dog groomer and then screwed me over in the end.
good,"Little lenience towards lateness and/ or illness"
good,I enjoyed working in the pet salon.  My father is a vet so I absolutely love working and being around animals.  I did not mind working with the co-workers at the Petsmart Salon but more importantly I loved to see the smile on the pet parents faces after their pet was bathed and groomed.
good,Good place to work if you like pets this is the place to work as an associate you will have to unload truck 2 times a week you better be in good shape
good,"A typical day at petsmart would be to stand in doggy camp all day until 5pm then get the dogs walked and food prepared but for the most part the overall job was a great experience i learned alot about dogs and their interaction with other dogs and humans, the hardest part about that job was not getting bit by a dog bigger than myself but overall i loved being around the dogs"
good,Typically I would check in a dog and have the customer communicate with me what they want I would also educate the pet parent on the type of hair their animal had as well as the products we had to maintain the coat and the hair cut. I learned a lot about dogs and dog breeds as well as how to be patient and maintain control over a scared animal
good,"I usually perform multiple tasks each day. I know how to perform wave clerk duties, train new associates and pick in many different sections of the warehouse. So basically, I just go where they need me the most. I enjoy performing multiple tasks, it keeps me busy and time seems to go by faster. "
good,"a day at work can be busy or not its very customer driven, I've learned to deal with managing my own time and organizing my time and work to balance each other out, I have learned the importance of patients and not judging a book by its cover, hardest part of my job is change, the thing I enjoy most are the smiling faces"
good,"There are three main aspects about working as a PetSmart associate, greeting and helping costumers in any way possible, working the till, and keeping shelves stocked.While working there I learned storage and organizational techniques, how to face, how to safely operate a forklift, how to operate the cash register, as well as a great deal to do with pet supplies, especially food. In terms of management, the first half of the time I worked here they ran the store like a well-oiled machine whereas the second half they were confused and disorganized. The people I worked with were almost always fun and friendly, many having pets themselves.The hardest part of the job was moving large amount of food and cat litter onto the shelves before the store opened. The thing I enjoyed the most about working here was meeting people and the pets they brought into the store."
good,a typical day at work was busy and stressful as you had several dogs to care for at once with constant walk ins. I learned a lot about animals and customer service. overall I enjoyed the job and getting to work with new people and animals everyday. my coworkers where more like a family to me then coworkers. the hardest part would be not knowing how dogs where going to react to things such as nail trim and having the possibility of being bitten. it was fun to see and meet dozens of new animals everyday.
good,I stocked and maintained the store night shift it wasn't too bad just had to be quick the stocking was to be finished before the store was open.
good,"Overall pretty good place to work. Worked there for almost 2 1/2 years, and i have to say i miss the family atmosphere. Plus i love animals so i miss getting to work with them on a daily basis."
good,"The hardest part of this job was working with some of the customers. There was a wide spectrum of them - nice, sweet people who loved their pets, people who clearly neglect their pets, and people who understand animals more than people who will be outright hostile. I left because the humid environment inside the salon was adversely affecting my health."
good,"Most rewarding part of the job was educating customers on products and services. Enjoyed very much working with the pet adoption groups, very rewarding seeing a pet find there everlasting home."
good,"I loved most aspects of the job, however if you do not buddy up with the management team and the employees they tell you that you have poor communication skills. Since when does gossip classify as a work related communication skill"
good,"Good company with many links to the community. Hardest part with many retail careers is working many hours. learned alot about retail and care for animals, as well as growing as a leader."
good,"I started at the PetSmart DC with intentions of staying quite a while. Unfortunately, I was presented with an opportunity that I couldn't pass up early on in my tenure with the company. The people were great. Conditions were a little rough as they had some racking that fell apart right before I came on-board."
good,"A typical work day at PetSmart is full of customer interaction and hard work. Stress filled and tiresome, But rewarding with the knowledge learned and animals helped."
good,nice people to work with...really seem to embrace a philosophy of caring about pets
good,"A typical day at petsmart as a retail sales associate is that you help pet parents with their needs, you try to figure out exactly what they are in the store looking for, guide them to the correct location, and make sure that the product they are looking for are on the shelves or stock room. Once you help the parent find the correct item(s), you check them out at the cash register. At petsmart, you have to have a customer first mindset and be driven to help all customers in accomplishing their goal. The culture at the petsmart I work at is laid back, but we try to accomplish every goal that we set out. The hardest part of working at petsmart is just trying to stay busy during the times where the store was not busy and getting enough hours to satisfy you, but the most enjoyable part of the job is relationships that you build with co-workers and customers."
good,"It was fun when I started working there but when I started needing days off, it became difficult and the store manager was not happy with me and eventually gave me an ultimatum for something out of my control. Good place to work but need a change of managment."
good,PetSmart offered a consistent work schedule with hard working colleagues. All in all a great place to work but could be better with time off requests during public holidays.
good,"I enjoy PetSmart because it allows me to work closely with animals. However, typical work days are either very busy with little time to get anything done, or impossibly long with nothing to complete. There is no happy medium which leads to many unfulfilling work days."
good,Management in my section was amazing and gravitating. Corporate however will go over managers heads and often lets scammers get away with scamming. Causing the bottom line to be hurt.
good,"Really fun place to work, however constant changes from corporate can become overwhelming. Good benefits if full time. Will be a physically demanding job."
good,"PetSmart has a really bad name and that makes it incredibly hard to work with. people will assume you abuse dogs. "
good,"Petsmart used to be a great company to work for, they have mad a switch to make you a salesperson and shove products down customers throats. Was with the company for 10+ years"
good,"a nice environment to help people with their pets and their problems. dealing with  crazy pet parents is a challenge."
good,"My overall experience was wonderful. Loved my coworkers and learned a lot about my future preferred field. Unfortunately, life was in the way and I had to leave due to management not being able to work with my issues."
good,"Too much information to learn and too many responsibilities for minimum wage pay. Petcare and cashiers have the hardest job positions, stocker position is the easiest but only if you are not lazy."
good,"The store I worked at is a fun place to work, however, I could never rely on the scheduling manager to give consistent hours so I could pay my rent and get groceries etc."
good,"Cooperate salon, has its pros and cons like every other retail places . It really depends on the store you work at and the management team............"
good,My only complaint is lack of advancement opportunities from within the company. Plus the fact that outside of work managers are not allowed to be social with associates. In a small town like Hutchinson people are close. But corporate says you can’t have friendships with management which is very ignorant.
good,The job gets harder to do as time goes on because hours are dwindling leaving managers and associates to do far more work that is possible to do. The company desires more customer engagement but still requires very task heavy daily responsibilities but they will not allow for more hours.
good,"I really had some great times working as a hotel associate. If you love dogs, they make it worth coming in every day. The problem I had that made me eventually quit was poor communication with certain coworkers. Sometimes they would flat out ignore me on the walkie. My manager was great but sometimes too lenient with their employees. I got tired of the stress that came with working with certain people so my time there was not long."
good,"Because it’s a big corporation there are book and manuals all over to tell you what to do, how to do it and on what days. It’s a very structured work place, but every day will be different. You have to find a way to help and greet customers whenever you see them and get all of the daily tasks done. I was first trained how to work the register for about two hours , then had to man the register by my self for the remaining two hours of my shift. The next shift I came in for I met the other pet care staff working that day before they left and was briefly given an overview of how the shift would go and then was expected to close for the night untrained in petcare. Luckily I had the manuals to tell me what to do in some aituations but others were harder and fell outside of what the manual said to do. When I came in for my next shift I was told all I had done wrong by the pet care manager which sucked but I explained I had no real training and she understood."
good,"The work is physical and you move around and are on your feet a lot. Coworkers are great and it is a very relaxed place to work, but there is a lot of work to do especially if you do stocking so don't expect it to be completely easy. Hours are not a for sure thing one week you can work a lot the next very little."
good,"Petsmart is a wonderful company to begin a career with. They sent me to their own grooming school where I was trained with a variety of different breeds and gained a very strong comprehension of the career as well as supplied me with all the tools I needed to begin my career. I also gained a number of other skills from this job including the ability to ""up sale"" add on packages, operate an online booking system, learn to manage my time well so I could get pets in and out in an timely manner, as well as a great deal of patients in handling difficult pets and clients. It is a very fast paced work environment with a great deal of advancement opportunity. However the pay is very low compared to what you can make as a groomer, but it's a great place to begin to get a very strong knowledge of the career."
good,".Management not bad but could be better. Faster respond time to workers and customers. More staff for shifts so things flow more smoothly. Often times its just one cashier and one petcare, which can hold up people and often causes lines especially when closing. "
good,Each store is very different however if you are hard working you can go far fast. Management is always growing their team to prepare them for the next step in their carriers.
good,"The store I worked at was in a great place full of great people so there was always business, and everything was new (the store was less than a year old) so everything was beautiful and shiny and worked great, which I can't say for every grooming salon I've worked at. The customers were nice to us but the staff wasn't always nice to each other...there was always some sort of drama going on, on any given day someone was upset with someone else. But everything remained mostly civil, it wasn't a bad work environment and the dogs in this area are very well-behaved, which makes it easier to groom them. We also had a Banfield Animal Hospital two doors down and a Doggie Day Camp/Hotel right next to us, so dogs could be groomed at leisure during their stay or get nice and tired by playing right before they get groomed to help them stay calm."
good,"Perfect for animal lovers.  The customers are great because they love pets of all variety, just like the staff.  The company is actively involved in the humane treatment of all animals.  Petsmart works with local communities/animal shelters to care for and place pets in forever homes.  Regular training in best practices for pet welfare."
good,Mucha enseñanza y desarrollo laboral dentro de un compañerismo bueno..
good,"I learned many and great skills while working here. From the animals out on the floor, to the dogs on my table. Petsmart really set the stage for me in my career. The hardest part of the job was management and select co-workers. It's hard to be in the grooming salon with a bunch of others without butting heads."
good,"Some days were better than others, but this is typical of work in customer service settings. Not a good place to work long term, but in the short term it is fine."
good,I loved working at persmart we were like onr big happy family and we all got along hours were not consistent to live off of but i stuck it out for 10.5 years.
good,"The workers at PetSmart are very friendly and are always doing their jobs.  I feel that they are very knowledgeable in their own areas of expertise; Banfield, Hotel, Petcare, Grooming, Cashiers.   I feel that management in some departments are less willing to help, but quickly try to find fault, or not willing to really help the employee ( which is part of Managements job)"
good,"overall think there were a good time and bad time .they help me with being prompted.i became a manager in them .i was on the safety team, did orientation for a new hire."
good,Until the restructuring of the company it was a great experience. Enjoyed getting to know the customers and their pets. Liked all the managers and associates.
good,Fun place at times with great co-workers. Got a great education regarding the care of animals I had never had as pets before (but which I now own). Customers were usually very appreciative of my assistance. Had many return customers and still shop there today. Would return if asked.
good,"Working here at the PetSmart Pet's Hotel has been a wonderful experience. These last 3 years have bee filled with incredible moments with our clientele and their pets, as well as my fellow co workers who have helped me maintain not one, but three different stores."
good,If you are a pet owner or love animals this is the place to be.  Even if you don not have a pet of your own it can be very enjoyable and rewarding.  Many areas to learn and grow within the store.  Working with the customers and their animals was very rewarding.
good,It has become a company that really does not care for its employees as much as it used to but the work is amazing. Getting to work with people who are creative and inspired with putting out amazing dog grooms is great. The hardest part of the job is not having a management system that supports you and is a leader opposed to and enforcer.
good,"I loved this job, and I loved the people I worked with.... but after having a medical issue that had to be dealt with I had issues with management and that made it a challenge to continue to work there."
good,"I enjoy working at petsmart because I'm always learning something. Learning new things is exciting to me, but the management is very poor. Managers can be lazy, and they play favoritism to certain associates and I think it's unfair."
good,Its a fun place to work and the best part of the day is when friend pups roll through. The compensation is good for high school/ college students but no where near enough for someone out.
good,"A typical day includes working with dogs, starting with a bath, doing their nails, ears, and brushing them out. Also, it includes making appointments for people on a computer. I liked my management, but some people are holding on too long and need to retire. What is driving me away is coworkers that are trying to stir up drama with everyone because she thinks she is higher than everyone else."
good,"This job is a typical retail job, working as a petcare associate, you must learn extensive knowledge of all pets and products. The management often contradicts themselves and expects far too much from associates while not doing much, themselves, or lying about new work policies to make their own lives easier. The scheduling is frustrating due to the fact that there are constant errors and the hours are unpredictable; one week you may get 30 and another you may get 15. It definitely doesn't provide a stable or steady weekly pay rate and doesn't take into account your requested amount of hours per week. Budget cuts and new work policies do not fall hand in hand, leaving the associates to scramble to find a proper work routine, which isn't made any easier by the fact that everyday is a skeleton crew. You must expect the worst each day because of all this PLUS the fact that the customers are absolutely atrocious."
good,Concern for safety high due to liability. Careless about staff quality of work in favor of numbers. Considered income more valuable than working conditions. Management talks around you rather than listens.
good,Working in the salon is very high paced and stressful. Corporate expects you to do so much than just grooming dogs. I really enjoyed working in ma and pa shops but they don't have any benifits.
good,"Company is always changing policies which in some ways is beneficial and necessary, however, a lot to keep up with. The job is much more physically demanding than let on. I think each location so the job might be different with someone else. I think a big part of how the job will suite you is also who is managing."
good,"In grooming you are able to build a career for yourself by retaining a clientele, but between management and corp constantly adding on more demands to the work load, it's physically and mentally draining. If you can deal with it the benefits are great."
good,"The store was always short staffed, and between working trucks, setting plan o grams and doing pricing and planner very frequently the store fell behind. The workload expected each month would be easy to maintain with just an extra employee or two to help, but corporate was always cutting hours so we were never able to hire anyone new."
good,"Good place to work, but could use some improvement. Need a better system of making sure product is ordered on time and employees get paid correctly and on time."
good,"answer phone calls"
good,It can be fun but you are constantly trying to do a million things at once while helping customers. I went from work 20 hours a week to now if I'm lucky I get 8-12. Petsmart is flexible with hours but best as a 2nd job or a starting job when you have no bills to pay. No real room for growth and breaks are often skipped due to lack of coverage unless you have to take a lunch.
good,"At PetSmart, you are always learning something new. This continues cultivating you and makes your job position still interesting and exciting. I was promoted to different job titles which was rewarding and I'm very appreciative of my management team for acknowledging my work ethic and granting me the opportunities."
good,Enjoyed working with the pets as well as the customers. Rewarding being able to watch pets get adopted. Good environment to be in and decent benefits.
good,The best part of this job is that you get to work with animals. It is a very productive and quick paced job. Time management skills are very important. I have learned a lot from this job in both the behavioral and technical sense.
good,"Working in the PetSmart salon can be very fun and exciting. It is also so much more than just playing with dogs all day though. This is high stress, but rewarding work."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the first year and a half, but then the job just started getting boring and repetitive. I requested many times to be trained in other areas in the store so i wouldn't get so bored, and also to possibly gain more hours. Management said they would train me but never did."
good,Working with Pets can be very rewarding. You are responsible for the lives and health of pets. Selling skills are a must as training and salon have separate sales goals aside from retail segment of the business.
good,"3 years ago PetSmart was a wonderful place to work. Management wanted associates' opinions and was very easy to work for and laid back. Since then the place has done a 180 as far as changing management, policies, rules and discipline. Everything about the job became more difficult physically and emotionally. Most of the good qualities of the job either came with consequences or were removed. Supervisors went from experienced and collaborative to inexperienced and don't ask questions."
good,"As a cashier,. It was non stop.  Hard to get breaks because there was no one to cover you half the time.   GREAT  people  to work with and for.  Training was very minimal."
good,"The employees and coworkers are amazing people for the most part. Management can have an issue with undervaluing employees, and the corporate system is not enjoyable to work with as they seem to put money and customers over employee happiness."
good,"Petsmart Distribution provided me with great training, good benefits, great hours I really enjoyed this job. Management was good but i do not agree with the policy on firing people for getting into disagreements at the workplace and the investigation protocl."
good,"The greatest feeling was working in a pet store, and seeing happy pet parents with their dogs and cats, and being able to interact with them. I was given a variety of projects to work on daily, which greatly involved multi-tasking, time management and workflow management. I was occasionally given the opportunity to train and grow new associates in my department. The most challenging aspect of a typical day was being understaffed, and having to function  single-handedly; however, my ability to multi-task and micromanage was integral to completing my tasks."
good,Fast paced and sometimes stressful mentally and physically. Helps if you make friends with the people you work with. You help them they help you in the long run.
good,"The salon is a click and you aren't welcome unless you go over the top for them, and even then you are still not an equal. The dog bather is like the 'bus boy' to the grooming salon. You are expected to set up everything for them and even if you help them when they are backed up they'll get on your case for something else. It's also corporate run so when you answer the phone the district manager will pretend to be a customer so they can get you in trouble for whatever you forgot to mention."
good,"Ive been with Petsmart for a little over a year now. I started as an associate lead and got promoted to Pet Hotel Manager. Like any workplace you will have people that you love working with and others that, well, get under your skin. If you love pets this is a great job. I mean, I get paid to be around dogs all day. Advancement opportunities are available as long as you put in the work. The biggest downside to this company is that they make you feel unappreciated. It doesnt matter how hard you work or how much you have changed things to help grow the business. If corporate doesnt see a huge jump in revenue they attack you. Its never, we see all that youve done for the company and we appreciate your efforts. its always a negative stance with them. that makes it a hard company to appreciate working for."
good,not the best job. Hotel manager is really nice but upper management and corporate are terrible. I learned a lot about dog behavior and customer service. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude pet parents and dealing with the death of pets that come to the hotel. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know people's pets and taking care of them.
good,My favorite part was caring for the animals and giving our customers information and tricks on how to take care of their pets. I really enjoyed working there but I didn't see a long term career and the opportunities for advancement and hours were slim. The staff was great to work for also!
good,"Love my coworkers and managers, the work environment is fun, helping customers is satisfying. However corporate's limit on hours and having schedules with no available overlap causes a lot of strain in various departments, we are often stretched entirely too thin across the store as a whole and it impacts our ability to help all customers and complete all assigned tasks."
good,"As a bather I love the work I do but not the corporation who runs it. The higher ups care more about profit than quality and safety of pets and employees. They expect you to churn out up to 8 dogs a day regardless of size and age for the most part and drop everything to take care of walk ins. On top of answering phones and checking dogs in and out and helping customers. Which results in rarely getting lunch breaks and leaving late which between the low blood sugar, dehydration  (due to how hot and humid it is) and complete exhaustion potentially risking safety to the animals and staff. Salon managers have to go along with whatever expectation corporate deems possible despite knowing the reality."
good,Petsmart is a great place to work if you do not mind doing a different thing every day. It is best to be cross trained in all departments and not give away too many of your shifts to maximize potential hours.
good,"As a cashier, a typical day of work consists of standing at the register and cashing customers out. We greet the customers as they walk in. If we're not busy, we are to make sure everything is faced forward and neat."
good,Salon was very busy at times and could be crowded. Had 8 groomers 2 bathers and many dogs. With good management and co-workers it is a great place to work.
good,"fun work environment getting to work with animals every day, customer engagement, and knowing how to interact with people and pets alike, training classes offered"
good,It can be a fun place to work at times. They are pretty good at working around your scheduale. Problem I have is that management now seems to be now more into making money then interest in the pets.
good,"Waking up early to stock shelves, I learned to stock shelves, face product, forklift trained, cashiering, customer assistance, work well with my peers."
good,Lack of DM support and poor assistance with HR led to stressful environment 10-12 hour work days 6-7 days a week with time off being interrupted with constant phone calls...extremely poor work life balance.
good,"The work culture in a grooming salon all depends on the people within. If you start having people who don't like one another, it becomes very petty. One bad egg can ruin everything. "
good,wasn't a fan of working here! they did alot of things wrong! they had a girl that hit a dog. went to the big guy and they didn't do anything about it!
good,Management was good and tried hard to keep workers happy but at the end of the day theres better ways to pick product and the job as an orderfiller sucks...you cant make rate because half of the stuff you pick falls over. They have to come up with a better way to keep stuff from falling over. If you get this job try your best to get anything but the order fill position.
good,"I get to work with an immediate team that is great and productive. I deal with customers, dogs, coworkers, paperwork, and cleaning. I've learned how to give the best customer service, managing skills, organization skills, dealing with coworkers during good and bad periods, how to care for living things, dog nutrition, dog training, dog bathing, and more. The company could focus more on their employees and teaching managers better people skills."
good,"My day at work was very fast paced. I had to do a certain amount of dogs, while answering phone calls and helping any customer that came in the door. I learned so much. The most amazing part of my job was to see all the different breeds that would come in. The worst part about this job was management. The managers were absolutely terrible but overall grooming is my passionate and im pretty good at it."
good,"Decent Job"
good,"The last store I worked for was a very hard place to be. Management made it miserable for their associates, but I wouldn't trade what I learned for anything. I was able to advance in my grooming career and move on to a better environment."
good,"I worked in the salon as a dog bather at PetSmart and maybe that's why I didn't really enjoy my job. It was more stressful than someone would originally think. It was a very fast-paced environment back in the salon, so if you enjoy that, then I would recommend this job for you. However, I did not get any hours. I was lucky if I would work 10 hours a week, because they were too overstaffed."
good,In my location I love my team!  My only issue with petsmart is that they expect the world from you and are only willing to pay pennies.  The amount of work they give and the time frames are impossible.  Makes you feel like you are failing at your job.  They intentionally set the bar high to make you try hard but never being able to actually achieve the initial goal.  It would be worth the stress if they would actually pay decent.
good,Just keep busy and stay positive. And you will get raises and position advancements. And will receive extra hours. The employees and management were all easy to get along with and the atmosphere was always fun and positive. All and all its a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much, especially seeing how happy the dogs felt after there grooms and knowing that the owners were satisfied with the service I provided."
good,The workflow is easy to keep up with though it can at times be a physical strain. The work environment is kind and at times playful but it never loses the sense of professionalism.
good,"A good company to work for, works around associates schedules if needed, positive environment to work in with the customers and animals."
good,"It was a good place to work until new management came around."
good,A typical day would consist of helping customers both on the sales floor and from the register and sometimes even out to their cars. As an employee there I learned more about team work and also got to see a store function as a family as well.
good,"I have worked at three locations and they were all very different. One location was okay, the store manager was good, the PetHotel manager was horrible and always had a bad attitude. Another location was awesome fun people, great management. Then there was a terrible one, the breaks were limited, they wouldn't give me time off for a family member that passed away. I was the dog trainer and I wanted to cancel my classes one day so I could go to my aunt's funeral and they said they would just let the other trainer teach them. I had worked at Petsmart for over 3 years at this point and had transferred here and was supposed to be replacing the trainer that they wanted to have cover my class. This trainer never left though and they never let me feel welcome. They were demeaning and wouldn't let me schedule my classes like I had previously done. Just a really horrid experience. That said, the two other ones I worked for were good. One was excellent and I loved going to work, so it really is dependent upon staff.The location listed is the best one I worked for."
good,"I enjoy working at PetSmart, I just don't like the fact that we've switched over to a sales-based company... and one of the managers is AGGY. Other than that, it's great!"
good,"Not much to say about this job. It's your basic retail position. Talking with customers and interacting with their pets is pretty much highlight of the job."
good,Upper management had a noticeable disconnect from associates and even lower management personnel This took a large toll on the job culture.
good,If you get stuck in Doggie Day Camp your day goes by so slow and you dwell for time to go quicker. However cashiering was an absolute blast and being able to interact with people.
good,"When I first started it was a great company. Management team.Ok insurance, great bonus structure. But after awhile things went down hill. There was no longer a management team so much as a group of managers pitted against each other. Compared to most retail job the customers are top tier. You rarely get that one person that ruins your day, but even when you do sometime down the line you'll get a costumer that brings in the cutest puppy/dog/cat/pig/hamster and your day will get better. I had the early morning shifts. In at 3am to do trucks. Lots of heavy lifting and walking. My pedometer averaged between 15k and 20k steps per day. We had to call HR a few times for things that went against P&P. Once corporate talked to management who lied their way out of anything we got written up.   When the company was sold things just got even worse. My position was terminated and I was let go."
good,Typically we would pick/pack orders going to other stores and warehouses.  Management was very nice in the beginning but they've had a big turn around in not only management but all positions.  Work is very driven on numbers.
good,"Working in the salon was a very hands on, on your toes type of job. You had to manage multiple appointments from check-in to check-out, learn how to properly handle pets of all sizes and stress levels, learn how to efficiently complete services, and how to manage digital and online appointments. "
good,"PetSmart is the perfect job for someone that is young or in a crunch.  The management however is the best team of managers I have ever came across! They are so realistic, understanding and truly care about their employees."
good,"From the moment I log on in the morning, it is back to back phone calls assisting customers with Support, making Salon and Hotel reservations."
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on department, but in the Pet Care department the brunt of the work is reserved for morning shifts Monday-Thursday especially so. Mornings are reserved for cleaning habitats and feeding animals while evenings are for feeding animals and to reorganize the shelves after a day of shoppers."
good,"There is no typical day at work, we have several customers who come in needing help with their new pets, we get to meet new pet parents and pets every day. It is a great feeling to help customers get what they need for their new pet"
good,A typical day is quite busy with a lot of traffic. As a pet care associate I am always talking to new and future pet owners about various animals and proper care. The hardest art of the job is when I get swamped with customers when we are short-staffed. The most enjoyable part it dealing with animals which is what I love most.
good,I really enjoy my coworkers and management is fair and supportive. It's flexible with my school schedule. I enjoy coming to work and having fun.
good,mornings everyonwould meet go over the day goal then do streches then pu head set and begin ordefillin was all slef work so didnt interact with outher co-workers thehardest part of thejob was just working 3 12s in a row iloved the job so it was all enjoyable
good,"Management is great!"
good,"The people really make a difference in this job. It's pretty much the best of the best when it comes to retail, because you do not typically get a lot of mean customers. You have to know what you're talking about when it comes to food and pet supplies. Management is OK, could be a lot better when it comes to respect to employees. The company is great though, I will always support them. The only complaint I have is that it has taken 3 months to receive a mileage check."
good,"Working at Petsmart is a great way to gain retail experience for those fresh out of high school or working while in college. I've gained a new family over the years there. My coworkers are amazing and store management is fair. Customers are passionate about their animals and are incredibly sweet if you have the right attitude."
good,"My job is an excellent retail job.  Everyone has things that they dislike about their job, however at Petsmart none of those issues are attributed to Petsmart.  I wish that compensation was more merit and duration based, but the benefit programs offered by Petsmart are next to none.  Petsmart HR really takes care of its employees.  There are a few issues that are felt to originate at the middle corporate level were the district manager doesn't have the luxury to spend more time in the stores.  His/her exposure of store performance is based almost exclusively on numbers.  As I said before, this is an excellent retail job.  It has all of the typical ups and downs of a retail experience with the added plus that the associates are allowed to love animals as much as the customers."
good,I enjoyed this job because I love animals. I was excited to learn new things everyday.
good,Its a great second job but they don't have any advance opportunities even tho they say they do.
good,"Typical day is getting there at 6 am before open at 9 am to prepare pet cages for cleaning and assuring that everything is stocked. Helping out customers if needed whether that be on cash register, or helping take things to their vehicles. Typical retail job."
good,A lot of potential. Some negative. You get out what you put in.
good,great place but the mangement needs to get it together on one accord
good,"Typically, as support manager, I had to take care of signing off on the pet salon, making sure every employee was working efficiently, answering phones, dealing with Banfield, the vets, making sure everyone was taking their breaks at the correct time, doing adoptions, paperwork, etc."
good,"Worked in the salon. It's a grubby job, and only one you can enjoy if you really love dogs. Petsmart provides its own grooming academy training fully paid for, all you have to pay for is your own grooming equipment, and the job pays quite well if you can handle a decent work load. Good people, good atmosphere. Most difficult part might be the customers sometimes, might be a difficult to handle dog."
good,"When I came to this salon, it was in a shambles. Numerous groomers were relocating or leaving for maternity leave, with no plans to replace any of them other than with myself and one other one that was transferred to us. In the 11 months I was there, I saw 3 store mangers, which caused for a constantly changing work environment due to differing managerial styles. Luckily, the groomers that remained were eager to learn proper grooming techniques and expanding their grooming knowledge beyond what was learned at Grooming Academy. It was a tough salon to manage, due to corporate constantly wanting us to make ""plan,"" despite it being based on the performance of 7 groomers from the year before, while we were now down to 4 groomers. This caused a somewhat stressful environment. However, we did often manage to have a good time, despite the pressure and changes around us. Due to the remaining groomers' willingness to learn, the quality of grooming was drastically improved once I left."
good,Friendly people and animals. Also you get to help a cusomer out with their best friends needs.
good,A typical day at work will consist of me ringing up customers on the cash registers and going around providing assistance to anyone that needs it.  I learned how to go up and approach people and assist them.  My management is good.  They are easy going with a good sense of humor.  My co-workers are great and we all get along very well.  The hardest part of the job is meeting any sales quotas that they may instill upon us.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and learning about their shopping habits.
good,washing and grooming dogs. cleaning dogs hair clipping nails. management was great and helpful. worked alone with the dogs mostly. hard part getting dog to be calm must love dogs.
good,This was an interesting place to work. The people were nice and I learned a lot about bringing customers time and again.
good,"Good company. I have a great store manager, but the associates are young and can be very annoying to work with. It really does help to love animals. Be prepared to constantly be in contact with customers!"
good,very professional yet fun atmoshpere. i enjoyed the friendships i made with customers and employees.
good,"It is difficult to describe a typical work day because the store didn't follow a set schedule; the work schedule changed every week and the hours of work were very unpredictable. If you were scheduled to work in the mornings, you would come in to work at 6 am and change the bedding of certain animals, feed them, and check on them. If there were sick or injured animals, you were responsible to take them a manager so they could accept to have them go to the vet. If you closed, you were responsible for closing the Pet Care department and make sure all of the animals had food and water for the night. As a Pet Care Specialist, you also had to help customers and assist them with their needs. You needed to have basic knowledge of small pets, reptiles, fish, birds, cats and dogs. I learned about animals through this job and I also learned about customer service."
good,"It was a safe clean work place,co-workers were helpful.I learned various shortcuts to make the job faster.The most enjoyable part was checking the various products to be packed. The hardest part of the job was to many hours at fast of pace."
good,For the most part it was a very fun work environment with certain management but could be an extremely bad vibe environment with others. My opinion and point of views were accepted by most and respected by most. Great starter job for animal lovers.
good,"Company has ways to move up the corporate ladder and rewards hard working employees. They do require a lot out of each employee, but hard work does not go unnoticed."
good,"Honestly, I do like my job, but I'm tired of it. I have been there for 15 years and want to try something new. I love learning new things as well and improve on this skills I have"
good,"I really liked working at pet care here. I felt like everyone really cared about creating the best environment for the in store animals and really tried to ensure that they were going to good home to the best of our ability. I liked my managers and coworkers, though I don't believe most of them are still there."
good,"positive workspace with lots of in-depth training. Kind and caring people. Corporate America, big-box store structure, but with so much heart and soul. A fantastic first job experience."
good,"Not a bad job to work while in school, but the pay was low for the expectations. If you get good hours it can be worth it, but as a Pet Care Associate you are responsible for all the animals and it can be very stressful."
good,Must have sales experience. Requires ability to stand for long periods of time. I do not feel the staff for pet care was adequately trained and animals were not properly taken care of.
good,As long as you get a store with good management to back you and do there part it's a great place to work. It emotionally got difficult working with the pets for me though.
good,"Managers at my location were amazing, the job was easy enough, and seeing animals everyday was a plus. The pay isn’t that great, but for a short term, part time job it’s alright."
good,Depending on the store manager could be great can be bad.  You need to always be on the sales floor and available to customers.  Holidays are time and a half.
good,"Because I was working with small animals, reptiles, birds, and fish, I had many rules to abide by. Which for me was absolutely no problem because I love following directions. There was so much to do and sometimes it would get very stressful when it came to medicating the animals and cleaning the bird cages. I personally did not like the manager because he was very sarcastic, the kind where you never know if he is actually angry at you for something or if he is just joking. I would observe him treating a few customers and employees very unprofessionally. What I mean by this is he was very prone to putting other people down in a joking manner. I watched him do this to a CUSTOMER. I was astounded he was even a manager. The manager that was there before him was an amazing manager and would have had no problem staying if he hadn't been relocated."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the salon when I first started. It's great to be able to learn a trade skill while being paid for it and it's a big plus to be able to work with animals all day even when they misbehave, which is often. The store manager's poor management style slowly weeded out all the best employees to the point where there are only a handful of us left doing the work of a fully staffed team, creating an incredibly stressful work environment. We lose employees and immediately we are pushed to take on more appointments while we are still struggling with what we already have. Each store has an entirely different work culture, so if you are looking to work here make sure you ask an employee what it's like to work there, not a manager. Not every store is this bad, but some of them are worse."
good,"Loved working there until I realized how much higher management abuse their power. Scheduling is done by ASL, which they completely can abuse to be in their favor with no supervision."
good,"Over all its a good job to work at if you dont have responsibilities already ,but for a young adult unless there giving enough hours for pay its not a good choice"
good,I love this job. It keeps me busy and I like that. I love helping customers in general. I’m well at multitasking and making sure the job gets completed. I also make sure the store is opening ready.
good,"great place to work for job experience. You can move up quickly if you work hard, but all departments have their challenges. Do not expect an easy job."
good,"Working at one of the largest locations it can definitly get stressful. Some managers are definitly a lot more helpful and proactive about helping while others are not. If you do your job well and get along with staff and management likes you will definitly be considered to move up, otherwise you wont. They are extremey flexible with working and school schedules"
good,"This company will put  you through school to learn a valuable trade in exchange for a 2-year work contract, Generally everyone works well together save for the typical spats you get with a whole bunch of catty females all contained in a stressful small environment. Great benefits, but they are more interested in how much money you make them instead of the well-being and comfort of customers/animals."
good,"Not being given enough resources to take care of our animals. Especially the sick. "
good,"A typical day working at Petsmart was to come in at 3:00AM, immediately begin receiving merchandise truck and begin restocking shelves until about 8:00AM. At this time if most of the receiving and stocking was complete my manager would place me at a cash register to work in the capacity of a cashier. Management was very hands off but stressed and pushed safety standards and a safe working environment while stocking, and friendly customer service at the cash register. Lifting and moving heavy weight around consistently for several hours without a break was the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job as i love to be challenged in any capacity."
good,Only worked here for a small period of time. Cleaning fish tanks and stocked items on the shelves. Was a good job to have when I was also working in the same building at the veterinary hospital.
good,"lots of drama at the store, but generally had a good time working and felt supported by my manager. they did a good job of training me and had fun working with the dogs and building relationships with the customers and their pets."
good,Work would start earlier because of my position. So usually around 6am. Managers had to be there to open for us and show us which shipment to work and what not to work.
good,"I learned a great deal about what pressures can do to management and how their steam blows off onto the employees. With a great experience in dealing with live animals and customer care, there wasn't much to complain about other than the attitude of the managers and the pressures of up-selling to customers whose feedback is nothing but complaints of workers doing just that."
good,The customers and the team members were great with fairly good managers very poor structure and inability to really take control of any situation on your own lack of competitive pay and very stagnant movement as far as growth and opportunity to move up.
good,"Enjoyed my position here very much.  The store manager was great as was the regional.  The district manager was quite difficult to get along with as he was a bit shady."
good,"I started on as a stocker for PetSmart, and now in order to give me more hours my managers have trained me for cashiering and are scheduling for more shifts.  PetSmart is an important store to work at but it is not too fast-paced since customers do not need to come in frequently to attend to their pets' needs."
good,I loved the clients and employees and management. The thing that was hard to deal with was being controlled by corporate. To high of standards without them having the knowledge of what it is like to work in the environment that we worked in.
good,Petsmart is a great place to work for pet lovers. There are a lot of activities in the store that allow pet parents to come and socialize. Working at Petsmart has given me greater knowledge of the best pet products for our customers.
good,"Petsmart is a fast pace place to work, downside maybe be company interests over employees."
good,"You have to restock dog and cat foods. Also, make sure the dog and cat clothes and non-food sections are neat and presentable. If you work in pet care you have to make sure all the animals have clean water and food. Also that the fish tanks are cleaned daily."
good,"Great place to work, fun workplace with many different animals you to enjoy. The management  is awesome at this place. if in new braunfes I recommend the Petsmart on walnut."
good,"Fun place to work, good work life balance. Customers are very nice. The pet make a feeling of ownerships. Teamwork, rigor, and accountability help with overall values."
good,The experience here was great I loved working with all the animals and meeting all the clients and helping customers with their animal but the store has slowly changed to just pushing sales no matter what.
good,"PetSmart can be a very nice place to work. You're surrounded by animals and people who like animals (for the most part), so people tend to be in a good mood. However, since the change in ownership a year or two back the company has gotten worse and harder to work for."
good,"Either it's a slow day or you're busy running around. The management were amazing, good, hard-working people. The usual drama between young workers. You always had a relaxing break. The hardest part was working with the animals since you can only do so much for them during your shift. Unfortunately, rude and ignorant customers take up most of your time. It was difficult being passionate about animals and having to give in to the company's need to make money off of the animals. However, the GOOD customers make it worth it. And again, the management were incredible."
good,"I've learned how to answer the phone, make appointments, and patience. Hardest part of my job is having a difficult dog and completing all my work safely. Most enjoyable part is the environment."
good,"If you like animals, best place to work.  Chance to try all positions in store. Friendly co-workers. Most managers were helpful and friendly. Holidays were fun."
good,Petsmart is a fun place to work and almost everyone is passionate about the pets. There is a bit of drama in the culture with management not being professional and staff not being totally professional.
good,"People there are understanding but also take it very serious too. its all about knowing what you come to work to do, do it and clock out. They don't mind if you take small breaks in between time as long as you make sure your work is complete for that day."
good,"PetSmart is probably the best company I've worked for thus far. Yeah, they aren't perfect. What company is? But within the almost 2 years I've been here, I've gotten two raises, have advanced in my field and have gotten perks such as; gifts/raffle winnings, free lunches, employee of the month perks and countless discounts. Management that took over once my hiring manager relocated, is less than professional. However, I don't think Petsmart should pay for his mistakes. Overall, I'd tell someone young, looking for a part time job (with possibilities) to fill out an app!"
good,"A typical day at PetSmart was stocking merchandise, checking prices for customers, retrieving carts from parking lot, and ringing up purchases. I learned accountabilty here, and patience in dealing with the public. Management was decent here, except when the store got busy. Because management got flustered really easily. And then co-workers and myself pretty much had to rely on ourselves to get the job done. The hardest part would be irate customers who just could not be pleased with anything you did. But on the flip side, pleasant customers made this job very enjoyable."
good,"Wonderful managers, but corporate treats us like numbers, and no matter how hard you work, its never enough. Lots of turn over due to lack of work/life balance and fostering of talent. TERRIBLE PAY RATES"
good,PetSmart is an aggressive company and will continue to have success in the future due to their business strategies. PetSmart could be a little frustrating to work for because they are slow to adapt new technology that could greatly improve efficiency
good,"In the end, its just another retail job. You're a cog in a wheel. Management could care less who the cogs are, just that they have cogs in place to keep the wheel moving."
good,"Working in the Petshotel can be very rewarding! You get to play with dogs in doggie day camp, see a lot of the same dogs every week, and talk with pet parents. Unfortunately the location I work at tends be lax on safety and our manager does a poor job scheduling us."
good,"If you have a love for animals, this is a great place to get a good hands on experience with pets. A typical day at work maybe a little hectic with all the responsibilities one may hold but is it all worth it in the end."
good,A decent store with quality workers. Short hours daily but an efficient business. Petsmart was a great environment as far as great customers and co workers.
good,"The management was such a mixed bag, you never knew if they were going to be appropriate or not. The pay was minimal until I cross trained into the grooming aspect. The grooming was a 50% commission unless you were a manager which was 60% of course I haven't worked there in a number of years and who knows how it has changed but I'll never go back due to a lot of unprofessional supervisors. Don't get me wrong though, there were a lot of really funny people that worked there but being funny on the job and shirking responsibilities just shouldn't go hand in hand."
good,for me luckily I had extremely good bosses they would help you and make sure that you know what your doing they have are very friendly people you get to play with animals if you are into that.
good,"Good people and place to work. Great work advancement ,wonderful atmosphere. Loved the animals and pet parents and coworkers. Wonderful place to work."
good,Great place to work. Associates and pet parent made coming to work very enjoyable. Building lifelong relationships with the pet parents.
good,The job is good. You learn great skills you can take with you forever. You will most likely always be busy and get great experience. Some of the downfalls are working for a corporate company and not being able to make your own schedule.
good,"Day's start by checking dogs in making sure they are healthy and, making sure we know what needs to be done with them. The hardest part of the job would probably be making sure the dogs are not endangering themselves or others around them. The best part is would be when the pet parent picks the dog up they are so happy and thankful, makes you feel like you did a good job."
good,"Friendly coworkers' and just a great atmosphere. Always someone around willing to help you when in need. Hardest part about the job is staying on the supervisor's and/or person over the supervisors' good side. To many screw-ups will result in termination. For example, not making rate continuously or just not getting the hang of operating your PIT (Powered Industrial Truck). Even something as minuscule as bumping into something, again not full on crash but bumping into something (an exp. guardrail which is made specifically for that, debris that has been dropped and left on the work floor or racking where you retrieve merchandise) is cause for termination.You must be extremely careful at all times, as you should. They will look at you as a ticking time bomb that hasn't detonated yet if it happens more than once. So definitely not a category you want to fall into. I learned that your at work not to make friends but to do your job at the best of your ability, without error and there are times where you may need to kiss a little tush. Management here was uptight and covered their own BEHINDS but were also willing to help you. Most enjoyable part of the job were the people I got the pleasure to know during breaks and lunch when working there. A typical day at work would be me showing up early, they like it when you do that, putting the daily rate you had to reach that corporate set to shame and going home. This is what you'd expect on a typical day working at the Pet Smart Distribution Center."
good,"I like their crossing training. Meaning you get trained for almost every aspect that needed in the store."
good,Working with people who are passionate about their trade is a wonderful experience. Be prepared for long hours and lots of bits of knowledge
good,"-interacting daily with customers and their pets."
good,"Work in the grooming salon fluctuates between very slow (one to two dogs in an eight hour shift) to exceedingly busy (six or seven dogs, plus phone calls and walk-in services) on any given day.  Taking a deep breath and rolling with whatever that particular day brings is a must!  Luckily my co-workers are all very supportive of each other and help however they can, even when they're busy as well.  The focus has shifted more to dollar signs (pushing add-ons and overall ticket sales as well as increased volume of dogs groomed) which is frustrating but I try to find a balance between the company's desired numbers and what customers are comfortable paying."
good,It is a great place to work if you don't have a family.  The management will not work around family at all. You are a number to them replaceable even after 2years of service.
good,"I enjoy working for the Pet Hotel it is a very fun environment and the dogs are amazing. The pay is not as much as it should be and full-time positions are not available often, and the hours tend to fluctuate but I still stand strong with the company. I am willing to do anything for any company I work for and have done just that with this company."
good,"Before the buyout the company was pretty good. Good benefits, decent hours, most managers work with you. Each department has its pros and cons. Salon is hectic but good money. downside is they over hire and results in more stress. PetsHotel is very easy but just requires a lot of attention to detail. Both to pets and facility. Store side is good as long as you have productive managers. Once things fall behind there is no getting back."
good,"lots of physical activity required, and ability to manage time and work with others. the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are making a difference in that pet's life, especially those that come in severely matted. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the nasty dogs and nasty pet parents."
good,"Petsmart overall is a pretty reasonable place to work DEPENDING on certain things."
good,Petsmart has been a great place to work for a number of years in fact I love my job. I love working with people and really enjoy the day to day interactions with the customers. The company is currently laying off corporate and regional level positions due to a down turn in business. I saw similar changes in Albertsons prior to their selling a large portion of the company and closing a vast number of stores. My Family and I are looking to relocate to the Carolina's in the near future and feel that with the company concerns that it would be a great time to not only relocate but to start a new career as well.
good,"My typical day was to wake up early, get some coffee, head into work, grab some leashes, took the dogs to go to the bathroom while also sanitizing and cleaning their rooms. I would also be called up front to bring the dogs checking in into the kennel.  Then I would go bring the dogs into the specified playrooms and supervise and interact with them.  Also had to make sure they didn't get into fights, but it did happen.  I learned how to safely break up those fights without either me or the dogs getting hurt. After playtime was done, I would clean and sanitize the playroom and then go on lunch break.  After my break I would be doing laundry and dishes and checking on the dogs who didn't go into playtime and clean their rooms if needed. I learned how to work hard and clean thoroughly and stay organized.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being with the dogs.  All of the co-workers worked together very well, but the management staff was a bunch of people (younger than me mostly) of whom eventually made the work environment emotionally painful and unbearable."
good,"Strong management team, helpful Leader ships- The only thing is its very hard to find people that are reliable that will show up no matter what and take care of the pets that would be staying with us. I worked some times 24 hours because some one not showing up to work, I got burned out. "
good,Loved working for Petsmart the past 7 years. I would recommend this company to anyone who is looking for a great fun exciting job.
good,"Like many retailers, PetSmart is founded on some great ideas and executed at store level by some great associates.  The troubles lie with inconsistent and sometimes unreasonable demands from field (upper) management.  Be prepared to respond endlessly to whatever the ""expectation of the week"" is- regardless if it flies in the face of last week's directions.  Also be prepared for vague criticisms such as  not being an ""authentic"" leader.  Store teams are great and generally love animals and working around them.  It can be very rewarding if you can manage the politics of staying on the good side of the field team leadership.  Step out of line and be prepared to be insulted and targeted."
good,"very busy, in animal care position.  too much division among departments.  entire staff needs more training."
good,"A typical day at work included checking your dogs in and out, answering the phones, scheduling appointments, cleaning the salon, bathing, drying, and grooming the dogs. I learned very good time management. The management always seemed happy to be at work, and always helped when needed. The co-workers were always very friendly, and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was busy times. The more busy it got, the crazier. There would be sixteen girls in the salon grooming and only eight tables to groom on. This made it tougher during the busier months. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I was able to build with co-workers and clients."
good,"I would meet the loading truck early in the morning. Help them unload the truck. Cut open the boxes, separate items for each section of the store. Stock items on the shelves. Worked with 5+ team members to get everything done neatly and in timely manner. "
good,I liked petsmart a great deal. when I finished grooming academy I was ready to become an experienced dog groomer and by the time my time was up there I felt I had reached my goals. 
good,"I have had my ups and downs with this job. They promise something but don't always keep it. I want to progress at PetSmart as a groomer but the managers keep pushing me around when I will go to grooming full time. I like cashiering, but it gets a little boring. Standing in one place for a long period of time, is hard sometimes. There is favoritism, jealousy problems between coworkers, and rudeness to other co workers and customers. The hardest part of the job is coming into an invironment that you have no idea what it will be like that day. The most enjoyable time is when I am in grooming and I have fun dealing with the dogs, dealing with the customer and having good conversations with the grooming co workers."
good,Great Team! However very poor management.The managers typically talk down to the employees and fight with one another (even in front of customers) Despite most of the managers the team will make you feel welcome. It is a great job for a animal lover!
good,"Greating & ringing customers out and I would ask the customer what kind of did they have & if they had a puppy tell them about Obedience classes,"
good,"This was my first job, at first it was an awesome job, but after a while when I realized that I had no where else to go in the company and I kept getting passed over for promotions, I didn't enjoy it anymore."
good,typical day at work is caring for the animals and helping customers.best part is working with the animals.
good,"A typical day at work involved daily paper work to balance commisions earmed with actual Point of sale daily. Recruiting/training new employees. Talking to customers face-to-face and over the phone constantly,and sometimes handling customer complaints."
good,"you must be able to stand for long periods of time, be very customer service orianted. There are all walks of life in an out of the store daily! very great place to work"
good,Managers are understand of how grooming can be overwhelming. Paid time off and benefits. After going to grooming academy you have to sign a contact so a secured job.
good,"The pay and benefits at petsmart were great, but the job was very demanding and high maintenance and very 'uptight.' Demands as a manager were highly stressful and it was hard to feel as if you were doing a job well done. It would have been better if more staff were working at a time and all of the duties didn't fall on one person."
good,It’s a good company for those who know how to groom fast in the short amount of time. For a part-time groomers they work with your schedule to help accommodate you if you go to school or if you have children.
good,"Worked for company over 9years, made it somone what to top. Never recived appropriate training for supervisor postion led to failing at job discription. Never given another chance"
good,I loved my job at PetSmart. My only issue was the hours. I never had a weekend day off and I was closing shift or late shift every day that I worked. I would definitely recommend this company to someone young without children. You will feel like you are married to the job. Another issue is the bonus incentives. They opened a new store within 10 minutes of our store and wondered why we weren’t making our daily sales anymore. That led to no one making any bonuses. I would say that PetSmart corporate needs to not open stores so close to one another. All you did was take away business from your own stores.
good,"Pretty decent to work for, you work together as a team."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Petsmart in Catonsville, but I felt like I was not payed enough for how hard and dedicated I was to making the pet owners happy."
good,"Difficult at first, since I had no formal training. A few things I was just thrown into and expected to learn on my own. Thankfully great staff and managers who helped teach you the tricks of the trade, when available."
good,I was a stand up reach truck driver i started off as an order selector then moved up a replenishment driver it was climate control great people but they pay people by who they like the most not by production.
good,"Even in the grooming salon, the retail environment is hectic"
good,"Some managers are great but some not so much. My day consisted of standing in front of a register all day. Preferably I would've liked to do stock more so you can actually move around and the time goes by faster. As a company its really good at treating employees decently. It all depends on whos in management that day,"
good,The job and its benefits were great. Although the environment made working there stressful and a huge impact on my mental state that caused me to not be greatful for working there like i had used to.
good,Wasn’t getting overtime because I was never crossed train. Pay never increasing started to effect my lifestyle. Worked their for a year and 6 months . . One day I decided to part ways and find better.
good,It has plenty of its ups and downs. Over the years i been then everything has been changed and from my point of view is just bad. Management got bad. Employees started leaving and they hire people with less experience but pay them more. I been there for over 2 years n still havent got my 1 year raise.
good,I liked working at PetSmart but it’s hard to build a career there. I would only recommend this as a steppingstone to gain experience but not as a place to center your life.
good,"I hated the upper management. They make so much money while us in the actual store barely make any money. Even if you are hardworking, you only get a raise when they give you your annual review. There is not really any room for growth, either. The best part of the job is interacting with pups! Hardest part of the job is not being able to advance."
good,"Its a great place to work, but sometimes to very slow paced if not a lot of dogs are booked for that day. They only Full-time employees are the Groomers in the Salon and the Mangers."
good,it is very stressful. long hard work days. you must love animals to be able to do this job. if not you wont make it. as a dog groomer this is the best place to work
good,"Overall, Petsmart grooming isn't....too bad, but I would not recommend unless a bather plans on becoming a groomer. There is the horrible habit of groomers trying to build hierarchies and expecting bather to take care of all of the menial labor, when (even in the job description) it is every one's responsibility to make sure the place is in tip top shape. It is imperative that everyone be fast learners and be able to deal with very stressful situations like back to back phone calls and customers coming in in droves, wanting any and everything or a dog screaming its head off at just the idea of you thinking about touching his foot...really it happens."
good,"Overall, I would recommend PetSmart Distribution as a place of employment to anyone. Good pay, good benefits, clean & safe working environment, advancement opportunities, etc."
good,We were having issues finding a store manager but once we found one it was basically smooth sailing from there Work was fun and people were nice. I enjoyed working there.
good,In the past two years with the company I've worked in three different departments all by choice. I'm looking for a company I can grow with and have great benefits.
good,Able to handle heavy call volume. Make appointments. answer product questions. cash register skills. follow certain policies and procedures.
good,"company has been around a long time. I've been with the company for twelve years."
good,"PetSmart Corporate Office is an environment where strategy, team, and leadership penetrate all levels and all roles within the business."
good,"I worked as a Stocker/Cashier which meant that typically as a stocker I would get to the store before it opened and stocked items the store receives 3 times a week mostly dealing with light weight items. As a cashier, ironically, I did not spend most of my time at the front cash register not to say that helping the customers isn't mine or the store's priority but to put it simply the store was over hired for the holiday season and therein lies my only problem with the store.  From what I could surmise it seemed like they did not want full time people. Petsmart is not a union company so they hire many people and give low hours across the board, possibly to lower break times, and this was not just for me as people working there for over five years were struggling to get five hours a week at the store I was working at. That being said the people there were some of the nicest people I think I will ever get to work with and I enjoyed whatever hours I got."
good,"Day to day operations were always challenging and different.  The culture that was developed was always changing.  It was always about the growth.  The hardest part of the job was finding different ways to inspire the employees.  "
good,"Working at Petsmart is a very enjoyable experience. Its extremely rewarding to create customer-employee relationships on a daily basis, along with their pets. Management is also pretty laid-back, making it easier to focus on what needs to be done rather than constantly getting yelled at. Co-workers are friendly and outgoing people, always willing to help you if needed. The hardest part of working at Petsmart I would have to say is the wage, and work load. There is typically not much to do once morning fish chores have been done, and wage is very minimal for someone trying to afford bills and daily necessities. Work load is extremely minimal, which isnt rally my cup of tea. Ive always preferred to be busy all day. Aside from that, the most enjoyable part of my job would be working around the animals, Watching them in the grooming salon, and seeing how happy customers are to bring in their pets is a great feeling. On top of that, the adoption days bring a light to the store thats hard to find anywhere else. Working with animals is truly rewarding in its own way."
good,Very energetic place to work. Enjoyable co workers. Fast pace advancement.
good,Just like with any job or business it can be good or bad depending on management or coworkers. Job can be anything depending what department or job title is.
good,I loved the animals that came into the store. Training was so rewarding. Got to know a lot of people.
good,"Can be a great and fun place to work, however there aren't many full time positions available and when you're part time, you usually don't get many hours. It's hard to make a living on the low hours and wage."
good,During the peak seasons work is very tedious.  Overall good experience.
good,Repetitive work / merchandising something different everyday / enjoyed the staff / Customers coming and asking for me / hardest part of the job - unsatisfied customer due to a co -workers mistake / what i have learned working at PetSmart hard work is never appreciated / Management changed once a year in the 12 years I worked there.
good,great team fun work easy to advance good pay you have to be a pet lover and have patience great experience
good,"PetSmart probably has to be the best place to work in retail. The clientele is nice, people are great, corporate management make smart decisions, communication is good. And where else do you get to play with puppies all day? My only issue is that certain promises were made to me that were not kept- and has resulted in a 125 mile round trip for me. Which on top of a 10hr workday is about 15 hours I'm not home; which is a poor quality of life."
good,I wouldnt change a thing about my career so far. My time with petsmart was great. I appreciate everything that company did for me. They put me through grooming school not only for free but paid me for it. My problem with them really started when the ownership changed and it started feeling like I mattered less and the quality and care mattered less than the money made.msdOther than
good,"After a week, I called the store manager about the hiring process and was willing to interview me in a couple days later. At the day of the interview, I was both excited and nervous because I feared that they won’t hired me but ended up getting hired on the spot. After training week, they put me on the schedule but had me for only 3 days. They didn’t give me another position neither work around school schedule so they ended up terminated my employment."
good,"Good company to work for with great benefits and bonuses. Was originally suppose to be a temporary job until I found my main job, ten years later I'm the assistant store leader."
good,I would like to see more professionalism in the grooming salons. All salons are different but most are too lax and social over the complete focus on the pet in their care.
good,"I was a bather at Petsmart for a few months. I enjoyed my job but I enjoy working under harsh or stressful conditions. I worked hard and pushed my limits. Sometimes the job was hard. Rushing to get dogs out quickly and still do a thorough job. Sometimes it was hard to get all the dogs ready on time plus handle walk in baths, walk in nail trims, and answer the phones. I was offered advancement relatively quickly due to good performance. I work well under pressure. I left to pursue a vet tech career instead as I felt it was more rewarding in addition to challenging."
good,Relaxed yet fast-paced environment. All employees are professional and easy to talk to.  No issues with team dynamics.  Excellent quality of work with a non-enterprise view of data.
good,"It was alright. It paid little to nothing, really busy(I was sweating half the time), and all the groomers back stabbed each other’s for more expensive pets. It’s very easy to get promoted from a dog bather to a groomer(they send you to their academy). I chose not to because I was going to school for something not in that field at all. A lot of drama goes on because you’re in a enclosed small space all day with deadlines crawling up and the salon is usually filled with women, so everyone has high emotions. On the upside you get to play with dogs and puppies all day and when you’re not stressed you’re just chilling, hanging out. It was a fun job. I only left because I found a job in the medical field."
good,I loved petsmart for the experience. it made me realize that i wanted a career with animals . That's why i went on to be a veterinary assistant. I got a lot of hands on experience with the animals.
good,"I liked working for this company but the hours were not good for me, and if you don't meet quota during the holidays you have to stay and work even though you have been there 12 plus hours. Management is ok, but if you have a family don't plan on seeing them on a regular basis because you will be working all of the time."
good,"Very fun, and positive work environment. However, management tends to be one-sided and not too competent as to where animals are concerned.h are to get time off but schedule is really flexible."
good,PetSmart is a customer based pet shop. But while they attempt to take great care of their employees it is not meant to be a career. Use it as your first job out of highschool before you move on to something else. Managers are cool but many are way to attached to the rules and the company is overly stuck up on certain aspects of policy and procedure.
good,"I went into this job thinking that I was good a salesman but without product to actually to rely on, I had to improve my skills to add on services.  Before this job, my retail sales experienced was focused on results, as long as people got the results that they wanted they didn't care how I treated them.  At PetsMart, in the boarding facility PetsHotel, I learned to establish ""my brand.""  The owners of the guests would trust my recommendations and spend quite a bit money based on that alone."
good,Good work enviroment had a chance to earn PFP every month for meeting and going above production standards and had every weekend off!
good,"One of the best things about this company was their willingness to work with changing or limited schedules. I learned a lot about caring for domesticated pets but it really depends on how educated management is. The hardest part was when management began to drastically change and some lower employees knew more than managers. I enjoyed PetSmarts commitment to ethical pet care and refusing to sell live feeder animals and instead providing a frozen option. There are many areas that could be improved within the department as far as caring for the animals and providing immediate vet care when necessary. In addition the vet connected to the building wasn't always knowledgeable in treating the animals we sold, some animals suffered as a result."
good,"Petsmart was a good fun place to work.I have ALWAYS enjoyed grooming dogs & my customers just as as they enjoyed me and has always asked me to groom their pets by request. This was during the first half of my emplomyment with petsmart.I have been with this company for almost 14 years.But sadly, Because of the managers constantly being changed out and moved to other petsmart locations, It has gone downhill since.Petsmart has not been a no longer enjoyable to work for anymore. Newcommers have made it very complicated & impossible to work here anymore.I am ready to move on to something new."
good,experienced racism every shift and felt very excluded from the team. management was great and really cared about the employees. other coworkers were very rude and not cooperative.
good,I think that Petsmart was great experience. During my time at Petsmart I learned a great deal of time management and how to work well under stressful conditions.
good,"I loved the job when I first started. Weekends and nights are always the busiest. Love seeing all the animals who come in and out. Loved petting them and giving them treats. Registers are easy to use. "
good,"I love working at PetSmart the management and associates are great, it is fun work environment being around animals. Seeing all the animals everyday is the best part."
good,PetSmart has a wonderful work culture. Everyone is positive. The down side is that the wage is barely passable as living wage. Only full-time associates are able to support themselves in this work.
good,"Within this company, you experience a friendly and welcoming work environment. Not to mention the pets! Since I've been working inside the hotel, I go to work everyday with a smile, mostly because pets are my passion."
good,It is an enjoyable place to work at expecially if you enjoy working with animals. There was always room to grow and the sky was the limit. I really enjoyed this job
good,Overall a decent company to work for. Caters more to the elderly than the youth. Good selection of products. Employees areally generally pretty knowledge about said products
good,"It is a very high volume store, I worked at the Duluth location."
good,"I was hired in as a cashier and cross trained as a stocker as well as a petshotel associate. It was a nice part time job to start off. The yearly raises I got were awful, despite being a good worker. I was there for over 6 years and got hired in at a new job for more than I made when I left Petsmart. The company went downhill once it was bought out. Eliminated positions while still expecting associates to deliver exceptional customer service on a skeleton crew. It feels like corporate and the workers in the store are divided, which is not a good thing."
good,"typical day at work would be, paperwork filling, reminder calls for future and pre-existing appointments, answering multiple calls , dealing with deadlines, cleanliness, perfection, weekly meetings, showing our dedication for our job, saling the right products to customers who are in need and some who just want to better their homes and décor, and being able to handle difficult customers without management."
good,"With any job, you have your ups and downs, but I think the only problem I had at PetSmart was poor management. I wanted to stay there and become a groomer, but felt like nothing I did was right and the manager was the main cause of it."
good,"This was my favorite job."
good,The indépendance to make daily decisions of the district operations within the region.  Worked closely with the LP Staff on putting better controls and follow up procedures to shrink and losses. Was given the opportunity to set the standards for customer service within the market.
good,"I love what I do for living. I never thought that I would ever become a Pet Stylist. What I love the most about being a Pet Stylist is the transformation of the after and before. I love to make dogs look their best and of course make their owners happy. I have learned a lot being a dog groomer, such as different ways of brushing a dogs coat to styling it. I'm a very easy going person and I work well with others. I'm willing to new challenges and as well learning new things such as new techniques from my co-workers."
good,"I worked many jobs here from professional bather, animal care, stocking/redesigning to checking out customers. They didn't have full time for me in the grooming salon so they had me working whatever help they needed out in the store to make up the full time hours."
good,I enjoyed the collaboration with my colleages.  Mentoring and developing subordinates was very rewarding.
good,The specific store I worked at was brand new at its location so it was a train wreck from the start but I have been to other better functioning stores
good,A typical retail job with little pay. Not worth wasting your time.
good,Very accommodating for part time positions for people going back to school and a lot of fun working with animals everyday. I would recommend for college students.
good,one of the worst possible coworkers one person could have. This whole store was run by the drama it created. good prices on headphones and games though as an employee
good,I liked working at PetSmart. The people were really friendly and I loved working with the animals and assisting the customers. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"The only reason I'm typing here is because it is required. "
good,"A typical day of work at petsmart consisted of a lot of cleaning. With all the dogs coming in and out of the salon, keeping the store clean was number one with customer service."
good,This job was really cool. I got to work with animals on a daily basis. Some of my managers were awesome. They made long hours go by with ease. Great Place!! (I still go shopping there).
good,"I liked this job as far as bathing the dogs, clipping their nails, cleaning their ears. It was a challenging job but i really enjoyed it."
good,wake up at 2a.m. and wont stop working for 10 hours straight. mainly moving heavy bags of food nonstop. Fantastic environment though.
good,"Was excited to work here beforehand. Though I tried my hardest as the only Early AM Stocker in the store, it got to be too much for me when I would get in 4 truckloads of items at 7AM and would have to be done by 10AM with unloading and stocking BY MYSELF. They didn't want to hire any help for me, and when I couldn't make a certain deadline for unloading and stocking, I was sent home for the day, and that would cut into my pay. Became a nightmare!"
good,Working at Petsmart was ok  need more hours that's why I left and am looking for fulltime work and good benfits and a good work  and good pay.........
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers, fixing parts of the store, doing daily tasks like taking care of animals and helping around the store. The managers do not work well with others. They are contently in bad moods from outside of work and take it out on the other employees. The managers also are not reasonable and complain when people deserves raises."
good,"Must be a very people loving person. I grew to love people through tis job. The majority of the managers were very kind however one of them I am shocked that still works there. I had complained several times to management and no action was taken, instead of saying they would work with this manager they told me they had been working with said person for years now. Anyway the rest of the environment and coworkers are very pleasant to work with. The most challenging part of the job was growing comfortable enough to approach people and not take their bad days personally. the most enjoyable was caring for the animals, each animal has a personality and it was so fun to place them into the correct families."
good,"IT's a fun place to work if you like animals. The environment is like most retail. The hours are the same, but depending on management your work/life balance and scheduling are usually horrible and not found out until the last minute."
good,Place is great place to get your foot in the door in the pet industry. Working with all sorts of animals. Being able to work around people who love animals as much as you do is always great.
good,it was a great place to work for that's where I learned all about animals and the care for them some of the management was good there were a few that were questionable I was there for awhile and people that go there after I did were getting raises and more hrs and I was getting nothing
good,Great people to work with not so great management. Best part is working with the pets hardest part is dealing with the owners.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering the phone,grooming,checking dogs in and out doing walk ins ,I learned alot working with petparents,greeting them,the salon manager was great very supportive and understanding,my co-workers were very nice really liked them of course we had hard days being alot of women in the same place everyday,the hardest part was when they mess up the appoinments people that dont know how to book,I love grooming I have done it for 15 years and working with animals specially dogs is my passion."
good,"With the right team, Petsmart is a great place to kick-start you work experience, or even begin a career path. Learning anything from Pet grooming, Pet care, Pet Training, and stocking, they do not leave you without educating you!"
good,I don't hold a management role but am given the responsibility of updating and educating my colleagues on policy changes. Any threat of corporate and the managers are giving you lists of things to complete that would take atleast 4 people to finish in the 4 hour time period given.
good,"Cared for all animals in the store, stocked shelves, cleaned after animals, provided customer service, work the cashier, scrub tanks, take pets to vet."
good,"Small staff, very little close management, a little lonely at times due to the independent nature of the job. It is enjoyable to work with the animals, but again, you are working completely alone most of the time, so it gets quiet and boring particularly during afternoons."
good,"Put both the customer or pet parents as well as the pets in jeopardy and lack of regard for the employees as well. I believe this was due to poor management, such as crowding the facility over the legal capacity making it an unsafe environment."
good,"Extremely fun place to work especially with all the animals, but they don't give enough hours to support myself and there is no such thing as a full-time employee so benefits are off the table. any full time employees you see were grandfathered in once they went to only part time hours."
good,it was ok place to work at unfair with who should be advanced people are overall nice and friendly but lack of hours and not much room to move up at all.
good,Worked this job as an additional part time job after my full time vet tech job. I can work anywhere in these stores with my back ground. Like talking to people about there animals
good,Both managers I had while working for PetSmart were awful. Extremely bossy and talked to us in a demeaning tone. Loved my coworkers and meeting all the customers but I left specifically because of the management and because I was only getting about 5 hours a WEEK
good,"I was supposed to go to Grooming Academy to become a professional groomer and I was told 5 separate times that I would go as part of salon manager training and that I would be evaluated and sent as soon as possible. Come time for my evaluations and I was then told that I was not ready to go to academy, yet no specifics were given. When asked for help refining my skills and preparing for my evaluations, promise were made and then broken. I have also experience manager retaliation for standing up for myself and my career more than once. Have your resume ready, because if you stand up for yourself in any way, management will make your life a living nightmare."
good,"it was amazing to work with all of the animals and it felt really good helping pet parents find proper solutions for their furry friends. I learnt something new everyday. My only issue was in an entire store i was the only person of colour, and it was very clear with a certain manager that she did not like me at all because of that. They also do not care if you are so sick that you are throwing up, and if you dont manipulate people into getting their emails you will get fired. They dont notice or appreciate hard workers either."
good,The people and atmosphere were excellent but the pay and hours definitely could have been better. It was a lot of hard work but was very rewarding work. Overall a decent place to work.
good,"Very stressful, lack of communication and open door policy they claim to have is nonexistent. Very educational about animals and there are some advancement opportunities."
good,"I learned how to work well as a team member, how to care for different animals, and how to provide excellent customer service to our customers. I helped to discuss with the customers the different needs of their pets and where to find products or additional resources if needed."
good,"What you would expect working at a giant chain store.  The best part was working directly with the animals/customers one on one.  Management was treated terrible by corporate, and in turn took it out on the lower level staff members."
good,I learned a vast amount about different types of animals. I also became better at speaking to people and selling products. The managers used us and were difficult to work with.
good,"A typical day included showing up extra early, setting up the salon, checking in dogs, bathing then grooming to pet parents specific expectations with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. I had the typical clean up in between each dog duties, and keeping your area always clean and sanitized; all while maintaining multitasking in busy and loud environment without jeopardizing your quality which in my opinion always comes before quantity."
good,"decent company, management depends on what store you work at, pay is at the bottom end of the retail scale.  No one starts at a high rate and raises are minimum at best"
good,"Fast pace, customer oriented, sale driven work experience with some attention to details. flexible work hours, depending on location."
good,"I have become an integral part of the management team.  "
good,"i loved doing daycare here ! its where i learned what i wanted to do !"
good,"good experience but looking for more"
good,Was a fun working environment and loved my coworkers. Not a place to work long-term. Loved that I got to interact with people and their pets. Loved the cat adoption centre.
good,"It’sa good place as a starting job, but if you’re wanting a job to advance in this is not the one. It’s definitely a learning job and great if you don’t have bad joints."
good,It was a good experience . I enjoyed my work and loved the people I worked with. I feel I am very good with my grooming skills and interaction with the dogs and pet parents.
good,When I worked there I had a positive experience with my coworkers and  the job it's self I loved my customers but the management definitely needs improvement.
good,"a very hard company to grow in and with, always hires outside of the comany and I found the lack of communication frustrating. but, an excellent starter job, good pay, respectful of time off requests and overall a fun and fullfilling job."
good,"This job is better than most retail jobs, especially if you love animals. Problem is the pay. No retail/food industry ever pays their employees enough to deal with all the self entitled and angry customers that are coming by day by day. Furthermore, I am not paid enough to try and do more than what I am suppose to do. The company, district managers and managers overall are always trying to get you to go above and beyond just so that the store looks pretty. They don’t pay you enough for the labor being input."
good,"Advancing in PetSmart felt nearly impossible. I was a bather for over a year and every time I got close to being sent to grooming school, the management would somehow fall short on submitting my enrollment papers."
good,"Provide excellent customer service. Process returns. Operate a cash register. Clean animal habitats as well as replace food and water through out the day. Replace all trash bins in the store, sweep the floor under isels, use automatic srubbber to clean the floor, sanitize bathrooms registers and faucets."
good,"when I was first hired management was terrific. they then switch that management to different locations and brought in all new management. who treat the employees horribly, abuse their position of power and have absolutely no idea what their doing overall! Extremely frustrating as an employee who formerly used to love their job."
good,"Management leaves a lot to be desired. They don't hire knowledgeable staff and it sucks for other pet care people to have to educate people that supposedly already knew everything. They prefer to promote externally rather than internally. They hired a new manager who had never worked at petsmart."
good,"Employees were really nice, customer's were friendly at times, I learned that the customer is always right, I liked my managers, The hardest part working there was the hours"
good,Mostly slow paced on weekdays. With small rushes here and there. Weekends can be a bit crazy. Basic nightly cleaning is easy and quick. Detail cleaning can take a whole shift.
good,"This was my first actual job so I had a couple issues with understanding how things worked.  Otherwise it was an interesting and fun place to work.  There was a problem with lack of training and guidance, however there were many things that were picked up with on the job training."
good,"A typical day at work starts with opening the floor, taking care of all the animals! Around 9AM the store opens and customers flow in, that's when it becomes fast pace and a bit stressful; specially on the weekends! At this job I learned how to give excellent customer service, how to properly take care of a variety of animals as well. Management is decent, but I feel like managers here pick their favorite associates- giving them less of a hard time if they mess up something. Workplace culture is big, it's difficult to describe unless you work there! "
good,"The store was very Productive, Fast paced, even though its only  part time...  they have No benefits.... The Job is very Stable.. Flexible Schedule...."
good,"Working there is fun, though at times tough. I enjoy it, but with having one of the managers right on my back on any one little mistake is stressful. At times I get extremely anxious because I really need this job and I am terrified they are looking for one little mistake to get rid of me. I love working with the animals and helping the Pet Parents."
good,"Teaching associates and customers proper ways of caring for animals including fish, small pets, reptiles and birds. Providing accurate sales promotions on a monthly basis as a team. The hardest parts of the job were being short staffed and not being able to save every pet that we had due to illness or deformity. Management  came and went, never had a stable crew so it was hard to stay on the same page with everyone. My associates were wonderful, always willing to give an extra hand when needed and always provided excellent customer service. The job was an ""always learning"" by hand on. So many different species of animals, they all had their own needs."
good,"Work days are repetitive with nothing new ever happening. You'll learn a lot about the animals that you care for there as well as solutions for maintaining the health of multiple animals. Most of management will try to overwork you and won't let you stop for even a minute. People generally don't stay for long and most of the people that do eventually stop caring. Cleaning reptile tanks is the hardest thing to do in my opinion, because you don't get enough time to do it properly and if you don't finish management will get mad at you. Only enjoyable part about it is learning and holding the animals when you get the time to."
good,"Managers are terrible,many schedule conflicts.easiest job I've ever had.get to see animals all day.the worst part of the job is finding something to do."
good,"Not good for careers, and can be hard to make enough to live off"
good,"I loved what I did, but management is very biased and if they don't like you, you will never get past bather. I worked there for 4 years and was never allowed to become a groomer while people who were hired after me, some being a bather for only two months, did."
good,"Petsmart is a fantastic company that offers many positives (to people and animals) I was unaware of until I became employed there. I was only employed part time and would have loved the job and concept of the company except for the manager of the particular store I worked in. It was a happy, fun, hardworking environment until he walked in. The feel of the place immediately became heavy and everyone tried to stay hidden. He had fantastic assistant managers who always seemed to get difficult schedules and no recognition. One lived far from the store but he would have her close late and be back early the next morning, continually while he enjoyed the best of schedules. I am a middle aged, neat, honest, hardworking person who has no problem with authority in general but myself and others were in agreement with the feeling of being overlooked while management singled out choice young favorites. Had the area manager taken a poll of the employees of that particular store I believe they would have found MOST if not all employees unhappy with the store manager. I was not employed there long unfortunately as I failed to feed his ego."
good,they didn't have hours to give they didn't pay well and the management was poor they were money hungry and didn't care much for the employees.
good,Hours were really bad and the management is a bunch of slave drivers. Co-workers and customers help to get the day by.
good,Petsmart could be such an outstanding company if they stopped fake caring . They also show a lot of favoritism towards certain employees .Management  sucks.
good,"Sometimes I enjoy my job. I love working with all the animals and learning new things about them but the people aren’t the best. I work well with customers but sometimes they don’t want to listen to what I have to say. I do my best to give them the correct advice to care for their animals but they don’t want to listen, especially if it involves spending more money."
good,"It is a great space to work, the customers and staff are awesome. However, sometimes it's alot for one person to cover the front if others are not available to help and pay is horrible."
good,"I was able to learn a lot of new things about animal care that prepared me for future jobs and medical services for animals, and the training was accurate to my job description."
good,You needed to have a passion for grooming and patience to boot for this job. I didn't get paid enough for the volume of work they expected of me and I've heard they made it worse since then.
good,Can be hard if your not competitive theres a lot of matches to see who can get the most of everything and than the manager say you won they dont give you the prize
good,"I absolutely loved my job. Handing animals and teaching people about the care for them was a fantastic experience. Unfortunately I got driven off by poor management. Some of the lower end managers were great at what they did, but the store lead often wasn't there when we needed them. There were times when we had issues that required their attention but didn't answer any calls or texts. The store lead out sometimes have frustrated outbursts as well, scaring some employees. Overall, I enjoyed the job itself, but decided the environment of the store I specifically worked out was not the best."
good,"I liked coming to work and doing the job, we got a new manager and she didn't seem to care how hard you worked. She picked favorites and made it an impossible place to work."
good,management could be done better on store managers part but sales and pet care manager where great and more then asked or excepted. pet care services where good as most employees knew a decent amount about the animals.
good,"I loved this job, although when the new store manager took over he picked favorites and started cleaning house immediately and let go of employees for no reason and wasn't the most gentlemanly man out their. favors the women."
good,"I actually enjoy my working career at Petsmart, but during my time at Petsmart a lot will depend on the competence of the managment staff. If you work with a great management team, you will move forward and up and will achieve whatever career goals you set out for. Unfortunately the down side is that management seems to be very inconsistent and seems to have a tendency to make hasty decisions that end up falling a part in the long term. They need to be more thorough and confident when it comes to choosing the right people for the right job, instead of rushing to meet a quota or goal"
good,"Management could use improvement, but I feel the company itself has core values that are worth working for. Good policies in place regarding animal safety and health. Could use improvememt on employee care and concern."
good,"I was a bather in the grooming salon and cashier on the sales floor. I loved working with the different dogs in the salon. Getting paid to bathe and play with dogs was great. That said, the store manager was an obnoxious little 20 year old who kept telling people how to do their jobs, when she didn't even know how to do her own."
good,"I really liked working here- at first. Coworkers are awesome, the customers were okay, and the first manager that hired me was very nice and team oriented. But when the managers changed everything started to change and it became a lot more disorganized. It was difficult when things would be marked as little as a dollar with no notification to the cashiers and no identifying marks to separate them from normal priced items in stock. And when trying to confirm price changed being met with rude and condescending remarks or attitudes. It was also very frustrating that the regional supervisor (as we were told) limited the number of total hours worked for one store so we were always understaffed with only two people in the store during some of our busiest hours."
good,I enjoyed working at Petsmart for quite awhile. Until the owners sold the company to someone new and everything became about numbers and money. We were no longer groomers but salesman. That is not the job I signed up for. There was also unfair treatment of employees. Some were favored over others.
good,It was a shame for me when I left. I really enjoyed my clients and most people I worked with. There was no real career advancement especially if they like you were your at.
good,"As an early morning stocker, I started work at about 0530 and got off at 1300. The work was not easy as you are required to for half of your day lift bags of dog food which can weigh up to 100lbs, so I hope you’re swol and know how to properly lift with your legs. It can be incredibly tedious and tiring. You will be engaged by customers who are either looking for something but haven’t actually tried looking or people with questions only management or a Veterinarian would know."
good,"Usually my day starts out at working by coming though the door and being over loaded with information that i never have enough time to understand or even remember, usually it mellows out towards the end of the day. The customers and families that come in are absolutely wonderful! As an employee you gain so many wonderful relationships with the customers and since I work at a micro store the customers always remember you, and sometimes they will remember your name! I would say the hardest part of my job was listening to my manager vent her anger to me. This happened A LOT! For some reason I always felt like it was my fault by the attitude and tone she was using with me."
good,Get store ready before store opens. Feed and clean small animals. Clean fish tanks and clean crickets. Stock and straighten shelves. Greet customers and help them.
good,"Sometimes unorganized rabble. Would be a fine job if everyone in grooming gets along, but that does not happen. Prepare for drama. If you love animals more than you hate gossip and petty bickering this is a good job for you. You will learn a lot about animals in grooming. No full-time unless you sign a 2-year grooming contract. If you quit before then, you have to pay back the grooming school."
good,"I love working with the animals and making new friends at my job,"
good,"This place is a great place to work if you are willing to work 8hrs a week, at times. Sometimes you have 20hrs of work and then sometimes you have little to no work. They tend to hire way to many people and only give hours to people they click with. I started out getting over time. Helped an employee out by giving her some of my hours, they started giving me less and less hours because of this. I was pregnant and they ended up changing my position, without notice, and my rate of pay was lowered. Over all I loved working there because the environment was fast paced and ever changing. I learned a lot while working there and wish I could have continued working, despite the abuse. As long as you have transportation, willing to work, even when you are not scheduled, and have great customer service skills, you can go far working for PetSmart."
good,"We can only get Part-time hours, no benefits, and lately they've been cutting our hours. Corporate is way too involved. They don't care about the animals, they just care about their money. I'm glad for the job experience though."
good,if you like animals it is a good place to work. Here you can interact with all sorts of animals and m any people come in  looking to give animals away so you could always rescue animals.
good,Management at the store I worked at was very unprofessional and racist. I will never work there again. The employees in the grooming salon slacked off a lot also.  They often cut many dogs.
good,"I was hired and was told at that time that I would be given management experience. When that time came, the position was given to another associate in that exact position, just at a different location. There were also very unprofessional relationships between associates and management."
good,"I worked in the Pets Hotel, so I was always working with dogs and cats. I worked both the day and overnight shifts. It was alot of fun."
good,"stock shelves with treats,run register,answer customer questions,and concerns."
good,"The company has a lack of internal advancement, preferring to seek externally. You work with some great people and it is really a team environment though it feels to have a separation between the store level and corporate."
good,"no comments,  don't really want to talk about it. I rather not talk about the companies and  I don't think you guys should ask for the reviews"
good,"I usually spent most of my time cashiering."
good,"Every job has its ups and down. I've worked at three location and every location was different. I can say the one thing that never changed was the benefits. "
good,All in all it was an OK place to work. I loved the laid back nature other than not being able to have your tattoos visible. The hours in the beginning were flexible. Management could of been a little more superior.
good,"This was a great first job to have. I learned customer service skills, stocking skills and cashier skills. It truly helped me with my people skills. Met a lot of great people and learned a lot about my self and others."
good,"This has been my first job and I am grateful to Petsmart for teaching me about the work place. I love the people who work there, most of the employees are fantastic. I have worked in several stores and just like any other corporation you have your managers that are fantastic and others that go by favorites/looks over qualification or actual work ethic. Basically you can get lucky and work at a store with great managers or get stuck with a store that will make you want to quit after the 3 month probation period. Luckily if you survive the first couple of  months the transfer process is fairly easy. Overall good place to work if you LOVE animals, if you don't then you might want to think twice about working there. The customers all depend on the neighborhood I have had fantastic customers and terrible customers, but that is the life of retail :)."
good,"This job is for the animal lovers! Very busy always something to do, never boring. I learned to have a lot of patience on this job. The hardest thing about this job is that you have a lot of multi- tasking. The most enjoyable part of my job is the dogs that come to visit me."
good,"I have worked at several locations and management is different at all. Some stores have their cashiers just stand at the register and others actually have them out on the floor interacting with customers. The management in some stores are never on the same page and that makes some of the employees so confused as to what they are actually supposed to do. There are a few store managers that never smile and always look like they are mad and that makes employees afraid to talk to them. However, there are a few stores that I have worked in that are like a family. The atmosphere is so welcoming. In these stores I have learned alot about the company and management."
good,it was great place to work fairly consistent with work but terrible with there workers
good,"It was a fun place to work but the management wasn't great. The managers never wanted people going to school to move up. So I worked there for over 5 years and never got promoted, even though I was going to school for business management and marketing. "
good,"This is a fun job but more work than you would think. Customers were always great and the pets are amazing. But I had some issues with advancement due to a poor manger, I have worked at 2 stores and each store is different."
good,For the short time that i worked there it was very fun cause of all the animals that i worked with and the people that i worked with
good,"I enjoyed working for the grooming department, just not enough business."
good,The managers were kind and understanding as well as the customers. The job was fun and challenging at the same time. Coworkers were really nice and willing to help
good,easy enough job to not stress you out more while enrolled in school. Fun place to work if you love animals and people. Fast paced work environment. Different tasks everyday.
good,"If you love animals than it’s a place for you but it can get extremely hectic and busy, like leave with a migraine busy. No opportunity for advancement and management only cares about sales. It’s ok for a bit bit but I wouldn’t want to get stuck for years"
good,I would sat that it was very entertaining working here but the management wasn't good at all. They were very hard on their employees and yelled a lot.
good,"Overall, it's an enjoyable job. You get to see many pets and chat with their pet parents. Most customers are friendly and just enjoy talking about their animals. The store can get busy around holidays, especially at the pets hotel (if the location has one). Even when part time, you can be scheduled for nearly 40 hours (Or more!) during the busiest times of the year, depending on staff numbers, so that can be an inconvenience to some people (again, specifically in the pets hotel)."
good,"A typical day for a pet care associate would be;"
good,"Retail is retail. Some managers are strict, some are more lax. Some coworkers are back-stabbing jerks, others pretty chill and open with how they feel."
good,"I loved working at petssmart but sadly no advancements and also I couldn't afford to stay because I couldn't live off only part time salary."
good,The management staff doesn't really help the other workers. They sit in the office most of the day and eat.............................................
good,"Pay could be better, hours were kept 30 minutes under 40 so you didn’t get benefits but worked full time hours, store manager at the time was so bad/condescending most of the staff quit within a month of him starting."
good,Pay sucks till you get into management. If your not willing to give your life to this company dont expect to move up. No full time roles open unless your a manager.
good,"Our managers where horrible. Salon manger did not stay long, left a girl who did not know how to run the salon in charge over a very qualified woman. Store manager was sexist, rude and plain awful to deal with. District manager did not do his job properly. I did not get proper training in my opinion."
good,"It's a retail job doing retail things. Not meant to support a family unless a manager or been there a long time, was an ok job and it wasn't bad, people were nice to work with and helped out."
good,"My time at Petsmart was bi-polar to put it nicely."
good,"Was a great first job, but wouldn’t recommend if looking for advancement. The old manager was amazing with everything he did for us! I loved working for and with him. The new manager was awful though!! She forced me to quit because my truck broke down on the way to work and the tow truck took forever. I called ahead to let her now what was going on and she said we would discuss it when I got there. When I got there, she pulled me aside to tell me I could quit now or she was going to fire me next week before the schedules came out."
good,The employees and lower level management were great! Very hands on and had very reasonable expectations. The upper management (ex:store manager) was a joke!!! Never hands on. Never actually stepped off of his high pedistool to see what the actual employees has to deal with. Never came to expierence the job he was expecting to get done for himself sp he could learn the ins and outs of the jobs he was actually managing.
good,"Loved working with the animals, but as a pet care associate spent too much time running around with too much work.  Given lots of responsibility with low pay."
good,It’s just worth it to work here. My managers are not at all understanding of needed time off. The danger of dog bites arent worth the pay especially since muzzles arent supposed to be used but pet parents get angry when you don’t want to take in their aggressive pet. I have scarring on my arms and face from scratches and bites. For barely above minimal wage? And having to work constantly over my shift hours to complete the amount of dogs they pile into your schedule? It’s not fair to me. I should’ve never taken this job. The company doesn’t care about your overall safety and well being and it’s obvious.
good,fun job with flexible hours however pay is not consistent with others equal to your position and skipped out on raises promised to their some of the workers rather than others
good,"On a store level, Pet Smart is really fun and a great workplace, But in recent times,corporate has made some moves that work against productivity and pets health, by taking time from the pet and placing it on the customer we have suffer more pet lost than any other year due to this change in policies."
good,Working at petsmart was fun and I was able to learn a lot about working with animals while I was there. Getting a regular schedule is really difficult and you may not always get all of your breaks during your shift if it is really busy.
good,"It was a good job,only part time and there is overtime during the holidays.  Very strict on adherence and policies.  Not so strict on having your phone with you."
good,"I enjoyed working here as part time. There was one problem though, I couldn’t get any more work hours because I felt I wasn’t working enough. I tried asking for more hours, but as a result they cut my hours a lot and eventually fired me."
good,"A typical work day for me was a closing cashier. Closing duties consist of dry mopping/ wet mopping cleaning tills, garbage's, carts, oops stations, vacuuming, putting returns away. Culture can be good just depending on your management. I've had good and bad manager's. I've learned a lot while working here from retail experience to cleaning floor using equipment. Often times your coworkers are always amazing. What I enjoy about the job was just working no matter what it was if i had to say it would be helping the pet parents."
good,I would of stayed with the company if i was at a different location and that they were more flexible with peoples lifestyles and availability. They need to work harder at making sure everybody has the chance to work the schedule that was best for them. The location i was at only cared about the people that have been there a long time and gave them special privileges.
good,PetSmart is currently in a down turn and lay offs are happening regularly. The atmosphere and culture are people waiting for the ax to fall. PetSmart is not a good place to work right now
good,"The environment is typically breakneck pace or dead. The store is understaffed, so there is always something to do, but at peak customer volume, there is very little to do by way of customer satisfaction."
good,"As much as I enjoyed working at PetSmart, I also am aware of flaws that were very much evident. Granted, the store I worked for was a new store, and traffic on Hilton Head does not pick up until the summer, but most days off-season are slow. This may be subject to change as years tread on, given that the immediate area is still undergoing construction. I did enjoy helping people find what they needed, and seeing that I checked them out quickly at the front. I suppose I would recommend this Job to someone who wants a slow paced workplace."
good,"I loved my job in pet care and I’d do it all again, but we had such poor management that it made me dread going in to work. I loved meeting customers who were pet owners, seeing young kids interested in the reptiles, and being able to answer all the questions they had. I never got trained so all the information I learned was through experience or researching on my own time."
good,"Quick moving work environment "
good,fun work environment but high turn over.loved most of my coworkers but some were stuck up. If I had the chance id work there again.The company sold out to a private equity firm
good,"typical work day is usually spent facing products on floor, and taking care of customers needs at register. It's usually either very slow, or very quick paced. managers aren't on top of breaks or when they happen. You basically get paid to listen to customers complain about things they bought too long ago to be returned, break up dog fights, or pet dogs. I thought I'd love working at petsmart, but management cuts hours without warning and the pay is horrible."
good,"a typical day is watching up to 15 dogs in a room with toys and play equipment, checking dogs in and out of the hotel going over any precautions with the pet parents, ensuring the safety of the pets under our care is the best for the pets well being. I learned how to read dogs behaviors and quirks and what to look for when a dog becomes scared or threatened. I enjoyed getting to know and see so many different breeds of dogs daily, they all have their own temperament and moods. The hardest part was having several high energy dogs at one time in the room, who all want to rough house. Management was very high strung and expected a lot out of the associates and for us to make little or no mistakes. The workplace was very loud and constantly was cleaned daily using watchdog (non toxic) to animals and humans, it was very fast paced and constantly left you on your toes."
good,I work in the grooming salon and it is so relaxed and everyone gets along well. The manager is very understanding when you need certain days off and tries to work with what you need. You can be bit a lot by the dogs. I dont get many hours because I am just a pet stylist apprentice (bather)
good,"Your love of pets will help you at this job, they are pet oriented, they help pet parents take care of their pets the right way. Very informative on what products they have, Cashiers are super friendly but fast paced. so it might seem they are pushing you through the line but that might only be because the line is long or they are getting heat from their managers. either way they are friendly."
good,I have 2 young children and one week I was scheduled for only 8 hours and the next week only 9 1/2 so I put in my 2 week notice after management wasn't cooperative with me.
good,"working pet care can be anywhere from boring to extremely stressful be it due to the amount of customers or the amount of animals that have suddenly become sick or died. management has the same kind of range,  either the managers are amazing or terrible."
good,Great job if your looking to work with animals. I've learned a lot about how to care of different types of animals. The people that come in are normally very nice and friendly.
good,"Not here anymore, this is not my most current job, indeed you need to fix this problem.  I do not want this part time job to be the first one they see!"
good,They have an active CARE program for associates that rewards them for positive behavior and actions which works. They earn cards that they can redeem treats.
good,"This was a retail job like many others. When I first started I truly enjoyed my job. Then in 2015 the company was bought out and everything changed. Not just my job title, but the expectations. I continued to work there until I found a more suitable job. It was not a job i wanted to leave, but the lack of CARE pushed me out. In the short time of the new owners I saw MANY Store Managers who had been with the company just up and quit. It was no longer a fun place to enjoy working. I went part-time after finding a more appropriate job to keep my discount and the family I made, but soon after I left for good. I cannot make a recommendation on if you should work there since I have not been there for a few years now and am unaware of the work environment they have created."
good,"Stock treats in the morning, help stock other departments, check out customers, water plants, fill flea and tick, and read over the list for the day. "
good,"Would be scheduled to work anywhere from 6 am to 9 am.  Performed inventory one time, and this is completed after store closing until finished.  I loved working with the pets and the customers."
good,"This is not a half bad place to work, they cut your hours pretty bad but the people are nice and they work with your schedule really well. Management is not very strict but they are fair with everyone."
good,"Very busy work, which I normally love.  However I left being a controller to work less hours and that was not the case here.  Starts off really really slow then you are sunk."
good,Worked part time while in school.  Great opportunities to learn about product and domestic pets.  Sales and pet training are expected skills to advance in the organization.
good,I get to play with lizards and take care of other small animals. Bagging fish/crickets. cleaning and feeding and taking care of the sick pets that are in isolation room in the back. Helping customers.
good,Knowledgeable staff. The managers were well organized and on top of their staff. They were well prepared to deal with all customers and handled all situations professionally.
good,Always willing to help and try to make your job easier. The people were very down to earth but most were not willing to go above and beyond. Not a best seasonal job/.
good,"Working with and helping educate pet parents was and always will be a joy for me.   What I learned in animal husbandry is invaluable.  However, the management at the store where I worked played politics; what I mean by that is they played favorites, enforced policy on the unlucky select few and not everyone.  Our store seemed to be where the corporate office sent all the managers that needed retraining or where biding their time before getting fired."
good,"I worked there for three years, a lot of people left and new people came, but it was like a small family. It's where I ended up with my biggest support group when I became pregnant."
good,"they will work with your schedule, but then call you in everyday you dont work. Overall very  nice people. Managers have favorites and will buy them food and drinks but not other employees."
good,"Your main focus is customer service. At first I thought this would be a job where I get to share my passion for pets with customers and help guide or educate them but it's not quite so. Most customers don't believe you or take your word for anything and will always do what they want even when you know it will result badly for the pet. So you have to go with your feeling for the customer and guess your way through each situation. Over all it's fun to work with animals but the customer service part can be a challenge. "
good,Loved the atmosphere and interaction with pets. Pay is low for the job requirement. Upper management would come in and pick apart your store once a week and never give good feedback.
good,"I greet all customers as they enter the facility, I make sure I count all money that is given to me and given back to the customer. I clean around the cashier center and assist customers."
good,"I have been with this company for almost 10 years and for the most part it was fine. Management is very poor. They seem to have two faces. They will talk about how bad an employee is and then turn around and act like they are the best thing on planet earth. The benefits are great. A I was saying about how long I have been there, I recently had to have a spinal fusion and have been out for the past 5 months. I have been released from my doctor to return to work without restrictions and can not seem to get anyone in corporate to say ok to me returning. It has been two weeks now that  I have been trying to go back to work. Very poor leadership. My co-workers all liked to talk about everyone. My days at work were very busy at all times. I really enjoyed taking care of the dogs. I have learned how to keep clients happy and to be a better person."
good,"It was an okay place, to work. However manigment was bad. Mangers did not listen to the complaints of concern and upset employes. I will shop for them but never again will I work with them. Alot of favoritism and bullying. Employies did not know how to care for the clients pets or even talk to clients."
good,"a decent place to work. The pay isn't the best I feel, but that's what you get for working in retail. The main reason I'm enjoying my experience with Petsmart is being able to work with some great associates."
good,"Managers are self orientated and care about profits , dont offer benefits to part time. If you tell them a problem they spread it around."
good,"While working at Petsmart I was exposed to productive and fun work place. I enjoyed that managers gave me important tasks to accomplish, I like being responsible."
good,i would rather not fill out a review on my previous employer. We parted ways for good reasons and I would like to leave it at that.
good,"Depending on what area you work at, money could be plenty. With any food job can be tough and fast place. The harder you work the MORE you will make."
good,"The job was very enjoyable. There was difficult times of course in example emergencies when pet's got ill on the lot. Overall a good job, make you feel appreciated. Only complaint was a lot of gossip occured and sometimes the hours were a little rough when doing college."
good,"I loved working with animals in my job and got along with all my co-workers. A particular manager gave me a hard time about small things that had nothing to do with the job, but everyone else always complimented me on my work and dedication to my duties. Unfortunately, the pay given was not nearly enough for all the education, training, and work required for the job."
good,A typical day was playing catching up for the lack of work others didn't do. Working with customers to get what they needed and explaining products. Maintaining the fish system.
good,"Petsmart is a fun place to work while you're in school or trying to get you life on track, but if you're looking for something with great opportunities I suggest you look elsewhere. The employees are generally nice people and the customers are some of the nicest I've ever met. There just isn't much room for advancement if you don't already know someone in upper management."
good,Can be a fun place to work. Must have genuine passion for the care of pets and helping guests find items that fit their needs.
good,Liked getting paid weekly but management seriously needed an overhaul.
good,Not long hours and you really cant provide for your family off  of the hours given
good,This is a very physical job. You are lifting 40 lb bags of dog food very often and you pull pallets off the truck.
good,"my days start at 5 or 6 a.m.. we go in and work freight for fills from previous day sales."
good,This company can provide a good start for someone interested in sales and/or retail management
good,Petsmart is perfect if you love animals. You see a different furry or scaly friend everyday so if animals are your passion its the perfect place to work
good,"keep an eye on all live stock keep everything stocked management was great co workers were fun to work with, not really a hard part but the best was taking care of reptiles"
good,"Working at Petsmart, you must love animals. The best part of my job was being around dogs all day. It was a fun challenge in grooming. "
good,"managers in and out never a stable consented manager on site,"
good,Job duties clearly defined. Management was helpful and compassionate.
good,Fun place to work with tons of nice people. Hardest part of my job is working in grooming and being at the risk of being bitten by dongs who don't like being groomed. I love being on register and helping customers find what best suits them and their animal. My hours aren't set so I have to modify things in my home life to work around the work schedule. Something the managers can be misleading and not understand home problems or problems with working certain hours. They are flexible though. Hours fluxuate a lot unless you are full time. I went from 14 one week to 26 the next and it always goes up and down.
good,I've really liked working for this company the past few years. They are always flexiable with my school hours and if I ever need to ask off a few days. Not much room for advancement and the pay isin't the best. No real benefits. Management depends on store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress levels of not having enough employees and having alot of customers. The most enjoyable part is getting to help people and seeing everyones pets!
good,I worked as a cashier and in the petcare department. Loved working with the animals and taking care of them. the pay wasnt very high at the time i worked there however it was nice to be around people that made you feel like family.
good,"Typical retail job, although working around animals is a big plus, and the customers are usually pretty chill. Hours are flexible enough, and schedules come out every 2 weeks"
good,They have good benefits if you work full time. Management is not the best. Expect to work lots of weekends and holidays and not to have much time off.
good,"I learned great customer service skills"
good,"Provide exceptional continued training for Pet Trainers. Work with you to allow flexibility for your schedule, benefits available for full-time employees"
good,I loved this company it was good and a respectable place ever one that works there are respectful and great job that’s why I love big place to work meet new people
good,"I worked in PetSmart for about a year,and really is a great job and good employee's,I was taught thurally on my job and what was expected of me to finish"
good,"If you can truly immerse yourself in the job (animal care, education and awareness) then your experience will genuinely only be tainted by management and policies."
good,"Fun and fast paced. Manager and salary are poor. There's a lot of hard physical work that all employees are expected to perform. Including throwing and stocking freight, custodial work such as cleaning and mopping bathrooms and the entire store."
good,Petsmart was great.. I loved working there. My manager and coworkers were so helpful! I did not like the fact that we all had to learn cashier. I worked in petcare and loved it..hated cashier!! But they don't pay much and you don't get benefits. That is the only reason I had to leave!
good,"I enjoyed my job, workplace and coworkers. The only issue I ever had was with management, they only care about money and it’s very easy for them to disrespect their associates."
good,Only downfall was that this oppurtunity was temporary and part time. Great work environment and great atmosphere at the time. If you expect a permanent job make sure before hiring on completely make sure its either temp or perm
good,"I was told that I was being considered for an open management opportunity, but they definitely took their time with it. It was about 4 months in that I was told that they were stringing me along so I would do management work, AND my regular work."
good,Overall I really enjoy working for the company but my main issue is lack of advancement when frequently told that I would make a perfect manager and knowing that they have a position open for what I would be placed into.
good,"It’s a decent work place to get you by. Management is a good position to be in, but associatess don’t get many hours or pay. The customers are great to form a bond with and start conversations."
good,The job was okay. I really liked the people I worked with but it's retail so anyone who can avoid it is going to. They pay was minimum wage but that's to be expected for an entry level retail position.
good,"Can be a very rewarding job if you have previous animal care experience/knowledge. No training for pet -care you learn as you go and are generally hired based on your knowledge (paid based on it too).  Downside is you won’t get over 30 hours, constantly hiring new people. Expect to be hired in one department and quickly be shuffled around between cash/pet-care/grooming/receiver and stocking. Culture is decent, coworkers usually have established bonds and if you aren’t in the “in-group”, expect the job to be just that- a job. Management leaves something to be desired. Upper management is horrible and inaccessible. In store management is just trying to do its best, but  often you will get an 8h week because there aren’t enough hours to go around. You will not get paid fairly as well. Considering all the knowledge/ experience/ patience you need to have and develop the pay is absolutely terrible, expect min wage to +50cents above min wage. But be prepared to have expertise in every aspect of the care for ALL animals in store. Expect to be a triage nurse and voice of the animals in the store. You will be asked to drive sick animals to and from the vet, without mileage compensation. Dealing with excrement, puss, animal fights, administering medications and rude customers comes with the job. The customers who are willing to learn , and the coworkers in the same boat as you make the job okay. If your love of animals is unconditional, you will find some satisfaction in the job. If not, it’s not the place for you."
good,"I enjoyed working in petcare, but sometimes the late hours wouldn’t work with my schooling. Good weekend job and fun to be around animals. I would recommend working here."
good,I personally didn’t like working for petsmart because management treated staff very unfairly. They cause a lot of the work drama that goes around. It can be a very uncomfortable environment.
good,I didn’t know if I would like retail or not having always had a desk job but I love customer service. I love coming in to work and seeing people bringing their dogs in or if they don’t have their dog with them I’ll always ask the customer what kind of dog they have if they’re buying dog food. We get into long conversations sometimes. Most customers are very pleasant. I like all of my coworkers and the management. The only things I don’t like are the low pay and sometimes only getting four hours a week.
good,My first job right out of high school. Was an awesome place to work. You learn so much and you have the right people to help you. A little overpriced but great products for your pet.
good,The manager was rude. overall everything was pretty decent. Love helping the customers. some customers were very disrespectful. Would recommend working here again.
good,"Working with the animals is easily the best part of the job, Co-workers are easily the second best part, and the managers are not bad either. Overall, Great environment"
good,"It's great, especially if you like animals and learning about how to take care of them. They don't pay the best, but it's comparable to your average retail job in that respect. My team in pet care is great and super cooperative. The workplace culture in that regard is absolutely the best I've ever personally experienced at a job like this. mgmt is what you'd expect. Not too bad if you do your job but sort of tricky to communicate with."
good,"I absolutely LOVED working at PetSmart! I really miss working there and wish I still could! I loved teaching others all about animals and learning new things about animals with the customers when I didn't know. Taking care of the animals, cleaning their cages and all that was fun too! There is a lot of fish knowlegde required for the job, and you WILL learn a lot, I would recommend being open to learning new things and being okay with going out of your way to learning these new things. Customer service is HUGE with PetSmart, it's all about helping and assisting pet parents, and helping them find what they need."
good,"I worked in the hotel and I loved everyone there. My manager and leaders were great, communicative, and understanding. I loved the dogs and they were the only reason I stayed a little longer than I planned. The management on the floor and our store manager, were not that great. I never worked directly with them, but I heard many complaints and gossip. Also just working in a corporate environment made it frustrating at times."
good,Could be managed better in disciplinary aspects and because the behavioral system is flawed. No one can plan to be sick however can not use sick days without planning them. Not fair
good,I did not like location i worked at management was not always professional. Management was not always willing to negotiate with staff about schedule. Also staff was big into gossiping instead of working
good,"Great job but I never get enough hours to live off of, staff and costumers are great however management can be questionable at times. Would continue working at petsmart if they had the option to advance."
good,good chances to move up and learn but lots of turnover and instability.  Promises were made and broken frequently.  The staff can be amazing but often problems are oevrlooked if they are friends with the store manager
good,"nice people, clean work environment, and decent hours. hardest part of the job was working with the difficult customers and the untrained dogs but other then that it was nice, i loved working with all the adorable babes."
good,Nothing new to any one that has worked retail. A very pet friendly environment. I enjoyed working for PetSmart. The only thing I did not like was the availability of advancement.
good,"Working at PetSmart was a lot of fun. I enjoyed my job very much. Getting to work with the dogs and the people i worked with were amazing. They were great about being flexible with my school schedule, and always willing to work with me. I would have loved to stay there, but i didnt see myself growing or advancing to be a career."
good,PetSmart was a good place to work part-time. I was able to pick the days or hours I was available and it paid decently well. It was a nice job to have while I was in school and interning.
good,No ability to move up. Almost 3 years and there was no help to try to get a higher position or learn more. They would rather hire someone new than teach.
good,"Good place to learn how to multi task and gain better work experience around customers in a pet retail setting. A very fun place to work full of fun, laughs, and a lot of animals. However, very easy to get dismissed for small mistakes, things not under your control and be ready to take a hit if necessary for someone else if they are new."
good,"In my current position, very early hours (not a morning person) with very hard labor. I'm constantly running from the time I clock in to the time I leave. I don't mind hard work, but this can get exhausting.. I get little support from higher management in the tasks that must be completed daily even if I'm not there. Basically, if I'm not there, these mandatory tasks don't get done at all. I enjoy the pets I meet and helping the pet parents with their needs. Contrary to popular belief, there's no ""playing"" with the animals. We take care of them. We provide for them. We do everything in our power to keep them healthy. We, however, are there to do a job."
good,"I started working at Petsmart as a cashier, and advanced to a pet care associate after a few months of working there.  I really enjoy my managers, however, some of the  supervisors are fairly rude at our locations. "
good,"Pet-smart is a wonderful first time or even forever job. The pet-smart on 1960 and 45 was the worst with management but got better with customer service.  A regular day in the salon you'll come in and sign on the computer , check to see how many dogs you have scheduled and if they have any notes that you need to worry about, then do a walk through of the salon front to back taking pictures of anything that didn't get clean or wasn't there the day before. Once you have done that you will go to your work station begin to set up while this is happening your morning dog 7 a.m. babies should be walking in the door. Once you have put all your morning dogs in a kennel with the service card and checked over everything you may begin your work day."
good,I love the training part of the job because it allows me to create a bond with pet parents and their pets while they learn to communicate with them using positive reinforcement techniques.
good,The job its self you would really have to have patience and understanding. dogs cannot talk so you have to be able to be patient. I loved interacting with the dogs and getting to know them and pet parents
good,"I enjoyed working here when I was right out of high school. It was a fun environment, but I did not have much room for growth. Nor did I have any benefits, however this was over 10 years ago and things could have changed."
good,Getting to hang out with animals is the best part of the job. Picking a store where managers and associates that care about those animals and customers are key.
good,"PetSmart is a fast paced, easy to work job. The hardest part is higher up jobs such as pet care and management positions. The most enjoyable part is connecting with other pet parents who have a passion for their pets."
good,"Pet care has a lot of tasks to complete on top of handling customers and caring for ALL the store's animals. I enjoyed the fast pace. I learned everything from my store manager and an associate who'd been there for 20 years. SM left and new SM and ASM are unfit for their positions and no number of HR calls or investigations have changed this. I have moved out of the sales floor and into the salon and haven't dealt with much more managerial shenanigans as the salon manager is amazing. "
good,"My store manager is a good person but i just don't think he knows what he's doing, and the assistant manager is very lazy and hardly works at all. My coworkers are easy to get along with for the most part, and I like being able to help people and their pets."
good,"Its alright, but its a low base pay for the grooming salon for the amount of work you do. We also have miscellaneous rules that sometimes aren't necessary but that is the corporate life for you. Besides being a bather, you can move up to being a groomer, and possibly a grooming manager. However its all about grooming dogs so you have to truly be set in what you want to do. Once they send you to the advancement classes, you are locked into a contract for 2+ years. If you quit or get fired, you would owe them legally 10,000 dollars."
good,"A typical day at work is taking in appointments, bathing dogs, answering phones, taking walk-ins, and assisting your coworkers. "
good,"Though working in the store with staff was an enjoyable experience, there is a lot of scrutiny from the district management level and sometimes overwhelming corporate expectations. There was no consistency from store to store."
good,"Going in with no previous work experience at all, this company has done its best to train me to the fullest extent for my position. This is the busiest location in the city of Las Vegas, and an average day the store is usually packed! The best part of the job for me was greeting all of the cute pets and helping pet parents find just what they needed for their little friend. The hardest part was dealing with theft. The company policies regarding it are very basic.. If a known thief making a bad return made enough of a ruckus, depending on the managers on duty, would get away with it almost every time. If you're not the type to mind things like this, it's a very easy and low stress job!"
good,Customers will wear you down. It's fun working there when you're able to help people and keep a positive attitude. It helps to have a manager with the same outlook and goals.
good,"Learning experience working with animals, doing various jobs within the store.  I like working with the company even though it was temporary.  The associates was great to work with comfortable working environment."
good,"Loved working with animals, but working with people made this job so difficult. Customers wouldn't listen and apply proper care, which often resulted in returning a dead animal. We also got a lot of sick animals from the breeders which often died. We didn't have the right equipment or knowledge to cure these animals. Management often forgot to make a vet appointment for them. The environment was very unprofessional."
good,"My favorite part about working at PetSmart is the animals, I loved all the animals that would come into the store. Ive seen pigs, hedgehogs and sugar gliders. I love that about the job."
good,"Nothing spectacular, retail job gone into management. Learned good basic skills in retail management and running retail stores. Learned to manage people and customers. Corporate office was not so easy to work with, they implemented policies that were often detrimental to the day to day care of animals."
good,Not every store is the same but they have ups and downs. Getting along with everyone and working as a team helps out a lot. Just make sure you’re always smiling and talking to everybody that comes in. Great customer service is key!
good,"PetSmart has been a good place to work for mostly. Recent cut backs on hours has made it a little bit rough though, as customers have been getting annoyed when there is no one available to help them because associates are already helping other people. "
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and busy yet at the same time it was fun and enjoyable. I learned how to communicate better, use my time wisely, and how to restock merchandise. Management was always polite, helpful, and available when needed. The hardest part about the job was pleasing each and every customer. The best part about the job was getting to know all the people I worked with."
good,"Working there was great, until they started to take away some of the things that made being an established, long term employee, attractive. They capped the amount of vacation time received. Rarely got reviews or was told anything until there was a list of things I had done wrong to go through."
good,"First job at the age of 16. Overall positive experience, worked there over 10 years ago so the job environment has changed. Some matters needed to be handled a little less by corporate oversight."
good,"Seeing the pets is great and helps with the horribly mundane job of a cashier. Standing in the same spot is horrible, but that's not the fault of the company as it is the standard practice for cashiers. The only big negative is that they hound you on getting customer emails and even though you do what they say they still get upset when you don't meet their quota, and you have no ability to change the fact hat people don't want to be spammed by their emails."
good,"It's okay. Dogs are great to be around, typical customers, but management on all levels is not up to par. The tech is old or not efficient. Sort of a high turn over rate."
good,It's a decent place overall. Depending on what store you're applying to will weigh greatly in your experiences with the company. It depends much upon your management staff/experience/ & store location/traffic.
good,"The pay is very good in comparison to other pet retailers.  There is a strict adherance to policies and procedures.  It is a very professional place to work.  "
good,"Offers a friendly working environment with slightly above minimum wage pay, usually leisurely paced work, and a chance to interact with animals and people. However, there's limited benefits, no full time hours, and hardly any advancement opportunities."
good,"I absolutely love grooming at PetSmart, and I am grateful for the one month long training experience I was given; however, this is not the job I see myself having for the rest of my life. It is a new trade I have acquired and that I can use in the future. I am hopeful of moving up to the corporate level of PetSmart because it is an excellent company, I'm just following a different approach."
good,this place is all about pets and not only making them happy but their families happy. we want to make sure we find homes for many different friends for all types.
good,"In the field of a sales Associate in Pet Retail, you tend to require having background and quite a bit of knowledge for pet care. Sometimes there are questions tossed at you which help you learn; either in discovering the information together or learning how to communicate with the customer. The most enjoyable part of work is the steady pace in which time passes quicker and the puppies and occasional cats that come in with their pet parents. The difficult part of work would be handling some of the rude and arrogant customers."
good,I love working here at petsmart but the management and my coworkers are sometimes not the best. But the job itself is one of my favorites. I have learned a lot from working here and I plan to use what I learned in the future.
good,"It is a very fun and friendly work environment. Everyday is a new experience as far as the animals and pet parents you meet. If you are able to get in good with the managers you will have the opportunity to learn the ropes of all aspects of the company but you must first show that you are a good, diligent, and trustworthy worker. Unfortunately, the opportunities for raises and/or advancement are slim. The hardest part of the job would probably be getting all your tasks done on busy days while still providing pet parents with quality customer service. The most enjoyable part is interacting with pet parents and their pets."
good,not a bad job if you keep your head down and work. don't get caught in the drama. Place for advancement if you know the right people. typically busy day. get to meet new pets daily!
good,"Petsmart isn't boring to work at, I'll give it that. But it won't be easy if you   have too much of a problem with cleaning messes left by animals daily and sometimes handling overzealous pet parents. I learned a lot about how to work with animals, and everyone working there are always friendly and fun to talk to. You're making a difference and making sure people's animals are cared for, but it can be a pretty dirty job sometimes. And don't expect to get a raise or a promotion anytime soon."
good,"Lots of one on one with customer and animal parents. Great possible of training to be a groomer and that was my plan. They were willing to train me. "
good,"What I have learned working as a pet stylist is a life long skill that i can take anywhere. Although it is not the profession I want in the long term, I can always go back to it if needed."
good,"It is ideal as an introduction to the work world but it is hard to advance and restrictions by corporate make certain things difficult. Intro level job for sure, unless you are a manager, it is pretty difficult, or impossible, to get benefits and it seems that, even if you work full time hours, you'll still be labeled as part time so benefits are just out of your reach. I learned A LOT about small animal/reptile/amphibian care and do not regret any of that but I wish that the managers and Corporate were more open to listening to their employees about certain things such as animal care or certain procedures. I met a lot of good people at my store, made friends, learned A LOT of information, skills, and how to care for animals. I do enjoy working with friends versus just seeing them as coworkers and the managers at my store are fairly easy to get along with as long as you do your job properly. "
good,"It wasn't a bad place, quite the opposite actually. The people I worked with directly were all good people with a healthy sense of humor which made the work day happy. The pay was good and the hours were fine depending which shift you were on. Safety was of paramount concern. Like any place it does have its issues but what place doesn't."
good,Working in the petcare department was really fun. I learned a lot about the care of animals and interesting facts about some of the exotic animals they would have. Fellow employees were great to work with.
good,"Depending on which location you were hired at, the managers can make a huge difference on your experience. While working at the initial location, I loved my job and then I was relocated when I was promoted and I ended up leaving because I could not handle the store manager."
good,This job is very demanding and not rewarding. The management asks a lot and gives very little in return. There is no room for advancement in the company.
good,"a typical day at work was very fast paced, could be stressful but days would always go by quickly."
good,they never really gave people ether the right amount of time or the right amount of people to get the job done but they where relatively flexible with the timetable
good,Good place to work for someone still in high school or working through college. this not the place to make your career if you are looking for good benefits or high wages
good,I really loved working here as caring for animals and helping customers make the best decisions for their pets was my #1. Every day was a fun day between catching fish and having laughs to making sure the customers knew the right product for there specified pet.
good,"Greeted all customers by phone and provided excellent customer service. Assisted customers by answering product and service questions and suggested information regarding additional products or services. Maintained customer records by verifying and updating account information. Resolved any issues by determining the cause of the problem, selecting appropriate department or solution to solve the problem and following up to ensure resolution."
good,"It was an amazing experience getting to know all of the dogs! I had my favorites and my lesser.. favorites. PetSmart, however, does NOT care for the customer pets in their PetsHotels. The ""theory"" on cleaning and handling is just about flawless but there is a severe lack in the number of employees. I worked at one of the largest (300 dogs boarding on one holiday week) and I saw some pretty terrible sights. One sight caused a close coworker to quit! Feces and urine sitting in rooms, dogs without water, chemicals getting into dog rooms, and finally a dog mauling! I'm sure they are working to fix it all, but they DESPERATELY NEED TO UP THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEED! Its fine as a company if you'd want to house that many dogs for boarding purposes, but you need to match the number of employees so that all of the dogs are in pristine condition! Many of my coworkers wouldn't even bring their dogs in for daycare let alone boarding! They would compare it to working in a shelter until we all realized: PetSmart was worse than AT LEAST 98% of all shelters. "
good,Great place to work  if you are a  first time call center  associate. No benefits though if you work  full time. The job can get dull and repetitive.  You are sitting down most of the day. They are very flexible with scheduling around school if  you are a student.
good,PetSmart is a wonderful place to begin your journey or to even end a journey. I am very appreciative for everything PetSmart has done for me but it is just time for me to move on.
good,"I love animals and working here was so amazing, I loved coming to work every day but I can't stand the managers and how clueless and hot/cold they are. They didn't understand the care that went into the animals and I've been yelled at for doing my job and taking care of the animals, but not something unimportant like pricing merchandise."
good,"Bathing dogs and grooming, Easy to get along with co-workers. Management was a little sloppy. Overall nice and welcoming co-workers"
good,"It was really fun spending time with the dogs and caring for them.  I didn't learn very much, but I did learn how to trim nails.  Management was absolutely terrible.  My co-workers were good, but mostly kids.  The hardest part of the job was actually dealing with the GM.  He was inconsiderate, rude, and didn't much care about the employees."
good,"The level of happiness at the job depends entirely on upper management. Good management can lead a culture that makes an amazing workplace. However, being retail, lots of changes have occurred in a short amount of time. Love my job, but if you need stability retail may not be best."
good,"Fun place to work, with complex people, but manageable,reasonable management. Unfortunately hard to move up, but still fun place to work. Some managers are better than the others."
good,"It was a great learning experience, I learned how to receive a delivery truck and work the forklift. Co-workers where nice and fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was lifting hundreds of pounds almost daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was the chance to help customers out and see them come back and ask for me personally."
good,Decent place to work. The coworkers I had when I was there weren't great. Slacking off on the job wasn't dealt with in a timely fashion and hard-work was often rewarded with having to do the work that others wouldn't do.
good,Overall its a fun workplace if you have a passion for pets. Mission statement is clear if you want to move up in the company lead by example and exceed expectations.
good,"I instructed customers on how to train their dogs...helped them locate items they were, looking for.  I gave advise on food choices, collars etc anything to do with their dogs"
good,"Typical day started at 3am, after two years this is what burned me out. Most enjoyable part of the job was the animals."
good,"The people are great, very strong talent.  Lots of change happening as a result of pressure from an investment company.  Would recommend researching more online before making any final decisions."
good,"Answering phone, helping with customer service, and working with pets."
good,"Good company to work for if  management works well with you."
good,"Clean and open Store"
good,"Every day is an adventure with Petsmart. It's never routine and it kepts me on my toes all the time. Working here has helped me gain more patience and a better understanding of how people want and need to be treated. Customers come first no matter what job you are at. Management is a constant presence in the work place and they are very open and honest with all their customers and employees. My co-workers make the working environment a better place to work in with their positive attitude and excitement. We all make sure that our customers leave with a smile on their face. The hardest part of the job is letting a customer down if we do not have the product that they were looking for, however we did not leave them unsatisfied with their visit. Besides the most enjoyable part is seeing the smile on our customers faces. That is what the job is about, making our customers our number one priority and by gaining their trust to better our business. Also, providing great customer service for when they need it most"
good,"I love animals so it was a very interesting job in that factor, besides that i have no real big issues with this job. Only problem i had at the time was transportation."
good,"the day are long and hot.but i learned to stack dog food.my manager was nice,and the most worker were helpful and friendly.but the hrdest part of the job was the breaks.the most enjoyable part was only working three day a week"
good,"It is a fun place to work at. My favorite part is to give the right information to  pet parents depending on the pet's necessities, "
good,This was the only job I ever had that I looked forward to going to work. I loved being able to be around animals and taking care of them. I made friends and was able to cross train into three departments. I eventually left and found a job that paid more but was sad to go.
good,"A typical day for a stocker involves being awake and at work at 4 or 5 in the morning and working the truck. PetSmart does not hire fulltime employees so all stockers are usually home 4 or 5 hours after our shift begins, and we are lucky if we get 20 hours a week."
good,I loved being a dog groomer. There were so many places to be creative not to mention you get to play with dogs all day.
good,Retail position dealing with cleaning and maintaining all animal habitats in the store
good,"A typical day would involve interacting/assisting customers."
good,Fairly easy job stocking up dog food and other pet products. Would be nice if the customers would pick up after their dog's mess then the place wouldn't stink as much.
good,"fast paced reaching indivual numbers learning more than one job with crosstraining management for the most part was willing to listen about daily situations concerning job questions some more helpful than others.the co workers i worked with we all worked as a group everyone picking packing different areas different assingments but teamworkthe hardest part of job was dealing with the gossip working for such a big company the most enjoyable part of the job was the respect and appreciation when shift was over the ceo stood outside as the employees left for the day thanking us for a job well done and to have a nice evening,"
good,Petsmart is a great company to work for. They really CARE about their associates and managers. At times it can be stressful but not all the time. It really makes a difference who your store manager is. I have worked for 3 different store managers and 2 out of the 3 were awesome. The third store manager was not a very good store manager. He was lazy and never kept his word. He would lie to you and always pawned his duties off to us. Overall I loved working for Petsmart. I just think they should really look at who is in management. I also feel like the DM should reach out to the other managers in the store to see how that particular store manager is performing. It's not always by the numbers.
good,"My typical day was feeding, washing and playing with the dogs in their dog camps for the day. From 9-12 and 1-5 we had camp for the dogs to play and it was fun. However there was no advancement "
good,"You'll deal with puppies and kittens all day, as well as their parents and messes.  Certain repeat customers can brighten your day and certain ones can wreak havoc but they can be calmed easily if you can find common ground.  I learned that the customer is ALWAYS right, even when they're not.  Co-workers can be friendly and some a bit reclusive.  The hardest part of the job is figuring out how to please the annoyed pet parents. The most enjoyable is making pets and their parents happy."
good,"The people I work with are wonderful.  I don't ALWAYS love the job, but the people around me make it so that I never HATE it."
good,Its a fun place to work but it is not a career by far. Had good management and the hours are avalible.
good,started as a groomer didnt like that. feet were always wet so i moved out to the sales floor. a little better just felt like i was being used for my ability and performance started selling alot and got bumped up to a commission based job and found that while i was working for the company i was getting stiff armed by another employee taking all sales for him self. this place has no sense of team work its every man for him self
good,"A typical day for me would vary because there was different duties per each day. Once the routine got down packed, it was like second nature to me. I was in charge of the Pet Department, associate wise, and feed the animals and change their bedding. Along with the animal husbandry I helped sell animals and educate pet parents on taking care of their animlas. Co-workers, came and went, but were very easy to get along with. We were like a family."
good,Petsmart was a great job. They rewarded us for doing a great job in picking and working in a timely order
good,This is a great place if you love animals advancement here is difficult for they don't seem to hire within
good,The best part of the job is interacting with the animals and their owners because you can tell they really care for their pet!
good,"Stocking the store, helping customes with animal choices, Cleaning, register"
good,i liked working there it was nice cause we got to see a lot of differt anmails.
good,i liked working there we had fun at what we did an got a long with everyone there.
good,"Very demanding job, the company only seems to care about improving their stock and doesnt give anything back to their employees. The people that work their all share the same passion for pets so it makes the work enviroment more enjoyable."
good,I was a contractor in the marketing department and enjoyed working in a different area of business than operations and cost management.
good,"Typical day at work involves helping customers, stocking shelves and taking care of animals. Hardest part of the job is usually trucks, or huge plan o gram changes"
good,I loved my fellow employees and the clients were usually easy to work with. Salon was never kept clean until new bathers were hired and management would make us clean things that are against health code.
good,"For a typical work day its just ringing people up, petting dogs, and seeing some cool animals. The job is pretty boring and taxing on the mind because customers tend to have a lot of items that must be scanned one by one, so that can take a while to get through. The equipment at the store is very outdated and needs to be changed, I really can't stress that enough. But the most and only fun part about the job would be the dogs and helping pet parents shop for there new puppy."
good,"The customers were decent people most of the time, it’s just not my field of work. Things never felt like I was meant to be there at that moment, and any problems brought about only made that worse."
good,"pet care was always a busy area in the store, everyday you had a set of deep cleans, fish day, birds, small animals and reptiles. its your job to teach the pet parents on there new loved one."
good,I would recommend it as a first job. A simi fast pace environment and the manager was well at his job. You learn alot about reptiles and cats and dogs..
good,"Everyday you could always expect a generally new experience, learning new things everyday! It is a great place for animal lovers to feel like they are giving back to the local shelters. Plus you get to meet new pets and help people take care of their new animal friend."
good,"Good company to work , offers great benefits for full time associates , flexible work schedule , trained in all areas of the store , allowed to wear jeans to work and they provide a shirt for associates to wear"
good,We got a new Store Manager how did not like me and he tried everything to get rid of me .After bullying for Weeks I quit .Don't expect help from your District Manager .Otherwise I loved Petsmart .Still sad that it went this Way
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with for the most part and the overall environment of the salon, however I did not care for the retail hours and how little I actually made on the dogs I groomed due to commission based pay"
good,"Petsmart is a cool place to work! I would recommend working here if you love pets and you enjoy working with awesome people! If you work hard, you can always move up in your position."
good,"i absolutely love working here at petsmart, fun place to work, great group of people to work with, everyone works with everyone, no one leaves anyone behind and if your willing to learn something new, petsmart is a great place to work."
good,Metting new and exciting faces everyday. Making the customer my number one priority to keep them happy with the company's service also mine. Striving to make every day better than the last.
good,"The company is nice to work for and you can learn a lot about the different animals you care for, but the managers are not the best. It may not be that way in every location but I wouldn't recommend this location."
good,"There were times at my specific store that working was less than enjoyable, but Petsmart is a great company with plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and grow."
good,"I dont mind it, its a nice place to work, kind people, needs vetter healthcare an dental plans. Overall its a decent place to work at especially for a first time job."
good,"For starting out, it's a nice job to get, but there's not much longevity in it. The pay wasn't reflective on the amount of work I had to do, and the amount I was expected or even ask to do, beyond my regular line of work."
good,This job is very very stressfull. Have to be strong willed and able to work long periods if time. And be on your feet all day. This job is very hard on your body.
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work as far as retail it was as good as it gets. The upper management is hugely worried about statistics and surveys that the customer barely cares to give. Giving performance reviews and bonuses based on the survey performance, which a lot of people don't even take seriously. Most of the metrics there asking to do well in is depending on teenagers to be highly engaging and wanting to be a salesman, which in this generation is practically non-existent."
good,"I really enjoyed working here for a short period of time, management was not the best. They consistantly were making our hours wrong. They had cut mine to 9 a week! It was impossible for me to go to work for 2 hours at a time for how far away from my home the business was at also as a dog trainer management was no help to me."
good,he did not care for the animals or to learn the managers names. He did not listen to staff. the company also added a lot of work load to their staff when they got bought out with out any more compensation.
good,It was a great experience. I learned so much about all the animals and the best types of food to feed them. Everyone was super nice and helpful and were patient while I was learned the ropes.
good,"it's good, not a whole lot of place to or room to grow. They work with you school schedule. A whole lot of monthly store changes as well as inventory management"
good,"Good place to work when you love animals but as all retain places, you are asked to do too much with too few people and not enough time given."
good,"So far from when I started working PetSmart I was happy I loved going to work because the pay  was better than my last job ,everyday I learn something different, management was something else mangers will always get fire so it’s was always different , depends where you work at ,its not a bad place to work if you’re trying to balance school and work very flexible with that and very helpful too"
good,Pet smart was a fun job. I started put as a stocker and that's all I did was stock shelves. Until they eventually moved me to the cash register and there I excelled.
good,I actually didn’t hate this job. If I would’ve gotten paid more per hour I definitely would have stayed. Working with all the animals was really fun. I enjoyed cleaning as well as feeding the animals. Customer service wasn’t my favorite part of the job though but that would be at any job.
good,"I helped clean and care for the cats. I volunteered for the cat shelter for the summer and found it to be very relaxed, yet challenging. I learned how to manage my time and how to properly care for the cats."
good,"I worked in the PetsHotel for 2 summers. I've worked with animals in the past so I knew going in that it would be a hard job. It is best to know going in that this job is exhausting both physically and mentally because people love to drop off their problem dogs to have us deal with instead. "
good,"I enjoy my co-workers and managers, the pay and hours are not too great though."
good,"My Manager was terrible.  She didn’t try to get along with me and hurt my feelings.  I could have been a much better Manager than she was.  If she left me alone, i did my best work.  I knew what needed to be done but I don’t think she did."
good,Working in the grooming section is hard work but rewarding. You learn how to change your schedule throughout the day. Due to online booking your day changes on a consistent basis.
good,Very fun workplace. You learn something new everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the fur babies and interacting with the loving pet parents!
good,I loved working at Petsmart. The first Salon I worked at was drama but once I switched stores it was a great time. The pets were great and the coworkers were awesome. Store managers can be kinda rude but the Salon managers are usually great.
good,"My typical day began at 4:30 in the morning, getting ready for work to make sure I arrived on time. We would often receive inventory every day or two. it was usually the manager, another associate and myself. our goal was to stock the merchandise in its place before the store opened, and make everything presentable for the customers."
good,"Loved the job and the people and pets , it was a fun and friendly place to work. I would not have left but had very bad management . All the people worked as a team ."
good,"It was just a weekend job for me so the people liked me but not as much as the ones that worked all the time. So wasn't sad to quit. work was fine but boring, only fun when people let you touch their dogs."
good,"PetSmart is a great environment to work in for anyone that can handle multitasking, a quick pace, and enjoys interacting with pets and customers alike."
good,"I enjoyed working here during my time and made some life long friends. People I worked with were great and full of character. Customers were sometimes not so great, but that's retail for you."
good,"I absolutely loved working here, but my hours weren't as flexible as I would've liked. When I worked here, I was a senior in high school. My manager would always call me during school and ask if I could come in earlier. They were very much aware that I was in high school. My hours were also cut to working 1 day a week after I returned from time off with a very serious illness. I loved the animals and made friends with my coworkers, but the management could use some work."
good,"I wasn't actually employed by PetSmart, I actually volunteered, however, I would still recommend them if you like pets. I personally have a few pets, and have had a few in the past and I love animals so helping out with the cats made me happy and I enjoyed it."
good,actually i learned to work in fast pace environment. the hardest part of the job was stocking really fast and the easiest part of the job was helping out customers.
good,We are trained to accomplish a certain amount of things done within our shift and during that time we are to also help customers. We are to know very much detail regarding our products in order to help the customer in the best way possible.
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work, there were multiple shifts and hours of availability. The pay was decent, and I learned  a greeat deal about pets and products."
good,"I worked for Petsmart for 4 years. For the first two years everything was great. It was my first job too. I loved the animals, liked learning about said animals, learned about customer service, very nice customers and management was nice and fair. I started to see the cracks when a certain manager was bullying employees by cutting the hours of the ones she did not like, getting them written up and intimidating them into helping her steal from the company by ringing her up for very discounted items. If anyone said something about it they were at risk of loosing their job. She was on a power trip and got away with it for years cause she was the store managers favorite. Me and this manger started not to see eye to eye and she started cutting my hours to get me to quit. Nope, I would not, then she started writing my up for tardies because she would change the schedule without notifying me when I already had it written out or printed out. We got a new store manager and I had to bring up the situation with him to explain what was going on. She ended up getting fired when she was caught stealing. For awhile things were good and I was doing well at the job. I left when I got a better paying job."
good,Great place to work although some inconsistency. Overall exiting workplace. I would definitely recommend petsmart to any pet lover. Some coaching for improvement opportunities.
good,"I loved stocking and helping customers find what they needed for there pets.  I  had many jobs such as barber, cashier and was asked to take a management position.  I loved my job at Petsmart just wish the pay was higher."
good,"First duty when coming in was to sanitize all the dogs crates, set all machines on standby. As the dogs came in on there scheduled appointment i would bathe them do glands if requested. I then dry the dogs do there nails and any privates. I assisted other groomers as needed in the bathing or drying area. I would also take care of walk in nails. At the end of the shift the entire salon needs to be cleaned and all filters are to be cleared. Duties also included answering the phone and making appointments. The best part of the job was indeed the animals and all there magnificent personalities. the hardest was the stress that came with the double bookings. All in all it was a company that could help provide growth for animal lovers."
good,"I LOVED working at this petsmart in the pets hotel. I got to play with dogs all day and as a dog lover, it was a dream come true! It also taught me a lot about animal safety as well as helped me to conquer my fears of some breeds of dogs."
good,The time I worked at petsmart was very enjoyable and the fast paced schedule made the day go by quickly. Working here requires hard work but it’s so fun it doesn’t feel like work.
good,"During the day at the store you had many different areas to be aware of because of the variation of areas in the store.  There were live animals constantly in and out of the store, animals that were sold to be cared for, a groom shop, and vet clinic.  All of these areas had to be monitored to make sure they were all running safely."
good,This was one of my favorite jobs I've had. I loved the freedom to be who you are and being surrounded by animals all day. I wish they had offered full time positions for new employees. It was a great environment with reasonable hours.
good,They bring in managers that don't know how to do the jobs there. Very strict policy. The mod is the worst place to work in the building. The provide food on Tuesday and Wednesday which was nice.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I also enjoyed my time as a cashier and being able to help out PetParents in order to give them the best experience in finding all the products they were looking for to ensure the well being of their pet.
good,This job was very easy and slow paced. They don't need many people working unless it's the holidays. Management is excellent they always have your back when you need help. People who work here are usually very nice and love animals. The hardest thing about working here is learning how to take care of all the animals. The best part about working here is getting to work with animals and people like to bring their dogs.
good,"loved my manager above me. Overall store manager ruined the experience for me, many employee left due to the bad leadership. I'm sure other stores may be better."
good,"Fun place to work, got to love animals. Sometimes a flexible schedule. Understanding mangers. Not a lot of opportunity for move ups in the company. But overall a cool high school job."
good,working for petsmart is a good experience. its a good foundation to learn what you need to learn for the future in this field./ overall its a good company
good,"Working at petsmart everyday was always a pleasure given the amount of knowledge and love I had for pets, so the job came naturally to me and I had a great time helping out other pet customers in need."
good,"the job is good because youre with dogs all day, and if youre working there you must love animals. as a bather, i help out the groomers a lot and some of them tend to think they are ""better"" than the bathers and treat them poorly. other than that the job is great. it would be better if it paid more than minimum wage though"
good,"Petsmart was a very fun place to work short term. I really enjoyed what I did there and my coworkers. The managers at my specific store were less then amazing at some points in my career, but overall I left because I couldn't gain anything more from the company."
good,Working in retail is not fun but this job is nice since you work with animals. Definitely a fast paced environment for the most part and opened most days of the year .
good,Learnt a lot of real time work at Petsmart. The campus was very cool and if you have a pet you can bring it to work. They have pet parks and day care centers for employees
good,There are very little opportunities for advancement thus pay is poor. Customers are friendly and coworkers are interesting. Laid back environment but not worth making a career there.
good,"I had an enjoyable time while I was employed at Petsmart, the people were always, willing to help and welcoming. I worked there for two years and partial in the grooming salon to bathe dogs, all in all it was fun."
good,Fast-paced work in an animal friendly environment.  Typical day as a stocker would include rotating between what merchandise would be stocked and which planograms would be set.
good,"The previous ownership was great. They cared about the employees and animals.  Rotating weekends off, store managers only one weekend a month, no nights."
good,"Through the time that I had spent there working for Buster's Friends, there was never any sort of disagreement with management as it was a volunteer organization."
good,"I have a dog, 2 guinea pigs, and a mouse at home so naturally I fit right in to the atmosphere. I love animals and I'm that one crazy employee that talks to the pets before the people. The work load can be stressful when the store is busy because often times I can get things done pretty quickly."
good,Great company to work for. If you like working in a distribution center then PetSmart is the place to work. It's a physical job but not a hard job at all.
good,Good work environment and managers are pretty great most of the time.  The best part of the job is the animals that come through.  Customers tend to be nice and the work is sometimes fast-paced but there is a strong teamwork environment so you're never alone if you're struggling.
good,"Understaffed mornings are the norm. Don't expect to leave your area much, even to get your break, because there is no one to cover you. Most pet parents are great, watch out for the obviously over the top ones, because management wont rescue you from crazy, irate, or downright abusive guests."
good,"It is a fast paced job, there's always something to do but interacting with the animals made it worth it. I was crossed trained in everything so my hours fluctuated, there were some short shifts as well as long shifts but over all had fun."
good,"When working in pet care, you are obviously going to be expected to do a lot of cleaning.  For about the first three hours of the day,  that is all you do.  Each day of the week, you cleaned a different set of animals cages.  I didn't feel like the rotation in employees who came in early (who had to clean) vs. the ones who came in later was fair, but thats life."
good,The petsmart company as a whole puts alot on their employees.  Managers and Staff alike.  High up beyond the Store Manager does not listen to their employees very well.
good,Very fun working with the pets. Management was ok. I received consistent hours. Coworkers were fun though they had already been working with each other for awhile so you could feel a little left out sometimes.
good,"Easy work just as any other retail job, but it's better than others because you get to be with animals every day. I've seen a goat, a pig, & a bunny brought into the store, all by nice loving pet parents. The staff really cares i love the job because all the animals help you forget that your working."
good,"This was my second job and I absolutely love it. Working with the animals is definitely my favorite part but it can be stressful at times when the store is extremely busy and many people need help.  If you wanna work here remember that this is a retail store above everything else. Customer service is extremely important to this company. I started as a cashier and working my way over to pet care. Being a cashier is incredibly easy but their registers are old and I think the system really needs to be updated, especially with the amount of fraud that it doesn't detect. In my store, the animals were always treated fairly, no matter what PETA or whatever group says. My coworkers and I are all passionate about the well being of the pets we sell, and it definitely shows in our customer service. Thankfully we're allowed to deny certain animals to people who we feel wouldn't take care of them. As far as the retail part goes, they definitely push you to sell puppy guides, training classes, and get people's emails at the register. It can be annoying depending on who your managers are and how much they wanna push you to sell. I think the thing I hate most about the company is how they don't really hire managers from within your store. I feel it's incredibly hard to work your way up in this company. The pay also sucks. I started 2 years ago at 9/hr and I'm at 9.44 right now. The only benefits I get is paid time off that slowly adds up by the minute. The employee discount is 15%."
good,Working at PetSmart was fun and i enjoyed it just because i am a pet owner. It helped me learn certain things about animals that i would need in the future as a pet owner.
good,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart a lot I learned a lot about the animals that I did not know before and how to take care of all different species. Nice experience, poor management."
good,"Really good place to work b.   People are expected to do too much. They are expected to sell animals on the floor, do register backup, take care of any customer that needs it stock shelves scrub fish tanks everyday, take care of a whole room full of sick animals, and carry a phone around it answer it.its a little much people employees are friendly and the managers are great."
good,"I've had this job for two years now and it has been great having it on the side while going to school. They have always been great about being flexible with hours and for my purposes the job pays well. My job is essentially to take care of and play with dogs, so there's no complaints there. All my coworkers have been enjoyable to work with and overall my experience at PetsMart has been very positive."
good,"I was only here a year, but during that time I had a blast. I met many people who I am still friends with today. "
good,"Great company that really strives for a good relationship with customers and also employees at the establishment. Payment could be higher for amount of work one does. However, is a very enjoyable job"
good,"PetSmart is a good solid company to work for, If you aren't afraid of hard work  The management is fair in their dealings with the employees. What you see is what you get."
good,"PetSmart can be a fun place, to learn more about the animals and products in store. It also depends on your team. It can get busy at times and can be slow at times as well. I would normally be running back and forth from the cashier to pet care a lot because we were short staffed for a while and I was the only pet care associate scheduled during my shift."
good,I had fun while working here while studying for my future career. The work was heavy when it got busy or when it was receiving day for animals or inventory but overall a great atmosphere. All the managers are as accommodating as can be for college students but do keep in mind you need to afford gas and try to give you decent hours. They had a fun and inclusive way of making their staff feel more like team members than workers.
good,"The pets hotel was fast-paced; unless there were a good amount of employees (like transitioning between shifts) there was always something to be done. If you do not know dogs or fear dogs., do not try the pet hotel."
good,•  A typical day at work was enjoyable and fast going.
good,"I wouldn't go any further than a part time position. I am an animal lover and I think thats the sole reason as to why I'm still there, besides making extra money. It's not that great, but I guess its what you make of It."
good,Work is pretty straight forward. It is a good place if you are willing to come in and get to work. If seeking advancement this is not the place for you.
good,Loved the job and all the animals I got to encounter on a daily basis. Really built connections with other employees and grew to love the animals taken care of.
good,Persmart is a great job to start it especially if you love animals when I first started there I wasn’t really a animal lover but I started to love them they are way better then working with humans at times!
good,everymorning there is a morning hundle. being a cashier you get slammed all the time for email captures. they are understanding of personal situations.
good,It was a great experience other than a lack of training and poor management as far as my store lead. It is definitely a great company with great morals
good,"It is a fun environment to work in, but certain members of the management team took away from that experience. I would recommend working there as an entry-level associate, but advancement into management level positions seem rare."
good,"Overall, I had a good experience in my four years at petsmart. Sometimes there are horrible customers, but that is in any retail job. Make sure you have a good manager. They can make or break a company."
good,"Very fun environment to work in if you like pets of almost any kind. Great place to learn tricks, techniques, and overall knowledge about raising and helping animals. Friendly atmosphere with an equally friendly customer base."
good,Hours are usually early in the morning. Must be ahead of schedule to be able to succeed this position. Not waste a single minute and hire the right help.
good,"This job was never just playing with dogs, or bubbles and puppies.  It is hard manual labor, including custodial duties and tool maintenance, as well as reception and customer service.  This is a multifaceted, fast paced job, and for this company there is a demand for your performance in numbers and sales.  This grooming department also boasts the values of transparency and personal accountability, as well as high safety standards and a low tolerance for safety incidents.  My canine customers, regular request clients, and team members make this job worth it."
good,"Interesting work, a company that promotes from within, growth opportunities for entry-level employees, nice coworkers, good wellness and health insurance benefits, convenient location."
good,"A typical day at work involved answering the phones, booking appointments for guests, dealing with inquiries/complaints and completing any given task. Management at my store has been friendly and understanding. The hardest part of my job is dealing with dogs that do not enjoy being groomed. When this happens, i have to be very cautious in order to ensure the safety of myself and the pet. However, working with animals is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"It's a fun place to work if you like animals and can relate to people with pets, of all kinds. If you are a cashier, there is a lot of pressure put on you for getting donations, getting people's email address, and getting people signed up for PetPerks! At my store if one person has a group of customers that doesn't want PetPerks or does not want to give you their email, that one cashier brings down the score for the whole store. It doesn't make you feel very good and really isn't fair. You can't control all the customers! They will work with you on scheduling. I really need full time and took the job at part time thinking it would give me an opportunity for advancement. It hasn't! And after talking to the other employees, it probably won't be much offered. The last few months I have gotten 26-28 hours a week, this week I was scheduled 13 hours! All in all, it's a relaxed and fun environment. I personally like to stay really busy all the time but at my store, if your a cashier, they expect you to just stand at the register and do nothing if there are no customers!"
good,Working in the hotel is great if you're a dog person. The hotel can be stressful but usually is fun and never boring. There is always something to do which makes the day go by fast.
good,"This was a fun job to have.  Employees work together and management was fair and honest.  They pay is pretty poor and don't expect to find a full time job here, but a good part time job."
good,A great place to work. Unfortunately I had to quit after 2 weeks due to overwhelming morning sickness. The manager was great. Be ready to stand for long periods of time when learning the register.
good,Petsmart is a nice place to learn and grow. I enjoy working with my co workers. The dogs are very fun to play with at times. Very educational on animals.
good,"A typical day included cleaning aquariums and habitats, feeding and watering the animals, caring for any sick animals and giving medications if needed, cash register sales, cleaning up messes, talking with customers and informing them about different animals needs and care. I learned a lot about the animals in the store and how to care for them. Management was alright, i was laid off because of money im assuming. I was hired as seasonal and they liked me and kept me for a while but then laid me off. Which was rather annoying since they ended up later firing two employees for stealing and I could have still had a job. Oh well. I would say the hardest part of the job was picking up chinchillas (haha). The job was really fun all around, I loved seeing the animals and giving out milkbones at the register."
good,"work on your duties the moment you start working. help out customers with their pets. I learned a lot about different breeds of animals. learned a lot about different brands of food for certain breed. management were ok, but not on point when it comes to raises. the work culture is friendly and relaxing. the hardest day at work was not to be able to find what product a customer ask for, or seeing a sick animal. a good day at work is when the pet parent is happy when helped with and a happy pet and also accomplished on your duties."
good,"Overall it was a fun place to work, especially if you love animals. Corporate has made it so that each store is severely understaffed though and this made it very stressful for every associate."
good,"If you are an animal lover, pet smart creates multiple oppurtunitys for employment beyond cashier. Veterinarian experience, shelters for adoptions and care for multiple species"
good,"Working with dogs has been an incredibly rewarding, but challenging experience. The diversity of the species allowed me to learn many things about the breed. As all living things do, dogs go to the bathroom, which sometimes left me leaving work smelling a bit worse than I wanted. The direct management in the PetsHotel I worked for seemed to play favorites, which left me feeling left out and under-appreciated."
good,"Take care of animals, educate people how to take care of pets, cashier responsibilities , customer service , money handling, stocking and closing procedures"
good,I worked at Petsmart to get future career skills and training. I am in school for veterinarian medicine. The only reason I did not like this job was because of a bad employee who ruined the workplace for more than just me.
good,lots of responsibility with pet care and groomers. Can be stressful with having to care for animals that come in sick and you are responsible for them
good,"It was okay, while the job was a fast-paced shift with reasonable hours, it was not for me. It would definitely be acceptable for someone else, though, as you get to work with animals."
good,"Petsmart is typical retail.  However, whatever job they hire for you remain in.  They will train you for a job and have training throughout year, but they are more interested in sales than anything else."
good,I loved working at petsmart. Coworkers were the best and helpful but the management at 1299 in springfield sucks. Nice to your face and nothing but terrible things to say behind your back. Quick to agree with client over employees in negative situation and will give away free things before actually resolving problem.
good,"The team of groomers got along well.  The pay is not bad. Commission every dog groomed you get 50%.  No real raised, though. Overall this company is good to work."
good,"Not for the faint of heart, it is a demanding , fast paced, detail oriented position. Time management & strong work ethic a MUST. Working with the animals & building a bond with the owners is the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Super fun place to work, lots of good people, managers are rude, unwilling to work with employees, pet care specialists are super underpaid for what they do, and they will switch your job on you if they don't feel like hiring."
good,For pet lovers a fun place to work. A good first job for high schoolers wanting to explore the world of retail. You learn a variety of pets products and become knowledgeable to help other pet parents.
good,Enjoy working with all different types of Dog. You learn to have patience with the different dogs behavior and gratitude from pet parents. At the end of the day you feel accomplished and proud of the work you have done.
good,Great job opportunity for anyone who loves pets of any kind. Building relationships with pet parents is the most enjoyable aspect of working at PetSmart.
good,fun and out going. the hardest part about working there was not many people on the floor when it got busy. I learned to have fun and show up on time. the best part about working there was dealing with animals.
good,"A typical day was getting to play with dogs and walk them."
good,We always got the work done and the teamwork was great. It was a great environment and a very clean warehouse. I learned how to manage my time wisely with getting work done.
good,"Working with the animals was great. Management, not so much. Had a great department manager, but lazy store manager. Most of my co-workers were fantastic, but like anywhere else you get bad ones."
good,A really great part time job. Very flexible with my college schedule. Not good for long term though. Very hard to get enough hours to make a decent amount of money. Easy second job or part time though.
good,"Great place to meet new people, and pets! Having previous customer service experiance is a MUST! Best part of the job is being able to interact with furry friends all day!"
good,"PetSmart employees at the location I worked were full of drama. They're cut throat and catty with one another. Drama is like wild fire and management fails to snuff it out, and some managers get involved in the drama. "
good,"OK place to work, very similar to tall other retail jobs. More concern is placed on safety of animal rightfully so. So more accountability is place on employees."
good,Relaxed environment.  Great place to start and move up.  Hours are flexible and they will work around school schedule or additional jobs.  Training is fast and easy.
good,"I liked my job, and ""most"" of the people I worked with, some managers had that I'm higher than you so I'm smarter attitude but most ended up moving up and leaving. Good for a younger person in school who doesn't need very much hours, very strict on not going over time, they don't want to give you too many hours so they don't have to give you benifits."
good,When I was working there a lot of favoritism was going on and you only got good hrs if you kissed someones butt so if you are willing to kiss someones butt then be all means
good,"The management team and co-workers are great people to work with.  The work can be stressful or boring at times, but overall it's a great place to work.  The pay could be better, but it's great for people looking for a part-time job while they are going to school."
good,Fun place to work. Employees were usually upbeat and enjoyable. Managers helped with any questions employees had. The only downfall was the cut back of hours I had
good,I enjoyed working with this company. I gained a wealth of knowledge that was able to help me in the future when I finally got my own pet. It's a great pet store
good,I enjoyed working with the animals. Fellow coworkers were knowledgeable with the nature of the work. Worked hard to meet the customer's needs. Enjoyed meeting the pets.
good,I learned to love animals unconditionally and how important it is to treat them as family. Also learned to deal with all kinds of different types of people.
good,"Management at the time of my position was pretty good, except that they did discriminate against older people, even though they say they didn't. I really loved working here because of being with the animals since I love animals so much. The hours really stunck but other then that it was a really nice place."
good,working at petsmart is very laid back. great people work at petsmart and all associates are very knowledgeable and caring for any and all animals that walk through our doors
good,Learned that Petsmart has good opportunities in all positions and management works with everyone to improve on good customer service. Also continued learning in all areas of the company by having videos to improve on service.
good,Loved working around so many pets and nice people. Management isn't quite there but it's a good place to work if you have that passion for animals and helping.
good,"Petsmart is a good place to work for, the managers there actually care about you and will do whatever they can to help you.  There is always something to do or someone needing help so you day flies by."
good,"This job really helped teaching it's employees patience. It was also really educational. A typical work day would be working wherever you were assigned. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help make a pet parent's life a little easier. The hardest part of the job was that management was a little young so they tended to gossip about the employees and it was really uncomfortable. However, the overall experience was pretty good. I have learned things about this place that have made me a better pet parent."
good,Had a great time here and really enjoyed the environment and staff.They were nice and everybody got along and did what was needed to be done.Workplace stayed clean and everybody had good attitudes.
good,"Being a bather at Pet Smart is hard work and definitely takes time to learn, but can be rewarding. Cashiering can be boring when its slow, but every job has its down falls."
good,I enjoyed working here a lot. I loved the animals and interactions. Management isn't very good and not much room to advance unless u know someone. Pretty decent though
good,Job was a good one to get started in the work world. Only downside is that they would get onto you for things without your control. Really enjoyed working with animals but people were the downside.
good,"It was still a public company when I worked for it. Amazing growth curve from 400 stores to 1000 when I left. My position required almost 90% travel, so living out of a hotel and an airplane was not great. Great headquarters, and pet ownership is only going to grow. The culture and leadership team really walk the talk and love pets."
good,"Very fun place to work and a great starter job. Typical retail experience with customers but often times you meet wonderful people and you get to snuggle pets on good days. To make the best of your time at Petsmart get cross trained in everything- grooming, pet training, cashier, pet care, and stocking. You learn many things about animal care while there and is a great stepping stone into the animal care industry."
good,good place to work can be stressful. get to see a lot of animals and learn a lot about products. for me advancement was hard hired a lot of managers from outside the company instead of promoting within
good,"I absolutely loved working with the animals and learned a great deal from some members of staff."
good,PetSmart is a really good place to work. They are flexible with the schedule and the coworkers are really cool. The possibility of meeting all kinds of people is available.
good,I hated being a cashier there. I was the only one who had to work both weekend days out of all the cashiers and i had my hours cut when i tried to only work one weekend day too. I developed a very bad allergy to cats while working there and couldn't do the tasks n the cat area of the hotel and was scolded many times for it even though it wasn't my fault.
good,"Top company in the Pet Care industry, great selection of products and services. Great culture of pet care needs and supplies. Great people to work with"
good,For this being a pet time job it wasn't bad. Store manager likes to play favoritism sometimes. But if you like animals it's a great place to work as a part time job.
good,Comfortable work environment. Company makes sure employees are well trained in their respective departments. Employees are willing to go above and beyond in customer service.
good,"Managers are nice, Cashiering gets boring over time, many different job options to choose from, easy with the breaks, friendly co-workers, nice to see dogs everyday"
good,"Working part time for Petsmart was a fun experience, once I became a manager, however, the tables turned. In my specific position, I was responsible for all manager calls/customer service on the sales floor, money orders, loan paybacks, drop everything assistance in every department, as well as making sure every other managers duties were completed before I left for the day. The stress and responsibility that I was dealing with was not compensated fairly in the slightest and there was no way around that, other than promotion/transfers that were unavailable. I would not recommend the position to anyone."
good,"I had an amazing 6 years at PetSmart, It was a great start to my professional and personal growth within the job industry. Being able to work with a very flexible company was what I need while finishing school."
good,its a great place to work. friendly employees learned lots about animals and the products needed to make sure they are healthy and well taken care of.
good,"Fun workplace, everyone is so nice, you will make friends very quickly. Pay is very good, not too stressful and they will give you the hours if you are in need of more hours."
good,PetSmart is a great first job and allows you to grow as an employee overtime. The corporate structure is a little suffocating at times but it is a fine company.
good,"Worked with great associates and gained good relationships with the customers. I learned communication skills and time management skills. The computer system was easy to learn plus the routine was easy to get down. The hardest part of the job was a poor change in management. There wasn't a good transition. Overall, an enjoyable job for a student."
good,the management could use a little work but the tasks are enjoyable and the coworkers become your greatest friends! definitely a good first job! definitely be prepared to work and be quick and efficient in what you do every shift.
good,"I really enjoy my day when I work at PetSmart. I work in a PetHotel and you really get to know each and every dog that comes through the facility. It can be stressful, knowing that their care and well-being in on your shoulders, but there is excellent team to support you that is also focused on the pet's health and happiness."
good,Great company to work for. Great work enviroment. Team leaders were friendly and helpful. Fast paced heavy lifting work. Learned alot of skills and work ethic here.
good,"I liked that after sometime of being a bather you get promoted to become a pet stylist, the petsmart academy was amazing im glad i learned how to groom there!"
good,"as long as the management is good the workplace is great. customers are friendly (usually) and workload is not asking too much. "
good,"I enjoyed working there, they would just need to work more like a team when closing the salon at night instead of relying on one person to do it all. Same with walk-in nail trims. "
good,Working in the grooming salon at PetSmart is nice because we're like a little family in the back. All of us have been back there for years and we've really connected. We have each other's backs when it's needed and you can count on your co-workers. I love working with pets all day bit it can be extremely stressful when a dog is difficult. If any incidents happen with cutting or hurting a dog it's heart breaking.
good,"PetSmart was an enjoyable place to work. With the ability to work closely with animals, I found that it was a character building experience. However, the environment between staff and even management was rather toxic."
good,"I worked full time as a shift manager in the Pets Hotel for six years. It was a great opportunity, and I learned a lot about my management style, and I grew to love the company while I was going to school for management."
good,"Having worked as a cashier, I was able to meet many customers and their delightful pets. The management was very kind and fair to me."
good,"You have the opportunity to work with animals in any avenue, whether it's with mostly dogs and cats through the PetsHotel, or with reptiles, fish, and birds, to name a few. Your schedule can be very flexible, but can change a lot based on the needs for that week."
good,PetSmart goes above and beyond to ensure each employee receives the training and knowledge necessary for each position. Employee benefits and programs/promotions are great.
good,"This is a great place to work as a part time employee or someone who loves dogs.  The management is amazing, but has the same problems every retail place does.  It's a lot of talking to customers, which is usually great, but when it's bad, it's bad.  It's quite a bit of physical labor, a lot of standing no matter what.  There are quite a lot of opportunities to advance and succeed though."
good,"Great people."
good,Checked in patients.  Helped Veterinarian.  Pulled blood for testing. Ran test.  Restrained patients.  Cleaned kennels.  Stocked inventory.  Checked in inventory. Dentals. Helped in surgeries.  Pulled vaccines and medications. Cleaned and sanitized clinic and exam rooms.
good,"My time with Petsmart was good, I enjoyed my time there and the employees were all really easy going and helpful. The only thing I didn't like about the company was the lack of available hours."
good,A fun place to work if you like animals. The atmosphere changes greatly from store to store dependent on the store manager. I was hired as a pet trainer but often filled in as cashier or on the floor as a sales associate.
good,"Petsmart was a great job for those learning the world of retail. Although management turnover was high, the culture of the store and other staff made it enjoyable. They were very passionate about their customers and pets. They were very flexible with availability changes and time off."
good,"PetSmart was a fun place to work, everyone was friendly and the environment was overall great. The pet owners could by on the annoying side sometimes but that was the only downfall at my location."
good,"Co workers are easy to get along with and management is very easy to talk to and learn from."
good,"The company is great. Morehead City, NC store is easy going, high school drama, average pay, typically only hire females. Would probably not recommend."
good,"Petsmart makes for a great high school job, but my manager was not the best person that I have worked for, by far. You would figure that a place with such a high turnover rate would be a little more attentive towards management, but that was not the case. I worked there for 2 years and saw little to no change."
good,I worked in the grooming salon as a bather. I enjoyed my job and all the new things I learned about pet products. Work was fun.
good,Productive environment to work in. Good management and very engaging staff. Lots of team building activities for staff and upper management.
good,"Typical day at PetSmart can go smoothly if all employees show up. There is no accountability for missing work, calling out repetitively and managers are blamed for work that doesn't get even if they never see nor talk to there employees because of schedules may be different. However I enjoyed working there with the employees who grew on me and certain managers."
good,This job was so much fun! I took care of dogs all day and made them look/feel better every time they left the salon. Management is not so great and we don't really get benefits either. I'd recommend this job to anyone from 18-21 it's fun but it's also very fast paced if you work at popular location.
good,"People just hand you puppies, it's great. I really enjoy it but it isn't a job I would see a career in. The pay is terrible and the hours are poor but that's really the only bad thing about the job."
good,"Employees are very friendly and easy to get along with. If you like working with pets and aren't afraid to get your hands a little dirty, this is the workplace for you."
good,Enjoyable place to work. You get to educate yourself and others about animals. Always something new to learn and teach. Cleaning cages is the only downfall but its not that bad.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at PetSmart was the customers and the pets they brought into the store with them. I liked knowing that with whatever problems they needed help with, I was able to provide them with the correct solution."
good,"I worked in the grooming area, first as a dog bather then a dog groomer. The work was very enjoyable and quick paced. I became good at what I did and had many clients that would only bring their pets to me. Management was pretty good but our store did have a few serious mishaps that we were able to overcome. My coworkers were great to work with and I miss many of them to this day. We worked together to make a great team that was able to work through many hurdles. For me the hardest part of the job was the state some of these pets came in and the owners were clueless about how it actually effected the pet. I would explain how painful the matted hair was to the pet and what we needed to do to make their pet happier. It always made me happy when the formerly dirty pet would prance around and show off their new haircut. I loved my job at PetSmart and would happily work there again if there was one near me."
good,"Great place for a partime job when you only need a few hours, but to live off of a paycheck from them isn't worth it. They'd only give me 20hrs and I need more to live and pay bills, short shifts, not worth taking when you live an hour or more away. "
good,"cashier is easy. dog training is fun. Pet care is very difficult but fun. never enough time or people to get things done. company has unrealistic expectations!!!! had a manager do my job once and he just said keep up the good work and ran that it was one of the hardest things he'd ever done, that he wouldn't complain about time again. managers can be awesome and inspiring. others are so bad they are fired. really just depends on what you get to tell you what your experience will be like. if you are looking to move up in the company starting from the bottom, it is very unlikely that will happen. they hire outside for upper positions."
good,The animals are amazing to work with.  There is no better feeling than watching a dis-guarded animal find a new home full of Love.  It is an enjoyable place to work.
good,This job was a great experience and taught me a lot about communication and customer assistance.  It has been a pleasure to work with my co-workers and managers.
good,"PetSmart has been a learning experience where I've expanded my knowledge on more than just different species of reptiles and other small animals. I've learned quite a bit of what to do, and what not to do as a manager from the examples here. Typically my day was pleasant, interacting with customers and co-workers. But by the end of the day often my managers would be unprepared for the end of the shift, often forcing us to stay an hour after closing. The hardest part of the day was usually closing. The most enjoyable part was typically customer relations and pet care."
good,"petsmart was a great place to work, friendly co-workers, enjoyable work experience, and there was always a dog around to pet! great management in every department."
good,"You always have fun working with the animals, they have personalities all of their own. I worked with a great staff however my manager was a bit unpleasant to work with. Had unrealistic expectations which made it hard to advance. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the large dogs in doggy day camp. The most enjoyable part was working with the animals and the staff."
good,"I enjoy working with the pets and co-workers."
good,"Typical part-time job, but had great coworkers. Learned a lot and had opportunities to switch between locations when working at school and home over breaks."
good,"·	Working in Petcare taking care of animals, stocking the floor, customer assistance, working in grooming bathing dogs with different services and nail grindings, teaching puppy and beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes."
good,"This job is ideal for someone wanting part-time work.  There is no availability for full time so if you are needing benefits, this is not the job for you."
good,Over all I enjoyed most of my time at pet smart the few things that bothered me where that copperate members can just come in and demote even managers just because they have tattoos not because of their work ethic. I have no tattoos currently so it is not myself i speak of. I have many friendly wonderful hardworking managers who got demoted right infront of me just because they had visible tattoos. So all in all the stores are fine the upper level management really needs a rework in morals.
good,"Various duties throughout your shift. Usually need to work alone, and in case two graveyard shifts are scheduled, the duties list increases."
good,"During my time at Petsmart, I have come to realize that there are other ways to help owners and their pets. Over this time period, I was able to learn what products could become beneficial to the pet. I was able to help them while learning the other side of animals; their owners.  Here I figured how to be  more compassionate of the owners, not just the pets."
good,"I've broaden my customer service skills dealing with the wide variety of customers that frequent this particular PetSmart. I also learned how to both open and close a store (cleaning, paperwork, and registers)."
good,easy to move up fun environment generally nice people. management cares and is knowledgeable. really customer orientated
good,Petsmart was a high energy environment. The company promotes care and consideration of pets and the people that love pets. Managers were required working knowledge of all aspects of store operation.
good,"Supervised the day to day operations of the pet hotel. Cared for both dogs and cats staying at the hotel, including feeding, exercising and cleaning them."
good,pet smart has been there for me and helped me when i needed it. they were very understanding and patient with my transformation from working in a private company to a corporation company as a groomer. i will miss working for them.
good,"It was a nice place to work. you get to deal with dogs all day long, but behind closed doors that's when things get less glam. You are wet majority of the day from bathing all the dogs, you have to brush teeth, clip nails, blow dry them, brush and fluff them, make them smell pretty and put a bow on the girls and bandana if its a boy. Not to bad for a days work till a dog gets so nervous they have explosive diarrhea in the kennel, or you get bit from trying to clip nails or scratched. The customer where harder to deal with than the dogs. If the dog was to aggressive you had to tell the owner they weren't allowed back. They would make a huge seen about how their dog would never make the five inch gash on my face. But if you love dogs and don't mind all aspects that come with the job its a good place to be."
good,I love working with the animals. The pet parents/co-workers are also a plus. I have no complaints about this job. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves animals.
good,I already typed this review three times so Im not exactly sure of what else to say so Ill just keep typing until it lets me go on with the rest of this process
good,It is a good job for a high school student who is starting their first job. It is a good place to learn the basics and go on to get a better job after that. Work with a lot of animals and interact with many pet parents so it is important to be knowledgeable.
good,PetSmart is a great place to work. I love seeing all the dogs and other pets come in the store because it always puts a smile on my face.
good,"This is actually an interesting and fun place to work.  There's a lot to learn about different pets, but after you get the basics down it is immensely rewarding to help pet parents learn to care for their new pets.  Management has been going through a lot of changes recently, so that's why it's rated so low.  The managers are all fine to work with, but how quickly they changed got a bit overwhelming.  The hardest part of the job is the beginning when you're learning, but after that it's a lot of fun."
good,"care for livestock in store"
good,Fast paced work environment. I learned better time management and developed customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was to bather the given amount of pets in such little time.
good,Provided friendly services to customers and helped them find product's. I also informed them on our services that we provide and answered their questions and concerns.
good,The only reason i left is because i needed full time. It was my favorite job working with animals and people. My coworkers where amazing people as well as my mangers.
good,I worked along side some great people and even had some great managers that worked with you and tried their best to work out a fair schedule.
good,I enjoy working with animals. PetSmart has allowed me to enjoy what I love while providing a small income. The hardest part of the job is losing an animal. The most enjoyable part is the everyday interaction.
good,"This was a great first job. I learned many things because I worked in many different areas including, a cashier position, floor associate, and pet care."
good,it was cool. I helped on adoption days. we took a few of the dogs from the rescue and brought them in and tried to get them happy homes.
good,great place to work  hard working staff amazing customer service goals attainable sales and services goals upper management very involved for help
good,Atmosphere varied per location and management team.  Company changes processes too much causing chaos within the store. Upper management is displaced from what goes on within the retail store.
good,Customer service in number one and each associate will go over and above to make sure each customer finds what they came for.
good,"Its a lot of fun to be in the Petshotel when you play with the dogs and such. But actual care of the animals is a lot of work. Feed, water, and clean up, as well as paid private one on one time can get a little tedious. Working in the grooming salon was a bit better, as I work personally with the dogs rather than a kennel full of them. Clients can be a little unsure of what they want and miscommunication happens a lot resulting in upset customers. For the most part it was enjoyable."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at PetSmart! The managers were all great, and I really liked all my coworkers. My favorite part of the job was helping customers and handling the animals."
good,Working at PetSmart is fun and there is a lot that you learn on the job due to the interaction with customers. You are not only helping the customers when they come in to the store but you are also helping their pets. Yes retail may not seem very fun however I can assure you that PetSmart is unlike any other pet store you have ever been to.
good,"I'm so thankful I was able to be apart of the PetSmart team. They took a chance on me and paid for my grooming academy tuition  and aloud me to not only grow as a great creative Pet stylist & Employee but as professional as well. This work place taught me everything I know about providing excellent customer service, being able to communicate in a professional manner, appointment scheduling, answering telephones, being a team player, work in a fast paced environment, multi-tasking, being able to take criticism, and the ability to be able to roll with the punches and problem solve."
good,"No support from the store manager, Store manager seams like they don't care what goes on in the store. This is a tough job to do inside of petsmart, you need to have the support and team players to make this work well."
good,It was a fun workplace. Lots of interesting conversations and great customers. We were able to love on all kinds of animals and that was the best part of the job. I loved being able to teach people new things as I learned to grow with the company and know all the products. Really great place to work if looking for something on the side of schooling.
good,"great I guess, but not a job I would try to support myself off of considering everyone that works here is part time. I rather have a job that's useful and I can use my skills that I've gained over the years than work with dogs."
good,"Since the sell of the company, things seem to be headed in the wrong direction.  Lots of jobs lost, less employees with more workload."
good,"Can be a fun place to work. the company has gone through some structural changes, which can ultimately be good for the company to grow, however there is always a transition period where the associate are unsettled about changes."
good,Fun work environment with supportive management. If you are interested in moving up in the company management will help you. Everyone seems to work together as a team and its a fairly pretty relaxed fun setting.
good,PetSmart provides great training and leadership development. Leaders are truly passionate about pets. Foster cross-pollination in the way of moving to allowing associates to move across departments to learn and grow professionally.
good,"Supportive management with positive direction."
good,"Over all the job was well structured, expectations made clear, and the possibility of advancement was present. It was a job I enjoyed greatly, but as time went on my financial needs were greater then the job was able or willing to provide and so I broke with them and sought a career in the independent sector."
good,"The company does well with informing employees about new products that will be carried in the stores, they also encourage everyone to do their best with some rewards when certain goals are accomplished."
good,"I loved working with the animals, I am an animal lover. I liked closing the store and counting everyone's register at the end of the night. My co-workers were very easy to get along. I left because I needed full-time employment making more money."
good,Company started caring less of their employees and more about money when they wanted to sell in 2014. It made it very difficult to continue working for the company I had been with for almost 14 years.
good,I enjoy working at PetSmart because every day is new and different. Pet Parents come in that need a harness because their puppy grew out of it or a pet parent needs crickets for their foot long Bearded Dragon. The possibilities are endless. I especially love Adoption Saturday because you get to help new pet parents find the things they will need for the new member of their family and you create a meaningful connection.
good,"Overall, PetSmart was a great experience, but since the company has been bought out, the changes do not all seem for the best."
good,Management is awesome and working with animals all day is great. Co-workers are always nice and helpful. I've learned so much about the service industry and how to properly take care of animals.
good,It was a nice place to work and all my coworkers were pretty nice. it was an enjoyable job because all work was done before the store opened and we just worked/stocked the store shelves till the space was filled.
good,"Pretty chill place. Co workers are great, animals are the best. Managers were always on point. Hardest part of the job was watching pet parents leave the vet crying or pet parents returning an item because their pet recently passed away."
good,"-  Determined current operational cost of 59.6 million USD per year at the International Distribution Center (IDC) "
good,Very good company to work for. Grooming Salon gets busy so its nice for your paycheck. Will love to work for them again. Co-workers were great.
good,"Fun, knowledgable groomers who will take time to work with you, clients are wonderful and excellent protocols. I really enjoyed my time there."
good,"Being a Pet Care Specialist was my first official job. It was very fast pace, always having something that needed to be done. This pace allowed for shifts to go by quickly, and kept me active because I was always doing multiple things. This job strengthened my skills of multi-tasking, communication with customers and coworkers, time management, and problem-solving."

good,"I enjoyed all of the tasks I performed during any given day, from helping a new pet parent find all of the right goodies, to leading obedience and training classes."
good,"The pay isn't good enough to keep agents here - many will move on to other companies within a few months. Good culture, but needs more competitive pay."
good,"working with animals, medically assist them, and cleaning to make a safe and clean environment. lifting and moving items up to 50 lbs."
good,"There are many perks to working with animals all day. You hear great stories and connect well with people. However, the biggest shortfall is the hours, or lack there of, from week to week and the inconsistency between weekly schedules."
good,"*Responsible for the safety and well being of all dogs/cats in my care"
good,PetSmart was a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff and our customers. Being able to educate our pet parents and staff to ensure that the pets in their care will be able to live a long and happy life. PetSmart provides products and services.
good,"Fast paced, busy work, with plenty of heavy lifting exercise. The most enjoyable part of the job was working overnights building plan-o-grams and working the freight. I learned to reintegrate canines back into my life after having been attacked by one previously to working at Petsmart. My management and leader skills were finely tuned in the two years with the company."
good,"It's a fun place to work where you are surrounded by all kinds of animals all day. They take their time to work with you until you understand what you are fully doing. Management is great and works with you the best they can with any issues you may have. Hardest part of the job is just having crazy hours. You don't really have ""set"" hours, they just kind of put you whenever they need you. You may work several morning shifts, then get thrown some nights shifts. I loved being able to play with the animals all day long and getting to help customers find new stuff for their little fur babies!"
good,"Always feels like a family. Open and close transactions at register, Open and close animal habitats,  Learned that you cant always please every singel human."

The atmosphere is very welcoming. We are one big family."
good,Awesome place to work at while in college. They worked around the schedule as much as they could.
good,"The Petshotel is, in my opinion, the best department to work in. I get to take care of pets like they're my own and I love getting to know the pet parents and pets alike. Working every holiday isn't ideal but I think the management is one of my least favorite aspects. They don't always seem to be completely organized in my store and do a good job of telling people that they're going to get a promotion and then give it to someone else to which has happened with several employees at my location."
good,"Meet with ecommerce to discuss priorities SKUs. Check on the off-site writing team that I manage. Check product room/ and check with photogrpahy to see if any new product has come in. The most enjoyable part of the job is - I basically shop, play and write. In that order. The most challenging is you most be awesome with time management and have creative thoughts. Thankfully, I'm good with both."
good,"I love my job. I love working with animals and being able to help them in anyway that i can. I've learned a lot over the past years I've been with Petsmart and I continue to learn everyday. Management is ok. Still new but they do their best. My co-workers are new to the company as well, but they learn more and more everyday. The hardest part of the job is handling a dog that does not like the whole process. Its not the getting it done part that's hard, I just want to make sure the dog has a safe and stress free visit. The best part of my job is meeting new dogs everyday. I love seeing new faces and new personalities come into the salon."
good,"Good learning situation, Rules were structured and safe. Job and duties were over burdened."

good,"A typical day at work, depends if there is new associates to train my job is to show them how to be successful at their new job. If there isnt new associates my job is to go in order fill and pick orders and drop them off at the correct locations. I have to learn to work on different PIT equipment. Management is very helpful and always around when needed. The hardest part of my job would be working 3 straight 12 hour shifts."
good,"•	Collected the requirements from Business people."
good,"Over all, Petsmart is a great place for a job . I love it there, But it is not the place for a full career nor a stable enough job to be able to pay bills and fend for ones self. This goes for all retail places, the hours/pay is not enough to live on and still keep up with bills."
good,came in to stock merchandise early in the morning before customers would come.
good,"♦Responsible for weekly dog training classes"
good,"The benefits are great, the pay is good, but the superiors have never worked in a store so it makes some policies unrealistic and not quite possible. I did learn a lot about different types of animals and how to be organized in a job because I made appointments in the salon."
good,I liked working with the animals and also baby sat some of the customer's pets. I liked working with all the employees and made lots of new friends. I made new friends with a lot of the customers as well. Overall most days were fun.

I learned that patience is very important in the workplace. You cant always please everyone 100%, but as long as you put 100% effort into trying, the customer will almost always come back. I loved my Salon Manager. She was always up-beat, and did her best to keep everyone happy. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays when the store is a zoo and your trying to get 10-15 dogs bathed on top of all the nail trims walking in. The most enjoyable and rewarding part was cleaning up a matted/flea infested stray that someone has taken in, and seeing the smile on the customers face when they come to pick the dog up."
good,"Check schedule to see what appointments you have and know the dogs name when they come in.  Client arrives, discuss what the pet parent wants, check in the dog.  Start the grooming process.  Make appointments for other clients.  I learned how to deal with customers, pleasant and unpleasant.  I learned that the customer is always right.  I learned time management.  The management care about their employees and make accommodations when there is a family emergency.  My co-workers and I are one big family.  We see each other out of work and get along really well.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly dogs.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working the animals every day and being around my co-workers."
good,i was a lot of fun with an amazing set of co workers and products
good,"I volunteered to take care of the cats they have out on display for adoption. I would clean out their cages and litter boxes, give them fresh food and water, and let them out to play for an hour or so. I was also in charge of keeping track of the cats behaviors and how the night went. I was also a go to, when a customer wanted to adopt a cat, to find what they were looking for and let the customer see the cats. I did not work with any co-workers."
good,taking care of animals; feeding and making sure habitat is perfect for their safety and health. Helping customers search for items and checking out customers while still acknowledging each individual customer that comes through the door.
good,I loved working at PetSmart because of all the animals that came through and generally i never had a bad customer because everyone was always so nice. I would not recommend this job to anyone that wants a steady paycheck because all the hours always fluctuated for different weeks but the pay check was weekly and that was really nice to have.
good,I had the opportunity to gain responsibility by taking care of the cats making sure they had fresh water and food and that they were being loved. The job was pretty easy.
good,Hard work at a very fast pace. lots of fun. lksdjfkajdhgsekrhgk
good,"PetSmart is a great learning experience, the company has taught me a lot about the corporate world and the business aspect of customer service. I love helping people, and I love seeing people actually appreciate the knowledge and experience I have."
good,"Petsmart was really fun, but there were downfalls with some of the management. My coworkers were fun, but there were some personal squabbles that cause our fantastic manager to quit, as well as the general store manager was replaced and it just turned into a downward spiral from there."
good,"At PetSmart our team continuously strived to perform better than the day before. Our performance did not just depend on meeting our sales numbers, but our ability to be good leaders. Our district focused on coaching our sales associates in order to help them reach their highest potential thereby creating a work environment that proved beneficial for the associates, managers and ultimately the pet parents. As an Operations Manager I was responsible to maintain the store's operations, including assisting all sales associates with issues or questions, store maintenance, and ordering store supplies, while staying within a budget. In addition, coordinate payroll for a staff of 35 to ensure that hours, commission, holiday, vacation and sick time were applied accordingly. "
good,"I liked working with the clients and the pets, I wish I could have continued to train."
good,I love working in a Team environment where I can manage young adults and develop them throughout their time at PetSmart. I loved working with the pets in an environment where customer service is critical to the success of our business!
good,"As an animal lover, I thoroughly enjoyed working for Petsmart. Since I was in school and had another job at the time of employment, they worked with me on scheduling and time needed off. My co-workers were of good nature and I loved being able to work with the customers in finding what best suited them and their pets."
good,"As a professional bather, I spent a lot of time with a variety of dogs which was very enjoyable. I love animals, especially dogs, so this being my first real job was amazing. I enjoyed going to work everyday and they also worked around my school schedule."
good,"I love working with the animals that would walk in and hear different customer stories about their pets. All my managers were fun and easy to get along with, however, they were still respected. Hardest part abut my job was not being able to bring every animal home. I learned pretty much everything there, learn about the care for every single animal we have at PetSmart."
good,"At Petsmart, every day was different.  I was trained to work in every department, but was signed on as a PetsHotel associate.  It was very rewarding work, to care for animals and to assist customers in the proper care and upkeep of their own.  The associates were all like a family, good and bad!  "
good,"Personal growth is encouraged.  I have been able to work in several management positions and have learned a great deal about the overall daily operations.  I am currently learning more about HR, including scheduling and employee development."
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers as well as management. I enjoyed taking care of the animals as well as the customers purchasing them.
good,Downloading price changes and changing prices on products.  Checking expiration on products in accordance with corporate dictates. Cashiering and assisting customers throughout the day.  I learned a great deal about the retail business.  The hardest part of the job is the lifting of heavy products.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with animals and people.
good,I loved being able to educate the public on how to properly care for their pets.
good,"PetSmart is great place to work if you love animals and enjoy teaching other people the knowledge you have learned with respect to all the different animals we sell in our store and some we don't. For the most part it is very ""teamwork"" oriented and fast paced, which keeps you on your toes. Overall, a great place to work if you are just getting started in the workplace."
good,"My work day was full of multitasking, working with dog, cats, a variety of customers, teamwork, answer calls, making and confirming appointment's, discussing the services and products."
good,The key to a great company is always found in the people that serve the customers!
good,"All of my co-workers are fun, friendly and hard working. There's plenty to learn from each department from the grooming salon all the way to the front end as a Cashier. The best part of the job is seeing new people everyday and the sweet pets that come through."
good,"I have a routine going into work. Do opening duties, look at the clients you have for the day, and prepare for those clients. I've learned a lot dealing with time efficiency and the tricks of the trade. Management is okay and my co-workers are helpful. This job isn't hard, it is mildly challenging to stay busy sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job is spending time with the dogs and seeing how happy the owner looks when they get there dog back."
good,I loved working with the store animals . it was a nice environment and nice people
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with animals. Something about a day with animals is very soothing to me.
good,"Variety of Animals, Great for people who like to walk around and people who are animal lovers and enjoy caring for animals and who enjoy helping customers. Beware of the cat room, some of the cats are a little too playful and like to scratch. Also watch out for the Russian Hamsters. They Bite!"

good,"Working here as a Pet Care Associate is very enjoyable!  I am certified to handle all animals.  Most of my managers are easy to work with, and I get along with most of my co-workers.  "
good,"I maintained all the pets within the store as well as gave medicine to pets who needed it. I also worked on the register and have handled cash, checks and credit cards. It is easy to work along side the other associates in the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping pet parents get everything they need to take care of their pets. The hardest part of my job is customizing all of the pet parents needs and solutions. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of helping customers, and taking care of the animals we hold in the store. I have learned many things about  animals such as fish, reptiles, birds, and small animals from my time here. The managers make our store feel like a family. All of my co-workers and managers work as a team rather than a hierarchy. The hardest part of the job was getting over my fear of snakes. With the help of my co-workers and managers, I managed to get past my fears and was able to conquer an important part of my job; taking care of the animals in the store, including the snakes. The most enjoyable part of working at PetSmart is seeing pets go to happy, loving homes."
good,"It is an okay place to work, if you want to make extra cash."
good,"Usually work either the morning shift 6am-12pm, sometimes later or the night shift 3pm-9:30pm. Typically food and water is checked for all the animals and their cages are cleaned. Once the animals are all accounted for and taken care of the inventory has to be stocked and all of the dates are checked. When working for PetSmart you learn about positive reinforcement with training; how to setup and maintain aquariums, reptile environments, bird houses, and small animals habitats; what foods are best for our pets, and how to fix a problem a pet parent is having. Co-workers are very friendly and willing to help with team lifts and assistance. The hardest part of my job is not being able to schedule family events since our schedule is posted on a weekly basis. I absolutely love working with animals so that is the most enjoyable aspect of the job. "
good,Can be an exhausting job being on your feet all day and you must be careful not to get bitten by animals but you have great co-workers and managers to help the day go by quickly. 
good,"The days were generally what you would expect them to be. Daily work was greet and check-in clients, groom dogs, close up shop and leave. Problems consisted of micromanagement and an overly conservative view (dark auburn red hair was not appropriate nor highlights in darker hair) though that was this particular store's policy. Direct supervisor had problems accepting others (unique people or in one glaring case, a homosexual) which made the work environment difficult. She also had a tendency to ""forget"" to order our necessities, including, but not limited to, shampoos (DOG GROOMING). Most enjoyable thing was a few of my co-workers. Hardest part was my direct supervisor (very demeaning woman), the store manager (he'll be retired by the end of this year though) and the assistant manager. The display manager was awesome though. "
good,Fun working with animals. Early morning stocking isn't too much fun. Great atmosphere.
good,"helped customers with all their pet care needs "
good,"I have been employed at PetSmart for the last two and half years, and while sometimes challenging, I have enjoyed my time there greatly. A typical day at work consists of assisting customers, restocking merchandise, and helping manage the cashiers. During my time there I have learned a lot such as; how to work well on a team, how to manage and show leadership, and improved my customer service skills."
good,"I learned a lot about different type of animals. A typical day was getting to work at 7 am cleaning the animal cages, feeding them then helping customers with their needs."
good,PetSmart is pretty fun to work for but at times can become very hectic and you may feel that your hard work will go unnoticed.
good,"This was a very friendly environment to work in. It was my first job and it offered many learning opportunities. They provided beneficial training whenever it came down to needing it, whether it was right at the beginning or because I was moving to a different department in the store. I liked this job and the people within the store that I worked for."
good,"Starting with feeding and cleaning up after animals in the morning and throughout the day. Administer any medications and check for signs of health. Next, start tank maintenance and cleaning procedures. Throughout the rest of day is customer service and maintaining the pet care department. Hardest part of job is lifting and cleaning heavy rocks for the fish tanks. The best part is seeing happy animals and providing information to help the customer take better care of their pet."
good,A typical day is one that is busy but exciting. Never the same thing day to day. I've learned there is just as much work as there is play in the Hotel. Management is very understanding with personal needs and co-workers are helpful and good with training.
good,Great place t work.
good,i loved my job there. the grooming manager was very lazy and moody though. she would make everyone else do her work for her which in turn would put everyone behind
good,"I have obtained many useful skills while working at PetSmart. I am able to interact with customers and their pets on a daily basis. I enjoy being able to help customers solve problems, listen to their concerns in order to provide suggestions and solutions for their individual needs."
good,Although I was usually working by myself the PetSmart employees always seemed cheerful and happy to be there.
good,"Each day was different, some good & some bad."
good,Grooming Salon with great clients. Great CoWorkers with good skills. Learned all about grooming dogs
good,Being able to work with animals & helping customers when needed.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and providing the best customer service as possible. Employees were friendly.
good,"I started working here at 16 (the age to apply now is 18). PetSmart is a great place to work as a student because they work around your schedule. The pay isn't amazing considering how huge the corporation is- but as a groomer the pay is a lot better (it's commission based). Though I have enjoyed the people I work with, the management is left to be desired. There are a few good managers that do their job, but most of the ones I've worked with get involved in the workplace drama. Overall I'm happy I had the opportunity to work here while supporting myself through school, but I do not see it as a career."
good,"-stock shelves, help with carry-outs"
good,"Petsmart was a place to help all the animals, I learned so much there from my management and from the employees and most of what I learned was personal achievments. The management was great, we all got along and they were always there if needed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with mean, irate customers that had no self control. The most enjoyable part was the customers as well, there is always that one customer who somehow makes your day better and puts a smile on your face/"
good,"I loved the people I worked with, the customers were great, hours were good. threw and threw I had a great experiance working at Petsmart."
good,If you are looking for job security PetSmart is a company to join.
good,I had an amazing time helping customers and learning about the animals
good,I absoultely loved working at petsmart. I got to work with sick animals and make them better. Also got to work with all the animals that came into the store everyday.
good,"A typical day at work was helping customer with the purchase of food, animals, and anything to help the customers with their pets."
good,Was great working for because am a pet lover and got to see pets everyday while helping pet owners
good,Great job for anyone who loves pets and helping others. Manager's are willing to work with you and are always available to help you if you're not sure about something.
good,"The best part of my day was having the opportunity to socialize with pets while being paid a salary for it. Petsmart is a great company to work for. The only downside is weekends off are not the usual weekends of a 9 to 5 business. Petsmart busiest days are the weekends so managers can have off Fri &Sat or Sun&Mon. Never the weekend as we know it. In time, you adapt to it. This is the very first company I worked for that started automatic replenishment for inventory. It took two years to get it accurate but now as a customer, I can see they have come a long way from being task oriented to service friendly. Petsmart pay is great but not a lot of advancement due to minimal management turnover. The company tends to keep people for a long time."
good,Worked with a knowledgable group of team members who help educate and encourage the improvements of animal health and well-being.
good,"Good company. I need to start my new career as a trainer rathyer than being stuck in cusomer services. No problems, just time for a change."
good,"A typical day at Pet Smart could be energetic yet fun or it could be dull and problematic. In which either case it was a good place to be. The co-workers make it a awesome place to work they are very caring and full of life, the diversity there makes it a very nice place to work. Management can be like any other management of a company some are strict and some are carefree but, I can say they are very caring people. One of the most enjoyable things about working at Petsmart is the pets and some clients. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irrational customers."
good,"During my work day I interact with many different types of customers, I like most everyone that I work with and we have fun while working together."
good,I learned different ways to work with co workers and what it's like opening a store.
good,"Great atmosphere in the grooming salon. I would love to go back and work with my previous co-workers, I miss them. It is under new managment now, not sure if itd be the same :/"
good,its a reward watching the pets get adopted.
good,I enjoy being among other people who truly loves animals. There are always interesting things going on in the store with a lot of customers and pets.
good,Everyone was very friendly and helped you out when you needed it
good,"Good benefits that are some what resonable, but very long hours and underaverage pay"
good,"Being a bather at Petsmart can sometimes be a very fast pace and time management job and I enjoy every minute of it. You learn about the regulars and thier dogs, the personalities and needs of the dog, as in their allergies and health issues and likes and dislikes. After a while you automatically know the pet and pet parent by name and you create a bond."
good,"The best thing about this place is meeting the different pets. People bring their dog(s) in and you get to pet them and greet them. The downside is all the standing at the cash register makes for a long day, and sore legs."
good,"Work started out at five am, do daily stretches then its off to work, unloading trucks and putting product away. The management team is the best i had ever seen, always willing to lend a hand or ear when needed. The most enjoyable part of petsmart had to be the supervisors so nice and respectful"
good,"A typical day would be clocking in and beginning at the register. Then working your way to facing, pricing, answering phones, treating animals, cleaning up ""accidents"" and assisting customers. I learned everything there is to know on how to diagnose and treat unwanted animal behavior and illness .Management is adequate. Hardest pat of the job was staging the truck. Most enjoyable part of this jobs is the customers and all the animals."
good,Good first job. You for only 4 or 5 hrs a shift so being part time you really cant get a second job because you have to have open schedule
good,Loved working here because of the change in environments such as working with pets and their owners.
good,Liked the job. Enjoyed working with the associates and customers.
good,The over night shift would have been very dull if not for the ability to play with the dogs whenever you like.
good,They care about there staff. and try there hardest to make it a pleasant environment to work in! And the grooming manager is amazing woman!
good,"The pets are lovable if you like dogs and cats. not a places for people with bad allergies to animals. lots of people contact. communication is a must, not for the shy."
good,"The work place was fun and busy always been kept on your toes, many skills from grooming dogs to helping customers were learned"
good,"Strict rules and guidelines, quality grooming products and well maintained equipment. Groomers not well trained and lack technical styling and pet handling skills due to the focus on sales, add-ons, and an outdated grooming manual."
good,"Their guidelines and expectations for managers are very tough to meet if you have a team that cannot keep pace, or not do all the work (drive the forklift). If your team is well prepared and the Store Manager is cool, then it can be a fun place to work"
good,Good company been cutting back allot lately but still a large company
good,"It was a long time ago but it was great. most customers are in a good mood, I did enjoy working there. I was manager. Other than the pay was low it was a very fun happy place to work."
good,"I learned a great deal about retail and loved that PetSmart was associated with and contributed to local animal shelters.  They really do care about finding homes for these animals.  The customers and their pets were a highlight of the job; however, this is not ultimately where I want to advance my career."
good,"The store manager is amazing, however the assistant managers not so much. As the Pet Trainer until I build up the clientele I’m barely getting hours. Not the worst job I’ve had but not worth the stress."
good,I enjoyed being here. It was a wonderful place to work and grow. It provides a variety of fields to work in. It gave me a sense of home. Pets came first for PetSmart and I loved that.
good,"Seen people get fired for ""not being approachable""; if you love animals do not work here. Advancement is all political and raises are very minimal. Not a great place to work long term."
good,"Just a warning to this job, don't be one of those people that lie, only work at a pet store if you actually like animals! All animals and aren't afraid to hold lizards, birds and such like. "
good,"faced paced with answering phones, greeting and checking in customers in between grooming dogs. fun environment with coworkers and dogs.  can get pretty loud."
good,"I like working here management wise. I'm not a big fan of retail. I had to deal with my fair share of rude customers, but that's what you get when you work retail. I got good hours."
good,"I like working at the pet hotel, but I can't ever complete my duties due to being so understaffed. The closing always disregards the amount pf work that I have to do."
good,"Would recommend as a side job for a student or teen or someone on there way to retirement. Decent job fun and the pets were obviously amazing! Management was decent, over all culture is decent."
good,"Typical day can be chaotic, but consists of a lot of customer service. Helping customers and pet parents find their products and recommending products. As well as covering breaks and making sure inventory is kept as stocked as possible."
good,"My day at work is easy going, manageable at times things need to be done and busy. What I learn at work is things aren't always easy rushing around sometimes. For management you need to get there right away if possible because at certain times it can be busy. For workplace culture I think anyone can work there. The hardest pat of my job is either getting scratched or bitten but, someone has to look after the animals and care for them. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the people bring in the animals and working with great people."
good,"I loved working at PetSmart when I first started. All the managers were amazing . They helped one another. As time went by the management went down hill. Employees were slacking off and others would have to pick up the slack. I learned a lot about dogs and cats along with their food and what’s good for them. "
good,For the most part the company is a dream. Great pay and benefits. Not a successful place to work if you like structure. Priorities of the higher ups are lacking and it can be confusing and hard to accomplish tasks as a manager.
good,"Timed orders, physically demanding, very fast pace, and sometimes critical environment. Be sure to take notes on any and all rules/proceedures because there is no handbook later on. If you have any questions, ask an LP associate or member of DC services because some managers aren't as well informed and can frequently miscommunicate with associates & management on other shifts."
good,"A typical day would start at 9:30 when I come in and the closing manager would let me know how many dogs and cats there were and what wasn't done yet. And that was where I had to start off. I would clean empty kennels, do the laundry, clean buckets and refill them for the morning shift. At about 2 am I would start getting the food ready for all the dogs and cats that were there and at 4 am I would feed all the animals then at 4:30 I would start walking the dogs one by one till I finished walking all of the dogs or until the morning crew came in if I couldn't finish walking all the dogs. This job taught me to manage my time very well and taught me to get a lot done in a matter of a few hours."
good,It's a fun place to work but can be slow and stressful at times. Get a long with your salon crew and you will be able to get through some sticky situations that may pop in.
good,"It is fast paced, you need to know about animals, it is important to provide excellent customer service, the management could improve. Higher management (district and up) are great."
good,"I loved the work, but being understaffed and constantly feeling the need to rush to meet quotas was incredibly stressful. Management also didn’t communicate within itself, so I would get in trouble for doing something one manager told me to do and of course they wouldn’t own up to it to save their own skin. I liked my general co-workers and the job however, so another location could be completely different."
good,"Most benefits as a groomer here are great I recommend giving it a go, even if you have zero grooming experience they WILL train you after a certain amount of time has passed. I personally left because of a store leader being an overall awful person and not because of the company itself."
good,"The paid is pretty good, the employee's are great but management can differentiate between the different stores but some can be super harsh and not nice to the point of having issues with. Normally good customers but had a few who wanted to steal and or use fake money successfully. Overall it was a good time though meeting all the fun loving animals that walk in every day, a lot more nicer than some customers."
good,"Petsmart was a fun place to work, with some really great people. Corporate really takes care if it’s employees, and makes sure everyone is treated with respect:"
good,Workplace environment is great. Customers will be customers. Management is supportive in dealing with unruly customers. Recent restructuring has been less than ideal.
good,Pretty standard job there are chances to move up in the company if you're willing to relocate. corporate can be a little demanding at times and change some of the things for the worse but overall a fine job
good,"All my coworkers were incredibly nice and welcoming, and the pets are the best part of the entire job. I generally stayed busy, with plenty customers and appointments. The most difficult part of the job would be the bathers taking all walk in services and their own scheduled appointments, making time management essential. Poor management is the only reason I would advise caution when applying."
good,I worked at petsmart all through High school it was my real first job. I made so many life long friends who now 15 years later I still stay in contact with. I went back to work for Petsmart as part time seasonal help and was asked to stay on part time after the holidays I stayed for another year until I was offered full time employment elsewhere. Its an easy job for the most part if you love being around animals. Also if you have pets like myself the employee discount comes in handy.
good,Petsmart is a great place to work entry level for animals lovers. Schedule is semi- flexible and management is knowledgeable. I worked at the PetHotel/ Doggie Day Camp Its more work then it appears. Team members are responsible for the health and well being of all pets in our care.
good,Petsmart is an excellent company to work for and their managemnet is fair. I was in a very bad car accident and was out for a while with my injuries. I left the company due to time lost.
good,"Stressful environment and PetSmart upper management demands too much from employees with only 50% commission. In my store we are like a family and help each other, but they are not all the same."
good,"Good work environment. No emergency work."
good,"I worked nearly 5 years there and barely made it far. I ended up transferring to another store in another state ( due to personal reasons for leaving prior state ) and though I loved where I worked at my last store, it was nice pace, lots to do, etc. I was still not given E.O.t.M, no matter how hard I worked, whether I worked over thr 40 hours ( though I was only given between 20 and 30 hours, depending on the time of the year ) and even when trying to get to full-time, they always told me that it wasn't possible but yet my other co-worker, barely worked there a year, had made to full-time and only doing half of what I would do. It's a good starting job but it's not worth staying the many years that I've stayed because unless you prove yourself, despite how hard you have to do that, there's no growth, though I was promised that there was a way to grow within the company."
good,"I really love working with my co-workers, but I was never given hours to work and they kept hiring people to come in when we didn't have hours to give. I am a Pet Care Associate but I was trained on the Register, however, I almost never get to work in pet care after 5 months when they hired 2 new workers. I even told my manager how unhappy this made me, I asked for just one shift in pet care a week but was just given a pat on the back and told to wait. I made some really great relationships but I thoroughly dislike my experience working here. Management is generally great otherwise, but one mistake (like forgetting to ask for register backup) and I would get chided. I learned a lot from working here like how to give medicine to an animal and the proper care of sick pets. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interact with customers pets and having great conversations with those customers."
good,The company is great to work for if you have a love for animals. You get to work by them and have a rewarding job finding new animals to homes. It is a fast-paced work environment and can be stressful at times.
good,"Great interaction with customers in-store and over the phone"
good,I was looking for a part time job that I know I would enjoy. Petsmart with the perfect fit for me. I love working with people and I love animals especially dogs.
good,"Working for Pet Smart taught me so much regarding animals! Grooming was a great job for me! It involved working in a shop with other groomers, cleaning kennels daily, answering phones, making appointments, calling to remind clients of their appointments, checking dogs in and out of salon, cleaning salon on a daily basis, grooming at least 6/7 dogs a day. If we had no clients for an hour or so we would help out on the floor, stocking shelves or helping customers on the floor! I had to leave due to a major health problem back then!"
good,I enjoy my work environment and the people I work with. Only reason I would leave is if I could get one full time job that can let me afford cost of living
good,"The team leads, my manager and everyone I got to work with were nice, understanding and incredible to work with, the only complaint I have, was the pay. For what I worked as, I personally felt I was underpaid. Other than th as t, I truly enjoyed working for petsmart"
good,"Fast paced with a lot to do, coming into work & opening registers/counting safe, printing reports & adjusting inventory from previous sales that were negative to on-hand inventory. Working with many different types of individuals to get tasks completed & trying to make the job fun to do. Time Management: coming to & leaving work on time & doing as much as you can in the time that you have."
good,"Really great place to work.   Everyone was friendly and the customers for the most part were very easy to deal with.    "
good,would stay at job I like it a lot just need more hours to pay bills. they cater to management when it comes to hours the shifts are too short for cashiers.
good,"People who love working with animals, this is a good place too be. It’s great and very fast paced and can be stressful but it’s a good work environment."
good,"Overall, the work environment is fair. Staff is friendly overall, its the corporation itself that could use some work.  Often times, Groomers are treated like robots and are expected to dish out 8-10 dogs in a short time span with only given half the pay of their hard work."
good,Management can improve more on the scheduling and respect for others when they are unavailable on certain days. Store manager is great but mostly feels like it's being ran by a bunch of kids.
good,"In petcare you take care of 300+ animals, given most of them are fish, their lives are in your hands. The workplace is competitive for hours and advancement often resulting in tension between coworkers."
good,It's a good retail store to work for .They pay better then most and alot of room to move in petsmart . and you get to work with pets . and get to know the people you help
good,It’s a great place to work part time. It’s only fun if you’re an Associate because management right now if focusing on all the wrong things. So stay as Ana associate
good,"Good coworkers, lots of cleaning fish tanks for pet care, and some difficult customers. Enjoyed working there for the first couple months but it got old pretty fast after that."
good,I love working at PetSmart but I disliked the scheduling. The work day can either be amazing with proper staff or a horrible shift with only the minimum amount of help.
good,Very friendly environment. Everyone is close yet professional. Management provides snacks and coffee in break room. No full time titles for Stylist Apprentice position.
good,"It was on an ok place to work, not a lot of hours.  Good people and fun clients.  The culture was laid back but professional and the uniform was jeans and a polo."
good,"Generally a good work environment except the workers can be very unprofessional. Managers have been great overall. Scheduling is a bit annoying because it’s very difficult to get time off and if you have an emergency and can’t find someone to cover you’re required to come in. You get a lot of repeat customers so it’s nice getting to know the people that come in. Pays average, not a lot of opportunity for advancement which is why I left. Overall not a bad place, but not a job youd want for a long time."
good,"This job is fun and hard work, however there is little room for growth and not a reliable job if you are looking for a career. There are always pets in the store and a few fun positions to fill"
good,"I love this job, but there were specific managers that made it extremely difficult to stay calm and have a good day at work. Any day that they weren't there was a day I had fun, I enjoyed the work, and I worked my tush off. My favorite aspect was the pet parents. I had a lot of regulars I loved to talk to and catch up with, and help them find any new solutions they might need. Working here makes you quick to change your mind about a lot of animals. I went from not wanting to put my hands in the fish tanks to owning too many animals and just walking around with a python on my arm."
good,"Working at PetSmart was wonderful. I am passionate about animals and that was the perfect place for me. I did have some issues with hours and management but overall, a fun place to work if you love animals."
good,"Very fast paced work place. You're under a time limit to groom your pet and you have multiple that come in at the same time sometimes. I learned how to properly and safely groom pets. Salon manager wasn't the best, but the job was fun. The hardest part of the job was pleasing the manager but the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfied customers. Over all it was a good company to work for."
good,"Very animal friendly and animal oriented. Every employee is there to help pets and their owners find and receive the best quality of health possible. Management trains employees continuously on animal health products, tips, and tricks, especially to share with owners to achieve the best results for the pet."
good,you start out as a bather and hopes that you can move up to groomer but you really have to patience at this job and understand sometimes they play favorites
good,"I haven't worked there in a long time, but when I did finally leave the company, they were a lot less fun to work for. They used to have a ""family"" feel to it, then the corporate greed took over."
good,"Overall, the environment was great, the coworkers were very nice and helpful, and the management is very supportive. Honestly, it depends on the setting of everything and how you handle situations. A normal work day could be great or it could go bad due to mistreatment to/from a customer."
good,"Petsmart stands for excellence in animal health care and overnight stays at their luxurious hotel suites. Its takes a very special person who has patience and love for different  breeds of dogs and cats. At Petsmart, you will learn life changing experience you can apply to your everyday life. The training is so rewarding and management will become the hands on team for your success. The easiest part of the job is to cuddle, one on one with a dog or cat. However, this makes leaving them the hardest part on the Job."
good,"Sometimes it's too much drama here, some people just start mess just to have fun, managers can be either rude to you about why you're late or why you can't work, sometimes customers can be rude as well, but some days it's the opposite like people can take care of the situation."
good,PetSmart provides a different atmosphere compared to most retail chains due to the variety of animals and entertaining customer/pet interactions. Communication is somewhat lacking in some areas but can be improved upon nonetheless. All staff members are nice and willing to work to further improve store culture and sales.
good,"There are five managers and I like three of them other than that I love my job. There was one manager that would always give me a really hard time about my work and I was an exceptional employee, the store manager loved the work I did."
good,"As a cashier, I rang up customers at the register, restocked and maintained shelves, and helped with basic cleaning (vacuuming, mopping). The workplace environment was pretty relaxed, and the managers were accommodating."
good,I drove a reach truck and it was a little stressful at times but It wasn't a bad job. I didn't apply for any other jobs and maybe I should have. I could have probably picked in the shipping department.
good,You make decent money but need to be prepared for a fast pace environment with high levels of stress mainly on the weekends in the grooming salon atleast.
good,"the grooming salon is a stressful and tightly packed place with too many people in it. the job itself is great, and the people are cool, but the hours given even being close to full time are still not enough to pay rent."
good,"If you’re a college student, have a second job, or just looking for part time work, Petsmart is a great company to work with. Advancement is possible with time and hard work, but it’s a lot of stress when you have to deal with constant down pour of neediness from higher ups. Animals are always fun working with, staff (other than some management) are almost always really good people, and the job is pretty fun when it comes to doing the actual job. But policies and standards are constantly changing turning simple tasks into unnecessarily hard projects."
good,"Typical work shift for pet care manager is about 130-10 nearly every shift. You come in and are also in charge of training and coaching all cashiers as well as running the petcare department and its group. It gets overwhelming but when there are no issues it can be easy. When your fish system crashes, the parts are unavailable, your cashiers aren't meeting set goals, you have more animal stock than you can safely handle and you are covering the floor alone... it is stressful."
good,"if you dont like all pets dont work in a place like this. mangers in cape coral fla all got fired. distric manager got fired for punching somebody."
good,Great job with lots of structured flexibility. Good Compensation but company is currently unstable with no CEO and no strategy or consistent direction.
good,"As a cashier, the atmosphere is usually slow-paced. There's a multitude of things to do, but none really are very demanding or difficult. Must love animals, as in, must be okay cleaning up after animals. Also must be okay with dealing with dead animals, but in a limited manner. A solid 4/5 stars. Better than food."
good,job is steady and having policies in place is great - not very flexible with work schedules. When i was working there it was usually that grooming staff only were allowed one weekend day a month off which was not realistic.
good,"got to learn a lot about different types of animals. all the different type of food there where, and witch best fit for the animal. meet new people and pets"
good,"This is a wonderful job with mostly great management. The task of pet care is a very knowledge intensive task. The pay for this task does not reflect the knowledge required on each and every animal in the store. Nor does it reflect the fact that pet care associated generate a large portion of the store's sales based on species specific recommendations. That being said, I found this job to be fulfilling and work environment to be friendly and pleasant."
good,"Typical retail environment, high turnover rate, people drama is the biggest issue. Fair pay, not much opportunity to advance, but pretty flexible hours."
good,The only reason I left was because of new management not caring enough about the animals. I would have worked here for much longer if my old manager had stayed. Really awesome taking care of the animals and connecting with customers and their pets.
good,Fun place to work when you have the right management team. Benefits are great and they pay managers well. Loved getting to know all the pet parents and their pets.
good,"I honestly love my job, but with the hours I get they aren't enough to make a living. I would like to gain another part-time job to even out my paychecks and being able to make sure I can pay my bills. The hardest part of the job would have to be time, You have a lot of things to do throughout the day and some of those are stressful. Work culture is great besides some of those who I work with don't seem very into their jobs, I wish they were more upbeat about it. Management is alright but I don't feel that they really hear what you are saying and don't have a clear mind when talking to employees. A typical day at work is answering phone calls and making appointments, bathing/drying, clipping nails, brushing, teeth brushing, etc to dogs in my care under appointments. Finally, the most enjoyable part of my job is helping those around me and getting to make dogs more beautiful then they were before. My overall rating for PetSmart is that it is a decent place to work, just not if you want more then 20 hours or less a week."
good,"I loved being at Petsmart since you learn something new everyday. Unfortunately, when I worked there, some of the coworkers in pet care area were not friendly and did not train new people very well. Because of this, when someone new makes a mistake, the other coworkers go out of their way to make sure the manager knows about it. After I left, those coworkers got fired. "
good,"This was a great starter job.  I was a pet care specialist.  The only thing that I really have a complaint about was that all of the work wasn't fairly distributed.  Other than that, it was not a hard job, though a lot of work and you learned a lot. The customers were usually pleasant unlike some retail places."
good,"Overall, PetSmart is not a bad place to work. As a cashier the job is pretty easy and laid back. Pet Care is a little more stressful, but for the most part it isn't too difficult as long as you have a decent amount of knowledge on the variety of animals in the store (if you don't, you'll learn as you go). However, they aren't so great at giving raises or moving people up in the store, so if you're hired as a cashier chances are you're going to be stuck as a cashier or be given the opportunity to move into the grooming salon as a bather."
good,"If you are a morning stocker its, most of the time 5 am wake up and a time limit for each pallet. cashier, you need to have high energy and friendly smiles all the time. As a cashier it can be a little crazy especially on weekends, you need to be focused and quick.All in all its fun and fast-paced, but you get to meet new people and make friends at work, it makes work go by faster."
good,Animals are fun to be around but there was nearly nothing to do even when the store is busy. Most of the days are spent cleaning and trying to talk to customers who are only interested in looking at the hamsters.
good,I went into retail because I love to work with customers.  This store was very clean and customers were treated with respect.  The management team really had their stuff together.
good,It is a very fast paced job and you make decent money if your fast. You will deal with people as well as dogs. You will have to deal with dogs who feces and urine on you as well.
good,"Love working with and around animals daily. dealing with customers and answering their questions about their animals was a daily challenge I looked forward to, not only as a sales associate but becoming a part of their family"
good,Some of the workers and managers here are amazing but some of the policies are not something that should be in a pet store for the sake of the pet. Some times you have to perform time consuming task while paying attention to all customers.
good,"Working in the grooming salon, you were disconnected from the other part of the store. It was almost like it was disconnected from it yet still had to follow the rules of the store and the salon and sometimes they contradicted themselves, you depending on who was on shift meant you followed which set of rules. Management strictness and interpretation of mandatory things were vastly different. The environment fluctuated between cut throat, back stabbing to loving and caring depending on the business busy times."
good,I would assist guests in their purchases for their companion. I would Be responsible for every department inside the store and would make quick decisions how to handle situations that needed manager experience.
good,"Overall Petsmart is a fun and easy place to work, you get to pet dogs all day as well as take care of sick/ healthy animals. Overall the lower management was fantastic but once you got higher up such as GM, district, there was a lack of care and lack of communication."
good,great place to work the crew and management are good but if your good at your job they will expect you to work every second you can. in my experience at least. i worked 15hrs 15 days in a row at one point but i volunteered and loved every second of it. i highly recommend this place as an employer they are an amazing company.
good,"Very fast paced. Time-consuming and detail orientated. Learned a lot about different dog breeds, coats, behaviors. Have to be able to work well as a team. Time management was one of the hardest parts of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the transformation the dogs went through when they were in our care."
good,"I love working at PetSmart and would love to continue working here. My only concern is the lack of advancement opportunities due to a shortage of spaces in their grooming academy program. I was supposed to go back in May, and 5 months later I'm still on a waiting list even though I was hired in to go immediately to their academy. This aside, I've loved my time with the company and only wish there was something that could be done about their commitment to the employee where advancement is concerned."
good,"I loved volunteering at pet smart, because I love the people there, they are so nice and compatible with what days you can work and not, especially since I go to school."
good,The employees and management was great but the company as a whole could definitely work on showing that they care of their employees. Also moving up in the store was a bit difficult.
good,"It was nice to experience working with animals, especially cats. They were in need of shelter, love, attention, affection and care. We sold them for a cheap price and honestly, it was warming to see an animal get adopted."
good,"Decent environment, good pay. Little room to advance. Long hours for managers and full timers. "
good,"Work was nice, not too hard. Enjoyed the employees and the animals. Hoped for more money but it was a fair wage for the work required. I would recommend to a friend or colleague."
good,"I work in the Doggie Daycamp/ Petshotel. It is often very stressful and you have to work holidays. Playing with the dogs is a lot of fun, but there is also a lot of work, that is most of the time gross. Cleaning rooms, cleaning up bodily fluids from dogs and cats. It is a lot of fun to watch puppies to grow up and get to know them. You have to work every holiday. The management is pretty much always on call and have to have completely open availability. Sometimes working 6am, the next day 2pm, then you could be working overnight."
good,"I worked at a PetSmart and although I enjoyed it, I had some issues. The managers treated everyone poorly at most times, lied about pay increases, and lied about other small things as well. I loved the environment and working with the various animals however, it was a great experience for me."
good,"Working with dogs was the best part of my shift. As a bather I saw between 4-6 dogs a day. Time management was pretty important - depending on the size of a dog and the services requested, I usually have about an hour to get a dog done and ready to send home. Teamwork was a big deal and I could always rely on my coworkers to lend a hand when needed."
good,"If you love working with animals, then the Pet Care Dept. is where you'll love to work in. You feed, clean, and maintain animal habitats along with ensuring pets are placed in responsible homes."
good,It was a good place to work. Limited opportunities for advancement. The company is no longer public and I have been made aware of many changes although I do not know any specifics.
good,Certain days are busier than others. Typically weekends. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and their pets when they come into the store.
good,Loved endless care and interaction with people and animals. Every day I met new animals in their microcosms. Unique holiday products came from the boxes like Christmas. And discounts allowed me to buy my largest tropical fish tank ever. Some days I fixed out of dates and other days I focused on nutrition. USA -made goods trended.
good,"For the most part, I really enjoyed working at PetSmart. I really needed Full-Time and they did not provide full time. I also did not really enjoy working with the store manager."
good,"If you love animals this is the place to work, you get training for all the animals, you get the knowledge of brands of food for the animals. They also have rescues in all store very rewarding."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Petsmart; the animals and customers were almost always a pleasure to be with. I knew most of my customers and clients (dogs) by name and grew a bond with every single one of them.
good,One of my favorite jobs i ever had. Pet people are naturally empathetic so every customer i worked with was in their own way very kind. My coworkers were interesting and the job itself paid ok with various tasks to mix it up.
good,"The store is to always look clean, but the staff still has fun to get the job done. Everyone is upbeat and willing to help out whenever it is needed. There is also always someone willing to be there if a problem is to occur. I learned so much in the pet care department. I am better at caring for animals and making sore the environment given is proper for them."
good,"Job is pretty average overall. Pay is a little above minimum wage with small raises after probation periods. Half of my managers are awesome but half of them are not good people but its like that at any store. The only issues I have are that they consider full time ""something you have to earn"" so not a lot of employees get benefits like healthcare and the hire everyone as Pet Care (because that's what everyone wants to do, everyone works there because animals are great) but then most of us get stuck as cashiers 90% of the time."
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work if you love animals. You learn a lot from your co-workers, but managers can micromanage sometimes and make you feel unappreciated"
good,"I love my job in the grooming salon as a professional groomer. The job itself is rewarding but hard work, it's not all playing with puppies. I love the people I work with too, we are definitely a family in the salon! "
good,I learned a lot about different pets and the people I worked with worked well with accommodating to my other job schedules. Loved all of the dogs that came in.
good,"The job itself is not bad and I worked in every department. As long as you lie animals and can deal with crazy customers, you won't have an issue. The pay isn't great but you can make pretty decent money if you go to grooming academy and get good at it. My store manager was the entire reason I left"
good,"it is a productive, friendly and comfortable environment. everyone and their pets are welcome. The store's atmosphere is well combined with their excellent customer service."
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work just for a little bit. You don't get appreciated for the work that you put in, Unless you are part of management. You will get tired of the constant nagging about what someone else did wrong. if you did something wrong management won't tell you. But everyone else will know. "
good,if you want more than part time look elsewhere! On average shifts are 5 or fewer hours. Doesn't really matter what you apply for you will end up doing most positions available in the store within the first 90 days.
good,"Its a pretty good place to work because you get to interact with all types of people and animals. You have to have some type of passion about animals to work here because this is the reason you come to work for,"
good,"A typical day at work can range from having only two or three dogs to having upwards of 10.  We are not allowed to advertise that we can receive tips which puts a major dent in compensation for how many dogs are done.  However, working in the salon as a team is almost always a pleasurable experience."
good,PetSmart seems to be losing it's way since going private.  I feel they've been abandoning core values that have fostered loyalty with both consumers and associates.
good,"PetSmart distribution warehouse in Ottawa, IL is a well managed company that ships out more than over millions amount worth of pet products they're currently focusing on the accuracy of the products that are shipped out to the variety of stores. The management does an ok job at shifting others into the functions that is needed for the company to be successful no matter if its switching on to other equipment such as the reach truck, dock stocker, cherry picker and also the center rider [electric pallet jack]. The toughest part of being an associate at petsmart is making the rate that is required with major factors that can alter you to be successful and also the hours of the shift which is 10 hours for days a week. PetSmart holds a great culture there as always helping out others such as shelters for pets. The co-workers are great people and the understand that we need to work together in order for the company to be successful."
good,Management personnel didn't hesitate to jump in and do any job whenever necessary.  The salon (where I worked) was very busy and weekends could be stressful for people and pets.  Loud and crowded.  Strong safety standards were reinforced and handling of all pets was done with care and compassion.  Most people who work here don't do it for the money.  Flexible schedules and a love of animals attracted a varied group who truly wanted the best for the pets.
good,Working with pets and their pet parents is the best part of the job. The culture in the store needs some work. The people I work with make the job worthwhile.
good,"Petsmart is a wonderful company to work for, they provide a safe work environment with a friendly staff. While working for Petsmart, not only do you learn how to take care of animals you also learn how to rehabilitate sick animals and maintain their wellness and health"
good,"I was an ASM that put dog food on the shelf every day.  The store was not as successful as they had hoped so hours were cut back very quickly, which I completely understand due to lack of sales. They were planning on a second store in the next year but put it on hold due to being unsuccessful.  I felt that associates weren't held accountable enough.  Rules were broken often..."
good,I am looking to broaden  my knowledge  of a different  field .  I have been here for 10 years and I work in a great department  which has hands on with product coming in and going out. It's challenging  which I love. I love to be a problem  solver.
good,"A typical day at work, as a bather, is answering the phones, scheduling appointments, checking in/out dogs (even if they aren't on your books for the day), and also bathing, drying, brushing, clipping nails, cleaning ears, and anything extra that the dogs that are on your schedule for the day require. The grooming department is a fast paced work environment with high stress."
good,"You are always busy early morning and closing shifts at PetSmart. As for the middle of the day, you are dying of boredom. Working up close with the animals was amazing. You got to socialize with them, care of them, and make sure they are living in a comfortable environment. The management wasn't that great where I worked, but I have heard differently from other stores. Work schedule was pretty good, breaks were on time, and if you love animals, it is a fun job! Pet parents are TERRIBLE though. Worst kind of customers you'll ever have to deal with when it comes to retail."
good,"Kind of boring since I would be on register providing customer care most of the days I worked, I did learn a lot about certain animals and got to know quite a few interesting people.  Management was alright and they did do a lot for customers.  The most enjoyable parts of the job was getting to know customers and their pets."
good,"A typical day work day involves being able to adapt to the rushed demands of completing clerical and operational tasks, handling customer needs, researching and troubleshooting options when errors or situations arise, and always remaining positive. Over the years I have gained many skills with this company. Time management, prioritizing tasks, and leading and inspiring a team of 10-12 associates are some of the most challenging, yet rewarding, skills obtained. I have worked closely with my co-managers to foster a productive workplace that meets the metrics set out for our individual store. This required adapting to different methods to reach our ever changing store focuses-i.e. conversion rates and store sales. During my employment with this company I excelled at meeting the expectations of clientele.  It is the most enjoyable part of this position, as I thrive in the ability to satisfy the customers' demands. The most difficult part of the position arose when the company combined two management positions into one. This junction required me to manage two departments ensuring that day to day operations were met per policy, all while setting an example and expectation for delivering optimal customer service to meet store goals. Furthermore, I am responsible for processing shipments, overlooking all paperwork for accuracy, and assisting to the needs of the organizations that partnered with our company. Overall, it has been a great experience working with this company. However, I am eager to explore other career fields with the skills I have obtained."
good,Petsmart is a great company overall.  The distribution environment is all metric driven with no consideration or respect for its associates.  Distribution centers do nothing to support local communities like the stores do.
good,really great place to work. met so many great people and enjoyed doing what i did everyday. You can learn a lot from the people you work with and it is not a hard job
good,"Where I am currently working, in my daily basis routine I take care of animals and make sure they are healthy and well taken care of. Give the best of my knowledge to pet parents with any questions or worries they have about their dog, cat and any exotic animal. Management where I am working at the moment is the best I have seen. Everyone respects each other. I could definitely say the hardest part of my job is that there are days where customers can be ignorant about how an animal should be taken care of. But when a pet parent does have interest of how an animal should be taken care of and not because it is only an animal but a living creature, it is something I enjoy and don't mind doing."
good,I miss it there but we went our separate ways. They have strong communication skills and work well with the animals. I would go back in a heart beat!
good,"Job is very demanding, you're always on your feet. Job is easy if you have knowledge of the animals sold here. Overall, a positive work experience."
good,"Working here was enjoyable at first because I got to deal with animals every day and I love animals. Although, I am an active person and being a cashier got boring so I had to leave that job."
good,"Awesome way experiencing new idea of working in a pet store.  Training is really good. "
good,"Worked at Petsmart for 4 years. I really enjoyed this job. And I still miss my 4 legged customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but it was a bit much for me. I was an early morning stocker and lifting the heavy bags of food was a bit much to do 4 hours straight with no breaks in the middle. the staff were very friendly and inviting and were always willing to help each other out. this was a great job it just wasn't for me."
good,"Great place to work, very busy work. Nice co-workers. Monday's are the busiest, because payroll is running.  Very strict deadlines to meet to make sure we pay everyone correctly.  Management has changed since the company was bought in 2015. I really enjoyed working there but management saw differently."
good,"pack orders at rate, help other packers with issues"
good,"I loved working at PetSmart, but with lack of well trained co-workers it made me have to work twice as hard. You get to help educated pet parents and see all sorts of animals. You really do learn a lot about retail, animal care, and customer service. The hardest part is the tough days when you are short staffed, or having rude customers. The best part is the animals!"
good,"A typical day involved store cleaning, merchandising and lots of customer service."
good,"As a bather you're expected to either quit or become a groomer, but to become a groomer you have to go to academy and sign a contract and purchase your own supplies. If you do not go to academy you will continue to be low man on the totem pole with look outlook for advancement. You will get bit and scratched and work your butt off for a high schoolers wage and no prospects of commission. There are so many managers that no one knows who's job is what so nothing actually gets done. But at least you get to see puppies all day."
good,I enjoyed working with animals. It has taught me much about them and individual needs. I have learned how to groom many breeds and it was a fun experience for me.
good,"Directions are vague and inaccurate and questions to clarify are not answered, when work is done incorrectly, you are thrown under the bus as if it was your fault instead of the managers."
good,"When working for PetSmart, it takes time, patience  and knowledge.  The time to learn everything that's needed, the patience when learning everything and helping customers, and the knowledge is important because pet parents often asks questions on food, medicines, shampoo, etc to keep their pets happy and healthy and the knowledge behind it all is very important to have."
good,i really enjoyed working for Petsmart over all. The clientele and services that you as an associate provide are great. The hiring and promotion of management jobs tends to be too biased and based more on how much you are liked verse how well you perform your job.
good,I enjoyed my job very much but I was not getting hours and I could not afford to keep the job. The management seemed bias to me. Other than these issues I enjoyed the workplace
good,"It feels fulfilling to go in every day and knowing that I'm really helping people solve the issues they are having with their new family members.  Putting my best foot forward every day means a lot to me as a trainer and a pet care associate because the Pet Parents and pets need me at my best.  If I don't know an answer to a question I can always rely on one of my co-workers or managers to assist us both and educate me so I can better assist the Pet Parents on my own next time.  The hardest part of the job is the really difficult to train or scared dogs that come through my classes, but I also enjoy them the most, because it makes my job seem so much more worthwhile when I see how much progress they've made at the end of our six weeks and others take notice besides just the Pet Parent and myself."
good,"Clean Animal Habitat's"
good,I really enjoyed working there. Management always has your back and works around your schedule. If you love pets then this is the place for you. I regret that i left this job
good,"I love my job at PetSmart, the only thing keeping me from moving forward with a career is the pay. I cannot support my family on $9 an hour. I love the staff and especially the pets that I am surrounded by all day long. I work as a ""Part-time"" hotel person but still work 39 hours a week, so I don't get to spend as much time with my kids as I'd like."
good,"A typical day would be around 4-6 dogs with 5 walk in nail trims. I learned to be more patient and considerate during my time with Petsmart. Management was fantastic, I absolutely loved my co-workers. Hardest part of the job would definitely have to be the multi tasking during a hectic day but that was outweighed by the feeling of satisfaction of taking care of a really good dog."
good,"Slow times were boring, Customers for the most part were good, training was amazing, great leaders/ management, no room to move up other then management which was hard to get into, decent pay for simple job requirements, great co workers, my second family, always smelt terrible but not as bad as smaller pet stores, truly passionate about animals, LOVED IT"
good,"You have to love people. Co-workers are helpful and friendly, management works well with your schedule. You will be more successful if you research animal care and products at home, they don't do much training."
good,Worked at the Pethotel and it was a fun first experience in the animal field. Learned a lot about pet care and providing great customer service.
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of several different things.  Booking appointments, taking care of animals, checking in/ checking out animals. I get along very well with all of my co-workers and managers.  We have fun while we are at work which is something I really look for in a job.  I like to work with people who can get the job done but have a good and positive attitude while doing it as well."
good,"The company has a good mission, a good vision and good leadership. The company is aggressively looking to grow.Fun atmosphere, lots of interaction with interesting people and pets, plenty of learning opportunities."
good,"Unload trucks first thing early in the morning. Then with my team i make a plan on who will work each skid and what time it all needs to be completed by. Management was good, always looked out for us and were always making sure we were working safe and telling us how to interact with customers and make sales. Hardest part of the job is having multiple set goals and having them to complete them while offering customers help in the store. Great team."
good,"It is a fun place to work, with good benefits.  Great to see different kinds of animals.  Ability to work in different stores across the region."
good,"Fun, people mostly good attitudes, usually look forward to going to work. easy work and I get to work with animals! The hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the customers and employees but that's retail for you."
good,"This review is based on my employment spanning eleven years five different general managers, four salon managers, and three locations. (was sent where I was needed at times)  But this makes an accurate review difficult. However I feel that being able to stay in one field and for the same company speaks very highly of that company. "
good,Petsmart was an okay job. They didn't like to work around your schedule if you've had another job. I learned how to stock products & ordered products.
good,"If you love dogs, aren't squeamish around excretions and don't mind janitorial work, this could be a great chance to learn about proper dog handling techniques and knowledge about pet behavior. Not only that but also plenty of my favorite part: cuddling and playing with pooches. My co-workers were great and I still have contact with them even after leaving.  Management could have been a bit better at keeping equity in the workspace, but were very friendly and approachable."
good,PetSmart does wonderful things for the communities in which they reside.  PetSmart assists with many programs throughout the country that most people do not know about.
good,"typically a decent place to arrive with fun happy employees and happy pets and customers.  limited room for advancement, coupled with uncertain times looming based on new company ownership."
good,It was a fun place to work. I worked full time in the dog day camp rooms. Most of my co workers were nice and friendly. The management at store level wanted to see you succeed. The hardest part of my job was leaving. The most enjoyable part was playing with all the dogs all day.
good,"The training,compensation and benefits are probably about average.  Discounts are awesome! For pet care, you are trained on the job, and there are brochures and guides to help you understand the animals. It's a fairly basic level of understanding, though, so employees can be a bit in over their heads. Dog training has a special training program and can be very good- provided your trainer is very good.  Scheduling, selling, and filling dog training classes was one of the most difficult parts of the job. Co-workers range from lazy to the most dedicated and passionate people you'll ever meet. Management and the merchandise side of things are typical retail, with a caring about pets kind of twist."
good,"Safe grooming salon to work in due to its safely rules (which a lot of salons do not have). "
good,"I really enjoy the work with animals and the managing of that department. I am not really cut out for retail and ""the customer is always right"" mentality."
good,"bathing dogs and trying not to get bit."
good,I worked for the Animal Care department where I not only had the chance to care for the animals but learn about their ways of life. My department was very team oriented. The best feeling is when I was able to teach new pet owners the exciting things about the animals as well as how to properly take care of them. Seeing how excited the customers would get adding a new pet member to their home was a great feeling. You didn't only care for the animals but you really learned a lot about the owners as well. Helping people as well as the animals is really what it was all about.
good,"I enjoyed my position and working for the company. "
good,The company was very supportive of an associates work/life balance.
good,Standing in a room with unruly dogs for 8 hours at a time is extremely mentally taxing.
good,"feeding and caring for animals, learned a lot about reptiles, management was fun hard working, great co-workers, hardest part was when an animal died, most enjoyable part was seeing new baby pets that came through the store"
good,"It can be a fun place to work, however, training needs work. Whenever you hire a new manager, it would be best, if they were fully trained to do their job."
good,"PetSmart is a good starter job just trying to get into the workforce, but after 3-4 years and becoming older, you get tired of just working in retail all the time. The pay sucks, management is okay, but overall its a good place to work"
good,being able to help assist customers with their pets needs and having a great group of coworkers helped to make the job a lot of fun.
good,Its a really good job. the people are great. i'm usually out before the store opens. the only bad thing is waking up at 4am to go to work.
good,Expect to work hard for the money.  Great benefits.  Fun working with animals.  Great customers that love their animals.
good,It was fun because of how I was allowed to engage with the customers
good,"If you love working with critters then this is a great place. "
good,The customers are friendly and very fun to work with... because they're dogs!
good,I loved working at Petsmart and miss it. I loved to share my passion with others for animals. Advancement was slim to none as is with any retail environment. Management changed alot at my store and could get confusing at times.
good,The job was fun only because I was able to play with animals. Spent my entire weekends working so it was not a good balance with my life and work.
good,"As a cashier, I worked at the register all day. I would also have to restock the store and help customers with their pet problems. At the end of each shift, I had to put away returned items back to their proper place in the store."
good,"As with most retail environments, more work is being put on the managers while cutting hours for regular workers in an effort to control costs with an expectation that productivity and quality remain the same.  While the work load and pace you have to perform is very challenging, the opportunity to work with animals and their parents is very satisfying and helps to reduce the stress."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of participation in team huddle, provide clean food and water for all pets, feed fish, open and clean adoption center, brief meeting with girls working with me that morning to list out action plan for the day, small paperwork, sales and customer service."
good,I worked the cash registers. my job was fairly easy. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers
good,"Worked with a lot of cool people. Could be a hard job at times, but overall a good place to work. Decent pay/hours. Only complaint was people letting their animals come in and not cleaning up after them."
good,"A typical day would start at 6am. I started by back washing the system, feeding the fish, disposing of the deceased fish and keeping a log of them on a piece of paper. Then, I fed the small animals and washed their dishes for the night crew. Next, I hand fed the macaws. After, I cleaned the cages and stocked the shelves. I talked to  customers about different animals and learned a lot from them in return. I sexed animals, boxed up animals, bagged fish and crickets.  I answered questions over the phone as well. I had people under me that I had to delegate duties to before I left for the day. When I was pregnant I changed to cashiering. My co-workers were fabulous and so was the management from time to time. The hardest part of the job was moving to cashiering. The best part of the job was seeing the customers satisfied."
good,Overall I like working at Petsmart.It is an easy going place and co-workers and customers are great.
good,"Working to meet goals was the normal work day I learned a lot of what I know from this place management was ok when I was there but could have been better, my coworkers were awesome and made everyday worth being there. and the hardest part of this job was leaving I really enjoyed it there. and the part I enjoyed the most while I was there was working in my department"
good,I really enjoy working here but as usual stress gets to management some times and it trickles down the line.
good,"At Petsmart, there was one common goal: Please the customer while maintaining the lives of animals. The energy and enthusiasm of co-workers was amazing, but the management lacked the motivation and energy themselves. Every day was enjoyable when each animal was healthy and living, when they weren't the days seemed harder. There was always opportunity for knowledge and advancement within the company which made each day new and entertaining."
good,I enjoyed most everything about my job with PetSmart. The employees and customers made coming to work fun
good,"A very physical and mental demanding job, that entails picking and stacking products at voice command, wrap stacked product on pallets put labels on them and transport them to assigned doors for shipment. Have to work at a fast paste with high level of accuracy and safety precautions. Have to clean as you go to maintain a clean, safe work area. "
good,You get to see pets all day long and help their owners find better ways to care for them.
good,For the amount of work required could have been paid more and also have the feeling of being watched to find something wrong not praise you for good work done.
good,"Everything was enjoyable about working at petsmart. A typical day at work went by fast, had the potential to bring in good money, and everyday you made other families happy by pampering their baby!"
good,"Coworkers were all very friendly, but because I worked in the grooming salon, the schedule was all over the place and I had to work in a hectic environment. However, I learned a lot about customer service. Most fun thing was working with nice dogs, hardest thing was working with mean dogs. Heh."
good,"A typical day would be bathing dogs. Washing, brushing, clipping nails, and cleaning ears. The hardest part of the job was having to see some of these horribly, matted dogs come in, and seeing the look on their faces was awful. The best part of the job was hanging out and pampering amazing dogs."
good,-There's a lot to be done on a daily basis for close to minimum wage
good,Was OK to work for. No major concerns or problems. Was enjoyable to be around animals. Must love animals in order to work there. Wage is not high enough to support a family. Loved the people I worked for
good,Fun place overall. Great company. You can bring your pets to work on Fridays and the weekends. On site cafeteria and gym are convenient.
good,i loved my job. i had a good boss and good co workers.
good,It's just like a groccery store but for animals. It's a unique and fun job if you love animals but we warned you also see the worst in animal ownership.
good,"I enjoyed working at petsmart., the only thing that never worked out, was the hours. Not enough to get me my benefits or job security. Got along good with my co-workers. Just not enough hours and the management team was lacking and not giving fair hours."
good,overall good company with some room for growth good insurance and benefits and good values based on customer service but short staff frequently for those values
good,Since this was volunteer work I did not mind the conditions of my job so much. I was not there to earn money but rather to help animals find a better home.
good,"If you love pets, this is your place to work! you will love the people, the pets! Hours are pretty crazy! Working at 3am for shipments, coming in at 7 am to open the store."
good,The enviorment is great and most of the customers are polite. There is always something to do so employees never get bored. The managment is not very Family Friendly.
good,It was a good job to have before trying to go to college. The animal's and people made the job exciting and challenging in a good way.
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work 80% of the time, but there was a lot of fighting among co workers. The pay was typical retail pay and the ""pet parents"" were rude."
good,"Taking care of dogs all day. There is not a lot of contact with other people than the dogs and coworkers so it is a very easy job but, we were understaffed quite frequently."
good,Working at Petsmart is a fun and enjoyable place. If you love Animals ( house hold) youll like petsmart. Petsmart has always been flexible in time off and having avaiable hours if needed.
good,"I enjoyed my day to day activities at Pet Smart. I was responsible for scheduling the staff, ensuring the safety of our pets, and leading our sales team to show great sales productivity."
good,This was a productive costumer service oriented company which provided sales opportunities and demands on its cashier's.
good,This is a good job to learn more about dogs and other animals. Has a variety of openings
good,The store is fun to work at. The employees are freindly and the customers are great. The managment is not open to change and doesn't listen to the employees as much as they should.
good,Petcare is always busy with tasks but register can be very slow and make the shift even longer. Not knowing about every single product can make customers get aggravated but most of the time a manager can answer it easily.
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with Petsmart and honestly miss it sometimes. When part-time, the pay is not ideal and neither are the hours, but it’s a fulfilling job for a student needing part time work and is a lover of animals."
good,"Overall nice job, though for all the work I had to do as a Pet Care associate I felt I should have been compensated more. Being with the animals is always nice, but it can get stressful when having to take care of the animals AND customers. Managers sometimes micro manage as if the Pet Care team doesn't have so much to do already. "
good,I enjoyed working at this job but I do wish that they would have offered to give me cross-training in other areas. The crew we had at the time were all younger than me but they were an awesome group of kids and took pride in what they were doing. Honestly I miss them all. But unfortunately I things must change.
good,Helping others and being respectful to help others in the morning and I will be in the area on the pets and keep it up and  if they need help with the pets
good,"Always a great adventure everyday working at PetSmart! Always be willing to help out pet parents find the right food or toys for their pets, be ready to meet and greet animals all day long!"
good,"PetSmart has been my favourite job that i have ever worked at. i regret leaving so much. Best part was dealing with the Dogs more than the customers, the dogs and cats are the best."
good,"PetSmart is a corporation. Money comes first. When you work with the animals that are in their care, that can be frustrating. However, at this store, the animals are taken care of very well because our associates really care. Of course there were some flaky employees who didn’t last long, and the few of us who have stayed. The store leader doesn’t know a lot about pet care, but the ASL is pretty cool  Of course bosses can be annoying but if you are not in pet care the job is pretty easy going  Pet care is all multitasking and stress, but if you love animals it’s worth it (sometimes). It’s also nice to know you can make sure these animals go to good homes."
good,It's a fun environment to work in. Love working with the animals and educating customers on their new pets. Management is nice and easy to talk to. Store is always clean and the employees are friendly.
good,Working at Petsmart gave me the opportunity to cross multiple times. It gave me the confidence in going after what I want. I enjoy working for Petsmart.
good,"Working as a receptionist for the Petsmart Grooming Salon, my work day was built on four consistent duties: scheduling appointments, checking customers and their pets in/out, answering phones, and maintaining a safe and clean work environment.  Training was easy to follow, allowing me to maintain a firm grasp on the scheduling program used, and the duties expected of me, before working on the floor.  And even when I slipped up, I had a wonderful set of coworkers to guild me!"
good,"Easy work , discounts on everything in store ..I honestly liked working there ..My coworkers were awesome and management was great...If your not an early morning person this job may not be for you..."
good,Petsmarr is a pretty decent company to work for in my experience. Management is pretty well rounded and willing to work with their associates. Id recommend
good,"As a groomer in petsmart the feel of the salon really depends on the management styles of your managers. I dont want to make a mess of a whole company in my reveiw for a few bad eggs. The company has a great goal in mind. Its built around an idea of a great work place culter but not every manager adheres to those goals, guild lines or mind set. There are policies in place that are easy to access and if you follow them AND KNOW THEM you will be fine. Its a great place to get your foot in the door and build an education and experiance (also to find out if this is really the job for you). "
good,"I worked in the PetsHotel so my day consisted of providing care for dogs and cats that were either in daycamp or boarding. There was always something to be done which was a little stressful but it meant I learned a lot when it came to animal care. I fed, cleaned, bathed, clipped nails, and watched over the dogs while they were in camp."
good,"As a stocker, I would only stock items from the truck. The truck only came twice a week, which meant I only worked two days a week and not for a very long amount of time. The overall environment was relaxed, but the hours were not providing a livable wage."
good,"customer driven"
good,I work in the grooming salon and it is very fast paced. But my coworkers are very nice and supportive. I recommend working here because the management is excellent and the people who work there are amazing.
good,"I tried to apply for a differemt job but at the moment they medded help with bather, in the end it was a good experience people was nice amd they were patient with me i was able to learn pretty quick thank to the saloon groomer. I recomend tis job only for those who enjoy working with pets."
good,Everyone is nice and greets you kindly but as the day gets busy it seems everyone looses that kind greeting and becomes less friendly when in fast paced and high stress situations.
good,"Management was fairly absent and detached when it came to understanding employees. (This was at a location that no longer exists). Coworkers were awesome. Teamwork was excellent, we all helped and respected each other. I also helped with stocking and at Banfield. (I worked primarily in the Salon). Cant say enough about how much I miss that job."
good,"Working at Petsmart is sometimes busy, usually cut back depending on how you handle customers. Learning how to complete inventory, operate the cash register, reordering shelves, and fully stocking."
good,"If you are looking for really early hours, it's a good job. You might work closings it during the day as well. Other then that, it is overall a great place to work."
good,"The work you do is mostly just common sense stuff. Once you know how to do it it's just the same every day so it gets a bit monotonous. The best part is you get to hang out with animals though, so thats nice."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Petsmart, however, the company was starting to have more unrealistic expectations of the management teams. The internal audits held you to an almost unreacheable standard. When I talk to friends still working there, I am told that it has only gotten worse."
good,"Overnights were more difficult I think because of the lack of employees, there were usually only 2 of us and our job requirements were to clean the entire back area ( mop floors, do laundry, clean out dog cages as needed, and play rooms). Also had to feed all the dogs and bring them out for 2 group playtimes towards the morning."
good,"Depending on locations differs the environment. Owasso was very stressful and test your patience with rude customers. Tho owasso was more fast paced and day went by faster, the store needs a whole new UPDATE. Broken arrow has more nice customers  that are pleasant to advise on pet needs. Broken arrow equipment is more nice also."
good,Must have lots passion for pets and have a hard-working and team-oriented. The job is not easy and not very clean. You have to be okay with dog's having diarrhea and vomiting
good,"I love the company and the benefits. The schedule is very flexible however you could have 28 hours 1 week and 4 the next. Training isnt the best, they rely a lot on other associates which isnt a good method. The work they expect of you and your coworkers isnt always the same nor consistent. Management is great, it's a fun environment a lot of the time but in a high traffic store management can be stressed which usually gets taken out on employees. Customers are great, you really build a bond with them and their pets."
good,"I loved working here and connecting with people about animals. There is lots of drama between employees and such though . I learned a lot about day to day operations of running a petshotel, the most enjoyable part was playing with the dogs and cats during their stay with us"
good,The other employees were friendly and helpful to new employees and customers. Most of the management was qualified but there were some instances where management seemed under qualified. Schedule was flexible but I did not have enough hours to maintain my cost of living.
good,The team at my store is mostly good with a few exceptions. Some clearly don't care about the animals in our care and are only there for the paycheck. Corporate has made some very bad decisions and budget cuts that make work a lot more stressful. The animals are often not cared for correctly and employees aren't trained on the proper information to care for the animals we sell. Customers are given false information because we are told to guess what we don't know. It is up to the employees to do research.
good,"Way too much work, favoritisms among staff. Personally I like the company but my current coworkers aren’t team players. Of course I’m sure not every store is like that. Way too much focus in customer service not completing tasks. Unrealistic goals."
good,"I think it's a great place to work if you're young and you genuinely love pets. But you have to know how to handle the animals too. Don't just go in there thinking it's a walk in the park and you can pet dogs all day. It's actual work and needs serious effort. Remember you're caring for other people's pets here. There's many things that can go wrong, not necessarily your fault - but you better be prepared and know how to handle it. Panicking isn't gonna help anything. Things ran pretty smoothly at my location and management was okay too, but I'm sure it varies. Everyone's different. I will say the hiring process took unusually long (about 3 weeks). They're slow to hire even when they're short staffed."
good,"This job is fun and rewarding, it just didn't pay as much as it should have for the amount of work that you are required to do as a dog bather. Otherwise, I really enjoyed working at Petsmart. The dogs are amazing!"
good,"A typical work day depended on the day of the week. In pet care each day you had a different task that needed to be completed to make sure the animals are safe and taken care off."
good,"I do enjoy working at Petsmart. It's a good company to work for, everyone is very friendly and I enjoy the work I do. They are just not offering full time employment and I need full time employment."
good,Required management to work 50 hours and gave a lot of responsibility to each manager but not a lot of staffing or support. Fast paced environment and high demands to produce and get stuff done.
good,"Petsmart was a fun part time job while in school, there was not much room for advancement in the company or any benefits but having animals the discount was nice."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my 10 years with PetSmart. My last three years there are when everything slowly declined. I am a strong believer in enjoying your work. Unfortunately, my Store Manager for the last three years was a cheater, manipulator and user. Despite my best attempts to get transferred peacefully, I was trapped. Prior to that my managers were great. However, all managers that I worked for were typically stressed and usually felt intimidated by upper management (District Managers). But I'm sure that's just about everywhere. The benefits were decent and vacation time grew with length of employment. Ever growing policy manual."
good,"This a CPG environment. Limited room for growth unless you can relocate to the US. Very corporate in its culture and pro-pet to the extreme, best to already have a pet to fit in."
good,"I worked here while I was in school, and the hours were fair to maneuver around. At my store, there was usually only an opening bather and a closer, rarely a mid-shift worker. "
good,"I love working with animal's so it made me happy to know I was doing something positive for them."
good,You rely on others to be fair on the books with dogs. Salon manager did the best he could with what he had to do. A lot of times Petsmart pushed the sales over the needs of the pet. Groomers weren't paid for working on floor unless they didn't commision out for the week. Which was very hard to not be able to.
good,"A daily routine for me at PetSmart is making sure all customers are greeted, checked in, cleaned and clipped. I communicate with the customers about their expectations of the groom they are looking for. Recommending products to improve their pet's health. As manager I make sure that schedules are written, company goals are met by myself and my staff. As a company we strive to keep the pets our number one priority and to be transparent with the ""pet parents"". The most enjoyable part of work is the animals and seeing the sheer joy they give you. I would say the hardest part is making sure my staff understand that policy changes are meant to help protect the animal's safety and drive sales and not to make more work that is ""money driven"" but that all we do is meant to be accommodating to not only the pet parent but them as well."
good,"Company has job titles split into teams which makes everyone’s job as a whole work really well. Morning huddles to motivate you, but small chance to advance unless you want to volunteer and be cross trained as a cashier and not get a raise for it. Otherwise fun and fast paced job with lots of pets as customers."
good,"They teach you everything you need to know about working in retail, as well as provide a lot of safety training, as you will be working with live animals."
good,"It is a enjoyable job, but it can be stressful depending on management. I was trained for over a month, and kept learning during the years I worked there. However, some of the newer associates are only trained for a few days before they are expected to do everything on their own with no problems."
good,"Petsmart days were always pretty active, even during the slow days we still had a steady flow of customers coming in for pet supplies. The managers were very interactive and helped with day to day in-store duties, they were always quick to jump on a register if we were getting swarmed with customers and would promptly attend to customers if an associate was too busy to get to them."
good,"I began my employment part time with Petsmart in 1996,  as a pet bather and was soon offered the opportunity to train through a two year contract with Petsmart, to become a Professional Pet Groomer and through this opportunity , I carried on with my Grooming Career throughout 2015"
good,I found working at PetSmart to be a good experience it has helped me grow as a person and as a employee I learned a lot about animals and working with people and customer sevice.
good,"The grooming salon was much different than the retail part of the store. It was much more competitive and a ""dog eat dog"" world. There was a sense of collaboration when it got down to the nitty-gritty though. I would recommend this for someone who needs some retail experience and if they plan to remain working at a place for more than a year."
good,"I've worked for two different PetSmart stores, and it can be a hit-or-miss with if you get a good manager or not. PetSmart typically gives good hours, and the employee discount is 15%, but only managers can become full-time (or groomers), at least from what I understand."
good,"I worked at PetSmart part-time and it was a great side job for me. The people were professional, yet easy to work with and for. I would work here again. I only left because my son was born."
good,You are always on the move trying to balance taking care of customers and taking care of the animals. If you want to work in animal husbandry this is the place. It can be very stressful to get all tasks done.
good,Great learning experiences and time management. As part time schedules are inconsistent but management will work with personal schedules. If you love pets this place is for you.
good,I love the job but the management in my department is very unprofessional. All their communication with employees is done through text message including sending out the work schedule. Which was given out the evening before the week starts.
good,"working at Petsmart is a good experience. the organization is passionate about pets, however, there is more they could do for their employees. they don't go out their way to help the people who work for them."
good,"Good place to work as a dog bather. I've gained many skills in dog handling and customer service. A typical day for a bather involves checking dogs in and out, and discussing service options with the pet parents; and then bathing, drying, and brushing the dog, trimming and/or grinding their nails, and sometimes teeth brushing and paw pad and sanitary area trims. The salary is not great, but is good for a part-time job."
good,"if you love seeing pets,great. retail can be hard,but just for a part time place to work its not bad at all. anyone would want more money but they are fair for retail."
good,I thought it was a great place to work while in college. The store manager was a fun guy to work for. They are also flexible with your hours while in school.
good,"My time at petsmart was cut short due to personal reasons, when I put in my 2 weeks the management was more then understanding and tried to work with me to see if my circumstances would change. In which they gave me a months leave to see if I would be able to get the help I need to care for my daughter."
good,I started as a petcare associate and soon after trained to be a dog trainer. They pay for you schooling and the trainer I was taught by was very helpful in making me a great trainer
good,A good place to work for groomers. Can be a bit stressful with all the other required task that have nothing to do with grooming though. The pay is great if you can groom 5 plus dogs per day.
good,"I loved working at this PetSmart. It was my favorite job, all my coworkers were great, management was professional but fun, hours were flexible, the work was easy and rewarding, it really was all around a great place."
good,"The staff was not always reliable. Too many people called off too often. The pay could have definitely been better. The people were otherwise great! The management was great as well! Though I think there could be more benefits, I will admit I learned a lot."
good,It was okay til everyone I liked quit. Then new people started coming in and taking advantage of the workplace and of your own personal products. No advancement unless you wanted to become a groomer and go to school for it
good,"MIL starts early 3,4,5 am working trucks and running day to day activities, stocking, pricing, inventory control etc."
good,"really good work environment , not a whole lot of hours but hours can be picked up. Being cross trained in every department is a very good thing to have, so you can pick up extra shifts. Not many full time options but the pets and the pet parents make working at petsmart great!"
good,Great management team but not a lot of advancement opportunities. They work with you and as long as you show up and keep busy you will be treated well by the managers. Petsmart is definitely a corporation so don't expect the company to care about anything except sales. Animals are not a priority with Petsmart so you have to make sure you have a good group of people to keep the petcare/hotel/grooming salon safe for animals.
good,"The people and animals are fun to work with, mostly, but the hours you get as a bather at the petsmart I work for are inconsistent and very low I've been getting only 14 hours for three weeks and now I'm getting only 20 hours."
good,"I had to learn quickly how to multitask. I learned to be able to bathe my dogs and also handle walk in services for nails. I had to be quick on my feet, also having to keep the area clean. Being a bather I had to be cautious on aggressive dogs and had to stay out of their bite zone. I had no problem asking for help or advice whenever I felt uncomfortable."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at PetSmart, making friends, and connections. I worked with I believe 5 managers  and worked well and in favor of all but the last.  It was a shame that my time trying to help people ant their families (pets included) was cut short(on my decision) for disagreements with management. Over all my time there was very enjoyable."
good,"Petsmart is not for those not willing to put in the work.  While the pay is...adequate, every position in the warehouse outside of leadership or clerk positions are hard labor.  "
good,"I enjoy working at PetSmart but they do not have competitive pay rates and i do not feel every employee is paid as fairly as they should be.  Being a retailer, the bottom line is more money for corporate"
good,A typical day at PetsMart was pretty medium paced. I learned a lot about stocking and dates while I was there. the management was fair and very helpful when needed. there really wasn't a hard part with the job there was goal set though.
good,"When I worked in Texas, I loooved my store. I made friends with not only the guests, but with every co-worker. I was allowed a promotion soon after I was hired and was given a set schedule with chances to get more hours. My manager cared for everyone and made everyone great everyday. My new store isn't near as warm and friendly as my old store, but they still are friendly and friendly somedays. Every store is different so it's best to see them in person before judging."
good,"Working for PetSmart was very enjoyable for me. I love animals and loved working with them as well as interacting with people who felt the same way."
good,Only ideal for students or people looking for very part time work. Hours will fluctuate greatly so not ideal for anyone who has bills to pay. Otherwise a very easy going workplace with overall good working conditions. Hard to have a bad day when you're surrounded by animals.
good,"Working at petsmart, I gained the knowledge needed for multiple kinds of animals. It was especially nice to know when buying said animals for myself. I've gained the best of friends and do not regret working at petsmart. Although many of the good employees left and found something more suited and helpful to them."
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful. There are 12 groomers and 3 bathers packed into a tiny salon with no windows and 6 grooming tables. I loved the pay and my managers, but there was only so far you could advance as a groomer."
good,Great temp job . Good hearted people. People work here because they have a strong connection with animals and want to do everything in their power to do what’s best for them.
good,"I love being a pet trainer, at this time sales are low and my commission pay is not what i want or need it to be. "
good,"At times we were busy, other times not. Got to meet a lot of people and their animals. Had to straighten store before and after closing. Management was pretty good."
good,"the day to day experience of the job is pretty much all physical. It can be very tiring. Petsmart offers excellent benefits such as medical, dental, eye. however, the job safety is very low. management doesnt hesitate to tell you, you can be replaced if you arent hitting the productivity goal."
good,"A lot of customer service. Great interaction with co-workers. management is well maintained and helpful. I'm always learning something new at my store. Sometimes it can get overwhelming during the weekends as we get extremely busy but we always tackle every situation with our team player roles. I love helping our customers and making sure they have found everything they were looking for and well taken care of. It's a great place to work, I love it there."
good,"The overall job culture is very fun and easy, however the hours fluctuate often and the pay isn't the best. At times it becomes boring when it's not busy but it's definitely nothing to stress out about."
good,"It takes a special kind of person to have the patience and ability to work with animals who are out of their element and often times not happy about the necessary work being done on them to get a decent haircut and service. I learned to calm myself in stressful situations, connect with customers about their pets and the ins and outs of the grooming process and amount of time it can take to do the job safely. The salon becomes a family and close relationships are formed between everyone who works there."
good,Management is overall awesome. Days go by fast. Fun place to work. There can be some slow days but the team makes it fun. Overall would recommend anyone work there that loves animals.
good,The job isn’t hard however the grooming department is not worth it. I was there for 3 years at first I loved it. Everyone was like family before we had a massive shift in leadership
good,I wouldn't always recommend this place. It was not the best place to work but it wasn't absolutely terrible. The management was my main issue. They didn't have the best management.
good,"Go in with management, clock in and get started. Learned about animals and there needs. Management was good. Not a hard job at all. The pets was the most fun"
good,"If you love pets, its a great place to work. Compensation is fair, but daily hours provided for running the store are too low. When someone calls in it creates a stressful environment for the staff."
good,"It is exhausting work. There is always lots to do and at times very little staff. It can be an enjoyable work place. I love working with animals and the customers are usually quite lovely. It can be quite demanding although and is typically understaffed, which therefore increases the work load, while not increasing the pay."
good,"Overall it was a great workplace. My only problem was I didn’t receive enough hours. I loved everyone I worked with, it was a positive environment and it’s a great place to work."
good,"Only been there for about 3 months but it is a decent place to work, Could pay more per hour but not bad pay if you are looking to only be there until something else comes along better"
good,It was all about the animals and the satisfaction of having all shelves full of product and hearing the customers awknowledge and reward you. Thus maxing out your quartly bonuses! I would always reward my staff members (3) $100.00 Every 4 months. I really enjoyed working there. You would make many animal friends as well has your customers that would come in daily and chat with you.
good,I liked working here. My coworkers and managers were very nice and accommodating. Hours are flexible and you can request changes and days off in advance.
good,Petsmart is an overall great company to work for. Job can be stressful at times when working with animals. Work environment was friendly and safe. Loved working and helping animals and customers everyday.
good,"I worked in petcare, and multiple times i came into my shift and had to deal with other people's work that they were too lazy to complete on their own shift. When confronted about it, they would simply say ""i forgot"" etc when they have a detailed sheet outlining what to do and when to do it on a daily basis. "
good,I liked working for petsmart. my last year there was in the hotel and I got burnt out quickly. I have 3 small children and balancing work and home was difficult because of the requirements for shifts. But I liked my managers and the company. and I had to drive 40 minutes one way everyday for 6 years.
good,I enjoyed working there mainly because I was around animals all the time. I didn’t give here a perfect rating because I am a colleg student and they didn’t always work with my class schedule. I ended up losing a lot of hours that I could’ve worked because of it.
good,"Great enviornment, pay lower end of retail for hourly associates. The push for customer service is weighed heavily by the operational items that must happen in a store. Really a tough one to shift away to the customers."
good,this is a great 1st job to learn customer service skills and animal service skills if you are a hard worker it will pay off as long in the long run you can easily move up to management
good,"Could have had a better experience with things getting handled better but not to bad of a place to work, learned a lot as a person as well as an employee."
good,When i worked at Pet-smart I was mainly a early morning stocker from about 4am in the morning until 9 or 11 am. Making sure merchandise is in the right places. Also was a fork-lift operator pulling and putting up pallets of product.
good,"Good managers and fun animals to work with. Can be difficult for a first job, lots of safety precautions to follow. It is worth it if you can get used to it."
good,"The general manager was very nice as well as the salon manager and most others. Very lovely job, accommodated to my needs and worked well with needing time off. Overall very good job."
good,Drive a pallet rider around pick orders that are sometimes very large and difficult you have to make certain times or you get in trouble you also have to have neat stacked pallets that meet requirements in certain times or you get in trouble
good,Its a really great second job! I've been there for over a year and half and things have been pretty great! Every company has its issues but I've enjoyed working there!
good,A typical day at work is usually slow and then it will get fast and slow down there’s a lot of dogs and dog toys that kids mess with but it’s a laid back to work at
good,"PetSmart was a very good job to me, they always treated their workers with respect and we worked as a team to accomplish big goals. I didn't have to ask my coworkers for help with very many things, but when I did they were always very helpful with me."
good,I loved to take care of the animals everyday and night. Helping people find the right pet to get and the correct products to maintain the health of there pets. Management was very fair and fun to work with.
good,PetSmart is an excellent company to work for with a relatively easygoing atmosphere. Management is quite capable and friendly as well. That being said there could be more chances for advancement in the company on a store level scale.
good,"If you love animals, this is both a wonderful and exhausting job. On the one hand you get to take care of and be around animals, on the other you have to deal with death, and things like customers coming in and being absolutely insane. As an example: During the summer, people will come in with turtles they found outside and want to keep as pets, despite your advice and warnings, will buy a small, plastic carrying container they intend to keep them in."
good,"Hard work"
good,Typical day at work consisted of loading pallets all day long on docked trailers. I learned a great deal on how to improve time management in all aspects of my job. The management was not bad but they care and stress number a great deal. Hardest part of the job is it feels like there is never enough time in the day. Most enjoyable part of the job was time went by fast.
good,"I loved my job at PetSmart. I worked in PetCare so I dealt with the small animals, fish, and reptiles all day. It is a lot of work though because you're required to scrub and siphon fish tanks by a certain deadline in the week. Also, you have to change bedding, feed fish, give medication to any animals needing it, driving to and from vet with sick animals, and assisting customers with any questions they might have. Overall I loved my job and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved animals and is looking for part time."
good,"I loved working at Pet Smart.  I do feel that moving up in the company was done unfairly, I felt it was who you got in good with and not how hard you worked. I still love the company, I guess it was just where I was."
good,Great place to work. Enjoyed my job there. Managers were ok but very young with not a ton of knowledge. If a Pet smart opened up in my town I would defenetly apply there.
good,the work space was stress free was an easy job employees helped each other out everyone works as a group meeting the pets was the best part management was great
good,"Management is fine at petsmart. it is what you make it. as far as regular associates its retail, hours are going to be all over the place and pay is not great."
good,"A typical day at Petsmart was very educational and fun. There were many skills that came with the job title I had to learn and it was always a pleasure when the customers brought in their pets."
good,The job provides a friendly environment filled with workers who take their job serious. They make sure that the store is built upon excellence. I enjoyed the job just looking for a career instead of part-time.
good,"It's a good place to work, but advancing takes time.  Like all retail places the hours you work are all over the place.  I wish there were better selections of pet food, toys etc"
good,"I worked for the company for almost a year. i went from being on the floor graveyard hours, to cashier and a dog bather. If your interested in a certain department they are more then willing to take time to teach you anything you need to know. If your looking to be a dog groomer you work commission based if you do not make your minimum of what your hourly wage would be then they will give you that instead of the commission. they will also pay for your grooming school and expenses with a year contract at signing. my girlfriends are still with the company and have relocated to different states where the company is located. they have paid vacations 401Ks and health insurance. I learned a lot during my time there that I still use on my own animals. I made life long friends there that have carried on every where i've related for the military."
good,PetSmart is a great place to work and they have a great culture.  The culture is very in favor of the hourly associates and they take very good care of them.
good,"For the most part, PetSmart was an enjoyable place to work at... The staff gave me several chances to (improve my life) better myself, however, there were some cons, but that occurs everywhere, if we all (myself included) begin to come together and make changes though, hopefully, things will enhance for all of us and things will get better..."
good,PetSmart has many positions available for employees to grow. It is a massive corporation that allows its employees to experience what it means to be a team.
good,The people and the job were fine.  For the most part I enjoy working there.  The main reason I am now seeking employment elsewhere is because there are not enough available hours.  There is also not enough room for salary growth.  The management is generally really great as far as making the environment a pleasant one.
good,"Very busy grooming salon where stylists answer telephones and check-in customers, in addition to grooming dogs and cats. I learned time management skills and had the support of the company for what I charged and had the discretion to refuse services if I deemed it appropriate; this increased confidence in myself. The job was utterly exhausting, spinning all those plates in addition to grooming and my entire life revolved around it. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the public and the satisfaction I gained helping others and their pets."
good,"I love the team I work with, and working with animals is fun and rewarding. I've been full time for over two years, and I appreciate the paid sick time and vacation time. However, this is still a retail job. Everyone is underpaid (including the managers - one of my old managers left because she made more as a nanny). Corporate is always putting increasingly higher expectations on us, and the customers can be very rude."
good,I enjoyed my time at PetSmart in the PetHotel and Doggie Day Camp. It was nice being able to be around dogs and cats all day and getting to play with them. There were responsibilities of course that needed to be done. Everyone that works there really cares about all the animals and treats them as if they were their own which is probably what I liked most about the environment. There was not really a difficult part of the job other than when it was really busy it was a bit hard to get everything done in a quick and timely manner. The best part of the job is playing with the dogs and puppies all day long.
good,"It is a decent place to work if you like animals, there is plenty of work to be done always and little time for slouching, or sitting down, great management though."
good,"For the most part I like PetSmart. Pay, as a groomer, it's how you apply and push yourself.  Benefits are great.   Hours, not bad if your store has the staff to support. Something that bothers me is that my hours keep getting changed.  So, I have to keep changing my personal responsibilities to fit with a small staff and manager's personal schedule. It is a very fast paced environment that requires PATIENCE, multi tasking, great team skills, great work ethic, MUST BE RELIABLE (this is not a desk job, you have clients and a team relying on you), and the ability to treat the clients, their children (pets), and fellow teammates like family.  PetSmart will give you the tools to be a groomer.  It's up to you to become a great groomer.  At PetSmart, you own your success!  The hardest part of the job is being able to prioritize time, staying cool under stressful situations(these occur daily whether its dealing with a difficult dog, pet parent, personal situation,etc.). The most enjoyable part is getting to build relations with pet parents and their children (pets).  Overall I give employment with PetSmart 3.5 out 5 stars."
good,"Not a great job for students!  You have to stick with the availability you signed on with or else they'll give you the boot.  While they accommodated to my class schedules... literally told me I had to quit my extracurricular activities although I could still work 30 hours a week (???)."
good,"Working in petcare was a great experience.  I learned how to care for animals that I never had, mostly reptiles and amphibians, and enjoyed passing on this knowledge, and what I already knew as a lifetime pet owner, to customers looking for their first pet.  I spent most of my day scrubbing fish tanks and bagging fish and feeder crickets, but the best time was helping customers.  I'd go home smelling of dirty fish water and exhausted, but I also felt full of life."
good,"Absolutely great place to work if you're in love with pets, from cats and dogs all the way down to reptiles and fish. There's really not much more that needs to be said. Good medical, good to occasionally great employee discount, and for the most part, they can work with your schedule... To a point. Keep in mind it is retail."
good,pets smart pets hotel was an exciting job because every day there were newdogs to work with.  there were some repeate customers also.  i usually worked with the large dog group.
good,"Loved working at petsmart with the dogs and building relationships with dogs and the owners. Although very rewarding job it is very difficult and hard working physically. For the work, time and effort put into the job I dont think the hourly wage was near enough, and didnt receive fair raises. after 3 months I got a .10 raise and that was all after over a year."
good,"Good place to work, good employees, and good atmosphere. Being around the animals makes it fun to interact with customers. I'd recommend working there to someone."
good,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart, they were great unfortunately I needed more hours and wanted to experience something different and had to take care of my sick mother and father."
good,"Working as a pet care associate is wonderful if you love people & animals, but it's very stressful. Especially if you work in a store that is chronically understaffed. You basically run the entire store by yourself or with one other person, two if you're lucky. If you open the store you also have a deadline that is unmanageable with one or two people, especially on shipment days. So fun, you get to be around animals, and educate people about them (so be knowledgeable or be willing to learn!), but very chaotic at times. But I had amazing managers. 7/10 would work here again."
good,It's fun working with all of the animals. Some of the new policies hinder you from taking care of them. They make you focus more on the customers than the health of the animals.
good,"I worked at 2 locations. The first location in VA was amazing. Management knew their jobs and excelled. The petcare department was an actual team and every person had a voice. This new location is a circus. Two managers are from a company of electronics and never worked a day at PetSmart and knows 4 weeks worth of knowledge, They both only know only what they read off the summary cards about animals. Manager A gives out false information and complains to anyone that is there to listen about everyone and everything. Manager B blames others on his short comings by lying. The store makes new employees feel like they have to prove themselves, I've been with the company almost 2 years, and moving to this store (same title) I feel demoted. The petcare lead is the only one allowed to make decisions, doesn't take recommendations or suggestions, and changes anything that wasn't done ""their way"", P&P standards or not. This store is very hard to work for because it seems only a handful know what they are doing."
good,A day at PetSmart is mostly good. I learned alot about fish and reptiles. The hardest part of the job was all of the cleaning of the tanks. The best part was customers and pets coming in.
good,Working at Petsmart is always fun.Specially when you will be in contact with Pets. For me personally i enjoy the petshotel in Delray Beach fl. We have a good team. every day we have new plan.The big problem for me is the pay by hour is to little.
good,Lots of animal interaction makes this job fun!  It was a good place to work and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a starter or career job.
good,Pet-friendly workplace that emphasizes the love of and for pets. Campus events throughout the month for associates to attend with their pets and learn about the company.
good,Very people friendly and although I was young I really gained sales experience. I learned how to work on people skills and animal skills. Although it was only temporary I felt I worked there for years because of how welcome they made me feel.
good,I loved my job and the people I worked with. There were times when I opened and closed. I got along with everyone and we had fun. The hardest part of my job was dealing with one of the managers. He was rude to the women that worked there. I learned how to work in Pet Care and how to read the SKUs when I stocked. I really didn't have grumpy customers. Everyone was so nice.
good,"If you love animals, and aren't afraid of mice or reptiles or birds or crickets, you'll enjoy being a Pet Care Associate at Petsmart. A typical day includes cleaning cages, distributing food and water, and giving medicine to sick pets. In my experience, my coworkers were mostly always friendly and willing to help with the daily cleaning, customers were always willing to let you pet their dog/cat, however the frequent change in management was not a positive."
good,"hire to many people & dont give many hours."
good,"Was a cashier as well as a dog bather. Fun to see everyone with their pets. However, you still deal with upset customers unsatisfied with products. All in all it's a good beginner retail job"
good,"A typical day at work starts with the review of any critical situations of safety and any managerial issues that have arrived. We then move to daily operations that are priority, being new resets of merchandise, employee designation, and coaching of our employees that we have scheduled for that day. I have learned that after stepping away from the Hospitality industry for over 5 years, that there was a lot more to learn about management alone. The culture at Petsmart is a position in which CARE is a slogan of safety and consistence for all employees. The hardest part of my job is the loss of any of our pet parents' pets. Rewards of my position include witnessing an adoption, assisting  the pet parent choose all of the necessary equipment, and seeing them bond with their pet during the process. A happy environment."
good,"Good company to work for with a relaxed and fun loving atmosphere. There could be more room for advancement in the store level employees. Pay could be slightly better, but overall not bad."
good,fun to work there. management is great and are very flexible with getting days off. the environment is great to work in. all fellow employees are friendly.
good,"I loved working here and I was always learning something new and applying it to my personal growth. I was a member of management and was therefore a key link between associates and higher powers. We were a great team that got along. The workplace culture was always positive, but there were times it seemed we just didn't have the right coverage for what all needed to be done to be successful day-to-day. The most enjoyable to me was completing projects tied to merchandising and presentation (my job) and getting to interact with the customers, finding solutions for their needs."
good,I enjoyed working for Pet Smarts company. They actually had a great work schedule and work compensation. I found working with coworkers at a quick and focused pace was most of all a great experience.
good,My job is pretty much customer service and making sure associates are where they are supposed to be at any given time. I do enjoy working there. My coworkers are awesome and customers are friendly.
good,"A typical day starts off with a review of the previous day to work on moving forward. We also make sure all the animals in our care are healthy and taken care of."
good,Great care for the animals. Not afraid to tell the customer they're wrong (ex: when being scammed at the register) and good friendly environment. I really did enjoy my time there. Transfers to different stores not hard to do.
good,Fast Paced environment with minimal advancement opportunities. Lower management team is great with Senior leadership team being dis-connected. Overall enjoyed my time but not sure if I would recommend during the reorganizing phase they are going through now.
good,"I absolutely loved working for PetSmart. Great opportunity for advancement, if you work hard and want to move up within the company you absolutely can."
good,"I love and MISS this job so much! While the benefits for its employees are NOT good at all...and they really do NOT care for their workers.Those that are hired are awesome people! It is a fun place to work and there is always something to do! The pay is not great...but with the right management you can move up quickly. Just as long as you are a reliable, diligent and courteous employee. I have some great memories of my 4 years with this company :)"
good,I love working as a senior pet care specialist. It's plenty of fun and you get to meet many caring pet parents and super adorable dogs and cats. You get to be able to take care of many dogs and make sure they have the best stay while their families are away.
good,"I have the blessing of working at a Petsnart location with great management, through the district level, and I love it. It's interesting, engaging, and varied work. However, the quality of the job is massively dependent on your management team. Overbearing or uncaring, either type of poor management will make getting any work done nearly impossible. With good managers, I have freedom for creativity, flexibility, and input as to my job requirements."
good,"Generally a day at work consisted of cleaning animal cages, watering and feeding the pets. Most of the co-workers were generally very nice and fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting t be around pets all day long."
good,"I worked for the company in 2 different locations and the atmosphere is polar opposites of each other. One seemed to feel like family as the other was more of a strictly business relationship within the workplace. Also, if another employee has a higher up job then a report against them does near nothing."
good,A typical day at petsmart was very fun and everyday was different. Many different people with a lot of different pets.Everyone was friendly and made you feel welcome. The store had a very strong team and was very attentive to customers that needed help when requested. the hardest part of the job was not being able to find a customer what they needed because the store carried almost everything. the best part was dealing with customers and their loving pets
good,I love working at petsmart because you get to see new puppys and work with a great staff. the management is fair. the co workers are amazing. the most enjoyable part is the environment
good,"Difficult to advance in the company, priorities are on quality though. Truly care about pets and want to make sure every customer is taken care of. Good focus on adoptions too"
good,Great and fun place to work. Always moving. Never gets boring. Time flies by really fast.Pay is fairly good starting out to. They are good at accommodating schedules
good,My jobs at Petsmart were always fun! I loved meeting all the animals and working with them. My favorite job in Petsmart was the grooming salon. Some days were difficult due to difficult dogs but I always enjoyed meeting new people and getting to know their fur babies!
good,The management is very poor and Petsmart store are struggling with loss prevention. The turnover rate is really high because of the poor managment. The animals are always very well taKen care of.
good,"A typical day at Petsmart involved keeping shelves stocked, unloading truck on truck day, helping customers find the right products for their pets.  Helping them carry heavy purchases to their cars.  Learning about the different options of food and grooming for specific breeds or animals with special needs  Keeping my work area  clean and tidy."
good,I learn how to be a good worker. How to organize stock and ask for help when needed. I always smile and am nice. I was there on a job training program thru Lorain county. I started around september 1998 and work for two weeks.I ended in September 1998.
good,"A typical day, involves standing behind a cash register.  Roaming the floor checking on customers, recommending various products (Dog Foods, Flea Tick treatments, Leashes Harness, ect...) Lots of 'Zoning' (Going through the store, pulling items to the front, making the store presentable to customers, restocking shelves, ect...) Catching fish and other live animals, making recommendations about Pet Care and habitat setups."
good,"My team at PetSmart, specifically in the salon, was one of the best teams I've ever had the pleasure of working with. "
good,Team members were fantastic and we worked well together for a common cause. Helped out a lot of pet owners with their dogs and cats.
good,Had fun working there. Pay had a lot to be desired when I worked there. Worked with a great team of people there. I would recommend working there
good,This is a decent place to work if you can handle the typical negatives of working retail. The management is a little rough but the other coworkers are amazing to work with. I thoroughly enjoy working with animals everyday.
good,"Petsmart is a very nice company to work for. Managers are really there to help make your life easier and want to hear your concerns and questions. I have learned so much over the year I have been there. My skills with animals, customer engagement and service have increased greatly."
good,I helped run doggie day care. I learned a lot about dog and cat behavior and how to care for them. I loved getting to work with the animals everyday.
good,"PetSmart serves the pet parent community with many products and services."
good,The managers are great. Fun environment. Hours vary depending the season. There is room for growth within the company.
good,"Fast past ever changing environment, that provides the opportunity to think out of the box to drive sales and build moral within the team."
good,"As soon as you walk in the door its very fast paced. You look at the computer to see how your day is going to go. You check in your dogs you put them in kennels. Then you bath and do what ever the customer wants done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an aggressive dog. The most enjoyable part of the job is the dogs. I enjoyed my co-workers,"
good,"I learned how to bathe dogs. Management was good and i didnt really communicate with my coworkers, The hardest part was lifting big dogs and bathing them fast paced."
good,Great place to work if you love animals and enjoy taking care of them. Customer service is key to making people happy. It is always nice working with animals.
good,"This job taught me a lot about working with people. I learned how to do inventory and work out on the floor, as well as how to stock and place everything corectly. I truly enjoyed and job, my only problem was there was no full time postitions."
good,"I have always had business however, management refused to understand the duties in the salon. I maintained great client relations unfortunately I worked with a staff who lacked knowledge, and patience with animals and co-workers."
good,"I worked at Petsmart for 2 years. I enjoyed it and it became fun as long as you are knowledgable about animals. I found the management somewhat lacking and had to ""self manage"" the department I was working in. This job is great as long as you are experienced with animals."
good,"Working at the PetsHotel is challenging but also very rewarding. "
good,"i enjoyed educating customers. always busy, never and down time easy to keep busy. management needs more experience with handling employees."
good,Very fun to work in the pet hotel. It could get messy but that is expected for the job. Being around all the dogs and cats was very pleasing.
good,A typical day at work was always fun as there was always new stories being told by the customers that would come in and there puppies or the animal that they owned i learned alot about the different types of food and nutrients that animals need. My coworkers were always fun to be around they always left there bad mood at the front door and there was always laughter at work.The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and their pets.
good,"I was responsible for the following:"
good,"Was a great place to work, went private and is now being gutted. They expect results but they have taken away all the tools and resources needed to do so"
good,"It really was a great place to work. Everyone was so nice and friendly. It's amazing getting to see all the different types of dogs that come in, or cats that get adopted out. If you are a cashier, the schedule is part time, so you have a life outside of work, but they pay around $8.25/hr, so if you have bills, part time on that hourly rate doesn't really cut it."
good,"As an Operations Manager, I handled total store operations. A typical week at work included ensuring everyone was on task and was in line to meet their goals. Scheduling uses the PS² program. Implemented and executed new policies or practices. Processed payroll. Completed all steps of hiring process. Continually trained and coached associates and managers. As managers, our highest priorities were taking care of our associates and our customers. The pets made this the best retail company I've ever worked for and we, as a company, took pride in the fact that we had facilitated the adoptions of nearly 7 million pets through the years. I'd never regret working for Petsmart."
good,"While working at petsmart i learned every section possible so i could always cover people when they called out , the management saw my dedication to the job and co workers loved working with me . Petsmart was truly a good experience. I loved animals so it made the job even better. Hardest part was stocking cause a time basis but once learned can become easy. Most enjoyable part was all of it."
good,"My co-workers were very passionate about the animals that were being taken care of. I helped customers go through the necessary paperwork to adopt a pet. Most of the day, I walked the dogs and kept them busy until a interested customer asked to meet them. The hardest part of the job was keeping the dogs at their happiest without any of them fighting each other."
good,"Great place to work, very innovative and forward thinking. Company was bought by a private equity, and a bright future was planned."
good,good place to work for retail management.  The company really allows for a good work and home life mix for employees.  Three weeks of vacation when hired.
good,I liked working at Applebee's because you could work as much as you wanted to. You could also get off of work whenever you had to.
good,"Learned a lot, worked hard alot of overtime was offered."
good,"A typical day at PetSmart was a combination of doing cashier, stock, cleaning, and a lot of customer service. I got hired right when the extended hours kicked in for the holidays so I had about close to 40 hours week but then they went down to 28. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with! My love for animals definitely grew!"
good,"It was a fun place to work because I love animals, but it was stressful at times. Management wasn't very understandable, which made life harder. Some co-workers in the salon were easy to get along with, while others were very difficult and had bad attitudes. The best part of the job was getting to see your favorite and best behaved client dogs. The hardest part was trying to explain to the pet parents that the groomers cannot make a dog look like a different breed (ie. making a Maltese look like a Poodle.) Another difficult thing was trying to explain to the owners that their dogs were matted and needed to be shaved, not just brushed out, as well as explaining that we did not take walk in grooms, everything has to be scheduled. Many pet parents were not understanding about certain issues, such as not being able to groom a dog because it was too stressed out, or not being able to clip its nails because it was biting us."
good,PetSmart is a great company to work for. Work life balance was exceptional for a retailer.  Internal promotions outside of the stores are difficult are not a priority of the company so advancement is tough.
good,"The place has typical job drama but things are difficult with recent company by outs. The training is not as good as it used to be and most associates are now only part time. Coverage was difficult and some of the managers were tough to deal with. You can try to share information with them when you know something is being done wrong, but in their mind they have been doing this longer and will always know more. But I did love working with the people there and learned a lot about animal care and animal training. You do have to clean up messes left behind by people and their pets. But working with the animals, to me, is well worth it. The pay is horrible, but that is retail part time for you."
good,I have worked with animals for 30 years and willing to learn more in detail when grooming pets. I am a very responsible hard working person and can have a out going personality with co-workers. I am still learning as a groomer but very eager to work with someone if given the chance.
good,"They teach you about the animals your store has and what they need before you go on the floor. The training that they give you is pretty extensive and thorough and everyone is really nice about teaching you everything you need to know."
good,"Over my seven years of working at Petsmart, i have seen a lot go through the doors. As with any job, its a good job, as long as the people you work with are trustworthy and able. retail is not as easy as some would have you believe. Making quotas, keeping customers happy, and not getting the company ripped off is a hard balance to achieve sometimes. especially when the customer has decided for themselves that they are getting something for free and they can't. "
good,"Fun work place, if you need help there are always a person that will come and help or try to help. Easy going when it is busy and not busy everyone has a good vibe inside the store."
good,"Great part-time job. "
good,". I've strengthened my ability to work on my own initiative, prioritizing workloads to meet targets with great customer service professionalism. I always wear a smile on my face and do not let my personal business interfere with my profession. I am mature and detail oriented and extremely organized. I am never tardy and have left work sick once in almost 2 years. I was Employee of the month a few months after I stated working at the Pets Hotel and moved to Employee of the district a month or two later. I am extremely dedicated and a very hard worker. I am a meticulous record keeper and very tidy. I am used to working the front desk of the hotel and know how to navigate through all duties required. I am able to complete tasks which involve working in a team or independently. I am the first point of contact for clients and also capable to work under pressure and to meet deadlines as required. I achieve good results to the best of my abilities to work towards agreed objectives and follow policies and procedures. I am always keen to expand my knowledge and gain additional experience."
good,well my time at petsmart was short. I don't know about benefits or advancement it was a great place to work co-works and management was great.
good,Enjoyed working with Pets. Had a lot of fun working there. Enjoyed working with my coworkers and management. It is retail though so holidays are very busy
good,"i really liked the client associate relationships that were built there, the petcare manager is wonderful to work with"
good,.Best part is seeing pet owners in the store. As a cashier it's really simple to complete transactions. The store's systems need to updated as PetSmart stays behind on technology.
good,"The work day depends on which position you are in."
good,"I worked in the PetsHotel, the names pretty much says it. Really fun environment working and caring for dogs and cats. You get to feed, play, care and clean after all the pets. You really get to learn a lot about them. The work environment during my time was a fun, productive time. As an animal lover it was really fun working so hands on with the pets. Manager at the time was not very ethical, but was let go since my time here."
good,"grooming 5 to 7 dogs a day, I was taught to groom there and will always be grateful for that."
good,"i enjoyed working here for the most part for the animals, but the manangement was very poor at taking care of the employees, and always never wrote the schedule right."
good,Working at PetSmart was good because you get to meet people every day that love pets. Coworkers were friendly and enjoyable to work with.
good,"- Would go in early morning to work freight, once store opens would continue to work freight and help customers. "
good,"I love working at Petsmart! What I mainly did was help customers with any questions about setting up habitats, care for animals, products that'll help cure fish tanks, and selling them animals that they want. I also took care of the in-store pets. Feeding, cleaning habitats, and looking over for any illness and determining on how to treat it. "
good,"Greeted customers entering establishment, received payment by cash, check, credit cards, or automatic debits. Issued receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. Maintained clean and orderly checkout areas and completed other general cleaning duties, such as mopping floors and emptying trash cans. Stocked shelves, and marked prices on items. Gave my full attention to what other people were saying, took time to understand the points being made, asked open ended questions when appropriate, without interrupting at inappropriate times."
good,"Furnished excellent customer service by managing and resolving pet and maintenance issues."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure all dogs are well taken care of (have water, food).  Also, overseeing the dogs in camp.  Camp is 9am-5pm and the dogs get to play in an enclosed area.  "
good,"Typical day at petsmart is stocking merchandise, helping customers and making sure of a neat/organized backroom. I learned more about stocking and general backroom skills from this job. My co-workers are great teachers throughout my learning experience. The hardest part of the job was the physically labor but it is also the most rewarding part of the job."
good,"Good life and work balance, Company operates under tight budgets which is good, makes it challenging and a good opportunity to learn. Operations manager position is very dynamic it requires direct involvement in different areas such as merchandising and specialty. Absolutely love the day to day challenges of a mid size specialty retail establishment."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I helped set up and open this store.
good,"Managing all employees including salon.  I learned a lot about how to manage people, and how to run services.  The company micromanages a lot and focuses on a lot of things that don't help the business.  Co-workers have the same interest as each other which makes it easier to work with most of them.  Hardest part of the job is balancing helping customers, dealing with new priorities, managing, and running the service.  The most enjoyable part of the job is actually the same as the hardest part.  The challenge made it enjoyable."
good,"Nearly everyone here is trained in most departments so there is an atmosphere of wanting to help others. The associates go out of their way to not only help each other but to take care of the needs of the customers as well. While going through a tough time personally, I was always asked how I was doing and what could be done to make things easier on me. The people genuinely care about each other and the people they are there to assist. The pay is not great and there are no benefits for part timers but from a large retail store that isn't surprising. The managers are very caring but have their bad days just like the rest of us. They try their best to give everyone the days off that they want/need and keep everyone happy. Sometimes there feels like there isn't enough hours in the day to accomplish everything needed to be done, but that is going to happen no matter what job you have!"
good,"- Pull and fill store merchandise orders"
good,"Pet smart is a good place to work for. Ablity to work with some animals, and learn about pet products."
good,"your part of the team, you are able to control your own business"
good,"Received a lot of hands on training as well as accredited training through the corporation. The compensation could've been better, but I did get a lot of clients in the door because it was publicly advertised. Worked at 3 different stores. Longest I worked for the company was one year straight (Oct '09 -Oct '10) at the Jacksonville, NC store. I left the stores because of my husband's job relocating."
good,"I loved working for PetSmart. Great people, great work and it was awesome looking forward to coming to work everyday."
good,"Long hours for managers, work can start to take over life balance. Decent pay for associates and managers and great benefits package"
good,"The company is great for lower level employees such as cashiers and sales floor people. The management typically runs around all day managing tasks while helping customers and end up not getting anything done. The labor hours are extremely tight. Essentially just enough employees to check customers out at register, bag fish and stock shelves. Everything else is on the managers."
good,Overall a great retail company to work for.  The company has a great mission that it is working towards.  Working with pets and customers is always a pleasure.  Overall store management environment is tolerable.
good,"Liked working with customers and their pets, employees always kept it fun to work they have an uplifting  attitude"
good,"As a manager, my main duty is acting as the closing manager of the store. When I come in, I determine the objectives of the day from the mid-shift manager and go from there. My duties include, customer service, store recovery, managing associates, register and vault room duties, and properly filing paperwork. On days I am not closing the store, I work in another department of the store such as cashiering or the pet care department. Since I started at my current job, I have done nothing but learn a grow my leadership skills. I very much enjoy talking to people which helps me a lot in helping customers and associates alike."
good,Nothing really special about this place.  In all honesty it is entirely average in every way.
good,"When I came into this job the turn around rate of employees was very high, they were adjusting the production rate with in 4 months time they had adjusted the rate two times. The rates were very hard to keep up. "
good,"I worked in the pet care department, so a typical day was bagging fish and crickets for customers, assisting them and answering any questions they had about any of the animals we sold. I was mainly a closer, so for closing we misted all the reptiles, make sure everyones water bottles and food bowls are filled, change any bedding that looks like it needs to be changed, also you medicate the sick animals, keep up with each of their charts and write down their progress. You also keep up with food and water for the animals in the new arrival room. "
good,"Responsible daily for all operations of the business from payroll, training, P&L and much more. The hardest part of my job was I did not have a work life balance with petsmart and after 80+ hours a week in work it became not a good balance. I loved learning about animals and other aspects of the business like dog training and grooming. I learned how to find a work life balance with my current job and what I am looking for in a career."
good,"PetSmart is without a doubt a very successful company, although it as a corporation takes very poor care of their employees. They don't take employee concerns & issues very serious & LOVE to point fingers. I enjoyed my job there but I didn't feel appreciated or valued which sometimes made me question my belonging there."
good,This was a great place to work until their views as a company changed.
good,It's wonderful working at a store where you can see pets ad talk with customers about them. Very enjoyable and laided back.
good,"I would go into work and make sure all animals had food and water. I cleaned cages and assisted customers. I loved my coworkers, they were always there to help when I needed it. The management was helpful and there for us when we needed it. The hardest part of the job was getting hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people that were passionate about animals like I am."
good,Working as a groomer in petsmart is a great opportunity..you have a never ending pay check and it is up to you on how much you make and of course the business that comes in.. if you can build long term relationships with customers you will constantly have work..standing for long periods of time with no where to sit other then a break room on lunch is not too fun..also management is very caddy and will pick and choose favorites have experienced this at numerous of petsmarts
good,"Great company to work for. Lots of advancement at the beginning. Unfortunally due to the hault in stores opening in maine the chance for advancement has stopped."
good,"I only worked for the Phoenix Corporate office on a temp job but wish it could have been longer.  I am now living in Florida and wish I could work for this company again.  People I worked with were friendly, enjoyed their jobs and all the people I talked to were pleased with the benefits."
good,"overlooking management issues, that you have at every place you will work, petsmart is a good place to work. you are always busy, you get to enjoy all different types of people, and animals. what other place can you encounter a domesticated wolf, a burmese python, and a monkey, along with dogs cats birds small animals and reptiles?"
good,"Personally, I loved Petsmart. They value their employees, their customers and, above all, make sure that your pet is taken care of no matter what. The company does quite a bit to make sure that everything is moving smoothly in the same direction and at its best. They are the only company that I worked for that valued doing things right over fast and cheap and it shows in much of what they do. They did make a few changes in order to compete with other stores so it's not AS great but still head and shoulders above most out there. The only issue I had was that, at the management level, they move people from store to store at the drop of a hat in order to get different results at different locations. It's a big downside for the managers and often results in lower level managers leaving. No one wants to get a job at a store 5 minutes from your house and then, 6 months later, you are having to drive over an hour to get to a different store they transferred you to. However, if that's not the biggest problem for someone, it's not a bad place to work at all."
good,"* Opening / Closing management responsibility. Balance workload, while providing direct customer service. Assign associate daily project list. Follow up through the day till completion."
good,"A typical day at work will always be busy and full of plenty of things to do. Whether I am assisting a customer or working behind the scenes caring for the pet, there is no doubt that every employee is on the move . The environment is pretty fast pace though it is extremely important to complete tasks with accuracy and pride to ensure that pets are receiving the best conditions. I've learned more than I've ever learned about fish and small animals while working at pet smart. It's definitely no doubt that I love what i do."
good,"generally a good place to work,not a lot a stress,fairly relaxed atmosphere,dependent upon also which store you work at.good chance for advancement."
good,This is a solid company to work for. There is room for advancement and for groomers the salary has no limit on what you can earn. The bad thing is that you will work every weekend and holiday. Your schedule will also be all over the place all the time. 
good,"I enjoyed working there - the multiply times i returned, but the company is too big to care about their employers"
good,"I really enjoyed starting at Petsmart, I got a chance to learn a lot about varying breeds of dogs, different canine behavior and I really improved my general education on other animals such as reptiles and small mammals. It was a lot of fun watching all the people come in with their pets and especially loved fun events like picture days. The staff were always wonderful and always appeared to have my best interest at hand. Their were occassionally overly demanding expectation of my time at the time, since I was a teenager."
good,Working at Pet Smart is definitely a different experience. Animals being brought in and out at a constant pace keeps things up beat and lively. Co-workers in the store are the sweetest people one could imagine working with. Things stay very organized and it is easy to talk to anyone there is there is a problem about something. I very much enjoy working there.
good,This place by far was my favorite place to work. The associates were great and you got to play with dogs all day in daycamp. You took care of family members for those who had to go away. Management was great. My co workers were awesome. Hardest part of the job was telling a Client that there dog got hurt in daycare.
good,"Daily operations included medicating sick animals, feeding their cages, cleaning the cages designated for that day. There was also an expectation to be knowledgeable about the animals your caring for as they for sale to customer. As the manager of the pet care department I was in charge of 8 other employees and ensuring that these tasks were accomplished thoroughly."
good,I had return customers that I enjoyed helping. I enjoyed working with my co workers it was like a big family.
good,A typical day at this job for me is just ringing customers up and making sure the shelves look good. You learn great customer service skills. All of my co-workers and managers are very laid back and nice to work with. The hardest part about this job is when you have to be to work by 3 am but once you get there its not to bad. The best part about my job is getting to work with the animals.
good,"My responsibilities are ensuring that every pet parent is fully satisfied with their dogs grooming experience. In the process of each dog’s bath, I have to clip and sometimes file toenails, shave pads of feet, sanitary areas, and matts if the dog has any; clean out the ears and pluck any necessary ear hair; cleaning glands externally, and making sure dog is thoroughly bathed, dried, and brushed before parent arrives for dogs pick up. We also are required to sell a percentage of add-on services to bath and grooming visits, based on the needs of the pet, to meet quotas every week. I assist other groomers with checking in and out their dogs and bathing if needed, so that we are able to meet our required time limit per dog and ensure the safety and security of pets by adhering to all grooming policies and procedures. Answering phones, completing weekly call logs, and scheduling appointments are also a part of daily functions."
good,"good company to work for, very enjoyable environment, good co worker, safe warehouse"
good,"I love being around animals, and PetSmart gave me the opportunity to learn and expand my knowledge of small animals. Customers were most always pleasant and the management was excellent at communicating with the employees. My co-workers were very nice and I have nothing but nice things to say about them. The hardest part of the job was getting up early. The most enjoyable part of the job was the animals and the customers."
good,"The job itself and the people are quite wonderful. I learned how to manage time and how to better help people while keeping up in a hectic scenario. Because of hours, there was a lack of people to do jobs sometimes, but that just meant having to press on harder. My work ethic has always been up for the challenge!"
good,"I opened this Petsmart in Mattoon Illinois as an operations manager. I was responsible for all aspects of opening a new store such as hiring, merchandising, ordering supplies, making schedules, training and community involvement."
good,"A typical day would start with walking dogs, cleaning up for and after pets. My Co workers are really friendly, and the management is great. Some dogs are really angry and a certain precaution must be taken to ensure everyone's safety."
good,"i learn all kind of dogs breeds and how to work with them,how they act,I feed them give them water,give them baths,took them up and back,and watch them in day camp,feed the cats,my boss was so cool,she work out my hours for me,she was more like a friend then a boss,she will not make someone else do something and not do it to,she help out when we did not have someone to go in the dog camps,I made few friends I hung out,I had one who was so cool,made my day better every time I come into work,the hardest part was being in day camp for all day,just out for 30 mins,when we had to check back on who work,it was hard to lessen to dogs all day, the best part was having a job i like going to,and a great boss."
good,PetSmart just seems like many corporations in that they only care about the money they are bringing and little else. Our pay was great and the benefits were excellent but everything else was terrible.
good,"a typical day at work would be cleaning out dirty rooms for both cats and dogs walking them feeding them going into doggie day camp for 3 hours of play time and assisting the supervisor with nail trims or grinds then helping with check outs or check ins. my co workers are all hardworking and love the animals we work with and always try and comfort them when scared. the hardest part of the job is having more than 150 animaks in the facility and having only a couple people on the shift working, the most enjoyable would be the dogs and how sweet or funny they can be."
good,Advancement is fast in this place if you do your work and prove your worth. I have seen cashier become managers in months.
good,"A typical day includes all day customer service. As well as insuring the small animals, reptiles, birds, fish, in my care are taken care of. Working three years at petsmart I have been fortunate enough to have great management at the store level. I am responsible for 5 - 6 employes in my department and though they all have their strengths and weaknesses the department has become quite self sufficient since I have started. The hardest part of my job is that I am spread thin amongst my department as well as the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I receive praise for the appearance of my departments and when I make my sales plan for the week."
good,"I have worked at Petsmart for almost 9 months now and it's not all I expected. I work in the Pet Care department, so I'll be the person you come to if you want help with aquatics, reptiles, hamsters, birds, guinea pigs, etc. You have to have a wealth of knowledge on all of these animals as well as the proper living conditions for these animals. With that being said, the pay sucks for what you're required to know. On top of that you have to deal with a variety of customers some REALLY nice some the complete opposite. All in all if you have patience and a love for animals then you can over look the negatives and appreciate the job. I'd give it a 3 out of 5 stars, because the company strives for excellent customer service, which I, as a customer can appreciate. Also, my managers are constantly recognizing me when I do something above and beyond, so that's also appreciated."
good,"While at PetSmart, I worked in the small animals area and was responsible for taking care of the various animals throughout the store. I cared for sick animals and ensured that the habitats were clean and safe. Along with the other associates in small animals, I was responsible for educating customers about the care needed for any animal they were interested in purchasing. This job required researching and learning about all the different animals in the store and being able to successfully communicate with people from all backgrounds and walks of life in order to insure that the animals that left the store were cared for appropriately. The most rewarding parts of this job were the people I met, caring for the animals, and being part of a team. The only parts of the job that I had a difficult time with were worrying that the animals would not be appropriately cared fro upon leaving the store and the occasional rude or combative customer. More often than not, the animals received a safe loving home, however, there were a few occasions where deceased animals were brought back to the store and I would often question whether or not I had given the individual enough information and the correct tools to successfully care for their pet. I enjoyed my coworkers and the managerial staff was friendly and appreciative of my hard work and dedication to the store and animals."
good,"While value is set high for associates their compensation does not reflect such. The work environment is face paced, yet enjoyable."
good,The biggest part of a Manager is associate and management development. Really big about promoting from within.
good,"I absolutely love my job at petsmart. My typical workday can vary to running the cash register, working the petcare department, and even stocking. I do almost everything in the store because I am so well rounded. Not only have I learned a lot about animals but I have also learned how to deal with customers and their pets. When customers come into the store they expect the best and that is what I give them. Even though the job does get stressful I always excel with shining colors at the end of the day to make for happy customers."
good,"PetSmart is a very rewarding company to work for, but it is an extremely stressful work environment."
good,"Working with animals was a great experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it and if you were a pet owner, you were given great benefits for both you and your animal (such as inexpensive vet bills, free dog bathing, and a free training class). On multiple occassions however, I had issues with the lack of teamwork in the grooming salon."
good,"It is definitely the best place I have personally ever worked but I have worked at some pretty bad places too. Most of the managers are cool except there is one who makes not only me but almost everyone else dread coming in to work with them. They are a very controlling, extremely nosey and very condescending whether they mean to be or not. Someone said something to them once about the way they talk to people and they got mad..."
good,"I worked at the Petsmart in Waterloo for a little under a year. I loved it. Until around December, the previous store manager left and the one from Guelph was brought in. Previously, the store environment was very relaxed, everyone was friendly and got along, and everyone was passionate about pets. The schedule was very flexible, if you needed time off, you got it. When the new store manager came in she was very specific about her expectations and left no room for error. She would immediately write someone up for not doing specific things or not following specific scripts. Before her, I had never seen or heard of someone getting written up or even in trouble since she had been hired this was now regular practice. Promptly after her employment, most of the original staff who had been working there for many years left. Her management style was not flexible and made everyone miserable. I know this environment does not apply for every Petsmart location, and I adored my time there prior to applying, but I would now be wary of applying and perhaps go to the Kitchener location instead if that is available to you."
good,"Overall I enjoy my role as a Pet Trainer. It has given me the opportunity to work around dogs and cats and learn about their breeds/types as well as their temperament. It has also given me the opportunity to recognize unusual or concerning behaviors for cats and dogs. With this job, you will also learn knowledge of safety around animals and how to handle different situations."
good,I enjoyed working there and honestly still would be if I was not forced to move suddenly. The work was fun and you got to meet some interesting dogs and people.
good,Petsmart is a really great environment and I like the people I work with. I am currently a bather and I work with all breeds of dogs. I enjoy it most days.
good,"I love the people here and there's a sense of collaboration and support between QA, developers, product owners and business analysts.  As a contractor, I don't really have any input on benefits."
good,"Typical retail drawbacks, otherwise good company to work for.  Mixture of outside hiring and internal promotions. You will do well if you own your own development."
good,"I would have to open the store sometimes, close it other times. As long as you did what you had to do it was a pretty chill workplace. Sometimes it'll be busy, other times it wouldn't be. I liked most of my coworkers but some were passive-aggressive to me for reasons I am not really sure about. You get to pet and give treats to all the good doggos which was probably the best part of the job, to be honest."
good,"fast paced, collaborative and enjoyable workplace. many oppertunities for advancement, great position for people looking for part time work in a welcoming environment"
good,I enjoyed my job but had to leave due to moving back to Missouri. I was able to advance and was given a raise in salary quickly. I enjoyed working with the public.
good,"It had its ups and downs but overall I enjoyed my time with the company, and given the opportunity to work there again, I just might. Work was simple but sometimes taxing (specifically in reference to the grooming salon. I didn't work on the floor.). Management was good for the most part. I didn't engage with too many team leasers other than my SL."
good,"A typical day at PetSmart would consist of me feeding and taking care of the animals, cleaning the animal habitats and helping customers. Sometimes I would help with backup at the register."
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers and their pets. Cashiering is simple and easy. Everyone is nice and friendly. Talking with pet parents about their pets is my favortie as well as meeting their pets!
good,"Management while I worked there was actually pretty great. The managers had your back, and they were supportive. The job was fun and fairly easy. I would go back if I could."
good,It's a nice job to get by college or if you need any side money. The work space at PetSmart is friendly and everyone gets along but when a crowd comes is when things get serious.
good,"PetSmart is a good company to work for especially for anyone looking to work with animals or learn new skills.  It's tough work that keeps you on your toes but is very fulfilling.  My only complaints are, as a Pet Trainer, they don't really give much time to complete the tasks required of the job and once you take on the position there is little to no room for advancement within the retail management side of things.  Also, the compensation isn't the best for Pet Trainers with commissions being about 20% of $120 and then that being doled out over a six week period.  I would recommend this job for someone looking to start training pets but it's not a long term career option."
good,"When I arrived to work, I would normally already have a dog ready for me to bathe and blow dry. I didn't have to many duties on the job besides wash up dogs. Half of the time I would sweep up the shaved fur from dogs being groomed and book appointments for all clients, as well as give dogs hands on assessment for approved services."
good,"The pet care associate position has a bit of a steep learning curve, as in addition to the intermediate knowledge of dog and cat ownership that all associates obtain, they also learn to care for reptiles, small mammals, birds, and fish. Keeping the store's animals healthy and happy is about half the job, advising pet parents on caring for theirs is the other half. Helping a prospective pet parent select the right type of pet and setting them up for success is both the most terrifying and rewarding part of the job. I thoroughly enjoyed the work despite building an increasing allergy to birds and a collection of hamster bites (more startling than painful). Every weekday has a different set of animal enclosures to clean while going through daily feeding. Animals do occasionally get sick and sometimes don't make it, which can be tough to deal with. Weekends were always nice to work because there were no cleaning tasks, mostly just tidying while waiting for a customer to need assistance. The adoption agencies regularly had events on weekends and it was always nice to see a family take home a new companion and help them get new toys and gear. The associate discount encouraged us to buy branded products so we could share our own experiences with customers. Every associate working with me at the time had at least one pet, so there was a lot of bonding over shared experiences."
good,Liked grooming but company expect more work but they want safety doesn’t go hand in hand. You get November and December blackout time that you can’t take vacation which is not okay
good,"a typical day a petsmart would include taking care of the shrink wrap, cardboard and trash. sometimes having to clean offices and bathrooms. I worked 12 hour days for 3 days then off four days. I was trained to operate a floor scrubber, pallet rider and a tugger."
good,Decent place to work easy work just quick paced great incentives easy to move around great warehouse vibe great vending machine choices the harder you work the more you get paid
good,Everyone is very kind to each other and to the customers and willing to help each other. Seeing the smiling faces of pet parents after they pick up their dogs from the salon was always my favorite part of my day.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working for PetSmart the issues I did face was due to Management. I, at first had an awesome work environment and team. Due to a few health setbacks I was forced to quit through a FMLA leave."
good,"Fast paced, calm work environment. Management is understanding and down to earth. Petsmart is a great place to work part time or full time. The customers are very nice aswell."
good,"I enjoyed helping the pet parents work out the issues with their dogs & finding the right products they needed for any pet in their home.   it was a 2nd job, so sometimes it was a bit tiring after already working a full 8 hours"
good,"I loved working with animals and learning about a llot more products and animals. The only downside to this job is not getting enough hours, unless the store is really understaffed. I also wish there were more opportunities for full time positions. I did enjoy the 15% employees discount + 50% discount on Petsmart exclusive brands!"
good,PetSmart is a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement.  I have learned a lot about pets and their individual care.  There are also many locations so transfering to a different location is fairly easy.
good,It was an easy job but hours were limited to part time associates.  Management was pleasant to work with and understanding when scheduling around school hours etc.
good,"management was detached, only talked to us to discipline. coworkers were friendly, open and cooperative. had to leave for illness and was pestered by management to return even when still in the hospital"
good,"Animals were fun, cashier job wasn't too stressful, did not love management, offered growth opportunities but no but follow through on manager's side, flexible with scheduling"
good,"Loved my job and working with all the animals. I could honestly work there the rest of my life. However, as a single mother, I can’t afford my $1500 bills on a $12.50/hr wage."
good,Some of my lower scores were because of difficult customers. It didn’t have anything to do with the people working there. It is also a corporation so it is always difficult to be a regular employee merely because your opinions are not heard higher up.
good,"Petsmart was rather boring on week days but I enjoyed my time there nonetheless, the managers were kind and helpful as well as personable. I do not recall having any coworkers that I didn't like working with."
good,"Good culture, fun place to work. Knowledge about bet products and pets is a plus. Left for better pay. Smaller stores require multiple roles be filled by same person. Pretty busy at times."
good,"Management was great and understanding"
good,"During the week it wouldn't be too busy but the weekends were very busy and stressful."
good,"Coworkers are nice, most customers are too. Managers help where they can but for Pet care your kinda on your own sometimes they ask to much of you and give little time to do it. The discounts are nice; wish we would get paid much more for all the things we do. Overall a pretty good place to work."
good,"has very good employees, very dedicated to their job and the safety that were taken care of. the staff always had your back if you needed help with anything. overall its a great place"
good,Would reccomend as a decent part time job. Would've enjoyed it much more if there was better management. There was a lot of micro management. Overall not too bad.
good,"A lot of walking and standing. Barely get a break due to the dogs , but can be fun if you love dogs. The staff was friendly and the manager would work around your schedule."
good,"Flexible hours."
good,".Fun place to work, amazing co-workers and managers."
good,"You are expected to go a lot of work and take on grooming a lot of dogs, but they have awesome benefits/ Bathers are expected to do  dogs an hour groomers have a little more control but still dont have much support."
good,The general manager at the time was just okay. I heard there is a new sheriff in town that is 10 times better. I would have enjoyed the job more if other employees would have been more helpful. Lots of drama
good,The job is very productive and constant pace. Everything has to be stocked and ready for customers before the store is open. The pay is low but everyone is confident and respectful in getting the job done.
good,"PetSmart is a good introduction to the working world if your fresh out of high school, and need a part time job, They teach you a lot of the skills on site and will even send you to school if you choose to be a groomer for them."
good,I enjoyed working with the animals and teaching others how to properly care for their new family members. The hobbis fast pace and their's always work to do. You learn something new every day
good,People here are easy to get along with. This company is a great place for a starter job. Also if you love animals it’s a good place to be and meet fellow animal lovers.
good,"Main duties opening post in the morning give to relevant personnel.  Produce the BACS run and set up new customer bank details. Deal with phone queries from customers, post any payments received to customer accounts."
good,My immediately manager was always complaining about never wanting to be there and disliking her job while my bosses boss made it tolerable to work there and also my coworkers when they were not gossiping about others
good,the 2 years i worked there was very laid back with working the shifts and hours i wanted. The management was fantastic. the things i did learn about was all the different products for all the kinds of animals we carried with different store meetings and lectures.
good,I loved the job wish I could go back got hurt to much but I would definitely go back as a floor person best job I have ever had plan to go back for sure
good,"Good for some looking for a stable job and starting hands-on in the pet industry. I eventually had to leave because I wanted to go into Veterinary Nursing and needed to go to school full-time. Worked with some of the best people in the grooming business, but when old co workers moved on, work demanded more from me, but school was more important."
good,"A typical day at work starts of very busy, there is not of knowledge needed. Learned lots about animal products. Management was really friendly and good to work with but lacked time management and not always available to talk."
good,Shift started early giving plenty of time for personal life. Learned a great deal about pet products and the care of pets. The hardest part of the job was meeting time tables for trucks being unloaded and it was enjoyable working closely with pets.
good,"A typical day includes doing about 5 dogs a day. management was great and always very helpful when you had a problem. "
good,"The family you establish within the store is probably the greatest highlight of working at PetSmart (besides the animals, of course). It's a small enough store that you get to work closely with everyone, and the people hired are typically very personable. Customers are usually pleasantly sociable and shop frequently enough to build a relationship with as well."
good,"You get to see all kinds of cute dogs and puppies, and co-workers are great. However unless you are full-time you are never guaranteed hours. I currently am working anywhere from 10-30 hours a week."
good,"Great part time job! I recommend this job for anybody looking for a part time job in Winston Salem, NC. The managers are very nice and all other employees as well!"
good,"Worked here while going to school. Fun place to work, but moving up in the company is really difficult, as there are really not that many open spots, and there is no policy to promote from within."
good,"A typical day at work consist of helping customers find things & answering questions & phone calls , signing customers up for treats program for discounted prices, I learned how to be even more patient when dealing with difficult customers, the workplace culture is fine, the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i was able to make a customer happy with their purchases"
good,I had the best Store manager then the district manager switched him for a terrible non working store manager who gve me no support even though I was in control of the inventory and merchandise
good,Excelent place to start. Room for growth. Management changes often so the tone of the store may also change. Benefits and paid time off. Pay based on time with company
good,"There IS room to move up if you so wish, but the climb is slow and unless you're destined to become a groomer your chances of going into management is not likely unless you can afford to work part time for quite awhile (living at home and/or going to college). The one i work for is really nice though staff wise and I wish i could have the kind of people here work at every job i've worked for."
good,"Started as a Manager, asked to step down to dog trainer. Loved being a dog trainer. Would still be there if the didn't force my resignation due to an injury."
good,I worked the truck in the morning on Wednesdays. The store I worked at was decently busy. The manager I worked under was not very direct and didn't seem to know what he was doing most of the time. Most everyone else I worked with made it a blast to work there.
good,"Work life balance can we a bit weird, advancement opportunities are very competitive but fair.  can be short staffed and frustrating at times.  Good discounts"
good,"Love what i do,  but poor management and not worth it to climb the ladder. It's a massive pay cut to manage a salon vs being a standard groomer. Associates are petty and immature. Management is lazy and worthless."
good,Stocking shelves a lot not paid good enough for all my work done poor management and not fairly treated and I did not like the poor management team sincerely and thanks
good,I had a great time while volunteering at Pet Smart. The staff was very caring and I could tell that they were passionate about their job. The environment is always stress-free and you will always have room to improve.
good,"Loved the management at my store that i worked at, ended up leaving because i was offered another job that was full time, other then the normal corporate stuff it was a great job"
good,"I liked working at Petsmart but it was only temporary. The managers were good,"
good,"Really loved working there; however, was taken off the time sheet and used as ""on-call"" because of low percentage of email capture. Most either already had email or didn't have a computer, or just wasn't interested.  After being 'on-call"" a short while, I called and spoke to the Manager and advised her to take me off the schedule.   I was not paid very much and going in for a few hours here and there wasn't working for me,     "
good,PetSmart is a good place to work if you are looking for either a part time job to earn extra money on the side or if you are looking to eventually move into retail management.
good,"Job is okay. People are plenty nice. The only real problem besides lack of hours is whoever does the inventory & ordering of product / supplies, is not doing a very good job. Some stuff is not order. A bunch of stuff keeps getting ordered that we have no room for."
good,"Petsmart slow and fast paced depending on the day, great for experience. Rarely anyone gets full time, however, low pay and few hours make cost of living difficult."
good,"Not a bad place to have your first job at, management was great and they worked around my class schedule. Working animals was nice but after a while the slow pace got too much to handle."
good,"Keeping up with as many as 17 dogs in any of the three day camps at hotel is physically demanding.  It is intense to keep dogs from too rough a play or an actual fight.  "
good,"I found that the company had rules that were set in place that seemed outdated to what I was able to work with.  I enjoyed the ability to communicate with others throughout the day, however, it was very stressful knowing my responsibilities couldn't be fulfilled."
good,You are constantly on your feet moving and standing on concrete floors although stress relieving mats are provided for cashiers. You always have to be vigilant as to pet needs.
good,"Working with my scheduled  pets was awesome. I enjoyed giving bath to them   or haircut depends on the owner request. After becoming Pet Salon Manager , scheduling  bathers and groomers became my one of responsibilities."
good,"I personally loved working at PetSmart. The one in Augusta, ME appeared to genuinely want to help the local humane society and pet parents make the best choices for their pets as opposed to the bottom line. Very clean and great teamwork. The problem is that most of the positions were part-time and that doesn't pay the bills for most people. I worked between 14-32 hours in any given week."
good,"It is very hard to put in vacation as a leader. But if you work for the company for 5 years you get an extra week"
good,It okay to work there if your in school don't give a lot of hours for people that are not in school other then that it is a good work place with great management
good,very fun place to work for if you are interested in animals. great energy within the team and the staff and also great communication between the managers and the staff.
good,"Just being in the store helping customers with their pets, which included all types of animals, was amazing and fun! I had many interesting conversations and each day that went by I improved my customer service skills."
good,"At my time at Petsmart, I’ve had the opportunity to put myself into the animal husbandry world. It’s a fantastic place to start if you’re serious about pet care. Management can be unreasonable due to corporate standards, but if you do your own thing, you’re going to have a good time"
good,it was a good place to volunteer. I enjoyed seeing the rescue animals going to they're new homes. I have nothing bad to say about the PetSmart here in town
good,"Petsmart has a passion for pets which is a  quality that I agree and live by. I have pets myself and with what I learned while working there, I have been able to maintain the quality of my pets wellbeing at a higher level."
good,"It can get very stressful at times considering there were days where there was only 1 manager and 2 employees in the store at a time, but for the most part it was a fun experience where I got to take care of animals all day and meet fellow animal lovers!"
good,Petsmart is a great place to work with a great culture and very nice coworkers  but the business has model has some big challenges. Amazon will eventually eliminate the merchandise business which accounts for 85 percent of petsmart revenue
good,I learned a lot about the animals I worked with and it was an experience that I'm glad I had but I dont wish to do again. There was quite a bit of labor involved and no matter how much I cleaned it was never really clean which was the worst part not including the low hours and lack of recgonition for tasks.
good,"Typical days are usually busy, between check-ins and check-outs, grooming, play times, and minding Doggy Day Camp. Our previous manager was good, but our current manager is a bit of a lame duck and seems to frequently misunderstand me. The physicality is the hardest part of the job; it is loud and can be smelly and dirty, plus I am on my feet for up to eight hours a day. The staff is very friendly, and they all show a clear commitment to the pets in our care. Plus, getting to play with dogs and cats all day is hard to beat."
good,This job was an overall fun job and I enjoyed my time spent with the animals. The management was okay but seemed a little cliquey. The Petsmart company was great though.
good,Like any other job there are pros and con. The main pro for me is getting to work with animals. The only con is the pay is not sufficient for all the work they have us do. If it wasn't for the pay it would be a great job. You definitely have to be quick and hardworking to keep up with the workload around holidays.
good,"Overall I got to play and be around animals all day, which is a dream. Most people were very nice and fun. Had your good and bad coworkers/management. You need to love animals to be able to do the job, not uncommon to be cross-trained."
good,"I loved working for the company, I have a passion for animals and for learning new things, and luckily my managers had given me all the tools and information I needed to become the best in my store. The company was decent moral wise, but there were a few changes that didn't make sense. There were many tasks to be done each day, but the animals and my coworkers made it all worth it."
good,"The best coworkers i've ever had were at petsmart. The work environment was relaxed but still productive, and people in all areas of the store were very helpful. I would absolutely recommend it and go back."
good,If you love animals I would recommend working there ! its a great place to not only earn but interact with the as well. doesn't give to many hours and they are always going through managers but its still a good job.
good,PetSmart is an extremely fun place to work at. I had the best time working there with different types of animals all the time. Only thing that I didn't like is how we would share a break room with the places next door.
good,Always moving it was a good fast working place to work. Good people and always someome was around to help if you needed the help .Over time was giving everyonce in a while
good,"enjoyed my time at this location the group was amazing. whenever there where issues it was resolved maturely. everyone was focus and on task , we took care of each other."
good,Petsmart is a fun and relaxed place to work for a college student to make extra spending money but would not cover all of one's living expenses and needs.
good,"Even though for the little pay that borders minimum wage, raises were frequent, benefits stable for employees full-time, hours stable for those in night shift. Work environment was always exciting and management always fair and supportive of their employees."
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking shelves, customer service and cleaning. It is an upbeat environment and employees are friendly and caring."
good,the pay was fair based on my experience as an employee just coming into the company. They gave me a few opportunities to advance into the company and the management was pretty great
good,a very busy and  upbeat salon with great people to work with. always something to do weather it be services on the grooming animals or helping pet parents with purchases or just providing them with information for purchases
good,"As the Pet Care Manager/Customer Engagment Leader, a typical day at PetSmart included checking store metrics to see where our opportunities for improvement were and what associates needed to be recognized for improvements or customer recognition. I've learned how to listen to customers and resolve any issues they may have had, as well as learning that although my title gave me authority, I am no higher of a person than my associates and that we are all one team working together. I personally feel that the management in my particular store could have had better communication in different aspects of the store. Our workplace culture was a fun, hands on type of place. Who couldn't be happy at work when a cute puppy comes running in the door? The hardest part of the job for me personally is the lack of communication in a few important areas of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was not only seeing the pet parents and their animals, but building the relationships with them and gaining their loyalty and trust."
good,"I started here while I was in graduate school just as income and ended up staying for much longer than I anticipated. I had great coworkers and a lot of opportunity for advancement. I think this could have partly been due to a lot of turnover, but some of it was employees who were being recruited to other Petsmart locations."
good,"The management and my coworkers were almost always wonderful. However, being a mom, a student, and working overnights just became too much, I was sleep deprived and every part of my life began to suffer. The animals were awesome, seeing them get excited to you helped get through the long, cold nights alone. (and boy was it cold overnight.) You pretty much didn't stop moving the entire night, from cleaning out kennels, to feeding 7-177 animals in a single night, usually alone, cleaning grooming rooms and dishes, cleaning playrooms with chemicals, and so, much, laundry. It was hard work, and i can honestly say i loved my job, but my school, and my daughter are more important to me than 177 a week, and i needed to leave in order to have the energy necessary to do those instead."
good,"You will learn a lot at PetSmart! So much fun to learn about all the different animals and teaching Pet Parents about them! A typical day at PetSmart for me was cleaning cages, feeding and watering animals, and medicating sick and injured animals. Then once the store is open helping Pet Parents with everything they need. Doing a lot of cleaning throughout the day. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the animals. The hardest part at first was running around all day, you never stop moving, and of course learning as you go. This job can be a little dirty cleaning up little accidents, cleaning the dead fish out, and doing dishes."
good,"It's only worth it if you absolutely love animals, you'll get a new perspective on them because you're constantly dealing with stressed animals. If you can deal with that then you would be fine,"
good,Petsmart takes good care of their employees. They're always willing to work with you and make an effort for the customers. In the salons they truly care about the animals and love what they do.
good,"PetSmart was a wonderful experience and I made many connections with our customers as well as the animals, and my coworkers. Like any retail job, it can get stressful but my experience was a wonderful one."
good,"Basically it was all about providing the best customer service, with a smile.  An informative interaction in a reasonable time frame with compassion for the cause.  90% of the Leaders were outstanding. It was a place where you felt at home and you belonged."
good,"I have learned to communicate with customers in a more professional way, and taking care of the animals. I loved making sure everyone was happy and the animals were well taken care of."
good,"A typical day at work can vary depending on when and what is on your schedule. You are definitely more fast paced around holidays and summer. It will also depend on how many dogs you groom within a shift."
good,I had an amazing time working at Petsmart. The hours they provided me and flexibility around my schooling really helped me get my education as well as work on the side.
good,"Although my particular store has different store managers frequently, the managers below the store lead are fun, fair, engaging, and actually care. You accumulated vacation time even as a part time and they have tuition reimbursement."
good,"I hope you like cleaning up after sick doggies! Poo! Poo everywhere. Clean it up and watch them dance....in more poo. Beside the constant clean up this is a fun job. The dog are fun and like to get into everything going on, while some like to just sleep in the chaos of noise and puppies walking on them."
good,"Its very rare that any employee will  feel any stress as they work, due to working with pets all day long. Even the guest are relaxed and are typically very polite and friendly ."
good,Its a great place to work. There are times hrs and work flw are lower. The people you work with are very nice and caring including staff.I would recommend this workplace to anyone looking to work safely accurately and quickly .
good,"It's been a while since I've worked but it was ok when I was there."
good,fun place to work - customers seek your advice and you were allowed to bring pets to work. Only thing I hated was inventory. The process was too cumbersome and could be refined
good,"PetSmart has been one of my favorite places to work so far. The people are great, the company really seems to care about their employees, and if you're full time then you receive all benefits (health, 401k, paid time, etc.) which is really nice. The only complaint I have is that, depending on which store you work in, it can be very difficult to get to full time. The hours can also be pretty inconsistent. I went several weeks working less than 10 hours a week, then back to 20+ without any notice. This might be the fault of my Store Leader, since I'm not entirely sure she knew what she was doing at the time, but still not something anyone was happy with. Other than that, it's a great place to work and I would highly recommend giving it a go if you're considering it. I will miss working here."
good,While I worked at Petsmart it was a good job the employees where nice but the management not so much either I was giving 4 hours for the week being a full time employees or I was working alone on busy hours with no help!
good,ces conditions n'étaient pas favorables en 2003 mais ont connu une amélioration
good,"I loved working at PetSmart so far my favorite job. I worked in the PetsHotel and it was fun, engaging, and I learned a lot about animals everyday. If I could go back I definitely would."
good,got to work with pet all day. they were supper fun and friendly. each pet has their own personality and every owner to match. they came in the shop looking or smelling bad and in need of a good cleaning and left looking and smelling great. it was hard work but very rewarding.
good,"Fun place to work with animals. Good managers, very fair. Unfortunately could not advance or become full-time so I had to make the hard choice to leave."
good,"you can work early mornings or late nights if wanted, many different positions available in various departments, all department associates get along very well"
good,A typical day would be ringing up customers. Assisting customers with any needs. Stocking shelves. Making sure all displays were in order. Cleaning and maintaining with any of the animals as well as feeding.
good,"Great people to work with, but really tumultuous in regards to employment. Multiple layoffs in a short time. My manager was great and I could tell his direct reports really like and respect him. Everyone I interacted with was more than happy to help me."
good,"Very good place to work. Id you are passionate about animals, then this is the perfect place for you! I love working here with all my favourite animals and even with my own dog!"
good,"As a cashier, I most often dealt with customers and their furry friends, so the job environment was very enjoyable.  The managers that I worked with were always willing to help in situations where a customer was unhappy which made my job a lot easier."
good,Typical day working with 8 to 10 dogs in addition to walk-ins.  Learned time management skills.  Enjoyed working with co-workers they definitely have your back.
good,"I learned a lot about animals while working here. Some managers i wonder why they have their jobs but there are some extremely hard workers who i admired very much. Seeing the different breeds of dogs come in is what made my day everyday. People will even bring in their bearded dragons, geckos, hedgehogs, etc. Fun work environment all around."
good,I had a great 3 years working here. You can learn a lot and meet a lot of good people who you form lasting bonds with here. Great job for young adults.
good,"A great and flexible job for someone who's in school or just looking for part time work. If someone is looking for a full time job immediately you might consider looking elsewhere because employees are advanced into higher positions so there's not often openings for fulltime. I started out as a cashier, then was cross trained in Petcare, and now I'm a supervisor after two years working here. So I'm very pleased with the progression. There is also flexibility when it comes to location, you can be transfered from store to store (I started out in Ottawa, then went to work in Kamloops)"
good,Greeted people and beginning of there experience and was there to send them off with the some enthusiasm.  I learned just how much people love and care for pets as if they were a part of the family.  Hardest part was when a pet owner loss the pet.
good,Corporate is demanding and ridiculous. They're constantly expecting you to do the job of three. I fully believe 90 percent of corporate has no experience on the sales floor. The management is great (depending on the store. I have had my fair share of extremely terrible management) and you can tell many of them care.
good,"My typical day of work included getting there early every morning and take appointments by my schedule. I learned how to get a hard job with some of these pets done in a timely manner, so I would definitely say this job taught me even more how to work at a fast pace. It was a joyful environment considering we were around pets all day. The hardest part of this job for me was personal strengths when it came to the dogs and their weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid to groom dogs, because I am a dog lover!"
good,"Overall great place to work"
good,"Job can really vary due to location of store, type of customers, and management team. Good job for anybody that loves pets and animals and wants to help others."
good,"Working at PetSmart can rather exhausting, however, it is a good working experience with both a lot of team building skills and relatively friendly managers."
good,"This was a great job to have as a teenager. I learned so much about customer service, retail, and pets working here! Management was usually very nice and hardworking, and it was a blast seeing the pets."
good,"Work days vary depending on your personal job within the store. Pet Care is very fast-paced and centers around caring for the animals in the store. On a daily basis you're cleaning habitats, fish tanks, ensuring animals are given proper medication, feeding the animals, making sure they have water etc."
good,Caring for animals and helping the pet parents is all in a days work. We consistently learn more about animals and help their owners understand what might be best for their pets. We believe pets make us better people.
good,"Great compensation, but you will be expected to work hard for it... more than 40 hours. You'll change direction many times because leadership lacks vision and direction."
good,"good if you're working through school, they also promote within and the workload is overall easy, they don't allow overtime and the schedule changes weekly and can start as early as 5am for truck deliveries."
good,"loved working in the pet care department, working with all types of different species of animals and ensuring their proper care throughout the day made the job worth while,"
good,"Stress governs your job; the difficulty of your work is entirely dependent on the dogs you're working with."
good,"We would start the day by checking each pet to make sure they have food and water, and administer medication. We would walk each dog and play with them to exercise them. The hardest part of the job was watching the pets grow old. It was very rewarding to see the dogs and cats get excited to see us, and appreciate us. It was a very fast paced environment and I was on my feet for 10 hour a day. I made it a point to make sure every dog got to feel love, and to get the proper attention. It was my job to over see employees and maintain the daily schedules. I would provide excellent customer service to all pet parents to ensure they felt at ease leaving their pets. Being a manager was rewarding, I was able to connect with my staff, and our clients. I believed in an open door policy, as did my peers. I've learned many things over the many years, how to balance a register, how to handle conflicts and how to always provide excellent customer service."
good,"I came in to work the truck/ cashiering and do price changes."
good,All I did was hold dogs in a circle looking for someone to adopt them. I also helped with taking them out to go to the bathroom. It could be more organized.
good,It was a great place to work very calm atmosphere the people were great to work with. I learn a lot by working there and how to deal with different culture of people.
good,After nearly two years of work only minimal raises have been given and very limited advancement opportunities given. Management at my store is very absent and places all blame on employees and not management   Job itself is fine and fun and worth it due to love of animals but management has placed undue stress over job
good,Co-workers are nice and helpful. It's fun and not to demanding of a job. The customers are okay and the dogs are sometimes aggressive. But its rewarding and nice to work with the dogs. If your a dog lover then i recommend this job
good,Theres a lot of studying to do in regards to different protein sources for different pets. Some dogs are grain intolerant or allergic to even the smallest dose of anything they're allergic to. You'd be surprised how much dog food is mixed in regards to ingredients. And defintely alot more studying or experience should be had if you plan to work in the small pets section. I feel like its very difficult to move up or get promoted. They're hiring outside of the company for manager positions.
good,The job is kinda simple but I prefer more of a mans job because you are picking up different varieties and sizes of pet food and stocking pallats alld
good,"i enjoyed the environment, the associates were friendly. work was consistent and enjoyed meeting new people.i learned a lot of information about animals and their care. the hardest part of the job was dealing with an upset customer but it was an experience that made me stronger."
good,"The overall work environment at my store was pleasant. I had an excellent management team that was always accommodating when I needed time off to study for exams, as I was also a full-time student. Additionally, they were always there for support when I needed assistance with something or when the occasional challenging customer came along."
good,This is a wonderful place to work if you are interested in becoming more knowledgeable about pets an how to interact correctly with animals of all varieties.
good,"Too much drama in the salon. Cashiering is easy, the management was nice. Though the grooming manager at the time wasn't even trained to groom. The corporation as a whole is money based and has little care about pets."
good,"Petsmart was a fun job to have. I loved being a dog trainer. The people were great and I loved my customers. I learned a lot about training as well as about dog breeds and other animals. The store was very clean. And the employees were very helpful, always willing to lend a hand. The customers were the best and it was always fun when they brought in their dogs, whether for training, grooming, or just a day of shopping."
good,"At the PetSmart I work at, my coworkers are always pretty friendly and very knowledgeable so I feel welcome to ask questions and talk pretty openly to them. I also feel safe knowing my managers are looking out for me and my well being."
good,Was only there for about a year. I did enjoy my time there though. Work was pretty straight forward. Worked in the distribution center. Management was good at this place.
good,There is a lot of room for growth and advancement in the company if you are willing to be trained in a lot of areas. And the best part is that you get to play with the pets!
good,You learn a lot of information on different pet foods and how to take care of the pets. Many things that most people don't know. You are expected to help everyone with whatever they need.
good,"As a dog bather, this job was a very stressful job. Phones going off all the time, having to stop what you're doing to accommodate walk-ins. "
good,If you love animals this is the place to work. You get hands on experiences on all sorry of animal. They work with great charities. There is no dog or cat sales. Only adoptions from local rescues. All animals are completely vetted.
good,"Company terminated my position gave me 24 hours to decide if I want to be demoted or leave everyone knew why I left ,my goal was to be manager 5 months it took 7 I was training to move up when my position was terminated."
good,Working at Petsmart had been a dream of mine and as soon as I stepped in there I realized though it wasn't all it was cracked up to be it did have it's benefits. Like every job it had it's ups and downs but hands down every single animal in the building helps bring a smile to your face and makes you think the stress is sometimes worth it. If you're an absolute animal it might be a nice place for you to start.
good,"An average day consists of stocking product, helping customers and selling pet training while directing 3 or 4 associates. I learned inventory and loss prevention programs as they pertain to PetSmart. Management was less than adequate making their own rules instead of following the company plan which put off a lot of associates. The culture was great with the pets and pet parents usually being happy just to be their getting attention and associates more than happy to give it. A good sense of urgency was carried by most associates. The hardest part of the job was the sick roome where the sick and injured retail pets were kept.the most enjoyable part was seeing how happy people were to become a pet parent through the adoption process and how they loved shopping for their pets."
good,"My typical day at work always varied, I am trained for all areas of the store except for management, including bathing dogs. Some days I would be stocking the shelves where as other days I'd be selling the live animals or being a cashier. Then there were the days I bathed the dogs in the grooming salon."
good,"Great place to work for anyone who loves animals."
good,It is a fun job to work at. Sometimes it can be hard because there isn't enough staff but we just try our best and get through with what we have. Part time employees don't get any benefits at all. Also in order to become full time there you either have to go into the grooming salon and become a groomer or become a manager. I love my job but i cant live off of 20 hrs a week.
good,"I absolutely loved working here. Very fun co-workers and management. Everyone was like a family. Unfortunately, you can't move up too much in the company and the hours for certain positions are just not worth staying at for too long. Very great for entry level!"
good,they are trying out a new training program that may help associates. lack of communication from managers to much outside hiring for upper management positions.
good,"The animals are what makes the job worth while.  They depend on you for a healthy and happy life until they are purchased/adopted.  They rely on you to give new prospective owners reliable information on how to continue that quality of care.  The variety of animals could be a little bigger, but it's better than most competitor stores in the surrounding area.  The management doesn't always keep a good manager attitude, sometimes the sarcasm line is crossed too far.  Nowhere is perfect though.  For the most part the managers here are genuinely caring.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get as much as you possibly can accomplished before the end of your shift.  There's definitely no down time most of the shifts.  However, this can be rewarding when you take a step back before leaving and see all you accomplished."
good,It is a good job working as a petstylist. The other groomers you work with become your good friends. Its not an easy job but its great being around animals all day.
good,My passion for animals and their owners made my job very easy. Pet Smart was a great place to work. The culture allowed me to thrive and excel while helping animals and their owners.
good,"I look back at dog bathing as a positive experience. Dogs have always been a big interest of mine, so being able to work with them was very enjoyable much of the time (even if the dogs were frequently not as happy to be there). I worked as a receptionist, answering calls and creating appointments, and also as a dog bather."
good,Had a wonderful experience working with this company  the employees are all super friendly and there to help if you need it always working together to make it a safe and fun work environment
good,good place to work to see and interact with animals. managers are very kind. co-workers are all pro animal lifestyles. position doesn't allow advancement forward in a career path.
good,If you like pets this is the place to be.  The work is hard can be very busy at times.   Most of the employees are nice.   They make sure you get your breaks.  Pay is not the greatest
good,I enjoyed it enough to no quit. There were plenty of great associates there that made the job worth staying there for and i enjoyed it. I mainly did stocking because that's what i preferred at the time.
good,"a typical day at work was very fast paced, could be stressful but days would always go by quickly."
good,Working here gives me the ability to do a job that I love and be around animals. It requires stamina and patience. Being able to stay alert and work with your hands constantly is key.
good,"I have certainly enjoyed working with Petsmart over the last four years as they have worked well with my school schedule and encouraged me to pursue leadership opportunities and learn new skills."
good,"PetSmart is a good first time job, or one with chances to advance into a full time groomer. Some days are extremely busy, others are more relaxed. My co-workers are some of the most helpful around, staying true to the team commitment. The hardest part of the job is time management and dealing with stressed dogs, and my favorite is seeing our regular dogs and their pet parents, and getting to know them."
good,I enjoy seeing all the animals everyday. All the employees are awesome and are always willing to help. I learned that when a person there has trouble finding something to just go up to the person and help them with your best ability.
good,"Loved working there customers were great for the most part. Petsmart employees actually do care for the animals rather well, better than most other petstores I've seen."
good,Worked here for 17 years. They actually care about you. Good benefits and room for advancement. It was a fun place to work.
good,Fun place to work. Its like one big family. I love working and being with the animals on a daily basis. Being a bather in the grooming salon is very satisfying.
good,I enjoyed working with the animals and my coworkers who were all helpful and energetic. There was always positive conversation flowing which made working a breeze in our fast-paced environment.
good,I love my job and will be sad to leave soon. The store I work at now doesn't provide enough hours for their part time employees to live off of and there are only two full time positions besides managers. It is hard to work with the GM especially since she is very closed minded and a know it all. She is also nosey and can cause employees to loose a sale.
good,"Although I have loved working for this company and my team the past 2 years, I have reached a point where I am no longer growing career wise."
good,PetSmart is a great place to work. Just like all other places of work their are those that are fun to work with and others that are not.
good,"Great opportunity for good pay, great hours and management but company was bought out and management changed so a lot of people resigned"
good,"I enjoyed working in the PetSmart grooming salon. The benefits weren't great for part-time workers, but the reason I left early was because I was going to grad school."
good,Ok working environment. Management cool.Co-workers very relaxed. Not many hours given out and not many full-time jobs given. But management really relaxed.
good,"For the most part working at PetSmart is great, lots of great co-workers and if you love animals the culture will satisfy you. Once your part of the benefits program it's really comprehensive and worthwhile. "
good,"I really enjoy working here. Getting to care for, learn about and connect with animals daily makes everything worth it for me. If it wasn't a retail schedule, I would still want to work here. Sadly, its getting harder to find child care on the weekends and my kids go to school during the week, so I don't get as much time with them as I'd like."
good,My overall experience at this establishment has been a wonderful experience. I have been given oppurtunity to advance and contribute my unique abilities to the overall workplace culture.
good,I have learned that Pet Smart is A wonderful place to work... just wish they had a better system in place for training future supervisors.
good,worked as cashier and shelf stocker. got to meet plenty of nice people. was paid for holidays. hourly wage was 11.00 hourly and was paid weekly
good,"PetSmart at the time was a great place to work, good work relationships with fellow co-workers, it had a few kinks but other than that it was a fun place to work and always got the job done."
good,"I worked my way up from an associate to manager over the years.  The company is really good at training an associate in all departments that they would like to learn about.  Depending on the day of the week, I worked on different tasks.  It may be working freight, which meant unloading a truck with a forklift and having one or two associates help me work the product out onto the store's floor before customers came in for the day.  We had to make sure any product not able to fit nicely and clean on the shelves was put away and organized by department, type, and aisle.  Reason for this was because on the other days that no freight was being worked, certain departments of the store were filled and spots were scanned and any accounts that could not be found were adjusted so new freight orders could be made.  This again had to all be done before customers arrived, so has to be done quickly.  Every day you have to file all the paperwork that goes along with these activities.  Every day your duty is to maintain a clean store and make sure all associates and pets in the store's care maintain a good bill of health.  Customer service is key in this company because bad customer service means the customer may get the wrong product that may cause harm to their pet."
good,"I clock in around mid-after noon and I immediately get to work. I'm generally pleasantly busy along side my fellow co-workers while we bathe and groom dogs, this usually continues until 6 or 7 when the evening starts to slow. Around 7 o'clock I start cleaning and preparing the salon for the next day. After the last dog leaves I Finish the last of the maintenance and collect my supplies to head home, at 9-ish."
good,"very busy store.learned to groom all types of AKC dogs breeds.Management changing constantly.Very stressful job ,but very rewarding when you see customers happy."
good,Petsmart is a company that truly tries to work around everyones individual schedule needs. The staff is friendly and management is run well. The only issues have been when rules are changed dependent on management which gets confusing. Company benefits are good and company sales are always growing.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, the customers are fun and getting to know their pets makes the job a fun one to come to each day.  While there is a pattern to the daily work the customers and unexpected make the job anything but boring."
good,"I followed the resident Veterinarian for his every day check ups with patients and accompanied him and the Vet Techs for basic surgeries, such as spay/neuter, and teeth extraction."
good,I learned how to approach pets without getting bit. the most enjoyable part was going to lunch because there were a lot of food places by petsmart.
good,"I am currently working as a Pet Care employee where I manage all the animals, their habitats, preparing their meals and selling to customers. I also managed the store and closed cash, filed paperwork, and managed employee tasks and breaks."
good,"All the managers are nice, and so are the co-workers.  I love all the customers and there pets.  I mostly cashier now but I work in pet care, stock, pricing, out of date, price auditing, and customer service."
good,Good company with lots of changes happening.  I have enjoed my experiences with Petsmart and typical work week is 45 to 50 hours.
good,a typical day usually varies depending upon what is scheduled to occur that day.  environment is fast paced and usually fun.
good,"Working at the #1 PetSmart store in the United States, the standards were set high which resulted in hard a hard working group of people with a love for all animals. As a small animal specialist, I learned all about caring for a range of small animals including fish, hamsters, birds (parakeets, conures, finches, etc.), chinchillas, snakes, etc. The management team was phenomenal and I only left this workplace to find a full-time job. I love these people!"
good,It is very hard work. Sometimes you are not appreciated for all that you do. They talk alot about being there for the pet but contradict themselves.
good,"My typical day consists of animal care and providing excellent customer service.  I also train the new employees and provide advice to management.  I have learned about Plan-O-Grams.  Management is okay, but I was promised a promotion months ago and it never happened, so managements word holds no value.  I love my co-workers!  Hardest part of the job is seeing animals get sick and suffer.  The most enjoyable part of the job is watching people fall in love with their new pet."
good,"When you come to work you come into a fun environment, over all your job it to make sure everyone is having fun. sometimes you dress up as chuck E. Cheese and dance. and keep the restaurant clean."
good,The culture and people are wonderful. The focus on pets brings a special culture in a big retailer that is hard to find. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with our stores and field leaders.
good,"I walk throughout my department to confirm all pets are properly taken care of and habitats contain all requirements set to policies and procedures. "
good,"The distribution center was a fun place to work , actually enjoyed my time there had the weekends off great pay. management  went out their way to make sure associates where ok  they did employee of the month great discounts on pet products"
good,"A typical day at Petsmart can consist of many tasks including cashier,stocking, managing and training. It is a job the requires skill and customer service. However, there is no opportunity for advancement as the company usually hires outside of Petsmart for jobs that are further up in rank. The culture is incredible though and you work with great people"
good,"Interesting environment and always changing. Strong core and plenty of CARE. A great hands on experience. Healthy working environment and plenty of teamwork. Can get busy and a bit hectic, but overall a rewarding experience and job."
good,The management truly care about the well being of their employees and their customers. There is a good balance of work and play. Employees create a great team and cooperative atmosphere.
good,The only problem with this job is the danger of working in a fast paced warehouse. The management tries to help but they are tied behind corporate red tape.
good,A typical day at the grooming salon consists of phone calls and setting appointments and depending on the day you usually have 4 or more dogs to do. The management is alright where I work I jut wish they worked better with you when it comes to the schedule and hours. My co-workers are very friendly and treat you like family and I enjoy where I work I am just looking for something that will give me better hours and that will work with me when it comes to my schedule because I am a full time student.
good,"A typical work day would be, coming in and clocking in. Then making sure my classes are in order. I learned so much more communication skills than what I had. The management there was amazing, and so friendly. My co-workers were some of the best and very easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was scheduling the classes to fit my hours for the week. The most enjoyable part was just the people that I worked with were awesome."
good,"The manager I ended with was not the one I started with. The manager I started with was friendly, outgoing, and really involved with the employees and the customers. The last manager was terrible. He doesn't like animals, will watch you flounder, and will blame you if you can't get something done. So when I was working in Pet Care, the only employee in that department that night, and had 7 people needing me, and everyone that could have helped was on back up registers, I reached out to the manager for some assistance. Apparently, fish are disgusting, he won't help with reptiles, and it's clear he thinks himself above the tasks everyone else is performing. I did love working there, though. Fabulous coworkers, (mostly) wonderful customers, and very fun place."
good,"I started at PetSmart in 2012 and I was at one of the smaller stores during most of that time.  The hours were often lean for part-timers but I kept at it, thinking one day I would advance.  "
good,great place to work. fun employees and great people. hard work early in the morning but got out at a reasonable time. liked the environment and the customers.
good,"Check in dogs scheduled for you by discussing, in detail, what the pet parent is looking for. Bathe and dry your dog, clip its nails and provide the haircut. Answer phone calls, book new appointments, and provide walk-in services, simultaneously. Manage time wisely while sticking to a strict schedule. Finish your scheduled dogs in time to check in your next appointments. Follow all safety policies and regulations. The hardest part of job would be dealing with difficult dogs that do not agree with what you are doing as well as difficult pet parents that feel the same way. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you are making a difference in a pet's life and making them look and feel better. It was very easy to get along with most of my co-workers and we all quickly become close friends from working in tight places together. Management could be a little difficult. Most managers have never worked a day in a grooming salon in their life so they do not understand the amount of work it takes, some worry more about the money instead of the groomer and pets involved."
good,"I love being around animals, I loved getting to bath and take care of them while in the salon."
good,"I worked here for a little more than 2 years. I didn't know much about any animals other than dogs, but after 2 years I was an expert at almost all domestic animals. I started as a petcare associate, was promoted to department lead, and then to department manager within the 2 years I was there. There is definitely room for growth at Petsmart. I had great coworkers and management, who were always willing to help."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, doing opening duties: turning on the computers, turning on phones, washing water bowls, letting the shampoos run for a bit, setting up grates for the bath tubs and drains. Checking to see how many dogs you have for the day, to check any availability the appointment book has and answering phone calls. Greeting customers as they walk in and also greeting the dogs that you are about to groom, checking the condition of the coat the dog is in and to see what cut the parent wants. I would open up their previous files to check if vaccinations are up to date and if not, to fill them in or call the vet. Reviewing what the parents wants done and printing out the service card and to make them sign the card on agreeing the length, type of cut, information is correct and the time that the dog will be done. While grooming the dog, customers would come in for walk-in services, phones would be ringing, checking in and our your other dogs all at the same time, also making sure the first dog gets out at the time the parent signed for. For closing duties: filing the service cards in the proper order, cleaning the salon, using disinfectant to clean the kennels, tables and tools, shutting down computers, cleaning the bathtubs and drains and sweeping/ vacuum hair from the floor and plugging in the phones to charge. I have learnt to deal with complains and issues, also how to deal with stressful situations. For a few months we were on and off with managers, until recently we got a permanent manager. She dealt with complaints and handled scheduling well. Overall"
good,"Customer Service in the grooming salon can be very stressful but overall pay was good, enjoyed working with animals, good open door policy, did take a toll out on your body, safety was a good concern they looked out for employees"
good,It's a good environment to work at. But the starting pay is to low if your trying to pay rent and utilities every month. Recommended job is for part timers in school and are still living with their parents.
good,"A typical day at work would have me feeding, cleaning, and maintaining the specialty animals and providing customers with the proper information if they wanted to purchase them. I learned about some unique pieces of information in regards to certain animals and even taught others due to my background as a biology major at the time. Unfortunately management outside of my department did not understand how much effort it took to maintain proper habitats for the animals and would often rush myself and other coworkers to leave a job half done, which would influence the animal's health negatively."
good,"My day of work would usually consist of stocking the shelves, make sure anything that wasn't on the shelves got stocked if we had it in stock. Helped the customers find what they needed and if they needed help carrying the time out would do that for them. The days were hard working, but my co-workers made it a fun time to be at work. Management was always busy dealing with orders coming in, but would also help us out if we needed it. Did their best to make sure we had what we needed to make the store run as smoothly as possible. Hardest part of the job would be when we didn't have what people wanted and not being able to satisfy their needs"
good,I loved working here.  Everyone is so passionate about pets that it makes everyone work that much harder.  Plus pets in the office every day.  Can't beat that!
good,"This was a trucking company and we had over 100 drivers in 5 locations within the US.  The drivers were awesome and most of the management team was also. The hardest part was the locations were under contract as it was a dedicated trucking company.  When the company loses the contract, you lose your job.  The best part about this job were the drivers."
good,if you like retail there are advancement opportunities. can be tough working under the strict rules of a large corporate run company
good,I loved helping customers and learning about their pets personalities.
good,A typical day at PetSmart is usually pretty busy.  Helping pet parents while juggling tasks that need to be accomplished for the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the different and unique animals that come into the store to shop with there owner.
good,"A typical day at work was a 4am to 11am shift that consisted of stocking, maintaining excellent store presentation, cashiering, and customer service.  I learned how to operate a forklift, use an RF scanner, delegate tasks to associates to keep up the store's efficiency, handle money transactions (credit/debit, check, cash), take care of pets, and, most importantly, provide distinguished customer service.  My co-workers were hard workers that communicated their thoughts very effectively.  They treated my ideas with respect and I treated their ideas with respect as well.  We all worked very well independently and as a team.  The hardest part of the job was balancing school with early work hours (4am).  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see how my team and I perfected our jobs before the doors of the store opened."
good,Orderfill consists of picking pet supplies for Petsmart stores. Its a very fast paced job They pay good and have great vacation time
good,"While working at PetSmart, I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I had more patience than I though. I would have up to 6 dogs to groom a day. The people were fun to work with and we all helped each other when we needed it. The hardest part of the job was working with the dogs. They would make it hard at times to make their grooming experience a good one. The most enjoyable part were also the dogs and the people that I worked with."
good,A typical work day consist of picking orders to be shipped to PetSmart stores. I learned about basic warehouse orderfill duties and working to meet production. Hardest part was meet production which wasnt that hard in itself. most enjoybable aspect was the fast pace.
good,"management is almost not there at all, anytime there's a problem it takes weeks too get fixed."
good,Always busy and I learned the basics of the pet store business. Co-workers were great and easy to get along with. Enjoyed being there and working at a quick pace.
good,"A typical day includes a 6am potty walk. This is followed by feedings, AM day camp, lunch feeding, PM day camp, dogs being picked up, then quick dinner and cage cleaning before the 9pm potty walk. What is great is that PetSmart offers a night shift for the daycare. Potty walks and scooping is not fun at all, but the responsibility for taking care of the dogs and individual playtime makes up for it."
good,"I work as a bather, and it is back-breaking work (dogs don't stand still or like baths or nail clipping, etc. and will not hesitate to bite at times), but the atmosphere is good due to great management. I'm too young to be having sharp shooting pains in my back from this work"
good,"Swiped in when it was time for my shift to start. If i was working on the registers I would greet the customers, ring up their items and make sure they were happy when they left the store. When I worked in the pet care department it was something new everyday, weather it be trying to catch birds in the cages for customers, to cleaning out tanks and tidying up the shelves. The management was great there everyone was on point and helped out everyone, along with the co workers they were great as well. The hardest part of the job was when I had to come into work at 5 AM to do inventory and open the store in the pet care department. I loved the store because I am an animal lover and got to work with the animals and teach people new things about them."
good,"PetSmart is a good organization with room for growth and development.  The culture is a large part of the organization and initially it is challenging to understand.  The one key element of the culture is collaboration, which is what make the culture unique and strong at the same time.  "
good,"PetsMart provides many option when it comes to work. their are different departments and all of which you get to work with pets. I work in the grooming salon and i get to work with a big variety of dogs. It is a fast paced environment in the salon, but that only test your skills, so you can improve them. My store offers a lot of different personalities when it comes to co-workers. You definitely feel welcomed and comfortable here at PetsMart."
good,"Though I did enjoy my 3 year stay for the most part, Petsmart was something in my life that made me feel somewhat stuck after the second year with no advancement, in part due to the frequent changes in management each year."
good,"My days would start at 4:00am, by beginning to move all the product racks and props out of the way of the isles. By 4:15 we would bring in pallets from the back room or container located outback and pull them into the isles. The opening manager would tag along and help fix and fill the products that are on the pallets. Your co-workers are always on alert if you need help on a team lift on heavy products. The hardest part about the job would be when the store opens (9am) and your not done stocking, you will have to juggle customer service and stocking the products and have to be done before your shift is over. What i like most about the job was how easy and laid back the job was, it had it stressful and hard moments but overall it was easy."
good,I loved working with the animals and getting to meet new people.
good,"Week days have a slower flow of customers than weekends. A typical day involves paperwork, meetings, conference calls, customer service, maintenance and cleaning, taking inventory and ordering supplies, assisting and training of associates, ensuring policies and procedures are followed, creative selling and advertising ideas for services, multitasking, writing schedules, frequent communication with management and associates throughout the store, and of course grooming dogs."
good,"amazing co-workers, management was great got along real well, learned product information, the most enjoyable part of the job would be the people I worked with."
good,"Build Genuine relationships with shoppers in recommending solutions and positively reinforcing the shoppers decisions with there purchases. Consistency is key in Coach associates in day to day tasks. Also keeping track of merchandise movement and the elimination of shrink, via cycle counts twice a week. The most difficult part of my job is holding my management team accountable for there actions and how they have a Direct impact on not only my success but the success of the store. "
good,I love working at Petsmart because of all the wonderful people and I love the animals. It is just not enough pay to make it in life.
good,"Fun place to be. As part of the grooming salon, you must be willing to learn patience for animals of all sizes and temperaments. Once you earn your stripes, you have the opportunity to train at the PetSmart grooming academy to become a professional groomer. "
good,"I would deal with customers and enjoyed speaking to people about their pets. I studied brands of pet food, supplements, etc to give customers knowledgeable answers to their pet health questions/concerns.."
good,I love my job at petsmart but i am looking for a change i have been there for three years now.
good,I LOVE LOVE LOVE The company! PetSmart offers advancement and such an amazing policy and procedure guideline. They have the correct structure that is needed to run a successful business! The only downfall to the Presentation Manager position is the hard work that is involved and the horrible hours. Expect to be there over 50 hours a week to get your tasks done!
good,"Being a specialty pet retailer, Petsmart is unlike any other retail environment. Not only do you need to cater to the customers walking in and out, but also their pets, which they typically bring with them."
good,"Most everyone gets along, we have fun! Get to see many different pets and play with them."
good,"A day at work was never the same. PetSmart values people and their pets. PetSmart staff is trained on a variety of skills including superior customer service, product knowledge, animal care, and creating a friendly work environment."
good,You will bathe and groom animals. Needs to be ablet to multitask when having scheduled appointments and walk-ins.
good,I learned a lot about pets I never knew about. I had great training from the management team and I enjoyed what I did. There wasn't a time that the management wouldn't answer a question to a problem I was having. I loved working with the animals and being a part of the Petsmart team.
good,"Great company in many ways, very organized and growing company. Compensation and new advancment opportunities were why I left."
good,Overall decent but hard to balance life and work. Requires a lot of getting up early and hard work lifting bags of food.
good,as management you will work 10 hour days so 50 hours a week with hour breaks each day. good thing is if you are any other manager besides the store manager and ops manager you are hourly but guaranteed those 5 hours of OT every week
good,"I was highly respected, family oriented staff And customers return so often you grow to know the regulars"
good,"Good place to work, though sometimes the chances for addvancing from associate to managment, and the pay is not to competitive, however they really care about their customers."
good,Typical day of work includes 6 Camps of 17 dogs. 3 camps running 9-12 and 3 more running 1-5. If we have an excessive amount of dogs staying at the hotel we will run 1 or 2 more camps before we open and after we close called boarding camps. These camps can contain up to 17 dogs depending on the store (do to size of the play rooms) and it is required that 1 person is in the room at all times! The turnover is low so it’s easy to befriend your coworkers! Management is willing to make accommodations for scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that we make a difference in the life of hundreds of animals. The hardest part of the job is dealing with poorly trained dogs and most of the time their ill mannered owners. Be aware that you will most likely be bitten by a dog. It is extremely important to learn all forms of body language and personality traits of all the dogs. Like people they all are different and different things can affect them. The job also requires you to pick up clean and dispose of animal waste so it is not for the squimish.
good,I liked working with the team. very knowledgable about all sales
good,"A typical day would be helping put things away, playing with all the animals and learning out them and their pet parents. I have learned a lot about animals and the people who own them. Management was alright, but they did need some management them self's. The hardest part of the job would be the up keep with all the pets we had to sell, and the most enjoyable was everything that had came up that day."
good,"The policies and procedures are a little overwhelming at first, but once you adjust it really is a nice place to work. There is never any confusion because there is strict adherance to the policies and procedures, but management can be a little rough. Overall I enjoyed my time working there."
good,"I enjoy working at Petsmart. I love all the team members that I work with! The hardest part about the job is the drive - 40 minutes. I also do not enjoy the inconsistent hours. I work 4 am Monday, Wednesday, Friday then the next week I will be working way 5 pm on those days."
good,"Typical weekday included answering the phone more than anything, usually making appointments for Friday or the weekend. The evenings were slightly busier, after people got off work. You check in the dog, make sure you know what they want done and which number to call them at when their dog is finished, and then you take the dog to the back and get started on the bath. The valuable skill that I learned from this job was customer service. This was my very first job ever, and so I learned how much customer service is about patience, lots of patience. My co-workers for the most part were agreeable, a couple of them were bossier than necessary, but we got along okay. The hardest part of the job was bringing in business on the slower days. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with the dogs, even if they were a little snappy."
good,"A typical day at work for me is ninety percent dedicated to customer service, while the other ten percent is for operations. In this position, I have learned so much knowledge about dogs, cats and small pets that I have not had before. As with any other job, my co-workers are comprised of different types of individuals. The first type of co-workers are the clearly motivated to work hard and produce results, the second type are co-workers who have an inconsistent work ethic who do the minimum they are told, while the third group of co-workers believe they do not need coaching or further development and are at work to socialize. The hardest part of this job is coaching the associates who feel they do not need coaching because they have been working at this location for so long. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers take care of those they love - their pets."
good,"i had to count the fish, stock sheelves, clean tanks/and area. i learned allot bout animals and what they needed to live. cowoekers were good people.the hardest part of the job was dealing with inpatient custermers but i always finished what i started so i had to stay calm and learn how to deal with the situation at hand. the most enjoyable part of the day is when everything worked out right"
good,"Great company with room for advancement within. Bright workplace, where customer interaction is #1"
good,"Greeting customers when I walk into the store, asking them if they need any assistance throughout their time while shopping. Ringing up the items at the customers want to buy."
good,"Almost every day, I was able to learn something new from fellow associates and customers. Customers would come in and ask for associates by name which showed how dedicated we were to our customers and their pets. It felt like a family."
good,I would clock in Early before the truck with products would come in every Monday and Friday. I learned how to think fast under pressure because we had to be able to do 1 pallet per hour which was difficult at first but then I got the hang of it and was able to do it. The management was great overall. Even though I was in stock loved interacting with pet parents and their pets at the store.
good,I really enjoyed working at pet smart. I just couldn’t continue to do the 45 min commute after I moved. It was just to long of a drive each way for me. And gas is not cheap.
good,"My experience with petsmart has been mostly positive. The work environment and other employees are really awesome. Pet lovers are some of the most fun and positive to work with. They did better than another job I've had before at making me feel comfortable. It's a hard job, and pay could be MUCH BETTER, but that's mostly entry-level work I suppose. The work is tiring, but rewarding. Especially for dog lovers."
good,"I liked working with all the animals. I enjoyed talking to and helping the customers. I loved highlighting the products I supported. However, I wish there had been more hours offered."
good,"If you enjoy going to work and being kissed by your customers every day this the place to be. Puppy kisses are in full supply. It's a very hard and demanding job and you will be required to do what your hired on for and work your shift to it's fullest. There's no time to waist. We do what we do for the people who help us survive, our customers. It's very fun just need to be adult about what yourdoing."
good,The work environment is always a learning field and growing as a team is a big goal in the work place. No one is left out when it comes to learning the ropes on how the job works. You build together as a team but learn to grow as an individual.
good,"Overall, nice place towel. Always learning something. Good vibes from customers and cute pets. Almost every body is nice and there are a lot of pets. Also, employees get some stuff from company’s"
good,Working at the Pet Hotel is a great starting part time job for any teen or early college student. The job can be really fun at times because of the various dogs you meet and play with. All my coworkers are very friendly and my manager is very understanding. However not much important life skills are gained from working here and after a while you might get tired of enduring long shifts spending time cleaning after dog droppings and dealing with misbehaving dogs.
good,if you like working with pets it's a nice place to work . Customers bring their pets in to be groomed you see many different kinds. You are able to learn many different diets of all pets
good,"If you like working with dogs good, you will learn dog body language, create bonds with pet parents and there dogs."
good,"Aside from having a very unproffesional and new GM to the industry, i thoroughly enjoyed my time with this company. I fully understand that one person doesn't represent a whole company, and the company itself is very inclusive and promotes a healthy work culture"
good,I would come in either in the morning or afternoon I would take care of animals and help customers. In the morning I would have to feed all the animals.
good,It’s was a great experience I Enjoyed my time while I was there. They gave plenty of opportunities for associates to move up & excel with in the company. All & all it was a nice company to work for
good,"Great place to work but the hours didn't match my schedule. All the employees are super nice and its a really healthy work environment. Save money on pet items, if u need too!"
good,If you want to work in retail it’s a good place to be. Staff help each other in all departments. Only issue I had was with corporate wanting all bathers to be groomers and if you didn’t go through the training or declined they stopped putting you on the schedule. That’s how they weed people out. I wouldn’t consider it a secure job. Once I got a second job they stopped scheduling me.
good,"A great place to work, but the corporate office is pushing the line when it comes to safety where the hotel is concerned. A lot of the recent changes have been monetarily motivated, and will have a negative impact on the pets staying there"
good,"Show up on time, clock in, be dressed properly, drink coffee while talking about the morning stock. Putting out all the morning stock, wiping off any rat feces or urine from the products, keeping busy when managers are watching especially. Avoid workplace drama and politics. I think you might be better off at a place like Costco or Home depot if the smell and feces is a problem for you."
good,Overall working at PetSmart was a good experience I left to go work for a friend of mine who owns his own company then I left there to remain an operations manager at angels and arrows...
good,As a whole PetSmart is a fun place to work at. They do a lot of Family stuff. You can bring your dog to work. They give away a lot of free stuff. Free food at times. People here are happy and love there job.
good,"I truly enjoyed my job while working for PetSmart. Even though I had to do the same tasks every shift, it was always different due to the different types of dogs I got to work with. I loved that I made commission and if I wanted to make more money I just had to work harder."
good,"THEY NEGOTIATE PAY*** "
good,"Coworkers were usually very friendly and helpful to everyone.  They were understanding about urgent things coming up and being unable to come into work.  If someone was struggling with a particular pet or customer, other coworkers would step in to help."
good,"Opportunity to advance is excellent, good work environment depending on management.  As a company, senior store management is great, I just happen to have one that js the exception to the rule. PetSmart is very associate oriented, working to ensure that all associates are taken care of and the work environment is enjoyable and rewarding. I would highly recommend them and certainly say as a career opportunity, definitely a great place to work!!!"
good,Fun place to work.. caring for animals is a must.. helping pet parents find what they need to give their pets a long and healthy life is very rewarding.
good,"Funnest job I have yet to do, I get to take care of the animals and overall this job is a great start to any specialization in the animal field. It also teaches you social skills and more about animals"
good,Outsmart was one of the best jobs I had. Pay was low but you do have some raise opportunities. Its a fun environment to work at since you work with and around interesting people with similar interests
good,"For starters, if you love working with dogs and have a good amount of patience, this job may be for you! The staff and management are super helpful and nice. They are always ready to lend a helping hand. On the downside, bathers don't get very many hours and are paid minimum wage. But if you do have the time, patience and a passion for grooming you will most likely receive the opportunity to go to academy, where they do 3-4 weeks of schooling teaching you how to groom dogs. This is a fully covered course and they give you a set of tools. Though this is an amazing opportunity if you're wanting to be a groomer, you have to be prepared to stay with PetSmart as a full time groomer for 2 years otherwise you pay for the schooling and tool set. Overall I enjoyed working there but realized dog grooming wasn't for me."
good,Overall I enjoyed my experience working with petsmart. I was fresh out of high school and was looking for a job where I could work with animals while I was going to school. This job is perfect for people who are animal lovers and have great customer service skills.
good,"I find PetSmart to be a relaxing place to work and if you enjoy working with animals and helping customers with their issues concerning their pets and meeting those pets, you'll like this job."
good,"Although some people may say it’s an awful place to work, I think that the atmosphere is a great place especially if you are an animal lover like me. I think that we could have been paid a little bit more, but we never really had to go on strike or anything, so overall, I thought pet smart was good."
good,Very welcoming environment with awesome staff and management. Felt very well prepared working here as the on-the- job training is more strict than other previous jobs I have experienced.
good,"I found the job to be enjoyable as an animal lover. The constant training and knowledge learned are enjoyable and useful in making sure that the animals cared for are in the best of hands. I found the manager and assistant managers to be very kind, interacting, engaging, and understanding. Co-workers are invested in all the animals with some specializing in certain animals. If you're willing to try, you can make friends with your co-workers easily. The job is often simple and you can never get tired caring for all the animals. The hardest part of the job is caring for the sick, the injured, or the returned animals in the isolation room. You will feel sad when you keep caretaking for an animal that just can't get healthy but you love that you can provide the loving and caring they appreciate. At times the job can get boring, slow, and repetitive but when rush hour hits, you'll be busy constantly. The best advice I can offer is taking the learnings to heart and try to advance your position. Advancing your position creates a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience overall that you won't forget."
good,"If you're applying to work in the grooming salon because you hate people and only want to work with dogs, then you're an actual fool. Please keep in mind that your entire day will be spent with your co-workers and in veiw of customers. the salon (including the back room where the kennels and baths are) is actually pretty small, and the one and ONLY window just lets you see the inside of the rest of the store. Customers will stare at you and children will tap on the glass like you're a god-forsaken fish. You will not see the light of day. "
good,"Petsmart will give you many tools to allow you to grow both within the company and outside of the company. They ensure that every individual is treated well, and that the pets are the main focus of daily operation."
good,Volunteer work here. Cleaned cages and played with cats. Report any medical conditions the cats have. Food and water for the cats. General management of the place.
good,it has great flexibility but not a lot of breathing room plus the management was horrible. I felt like I was working more than what i was getting paid for and it was really disorganized.
good,"Pretty good place to work. Fair hours, reasonable pay, nothing out of the ordinary for a first part-time job. Only word of caution would be that if you sign up for any position outside of grooming/management, you will be doing any and every job needed to be done in your shift. You may sign up as a pet care associate, but you will spend plenty of time stocking and cashiering as well as being an associate."
good,"I started this job in college and it was a perfect job until I ended up having to move. It was very flexable with my school hours, but they would also make sure I had enough hours of work that I asked for."
good,As a store leader I gave it my all because I was supported by district leader and did not want to let him down.   Built a solid team.   As I find with all retail I find drama.   Enjoyed working with adoption groups and pet parents pets.
good,"In a typical day at petsmart I come into work ready to work and have a great day. The relationship that I have with my coworkers is amazing and working with the pets is really rewarding most days. All of my managers are amazing, from the store manager to the the salon manager. After the end of the day I have the possibility of going home or netting a few extra hours on the floor because I have been cross-trained to run the cash register and help out on the floor. The times that I find the most difficult is when the salon is really busy and everyone is very busy but we get though it and manage to complete everything. Working at petsmart is a great experience and I am happy to be an associate."
good,A typical day would be cleaning the cage the animals stayed in and watching them in the play room or cleaning the play room. I learned how great it is to have an animal and how to handle one. The hardest part was making sure the animals got along. The enjoyable was when the boxers would sit near me instead of playing with others. They were sweet.
good,"Working with animals is great, especially if you work in the PetCare department. But sometimes it feels like your pay should be more because we are the most knowledgeable of variety of animals and their care."
good,"Depending on the location and management, Petsmart can be a great place to work. You get to meet a lot of friendly pet parents and take care of the pups that come into the salon. you must have a lot of patients and work well with all sorts of animals."
good,"Fun and Always presenting new challenges. Like any other company, its not perfect. On busy times of the year scheduling can be a little off but that is expected for any business."
good,If you love animals it is great to work at. Coworkers were some of the best people I know and I enjoyed working here for as long as I did. Not much pay and not much advancement however.
good,great place to learn new real life applications of being a pet parent and educating customers to learn more about a new pet they may not have known they would enjoy.
good,"I worked at Petsmart for about seven months. It was a fun company to work for and I was offered a lot of job variety (cashier, stocking shelves, pet care associate, dog bather, etc.). However, I was only ever scheduled 20 hr. per week or less. I honestly loved the job and would have stayed on longer, if only they had given me more hours a week."
good,"I loved working there. It was one of the few jobs I have had that I actually like. Managers were great, the pay was decent. You were able to get paid every week."
good,"Petsmart is a nice place to work for. I am glad that have been working there for almost 2 years now. The people I work with are absolutely amazing. Ever since I started at petsmart, my knowledge of animals has expanded a lot."
good,This was a good place to work that offered opportunities for advancement in most areas. Obedience training was always my favorite part of that job. You got regular pay raises based off of your performance but I never had a vacation. They had decent health coverage.
good,"It's really a fun place to work if you like dogs.  Getting to love on all sorts of dogs and play with them individually.  Checking in at morning time before day camp is consistant, you have to put name bands on them, pet them, check for any bumps bruises or hot spots.  Take them to their room and ensure they have water. You have to check them into the computer and make sure any special services are notated on the break chart, ie.  baths, walks, nails.   Responsible for creating a play list for Doggie day camp and if necessary make sure some dogs who don't necessairily get along aren't in the same playroom.  Assign tasks to the associates that will be working that day with you; cleaning rooms, baths, nails, or individual play times with certain dogs.  January thru March is a little slow not at many people needing a boarding facility. so in these times we assign cleaning to all associates.  There is always something to be cleaned.   If ever I am having a bad day just going into a room and loving on a dog releases the stress of the day.  I have personally learned how to approach people either employees or customers in a different way to make sure everyone is happy and not being condesending to them. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the people who think they deserve a discount all the time.  They can get rather rude and sometimes you just have to call another manager to handle the situation.  Sometimes they call you names and cuss at you but you cant take it to heart.  Another hard part of the job is when occassionally there is a dog fight and a dog gets hurt.  Lots of"
good,"It is a fun environment to work for. You can really make friends while working here, but some of the staff isn't so friendly. You can really learn a lot about animals while working here and if you love animals this is your place to be."
good,"I worked for Petsmart for two years and my overall experience was good. The managers are awesome. They always make sure to work with your schedule and they are very helpful."
good,"The animals are amazing, most of the customers are great, and the culture is lively and fun. Management focuses mostly on corporate numbers and less on the individual employees."
good,"Always fun, the animals are the sweetest part. It can be a stressful environment when customers are unhappy. It can also get very tedious when waiting around."
good,Managers have been very helpful and are great people to work with. They have been the kind of people who you want to work hard for. However the more open availability the better chance for hours. They do not hire full time.
good,My time at petsmart that is also not really gonna end soon has been a good one besides one manager that I have that has been a problem since before we transferred from another store to the same store. this manager has made other coworkers not want to work here and in turn they decided to leave simply because of how this manager was acting. I've had very few bad incidents with this manager but that's because she plays favorites.
good,steadily busy throughout your shift learned a lot of things about pet care there is always something that you can find to do great group of people to work with the only thing i feel like the training was not very detailed and did not help too much and coworkers seemed to get aggravated if u had to ask them for help..other than that i would say it was a decent place to work
good,"Petsmart was my first job I loved it. The animals, the training, everything. But as all work places there are people who get special treatment and I don’t put up with unfair treatment."
good,i had the positon after graduating college in 2008.  It was a great opportunity to learn managment skills.  the work was enjoyable with little stress.
good,I sat with the team I supported which had be separated from my own team.  This made it more difficult to interact with my team to get feedback on work I was doing.
good,"Petsmart was fun because of all the dogs you got to meet. Being a dog bather I had to learn time management, and it was also satisfying to help dogs stay clean and cute."
good,"The job requires a set schedule in order to complete the daily tasks but the pay is fair and they offer health care for full time employees."
good,A great company to work for. Easy to work at other stores to pick up hours. Very flexible schedules. I loved learning other positions in the store. I loved helping guests
good,"Petsmart was great place to work if you love pets. Great atmosphere ,Love the people i worked with,learned a lot about animals,fish.And running a store."
good,I liked working at Petsmart mainly because I'm an animal lover and got to work with animals all day.  The pay isn't very good at all. Every day was different. It's a very busy environment and can stressful at times.
good,able to easily go to different department and gives lots of training everywhere you go. staff and management in positive moods and is always giving their best knowledge to customers.
good,"Lots of fun dog grooming."
good,"I worked as a contract cleaner, but I observed the work environment at Petsmart for five years--it is not easy work--lots of stocking, as it is a very busy place, but the customers that come in (especially the ones that bring their pets) are friendlier, as pets have that effect on humans; I was particularly impressed at the amiability between the employees at Petsmart--they seemed to like and respect each other and help each other out and (as a 54 year old now) I have worked some places where that geniality was not present. One of the better places to work."
good,"After clocking in and stretching, must get the right PPE equipment and begin picking orders assigned to you."
good,"This was a job I truly loved. I was very involved in the business and I enjoyed the customers and pets who would shop in the store. I left for another opportunity, but always look back and think to myself, I should have never left."
good,Management was a treat to work for and had a vested interest in employees.  Opportunities to learn new skills and demonstrate those skills. Repeat customers so you go to know the names of the customers.
good,"My reason for leaving was issues w/the scheduler.  I can't live on 5 hours a week.Most management was good, some were less productive at their jobs.  Overall I liked working there."
good,"Truly enjoyed the experience of working for PetSmart. Customers, pet parents, are wonderful people who truly care about their pets. Overall satisfaction at the end of the day knowing you supported customers in taking care of their pets."
good,"I worked at PetSmart for almost a year, and there were a few flaws, but overall it was a really nice place to work. Customers and coworkers were almost always friendly, and a majority of management I had was excellent. Would recommend to anyone as a part time job."
good,"The group of people I worked with were great, but I didn't feel like I got real support from the managers. They change when they feel like following protocol or not."
good,"Friendly people, made a lot of friends. Job can be fun some days. Slow summers, very busy winters. Many opportunities to try different job functions. Regular breaks. 4 days a week. Par pay. Despite it's flaws, I recommend giving it a shot."
good,"On the average day I got the chance to work with customers on the sales floor as well as at the cash register. You're not stuck in one place all day, which really helps the day go faster. Since it was a pet store, I got to see animals almost every few minutes no matter the day. The managers were reliable and open-minded, as well as willing to work with employees rather than leaving them to work alone. It is a team atmosphere, I never felt like I was fending for myself."
good,"Playing with all the live animals will keep you from getting your work done."
good,I was not an experience dog bather when I first started. But I was very interested when I went in with a friend to have her dog bathed. So the manager of PetSmart so my interest and told me to put in an application. I did I got hired and I rather enjoyed it. The dogs also liked my long manicure nails that was how I massage them when I bathe them
good,You will be doing your job and other people's job...but I liked my co-workers. It was great until a new business took over and started making cuts to staff so we were shorthanded and making it hard for groo.rrs to commission out.
good,Petsmart Pethotel is a lot of hardwork that is rewarded by playing with dogs all day. you create bonds wiht the aninamls and they recognize you and get super excited to see you. the management is friendly and always willing to work with their employees like schedule adjustments.
good,"Over all petsmart is not a bad place to work for a groomer, paid time off steady work and benefits. Very fast pace and can be stressful at times but if your a groomer with plans of managment it's a good place"
good,great place to work especially if your an animal lover. be ready to work weekends and holidays. the leadership in my district is great and I love the relationship I have with them
good,"Petsmart will constantly try to push you into doing almost everything, from cashering to sales associate, to cleaning, etc. They have also taught me a great amount in animal care."
good,Good place to learn your entry management skills. Can take some time to move up to the higher management positions. Can be fun place to work. Fast paced.
good,Petsmart is a great place to gain experience in cashiering and about customer service. You do as well learn about caring for animals. You do get trained on how to speak to customers and getting certain sales as certain things through the year do get promoted a lot.
good,"I love working at PetSmart in the grooming salon. I just can't make a living for what it pays me. If I could be a full time bather, I would stay. I don't want to be a dog stylist and that's what the bathing position is all about: stepping up to haircuts."
good,Loved working here with all the associates! Everyone’s friendly. The only downside is the customers who think they can do whatever and treat you wrong.
good,It is not that that stressful or fast-paced but required/expected to get things done. Managers are good and helpful never had a problem with any of them. Relaxed and friendly work days.
good,"Cashed people out in a timely and efficient manner, stocked shelves in the early morning, flexible hours, great management, most enjoyable part of the day was being able to talk with coworkers"
good,I have a love hate relationship with petsmart.  Love it because when working with animals you dont feel like you are not at work. Dislike it because i was expected to go above and beyond  my job description but still paid the minimum.
good,"The people you work for are great, management is pretty decent.  The work load and pace is a bit much, but manageable if you stay focused. You will get tired of hearing your voice and the headsets voice though."
good,A typical day at Petsmart starts with greeting the line of people that are more ready to be there than you are. It is getting to meet different people and different dogs and providing a safe and fun environment for both pet parents and their pets. I enjoyed my time at my first store and I am looking forward to meeting the Petsmart team in Tempe.
good,"Good place to work if you love people and also animals, being able to help pet parents with their question is alsways a plus. Manger scheduling could be better and also the turnover rate is fairly high"
good,I've been employed with PetSmart for three years and have a positive work experience in this organization.  Unfortunately me commute has become burdensome and I need to work closer to home.
good,My positions were challenging and I enjoyed my time at Petsmart. When I was there they went from a small company to being on the stock exchange so I saw a lot of growth with this company.
good,"you get to see a lot of animals, you get hands on training, you are given daily tasks to complete in a timely manner."
good,"good pace environment ,engaging supervisors, recreation for breaks,incentives for production and accuracy,fair paid time off,safety lunches for meeting osha safety standerd"
good,the most enjoyable part is connecting with animals and the customers that love their pets. Although sales for premium packages are very important to them.
good,"I have worked for Petsmart for a little over a year. Everyone at my store gets along and works together well. The job itself is enjoyable and isn't hard to do. Unfortunately full time isn't available, pay is low, and it is difficult to grow into better positions within the company."
good,I was a retail manager for years. I found out I was pregnant and I needed to step to a lower job position due to health reasons and me still being an undergraduate student with a full-time internship. PetSmart worked with me and they were very supportive. I would not have taken the job if I was not pregnant but I'm glad this is where I worked during my pregnancy.
good,Managers are super nice and helpful when I worked there. I always felt appreciated and there was never any drama. It's a very easy fun first job. And they are always willing to train in other areas.
good,Gives you the opportunity to learn valuable skills in customer service as well as animal exposure and experience. Is very flexible and allows opportunity to cross train.
good,It was an experience working with all different types of animals. It was really fun when the shelters came with all the puppies and kittens. The staff was super nice and fun.
good,"This is a great  place to work.  Other employees are nice,  and the management is very competent and nice and helpful.  Sometimes the employees don't get enough hours, but management usually tries to give enough hours."
good,"Fun place to work.  Cultivating a relationship with the regular customers that come in and getting to know them, their pet, and the needs of both is very rewarding.  It also does not hurt that you get  to be around all different animals everyday."
good,"A pet stylist has a very stressful job when busy. Between the opening/closing duties you also have to check in/out your appointments and coworkers appointments, groom dogs, answer phones, make appointments and take walk ins. you must work weekends and holidays."
good,"Working as a Bather in the Grooming Salon is such a fun and interesting job for those who love animals (mostly dogs). Being able to be around dogs all the time working in this type of environment is such a good learning experience. You're really able to learn a lot about how to properly care for dogs and how grooming regularly can extend the life of a dog. Management is very particular about how they want things done to promote safety of all pets. Weekends are usually the busier days in the Salon for both Bathers and Groomers, but either way there is always something to do."
good,"Overall it was a fun and productive place to work.  A place that i hated leaving and would love to work for again.  The management was good and had no problem coming out and helping people on the floor to take care of things, no matter if it was helping someone in the Salon with bathing a dog, or out on the floor stocking things. The workplace over all was upbeat and relaxing."
good,"Great company to work for. I would continue if i didn't have a different career goal that I was seeking. The job is fast paced and physically demanding, but the benefits for working for a big company like this are rewarding."
good,It was a good company. I only left to work somewhere else.I liked training the dogs and the customers were great. I had a good managerial staff. I was a good experience. I would go back and work there again.
good,"I loved working with my pet parents and their dog, they brought light onto my day. There is just no movement to a higher positio though this company, I cross trained in petcare and became#1 in puppy guide sales. I have the highest email capture at 47%."
good,can set your schedule but hard to switch shift/get time off sometimes.  still retail  but overall better customers and work environment. minimum wage with ok raises
good,"Took care of dogs all day, played with them and watched over them while their owners were at work/vacation/etc. Cleaned kennels, gave medicine, fed and provided water."
good,"Out of all the jobs I have applied and worked for, PetSmart has to be the best job I've ever had. The people I work with are super friendly and very helpful."
good,Most recent job and it pays the bills. Long hours but you have a longer weekend than other jobs would give you. As long as you do your job and don't cause drama you will have a job for long-term.
good,"Hard work with a bit of fun, You have the opportunity to interact with not only store animals but also customers.  Management is great the store is smaller scale therefore you will have more than one role."
good,I love animals and loved working here.  I worked as a team leader in the specialty department (pet care and sales) so I took care of all types of animals.   The best part was learning to hand feed a cockatoo who came to store so young that he didn't know how to feed himself.  The training and knowledge gained about animals is phenomenal.  The other great part is dealing with families and kids as they come to get an addition to their family.  The kids are cute and so excited and it great to teach them new things and get updates on animals you may have helped raise.  Now the hard part is it can be a dirty job as you will have to clean up a lot of messy situations and sometimes properly dispose of animals that have died due to injuries or just age.  Occasionally you will also have to deal with families that are neglecting or hurting animals and get with your manager to intervene.
good,Not a bad place to work but you must have a love for animals you do have to pick up after the customers pets that they come in and shop with the pets but overall the people are nice the workers are nice nicer place to shop than to work
good,"amazing job, i love working there but since we had a new manager hired its gone downhill. I love my job and every single one of my coworkers. amazing environment and tons of fun while we work."
good,"I loved grooming and working with the team I was with. The salon we were in was a very close knit and loving salon. The managers were always supportive, even in a difficult situation"
good,A typical day at work consists of standing at a cash register from when your shift starts to when it ends. Except when you open you help stock the shelves. I have learned great customer service skills. The management is great. Very friendly people. The hardest part of the job would be when it gets to busy sometimes you don't get any help. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely meeting all of the cute puppies.
good,"Petsmart is a fast growing company.  Management staff varies on each location, but overall it's a solid company to work for.  The benefits are incredible as well."
good,"Petsmart is a fun place to work if you're into animals. Hours are flexible, and the pay is ok. The management however often seems a little slow to act on certain situations, however they are there for you when you need them. Honestly, every experience depends on the people around you in the store, working with friends greatly increases the amount of fun that you will have."
good,"Petsmart is a very fun place to work. It is great if you are an animal lover who likes to be moving constantly and always want something to do. The only issue is there is too much to do and never enough time, employees, or pay. Burning out is fairly common."
good,I loved working at Pet'sMart. I worked there for about two years and never really had any problems until I had my wisdom teeth removed. Once I was able to go back to work which I actually went back sooner than the doctor wanted me to because I didn't want to lose my job. They would only schedule my for 5 hours a week instead of 8/9 hour shifts Monday-Sunday. Other than that it's a great place to work.
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work if you are just starting out in your field, or want to try a different line of work.  They provide a lot of training for most positions.  Unfortunately, unless you work within the corporate office, there is not a lot of opportunity for career advancement."
good,"I worked in the hotel and it was amazingly fun! I never wanted to leave but unfortunately I had to move. The hotel is one of the harder jobs at PetSmart. It requires a lot of patience and determination, but it's all worth it when you see those happy dog faces! Management tends to be amazing and cares a lot for the associates. It's generally a great place to work."
good,"Fun environment for animal lovers, customers not as irritable as most stores. Scheduling is fantastic. No benefits for part timers and must fight your way to become full time, but once you are all is good."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with managers because they actually made my job enjoyable.I didn't mind getting up and coming to work everyday. There were a few managers who you couldn't rely on to get their stuff done, So you would have to pick up their slack,"
good,"People friendly - Constant celebrations"
good,great job to have if you have a passion for customer service and animals. always oppurtunity to move up the ladder and great pay and benefits offered if the work ethic is there
good,Interacting with all the animals and pets each day is very rewarding. The best part of the job was seeing puppies in the store and being able to pet and play with them.
good,"Don't get me wrong, its a great place, the people are great and every thing along those lines. However, due to past experiences and horrible time off request allowance, It can be kind of hard to enjoy it there. "
good,It was a good place to work. The mangers were kind and treated me well. I enjoyed my time working there. My coeworkers were helpful and respectful towards me.
good,"The work environment is easy-going with the right co-workers, and managers. Unfortunately, during my time working their, the store went through three managers with caused a real bad mix-up among workers and a lot of miscommunication."
good,"Good part time job, for either college students or anyone looking for a part time job. The culture that the company sets is friendly and welcoming to anyone."
good,"A typical day at work is busy no matter what you're doing in the store, but it's so worth it because most of the customers and staff are so nice. The managers are all really great, and the coworkers are pretty nerdy. The hardest part about being a pet care associate is finding time to clean those fish tanks. But the best part of the job is coming home and always feeling satisfied by the work you did that day."
good,Pet smart is constantly changing their policy on how associates take care and provide for our animals and our costumers. I enjoy working here but the way we go about handling our customers is hard. Were required to ask certain questions to guarantee the animals safety but yet when we don't feel the pet parent should be an owner were forced to sale anyways.
good,"Working here is both fun and challenging. The people are great and the Managers are really nice. It's a real education here, with all the various creatures we have here."
good,"During turn over they tell me which guest are sick and take an extra look for it. Clean all cages, scrub the floor do laundry/dishes. Prepare food around 4 am and distribute it around 5am. Then do walks and mark it on the chart. If they ate, urinate and/or no. 2."
good,"It was fun working there, the people are nice and the animals are great! The part of the job that was concerning for me was the working hours. It's almost like seasonal work because during summer and holidays you will get many hours. During the off season, the hours can vary, they can send you home if it's too slow, or call you in last minute if there is a sudden rush. Sometimes you will get rude customers, and I was fortunate that I felt really supported by my managers."
good,"Great place to work for a couple years. I did everything in this store, hotel, salon, cashier, petcare, etc. I learned a lot and it taught me a lot about customer service and teamwork."
good,This job was a job where there was always something to do. You always had to be vigilant and careful because you were in charge of other people's pets.The people and management were friendly and always willing to help.
good,"Working at Petsmart was fun! I had decent wages and good, flexible hours. Management is great in regards to working around doctor appointments, child care, and school schedules. Getting to interact with customers and their pets at work was an added bonus!"
good,there is typically always something to do. I learned a lot about different animals and dog food. Management can be better and can be nicer. The best part about the job is all the animals you get to see and even pet.
good,This position is for someone that loves animals and willing to get their hands dirty. It worth the experience if your attending school in the veterinary medical field.
good,this is one of the best jobs to have if you love pets there is so much more as you work you learn  of the many products that are out there. the work is part-time
good,"A typical day at Petsmart is greeting customers, asking if they need help with anything, selling fish,small animals,birds and reptiles."
good,The job in general is very easy to learn but after a while it does get to be tiring. Working with animals is definitely going to be the best part about it.
good,"If you intend to move to management they give you opportunity to advance, however if you don't take the first opportunity to advance then they may over look you for the next advancement.  Customer service is a must, but easy if you are good with this skill."
good,"i started in stocking then moved up to lead then manager within a year. i became the closing manager in a extremely high volume store in Plano TX. I had good relations with all employees and mangers. repeat customers would request me to help. i would close the store,  count tills and lock up the safe and walk employees to their cars. the most difficult part of the job was dealing with angry customers. they would be upset about grooming mainly which i would sort out easily. the most enjoyable job was having good employees and managers to help out. Team oriented stores get more done and have an overall better atmosphere."
good,"I very much enjoyed my job at petsmart. My customers were the best part of the job."
good,"Growth/Advancement is very possible, with hard work and determination can be achieved quite quickly."
good,"Its a pretty labor intensive job but I've gained a lot of customer service experience from it. You do a lot of frequent cleaning cages, feeding the cats and dogs, bathing them and most of all...playing with them! The hotel manager at the location I worked at was great and really cared and showed appreciation for his employees. I learned about dog breeds I have never heard of and helping work at the front desk helped me not be so shy. It gets really busy and stressful during the holidays and holiday/3 day weekends but somehow we manage to get through it. Overall, fun but a lot of physical labor."
good,"Petsmart is a fun, with great benefits, not a lot of room for advancement and this company always has the customer in mind, and stands by the customer is always right."
good,"Had many opportunities, worked in 6 different stores, opened two new stores, training manager for six years, was able to make many new friends.  I saw the company go from 350 stores to over 1200. stock price go from $3.00 per share to $80.00+.  Over all it was a good experience."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Petsmart as a PCS at the pet hotel. All of the dogs I've met and all of the regular customers we got was a fun experience. Although it was fun, it was still hardworking! There is a lot more than just playing with dogs in camp."
good,"Go into work at least ten minutes or early to get into my work zone."
good,"Management is wonderful. They create a comfortable, laid back atmosphere. It is great to be able to meet dogs on a daily basis. I enjoy learning new things about nutrition and species I am not familiar with."
good,"Whereas the pay could have been way better, the people I worked with made it worth the while. My managers were always so great, and the people I worked with in the salon were awesome. We always had a good time, even when the work loads got high. I was not too keen on the conveyor belt style I got roped into, because it became harder to take the time I felt would be needed to work with the dogs rather than speeding through them all like an assembly line. I loved bathing, it was great fun, but I would have liked more flexibility and freedom in working with the dogs and their conditions. It was all about upsells rather than the benefit to the pet. That was the only thing I did not like about the job, because I like to help pets rather than process them on a conveyor belt. Otherwise, this was a great place to work! I loved the animals, and I loved the people I worked with!"
good,I enjoyed Petsmart.  I wanted to grow my family so decided to leave and have a daughter and stay home and take care of her.  I am looking to start working again!
good,"PetSmart is a wonderful place to work. I have had nothing but a wonderful experience working there.I have the wonderful coworkers and management. The culture is something I have never experience in any previous positions. I find myself enjoying spending time at work and never dreading any day. "
good,"Customer service, cashier, pet care associate, dog bather, stocker. Got things that customers needed, answered any questions, took care of the dogs and other animals that were there. Make sure everything is stocked and all shelves looked good and items were rotated properly. Being short handed really made for a long day but the job always got done."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company.  They were fair, honest, and promoted from within.  I worked for them in both Florida and South Carolina."
good,Management is good. All the employees get along great. It was a good place to work and I would recommend it to anybody looking for part time work. It would get busy and fast paced.
good,"Pet smart is a great place to work."
good,High stress you are working with animals there is always a chance of getting hurt. There is always somewhere to go within the company
good,"I worked here for five years and overall it was not a bad place to work, the compensation was minimum wage and it was difficult to move ahead. I liked all but one manager who just had a superiority complex."
good,when I started working for PetSmart I loved it!!!!! Great place. all the employees were friendly and open armed I have met some nice people and till this day I still keep in contact with some of the people there. I have never had a bad time at this place. for someone to know nothing about animals I learned quickly.
good,It was a very self paced work place. The managers were kind but they messes up the schedule a few times which was a bummer but other than that it was a good place overall
good,"I loved the variety of animals that would come in. From snakes to rare dog breeds. I loved working there because of that. Also, the money was pretty good, as long as you want to do the dogs i will make pretty decent money."
good,"very satisfying work can learn alot about animals and customer service. great people, great environment and great company. Really good job and highly recommended."
good,cashier or pet care was set from when you get to work. from then till the end of your shift you are to remain in the position placed until told other wise. they can also train you in fork lift and stock or pet  groomer if chosen
good,A lot of labor intense work. Must be constantly on task in order to get numbers but overall a decent place to work. Ping pong and fuseball tables for break
good,I truly enjoy working at my job and with the people I work with. Management is very considerate with my feelings and appreciates my hard work. I enjoy being able to teach new pet owners how to take care of their animals and educate them on how to be the best parent they can to their animals.
good,"typical retail job. Nothing too special to report. The management team seemed to move around from store to store often which typically meant a shift in store culture with every change. Can sometimes make things confusing for those who had worked at the same store for years at a time, but kept everything refreshing."
good,"The people at PetSmart are very easy to get along with and management is great, but the pay is unfair and raises are annual. Otherwise it's a great job."
good,"While working at PetsMart, I learned a lot. It is a great company to work for.The atmosphere was always busy and I loved the staff. Everyone worked together and they were always nice."
good,"Despite having to write 15 individual logs for each dog, it's fun to interact with all the pets that come into the pets hotel every day. I always enjoy watching over them and having friendly conversations with neighboring employees. It's definitely an exciting environment that doesn't get old."
good,"Fast - paced, yet very fun place to work at. Can sometimes be somewhat stressful like any other job. Depending on the store and management it can be a good place to work, but if management isn't consistent it can cause the work environment to be pretty crazy"
good,"Great place to work. Besides the typical duties of a Store leader, you have the opportunity to create moments with Pet Parents. When a family comes in for their first pet and you are there to help with the decision, that is something special. What other job are you able to pet a puppy or kitten on a daily basis!"
good,Animals have a way to boost your spirit and the best part is that they do not talk. Of course their bark is better than their bite but when you love what you do and know your job there are always tricks to the trade.
good,"I love working with animals, and this job is the perfect opportunity.  Good pay, good tips, and decently great coworkers. However, when something goes wrong with one coworker, everyone tends to jump on the band wagon, which can make it hard to feel comfortable being there. But all in all, it is worth it, to see my customers smile at their newly washed and great smelling dog. It is my pride and joy to take care of their animals."
good,"My day at work is spent getting the store ""Grand Opening ready"", communicating with my team the goals of the day and working to achieve those goals.  I will check in with the team regularly and give feed back when needed.  I love working with people and it is great to be around animals."
good,"Overall was happy with this company.  Health and vacation benefits were good, people were great.  Was typically very busy and fast paced."
good,"Fun very fast paced place to work, You get experience different types of animals. One of the biggest down falls for me with petsmart was the extreme lack communication and lack of care for associates."
good,I enjoyed working here a great deal.  Reasonable job requirements.  Decent pay. The most enjoyable part is of course seeing animals all day. Lengthy hiring process but worth it.
good,"If you love pets then this is a great place to work. If retail is your career, there is no better place to work that here. Selling products to help better the lives of our pets is far more gratifying then selling electronic items or paper and pens."
good,"Fast Paced and Enjoyable but could be better. Management is fair, laid back environment. Work can be emotionally over baring."
good,"It was a great learning environment for a first job. I learned to deal with problem solving situations, deal with animals, and lastly to deal with customers. I learned that it was a productive and fun workplace since I had to learn how to deal with various animals. The management were always willing to work with you just in case some family emergency came up or school related activities I had to attend while I was in college. Overall my experience there helped me become more responsible, time oriented, work with people,and it also helped me realize my flaws."
good,"My tipical day at work consist of interacting with drivers, associates, supervisiors and managers. Making appointments and driving a dock. I've learned so much, from managing a dock to leading a team. Managment is great, they have a positive attitude and a great outlook on the business."
good,"If you love animals, PetSmart is a great place to work. It's mostly like any other big company regarding pay and benefits, but the scheduling is pretty flexible, the environment is mostly laid back and happy."
good,I love working as a PetSmart associate but it is my goal to be able to pay for my own tuition in school and the hours they are providing just aren't practical for me.
good,"It's a good job I like the people I work with, just kind of difficult when people ask you for products you don't carry or then make a big scene about it,  good customer service is a must,"
good,"I love when the pet parents bring the dogs I have helped train back in to see me to show off their progress. I enjoying helping people understand how dogs think and why they react and do the things that they do. I love in class when the pet parents all of the sudden has an ""AH HA"" moment and it all makes sense for them. I try to also let them know that not one way works for all dogs. and that I would be more than happy to tailor the training to them and their dog. Kind of like how not all people learn the same way, I try to explain that concept. The hardest part of the job is when people know and have been told several times how to fix the ""dogs problem"" but they refuse to change their habits in order to do it. All that I can do is continue to offer the help and advice that I can to help people know what to do with their dogs and how to make life easier for the both of them through training."
good,my review always  good I do not have problem. they pay good and every year review I get raise . the company give more money and more hour.
good,Management is awesome depending on what store you are at but support higher than store level is lacking severely. If there is a serious concern they pay no attention to it. If you apply yourself and really take in everything that they teach you it is easy to move up a few levels.
good,"I am a professional bather on a typical day at work I check to see how many dogs I have scheduled. I proceed to check in the appointed dogs and commence my work. I do the dogs nails, bath, drying, and clean their ears. There are a lot of different bath packages that I have to know how to do off the top of my head. I also assist my coworker in achieving their goals. I have learned more about time management on this job. Also how to rise to the occasion when nothing is going to plan and you have to figure out how you are going to complete your work on time and to the level of excellence you expect of yourself. I have gained more experience dealing with dogs of all types and breeds. I enjoy my coworkers we all help each other on a daily basis. The hardest part of this job is how back breaking the work is I get a lot of large breed dogs so a huge portion of my day is bent over washing/drying them. Another difficult part is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with dogs. Getting return customers who are kind and appreciative of how hard I work for them."
good,we would clockin and attend our start up meeting and we are told what we have for that day and then we get to work. work is fun and the people were great and i enjoyed working there.
good,"Depends on the manager you were working for, instead of taking responsibility, the manager I worked for blamed everyone else and within a year had 100% turnover rate for management.  The store manager is now, no longer with the company.  The company is great to work for"
good,"I can't speak to all of the Petsmart stores out there, but I loved showing up to work. As a part time Pet Training Instructor, I had the ability to provide flexibility for my own schedule and was able to interact with associates and customers from all departments and all all walks of life. Getting paid to play with dogs isn't all that bad either!"
good,"This is definitely a fun place to work. It's not always easy, but everybody is willing to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is getting a difficult dog that won't sit still or tries to bite. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to play with dogs at work (who wouldn't love that?)."
good,There is always something new to learn. It is enjoyable to be able to learn new things about the products and new tips and tricks to help others. The managers are friendly and know how to give constructive criticism which makes for a constantly growing and enjoyable work place. My coworkers are all willing to make changes for the better and never have problems with addressing any issue that may be presented. One of the harder parts of the job is to make sure that some of the more stressed animals are comfortable. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help customers learn something they may not have known prior to walking into the store.
good,"Loved the team that was there when I worked there. Management was amazing when I started, but was going downhill around the time I left. Hours are flexible, pay is kind of low but to be expected for this kind of job. Not a lot of room for growth but its still possible with good timing/luck and the right managers to guide you."
good,"PetSmart has provided me the experience and growth in a retail environment. My strength is customer service and I am supervisor over the front end, managing the cashiers and balancing the cash office. I enjoy people and helping them, which comes from my medical background."
good,"Taking care of dogs and making sure every customer is comfortable leaving their pet in our care. Resolving any issues with customers or employees and making sure the workplace is fun and safe. I've learned the importance of budget, the true meaning of sales and how to drive a business. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing every customer, employee, and pet is happy."
good,"I have been working for Petsmart for 6+ years and have never had any obstacles moving up in the company. Pay is not the best for certain positions, but I have always loved the people I work with/have worked with."
good,"Enjoyable workplace with amazing co-workers. Friendly atmosphere. Management has changed throughout the company, but still not a bad experience. I have learned how to respectfully deal with troublesome customers. I also learn from the associates in other departments of the store.  Hardest part of the job is not being able to help a customer with a situation out of our control. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to see and pet the different animals that enter the store."
good,"I loved being a Pet Care Manager. I enjoyed caring for the pets. I had a great team but one team member. I did not get any support from that particular store manager to discipline the employee. Corporate got wind and took it into their own hands. I loved my job there. The store manager, not so much."
good,"constant interaction with pets make the day go by faster."
good,Moving at a very fast pace is a typical day work work. Learning the different areas and the different products and where they should be placed by pulling orders. Management was pretty good I never had any issues at all. Co-workers where fun to talk to. Sometimes working at a fast pace for 10 hrs was hard. I had to have the right foot wear on my feet. But the enjoyable part was exercising.
good,"Always come to work happy with a smile on my face, constantly greeting customers, providing assistance and any help needed to the customers. Learned new things about all types of animals, every day I went to work and new experiences by caring for them myself."
good,"Production levels are high, no definite job security.  Must be able to tolerate alot of demands.  Overtime is available but goes to managerial favorites"
good,It was a pleasure to go to work everyday. Spending time with pets and Pet parents became part of my life that is and always will be a love of my life
good,"Overall it was a nice place to work.  I loved the pet care department, although I didn't spend as much time there as I would have liked.  It was a good community and I appreciated the open door policy.  It would have been my ideal job if I could focus on the care of animals, both at the store and belonging to the customers."
good,I worked here as a student attending SAIT. PetSmart has been very supportive during my time as a student. My managers were very nice and easy to get along with. I always maintained a good report with all of my managers.
good,"on a typical day at work, I would go in, stock the inventory, and help customers with what they need. I learned how to drive a forklift as well as gaining information about animal species and breeds/diets. the managers are understanding, and easy to work with. co workers were friendly and fun. the hardest part of this job is heavy lifting and seeing animals in pain and in need of assistance. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see, and interact with customers pets."
good,"PetSmart was a decent place to work. I personally had to leave due to what I thought was a better job and due to some personal issues of my own that affected my work at the time. Overall, great place to work."
good,"You get to interact with all sorts of dogs (and the occasional cat on a leash), and my fellow employees were always great to be around. They were also great about working with employee's schedules for college. The atmosphere is pretty laid back."
good,"Well, need to wake up very early in the morning to get to work on time at 5 am. Need to check existing stock and to replace sold goods. Manage time and to complete work. Team work."
good,"Managers are excellent, my only problems have been with the customers. My normal work day is very organized making it easy for me to get what work I am told to do quickly and efficiently. I enjoy my co-workers and I love being a part of the petsmart team."
good,"A typical day at work involved:  Customer Service/Vendors/Reports/Animal Care/Inventory/Training/Sales"
good,A typical day at work would consist of greeting the customers as they walked through the door and also providing customer service to their needs and ringing up the sales
good,"A typical day at work is to greet, discuss services, check in, provide the service and follow through with the pet parent. I have already been trained in customer service but this job taught me how to even become more familiar with repeat customers, customer complaints and overall satisfaction of customers. I enjoyed my management team because they gave me the direction and tools to do my job and than followed up with me to ensure a happy and enjoyable work environment. My coworkers were a great team. They were always ready to give a hand when needed. The hardest part of the job was controlling the environment to suite the pets needs first.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my customers, and mastering the art of grooming."
good,"Need a job just for fun?  Then try PetSmart.  I have been there for four years.  It was a good job while I was in college, but now that I have graduated I can't afford the bills that I have working there.  Management does really well in giving you the days you need off and working with you in emergencies.  Corporate cut a lot of hours they can use, so now part timers are getting no more than 20 hours a week.  They are good on giving raises, but after your third (and required) raise, it'll be hard to advance from there."
good,"I love interacting with customers and there pets and helping them find all there pets needs."
good,"I started out as a cashier but quickly started learning most areas of customer service including handling and adopting out live animals, stocking the floor and helping solve customer problems and complaints. At Petsmart, they tend to cross-train their employees to make scheduling more flexible. I learned a lot about animal behavior and how to deal with customers in both normal and stressful situations. For the most part, management was fine. There was a lot of turn over in management so our store policies changed a bit depending on who was enforcing them. My co-workers were mostly very competent and professional who didn't just care about getting the job done but getting it done right which is rare in minimum wage retail. The hardest oart of the job was Sundays because those are busy days when people return a lot of merchandise, they're also the days I usually spend the most time on the register. The best part of the job is finding a good family for the older cats who are up for adoption and knowing it's a good match."
good,"I am currently a Petcare Manager for Petsmart. I have been with the company for over six years. It is a great place to work if you're dedicated and dependable just like any other job. However, over the past year, they've taken a turn. I understand that this is a business and that businesses exist to make money. However, I feel like the company is steering away from the care of the animals in our care. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping someone with a pet whether it be a dog, a cat, a reptile, a bird, a fish, or a fur baby. I can tell you that when I'm having a bad day, going to work seems to melt away all the frustrations of every day happenstance."
good,Worked for the company for years and loved it until going to the Saginaw store. District manager was horrible and played favorites. She let her favorite Store manager ruin many careers.
good,"I look forward to my work-days simply because my coworkers, environment, etc. are all pleasant and easy-going. There is no ""high-school"" drama, as I like to call it. Everyone gets to work to do one thing: their job. My managers are all EXTREMELY understanding and patient with me and my coworkers. They are some of the best managers I've ever had in a work-place. Things get tough when I have to deal with complicated customers, or there is an update with our computer system (which happens very often) and it changes the entire day-to-day routine. I enjoy getting to work everyday and knowing exactly what information customers need me to know, meeting my daily quota, and seeing cute animals that like to come into my job."
good,I work in the grooming salon. The most enjoyable thing about my job is the look on the parents face when they pick up their pet from being groomed. My co-workers are easy to get along with and so is the management. The hardest part of my job is that they are over staffed and it reflects at payday. I feel there should be more communication between the salon manager and the store managers.
good,"My typical day was spent taking care of a multitude of things at once and I loved it. I took care of animals and helped new pet parents get educated on how to care for their new addition to the family. I learned so much about animals and how to communicate effectively. I loved my managers for the most part. They had their flaws as most people do but they were good people and I felt really comfortable coming to them at any point and with any issue. The toughest part of this job was the amount of knowledge you had to obtain about the animals, people you are communicating with, and all the other small things that never get appreciated. I enjoyed my job very much and lived the level of challenge I got from it but in the end it wasn't enough to keep me in place. While at Petsmart I was never going to advance like I needed too, the stress from corporate cut backs were taking a huge toll on me, and I didn't get the pay I deserved for the amount of responsibilities I had."
good,"I worked here when I was late teens/early 20s. Managers were on point; making sure the store looked great, price changes were on time, and pet care was well monitored. Daily checklists were enforced."
good,"A typical day at work for me includes connecting with Pet Parents and their animals and providing a warm and exciting experience where customers feel as though they are at a mini-amusement park. Yes I am mainly a cashier and pet care associate but I am also co-ring leader of a positive circus that requires me to make sure I go above and beyond the typical duties of a traditional retail associate. Not only is customer satisfaction important, but more specifically the health and welfare of the animals is priority number one. Whether it is treating sick critters in the isolation room, or just educating customers on how to take care of the pets they have or are intending to have is key. I enjoy my job so much and love all my coworkers and we are truly like a family, however, recently hours have been slashed and therefore I am indeed looking for a career that both I am qualified for but that provides a decent amount of hours and compensation. Looking for ideally at minimum 30 hours a week with no max. Other than the lack of hours available, the only other hard part of the job is I am not the strongest suggestive seller but I believe I make up for it with the other skills I have. The most enjoyable part of the job is hands down interacting with the puppies and pet parents that come in. Even if one is having a bad day, nothing like petting a dog to make yourself feel better."
good,I enjoyed working for this company because I pay a lot of attention to detail. Which is a key aspect for a Pet Stylist position. I take pride in the quality of work that I provide for my customers.
good,"A typical day includes animal care and a great deal of knowledge for customer service. There is always a task to work on and customers to tend to, listen to and assist with their pets needs. I have learned how to use my time wisely to complete tasks within a certain schedule. My co-workers are all very helpful and a very fun and enjoyable group to work with. The hardest part of the job is to be able to juggle multiple customers while answering very detailed questions among completing the tasks at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with animals and taking care of them. I truly enjoy assisting customers and having them feel satisfied from the moment they walk in to the time they get home."
good,Not a bad place to work. Management was very relaxed and friendly.
good,"maintaining a clean work area. Help greet customers and assist them in any help needed. Great co-workers, always a positive place to be at."
good,"I found it is a very laborious job. It involves a lot of responsibility. It is fun and rewarding to be so needed by all of the animals, and having answers for the pet parents."
good,I really enjoyed working at petsmart it was a wonderful experience i really enjoyed my assignments and love the first class service for the dogs.
good,I have been working at Petsmart for 3 years and have enjoyed my time there. My coworkers are very nice and inclusive of others. The managers and assistant managers are very nice and are always there to help the lower-ranked associates. Everyone tries their best to be considerate and understanding with our customers and make their pet's stay a good one.
good,At a typical work day you punch in and complete your daily task list and the rest is all customer services and making the store look presentable. From this job I learned a lot about pet care. The co-workers are great. Everyone is very caring and helpful. The hardest part of the job is cleaning the animal cages. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with all of the animals.
good,"A typical day at work includes working with all kinds of animals from dogs and cats to exotics like reptiles, birds, etc."
good,"Petsmart treats its employees exceptionally well, employee sales that include items that have been discontinued or unsold clearance for very minimal prices, great benefits, and great environment. The supervisors and trainers were very encouraging and let us know that even though we couldn't reach production, we would be a great fit within the company. The problem with that is that most, if not all, of the other departments only hire from within. If you can't make it in shipping, you basically don't get to work for the company these days. This isn't just my point of view, but the point of view of employees that work there and many that have left or been discharged."
good,Fun place to interact with customers and pets and to be around people of like minds
good,"I loved working at Petsmart as my first job from 16-19 years old. I had every job at one time or another whether it be cashier, stock, maintaining the animals."
good,"PetSmart is a great company! It honestly depends on the work environment in certain stores and the people you work with, their passion, etc. I enjoyed working at my store as a Cashier, Lead Cashier, and then Support Manager. I enjoyed pricing and other duties that were related to my marketing skills. I left because I wanted to find something towards my degree. PetSmart will always be the job I learned the most from. I suggest working for the company anytime."
good,"This was a high school job for me, and I carried it through after high school.  I then pursued an advancement to management based on my performance reviews and dedication to the company's values.  I was given a position as a night operations manager.  In this role I managed up to four employees responsible for restocking the store, and conducting inventory counts."
good,Petsmart is a great place to work with lots of oppertunity for growth within the company and moving up does not take forever and a day
good,good job with great benefits. a lot of physical labor and very fast pace.
good,"Replenishment to the hole warehouse using cherry picker, forklift to help with job. Order Pick with in the hole warehouse using pallet runner. This was the first job I use power lifting equipment, and I basically manage myself unless a member of management ask me to do a task. On break me and other co-workers enjoyed play Chess, ping pong and basketball. the hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shift"
good,"A typical day at work included cashiering , stocking and facing products working with customers on their product selection and individaul pet needs suggesting products and services and pet training needs. Loved the job but had very few hours scheduled . In reality I should have stayed there . Management called me into work no less than thirty times to come in and I came in every time to fill void in schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and challenging myself to be the best employee I could be."
good,"Working at Petsmart was one of the most enjoyable jobs I've ever had. Not because of the nature of the work nor the place of work, what made working at Petsmart enjoyable was the people I was working with."
good,"Responsible for start up meetings, planning meetings, engagement with associates, observations, co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"Typical day at work will include being on the register for a few hours, helping customers, seeking out people who need our assistance. Greeting dogs, greeting new pet owners. Doing go backs, organizing the store i.e. facing, garbage and cleaning up after dogs. Co-workers are fun and happy to see each other. Hardest part of the job is definitely staying up at the register for 5+ hours straight. Most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all the dogs, cats, and other animals."
good,"My job with Petsmart was very different from any job I have had before. It was very different caring for dogs and cats that stayed in the store. I would take care of the dogs is Doggie Daycamp and let them around and play, I then would walk the individual dogs that could not be around others. I would clean rooms that dogs checked out of, do the Laundry. I would change their water on the hour and then set up their meals for the job. I learned more about animals then I  knew before. I had great managers that were understanding and patient."
good,"This job is fun to work with the pets, but there seems to be a lack of love with everyone."
good,"My work day consist of grooming dogs, setting appointments, and offering awesome customer service. Working for Petsmart, has taught me how to interact with customers and their fur babies. My co-workers are just like family. They are always willing  to help in time of need. They have great personalities and love their jobs. The hardest part of my job was stocking freight because it is never ending. The most enjoyable part about my job is grooming dogs."
good,"I love the people I work with, my team is very supportive... however it is difficult working at 3am some days and 12pm others. The work wears down on your body and mind as well. Great place to work for if you want to move up in a company, plenty of opportunities given the right store."
good,"typical day at work stocking freight, scanning outs, or unloading the trucks, "
good,"Great company to work for.  "
good,"I learned many skills from PetsMart, I learned to multi-task and toned up my ability to sale, because I was a Dog Groomer, my job was based in commissions. The more I sale the more I earn. It kept me motivated and energize to work in a fast pace environment! I would groom while making an appointment at the same time, we had call backs to make for any pet owner that missed or had been too long since they came in, as well as tend to the kennels (i.e. clean inside and out of kennel and make sure the pups had water) and bathed, dried and clipped dogs hair in a breed clip or just creative ways like mohawks!"
good,"This job is a lot of fun sometimes; I love seeing all the animals every day and getting to play with them.  But we don't get very good compensation and raises are insulting (10 cents a year).  The hardest part of my job is being there at 4 or 5 in the morning to clean animal cages, but so long as they don't do that to me often, it's not so bad.  My co-workers are mostly pretty awesome people and we can always connect about our love for animals and share knowledge about different kinds of pets."
good,The Superintendent was a great boss as well as a mentor.  The work was hard but worth it.
good,"This location of Petsmart had great managers, vet, training, and grooming programs."
good,Great place to work for students. Shift manager is very flexible with hours in consideration of school and personal life activities. The customers are great as well as my associate peers. The workplace has helped provide experience in all areas of the store along with pointers for future occupations.
good,"Come to work clock in go to the grooming salon area , check n pet parents which are customers who own pets ,answer phones and set up appointments for other customers who want to bring in there pets , start on my dogs that are already in there for me if there are any in there if not help other associates in the grooming salon clean dog kennels if need be make sure shampoo for the dogs are connected to the shampoo machine correct if empty connect new shampoo products , bathed dogs, force dry dogs,  clean ears, brush teeth ,trim nails grind nail,if pet parents wants that for there dog ,shaved down coat give the style that pet parents ask for ,call when dos is finished and fill out dog progress report telling all treatments that the dogs received and how they reacted to the treatments that were given to them in the progress reports"
good,I got to work and take care of different animals. I was able to get promoted to Stock manager before i went to the Army.
good,"Once i arrive at work I usually will begin to unload the truck of supplies around 2:30a.m, I unload everything off of the truck then stock the items that need replaced. I also will lift pallets up to the shelves or down from the shelves as necessary. Once we finish unloading the truck I put away any other items that are already in the store that may need restocked from previous trucks as well. At the end of my day I go around the store and organize any items that may be out of place then finish by taking out all of the trash. I have learned many important skills such as how to properly stock and rotate items, how to apply helpful customer service skills, how to use a forklift, and how to manage my time appropriately. My co-workers are helpful and friendly however there are only a couple that could work on time management skills. The hardest part of the job is when the truck arrives late and we have to hurry to get everything put away before customers arrive. The most enjoyable part of the day is restocking dog food and cat liter because it goes quickly and I've memorized where all of the brands are already."
good,"A typical day at work includes ensuring that all animals are taken care of due to the proper procedures and policies. I learned that knowledge is vital to ensure everything is done right concerning the care of pets and to execute customer satisfaction. Management was normally very good, as I was a fellow manager typically petsmart is a good judgement company and we always were able to work together including all co-workers below us. Hardest part of the job was executing customer satisfaction 100%.. because you're always gonna have those few unhappy souls but it was all worth it because I was able to teach a lot of people concerning animals and pets and just being able to take care of animals all day was pretty rewarding."
good,Customer service focus. They always do what is right for the customer.
good,"My last job was a friendly place to work. They was always willing to help new employees how to do their jobs and give positive criticism if they made mistakes. The management helped me a lot when I became a presentation manager, they showed me what they need how to maintain the store visual reputation and how to make it better."
good,"A typical day at work for me includes medicating sick animals, feeding and watering animals, preforming daily tasks (bedding changes, tank scrubbing, fish system maintenance). Also, interacting with Pet Parents, using detective skills to figure out something wrong. Stocking duties (assuring product remains on the shelf at all times), Training new associates, Cashiering duties. The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult Pet Parents, however, I make sure to go above and beyond for each and every one to make sure they all have a pleasurable experience."
good,the co-workers that i worked with were awesome and kept it an upbeat and fun place to work
good,"Took care of small animals.  Caught the fish people wanted to buy out of the many aquariums.  Dealt with customers and answered many questions about pet care and recommended items their pets needed.  "
good," friendly environment, great co-workers, stock shelves daily, unload delivery trucks, assist customers, work with product representatives"
good,I love working with the dogs and their owners.  There is never a dull moment when working with animals.
good,"Everyday was a day to be dedicated to the job."
good,"I have learned more than I ever imagined working here. Just about everything there is to know about fish, reptiles, birds, small animals, cats, and dogs. There is a lot of work to be done all the the time but it keeps the days going by fast. Always nice to see a wide variety of pets come in everyday all day. Most managers are very great at showing their appreciation for hard work. Most enjoyable part is getting to work with these sweet adorable pets. Hardest part would have to be having to deal with some pet parents who discriminate on specific types of pets. "
good,Through Petsmart I learned how to help people with their pets. The management was not very people friendly.
good,Overseeing that staff was knowledgeable on how to care for our animal needs as well working as a team to make it a fun and passionate job. Upper management was its down fall.
good,Learned new software systems. Company has excellent opportunity for growth.
good,"Love working with the people and the pets. have learned the fundamentals of dog grooming and have worked and studied to go beyond what is expected. Never thought I would find more enjoyable work that pet grooming. It is a team effort in our salon and everyone works well together to achieve that. The hardest part of the day for me doesnt happen often but when you have an ungroomable dog due to aggression or illness, sending them home is the hardest thing."
good,Good place to work friendly staff and pet owners days are long.
good,On an average work day I do multiple job functions. I learn to be versitile in my job functions.I interaction with managment is limited. Teamwork is great. The hardest part of the job is replenishing bird seeds and the most enjoyable part of the job is solving system or procedures problems.
good,I learned that there are not as many team players in the work force as I have hoped. Management was understanding of the employees needs and did go the extra mile to insure the employee was taken care of. They hardest part of the job was getting used to the physical demands at first. But it only took a couple weeks for the body to adjust.
good,"PetSmart is a good job for people that are interested and knowlegdable about pets. Before the store opens, your time will be devoted to the care and cleaning of the animals. During open hours, you will be assisting pet parents with questions related to animals and their needs. You will also be get out and securing animals for transport to their new homes. Once the store closes, you duties will entail addition care, feeding and cleaning of animals and making sure the store is back in order for the next day."
good,A typical day at work;
good,"Like every other job, Petsmart has its ups and downs. The one I work at in particular is very customer oriented. Always making sure that the pet parents are happy and completely satisfied with everything is vital to managers and associates. It can be stressful at times because there are so many things that need to get done throughout the day. However, seeing happy pets and working with a good group of co-workers make it a little better. Theyre good about working around your schedule too, but do not provide enough hours for the week."
good,"A day of work involves a lot of customer service. In-between that is chatting with the other employees and playing with the animals. I have learned so much about animal care as well as how to communicate with people, even the not-so-nice ones. My managers for the most part were nice, although sometimes a little overbearing. My co-workers were awesome, there wasn't anyone I really disliked we all got along great. I think the hardest part of the job was probably dealing with customers who refused to listen or were not pleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job was teaching people about animals and helping them out with their pets."
good,Great place to work. Excellent team. Strong management leaders. Hard work but enjoyable work. Cleaning pet habitats very demanding physically. Interaction with pets very rewarding. Helping people understand how to care for their pets was a very good feeling.
good,Helped customers find solutions for their pets or help them get associated with a new pet to get ready to go to their forever home. I learned how to deal with all types of customers and problems to come up with the best solutions. I love animals and helping people understand their needs.
good,Hardest Part of Job:
good,"Petsmart has helped me evolve my customer service skills. A typical day at work included greeting and thanking each customer; working on the register, answering multiple phone lines etc... It was a very busy job but also very rewarding and highly energized. My co-workers and managers made the day go by much faster with their continous positive attitudes and joyful ways. The thoughest part of my job included the morning shifts when i was required to work the new trucks each friday and had to go in at 3:00am. Overall, for a stable job it was a very fun experience and very knowledgeable both personally and professionally."
good,"Clock in,get duties for the day,stock shelves ( dog or cat mercahndise),clean fish tanks."
good,"merchandising, customer sevice, management duties. My day always went by quickly because i enjoyed my surroundings while i was at work."
good,High speed job that is always 100 miles an hour but a great place to work to do something most people don't get a chance to do.
good,A typical day at work i organized storage room and maintained floor presentation for easy finds for the customer. I learned how to effectively handle different pets and organize at a pretty fast pace.
good,Great place to work and great benefits. To many hours and is taking away from my family time.
good,If you love animals this is a great job for you. Working in the Pet Hotel area was a great experience interacting with pets and letting pet parents know their pet is in a safe and fun environment.
good,It's a nice fall back so make sure if you plan on leaving to keep management in the loop. My location is very busy and demanding but your managers are willing to work with you if you're honest and upfront with them.
good,When you walk in to the place feels like family right off the bat. Employees and manger are really sweet and welcoming. Helping customer with what there looking for or even if there and looking around engage with the pet parent and there pet. Fast and quick check out too. There flexibility with schedule or if your in school. The only negative thing I could say is that they don’t hire full time employees it’s always part time sadly.
good,Good place to work. I learned so much and still am every day. I enjoy working with the animals and meeting new ones every day. It can be hard but its worth it
good,Great people. Awesome work place. Zero complaints from me. I loved everything about this job from the people to the hours. I worked 3rd shift & my whole crew was awesome!
good,"I’ve had good experiences here, the hotel is my passion. They wanted me to learn the floor. It’s not something that would make me happy in my job. Overall it’s been a great experience here."
good,The job is very productive and very rewarding. It is important to work with others and learn how to multitask during your shift. There is always something new to learn at every shift so everybody has to come in with an open mind.
good,"The management was very helpful and quick to promote the people they feel are qualified.  They were very professional.  Truly cared about the safety and wellbeing of all pets that came through the door.  Also, very customer service oriented."
good,The employees at PetSmart love animals and are kind people. My time volunteering there was pleasant. Everyone I worked with was helpful and knowledgable.
good,"My time at PetSmart was cut short due to a disgruntled manager. Overall it is not a bad place to work. There are benifits, and oportunity to make money as a Pet groomer."
good,If you like animals its a great place to be. Lots of like minded people and there is room to grow within the company. Meeting the Pet Parents and interacting with there pets was great.
good,You are constantly challenged to be better at what you do.  Each day provides unique opportunities to serve Pet Parents solutions while building a trusted relationship.
good,"I started working during my senior year of high school, and It was great, the customers and co-workers were very friendly, the only problem that I had was I barely got more then 16 hours a week even during the summer, but you do get paid weekly"
good,"My time at PetSmart was honestly pretty awesome, I was really happy the only issues I had were through the grooming Academy tests, I felt as if I was treated unfairly, another associate passed yet they broke a bigger safety rule than I did, I understand safety is a big priority but it felt unfair"
good,"As a store manager, I love it. But there was no chance to get promoted any higher. The company would hire someone from outside the company most of the time."
good,"Love working with dogs. I have built a foundation of request dogs that come in to see me. Connecting with owners has been amazing because while you're working and making sure their dogs look their best. You get the satisfaction of the owners faces when they see their dogs and a huge smile forms. That's what I love about the job the most, is making people happy."
good,The people there are friendly; it's very diverse and working with dogs for a job is an awesome experience. I recommend it to anyone who likes dogs. It's a good work environment.
good,Great place to learn about and work with animals.  They will teach you everything you want to learn.  Helping customers with their pets was an extremely rewarding experience.
good,A good company that truly pushes you to be the best. The company is always looking for talent that can help them continue being the best pet retailer. Good pay. Good work life balance. The job / career is what you make it.
good,Anything other than leadership is constant fun with pets and customer interactions. In Store Events are a blast and the company does a good job of recognizing their associates.
good,"I used to like dogs until I started working here. Now, for the most part, I dislike both them and dog owners. There's just something off about people who will be bitten and pooped on and so stressed out working with a pet to the point of tears... only for an hour later to be kissing all up in the pets faces and going ""I still love you though!"". I don't get that. Even some customers SEE their dogs practically trying to murder us and they have the nerve to laugh or get upset when we end up declining the service. I'm bleeding in three different places and you're threatening to call corporate on me because I don't love your dog enough to continue the service? What? I got a report about me a while ago from a customer claiming I shouldn't work there because I wasn't kissing on his dog like other groomers were kissing on other dogs while I was giving his a nail trim. I don't love anything or anyone just because I interact with it. I don't kiss on anything unless I WANT TO. At least I learned how to stick up for myself working here, so I will definitely thank this place for that much."
good,Days are often very busy with lots to do. Can be fast-paced if you know what you are doing. Lot of merchandise to have knowledge on for customers who may have specific questions for their pets.
good,I love working as an Associate. The work atmosphere is friendly and fair. Only being offered PT no FT positions unless management is financially hard.
good,I really enjoyed working for PetSmart. They were very understanding during family emergencies and necessities. However the pay was just not enough to compensate for childcare.
good,"I love my particular location.  I work in the pet care department and have been there for 15 years.  I love educating people about animals and helping find the right pet for them."
good,I come in and the the pallets are already there from the day before then I work them out based on what will go out fastest and it is very busy work not much time to not work.
good,The staff is good and the benefits are good. the culture is good. I love working as a team in my department. I help when he fish come in from the airport at times and I also help in shipping the fish when we are through picking them.
good,Great entry level job and a fun place to go everyday.  People are kind and welcoming. Offered great training and opportunities to change positions. Pet friendly place.
good,Training was thorough and staff is very welcoming. management was understanding and trained all staff to their highest potential. the room for growth was clear and offered opportunity.
good,They teach you basic retail skills and more. They great when i comes to scheduling they are very understanding that you have a life outside of work and that many of their employees go to school as well.
good,"Cross trained for cashier, stocker and dog bather but wasn’t properly cross trained in order. New employees were hired with a pay grade higher than my pay and other employees pay, also cross trained faster than I was. Somewhat favoritism in the work place. Enjoyed being around all the animals. Somewhat competitive for sales and email capture that would affect work schedules as well (favoritisms)"
good,"The work itself can be challenging, but it is very informative. I have picked up new and dynamic skills in pet care and customer service. The culture itself is refreshing, new and exciting."
good,"Just as with most businesses, hard work, dedication, and integrity are rewarded. Do your job as prescribed and be consistent, and you will do very well with this company."
good,They were a great set of people to work with. The animals there were fun. Petsmart is a great job to work at if you looking for something easy and flexible.
good,"I started with a less than awesome boss, but he promoted me twice and gave me compensation that was more than fair. I have a new boss now, and he's the best. Awesome coworkers!"
good,"Petsmart is a very good company , lacks advancement in technology .would definate recommend people to work here .love working in here and the people are great! and you can bring you pets to work!"
good,Petsmart is pretty good. Only downfall was lack of communication with the salon manager. Other than this it's a decent pace to start if you're looking on working with animals as a future career path.
good,"I love my coworkers and I do love Petsmart, they offer flexible hours and have transferred my job when I even moved states! I'm a bather and the hardest part of the job is the stress. Dealing with sometimes horrible owners who just want free things or scared dogs that really test your patience. It can be hard to balance with life mostly because I always come out of work exhausted and wet/dirty. The tipping at my store is great so I do get paid very well and it's a rewarding job at the end of the day to work with animals we all have a STRONG compassion for them to work this job!"
good,If you are an animal lover petsmart always has adoption weekends where the store is full of dogs I believe one weekend a month. During my time there I've learned a lot about animals and for that I'm forever grateful.
good,It heavily depends on management how well the store is run and the culture of the store. Benefits are great. I'm happy working with Petsmart although I don't see it as a long term place of employment for me. I work as a bather and it's hard work for minimum wage. Company never wants to give raises and if they do it's 10 cents.
good,The head manager was a very nice and understanding man and flexible to work with and for! It was all about the animals and helping someone find a pet.
good,"PetSmart was a good place to work except for my manager at the time. It was a lot of work, but rewarding seeing the happy dogs and other animals that came in."
good,Working at Petsmart was a very fun and satisfying job. You get to be around a lot of different animals which makes the job much more fun. The management and coworkers are very upbeat and nice to be around.
good,"This was my first job and other than the fact that the store manager intimidated me I liked it. Of course I made a lot of mistakes since this was my first job but for the most part management was patient and understanding. The hours weren't good but I was just part time and hoped to become full time at some point. I would have stayed with this company but I was moving to Wisconsin with my family. I was told by my Texas manager that a transfer had been set up, but when I got to Wisconsin I was told by that store manager that there was no transfer and he had no openings for me."
good,I love this job but was not given enough hours. I need more hours and they were not able to give the hours. they had lots of employees so hours were limited.
good,Petsmart gave me the opportunity to expand my career by not only managing people but now pets.  It was a great job and there are times I regret leaving due to relocation.
good,This job is perfect for a student working part time as the hours are really flexible and your managers are understanding of a healthy school/work life. Also extremely low stress and easy. Honestly retail is a hard job to work but working with the pets and their owners is a major perk to this job. Literally the easiest retail job you can work. Only down side is rude customers. Which is in every job you'll ever work.
good,I didn’t like the park of cleaning up all the animals cages alone when there other people capable of helping or doing it when it wasn’t my role at the workplace. I would have to guess on things because I wouldn’t have a lot of help there.
good,"awesome co workers, decent hours. flexible hours, working with dogs is a plus! Have to love animals and not be allergic. Builds your character. Fast paced environment"
good,"I feel like the managers have your back at all times, while still maintaining professionalism and the need for the store to run smoothly."
good,"It can be hard work and a bit stressful, especially for those not prepared for working with animals. Most people think it's fun and games, playing with dogs/cats all day, but you need to be vigilant to ensure no harm comes to the animals or yourself."
good,"A typical day at work included speaking with customers and what they wanted done for their dog while they were in the salon. For my position, that normally was a regular bath coinciding with nail trims, nail grindings, or both. I also was responsible with scheduling appointments for both bathing and haircuts for dogs. Throughout my time with Petsmart, we had many different managers come and go, but a vast majority of them were all strong leaders. Even though the main job was bathing dogs, I gained a great amount of experience in customer service, whether it was scheduling an appointment or inquiring if the dog was medically fit to be taken in for grooming. The most difficult part of the job would be working with some uncooperative dogs. The best part of the job was having request customers that really respected what you did for their dogs for they were a welcomed sight when the days become more stressful due to workload."
good,"This job is fun and exiting. I usually do regular cashier stuff but after closing, i get to do much more. I can sometimes feed the animals and play with them and do my regular duties, like stocking, returns and a little bit of cleaning."
good,"Most of management is very kind, as well as the co workers. Many employees work here for years without advancement in title or pay, unfortunately. It’s a nice job for someone that needs flexible hours."
good,"Really fun part time job if you love animals & don't mind cleaning up after them or the kennels. Small and large dogs. Hardest part of the job would be cleaning the kennels. Best part, playing with puppies all day!"
good,It was fun working with the animals and it was nice to see a lot of customers during adoption events. You get to learn about the animals and care for them.
good,PetSmart has offered me a great opportunity to improve my skills and work ethics. I have grown significantly in the short time I have been here. I have gotten coaching from my upper management on how to better myself as a manager.
good,Typical customer service/retail environment. Learned quite a bit about animals during my time. Learn as you go with the animals. Can always research on the job or be honest if you are unsure.
good,"I loved knowing that when people came in with questions about products and services, that it really meant I was helping pets have/live better, healthier lives."
good,Its a really relaxed work enviroment and the other groomers are awesome but you are constantly moving and working since you'll always have scheduled dogs and walk ins which can be stressful but since the dogs are nice and my coworkers are awesome i love it
good,"Come in when scheduled, about 10 to 5 mins early so you can check-in the dogs the has an appointment with you. Try to get all the dogs you have done as fast as safely possible including answering the phone and taking any walk-ins. Clean and makes calls in any free time you have. Deep cleaning every night if closing, the last hour you will be alone."
good,It was a fun experience. Customers are annoying but that is just retail. The hours can be early and the pay is average. I enjoyed my time though and it was a fair experience.
good,"My typical day would be to look over the store then to take the mop broom to clean up and dirt and pet hair off the floor prior to mopping or using the scrubber. After the floor was done, then i would clean the bathrooms, change out toilet paper and paper towels and mop the floors then I would proceed to clean the break room and mop the floor. I emptied all trash cans in the store and pur new trash bags in the trash cans and then took all the trash outside to the dumpster."
good,"Working at  Petsmart was the best but low pay and a few hours isn't worth it. I had to apply for a second job, but Petsmart is nice job and very straight forwarded unless they threw you into petcare (like they did with me) without training you first or giving you a higher pay."
good,Petsmart was a great place to work for. It's a fast place setting and there is always something to learn. You get to love in pets all day and work hard.
good,Great place with great chances of promotion within. Owners of the company have changed hands so i worked in a different time for petsmart. I can only imagine what it is like now.
good,PetSmart is a great place to work with animals and to meet people who love animals as well. If you wish to work on servicing pets it is a great place to help establish yourself.
good,This experience was fun and beneficial because it allowed me to play with animals while taking care of them. It also gave me experience in animal care.
good,"Fun, clean please to work with nice team members. Quality animals and products. Grooming, adoptions and veterinarian services also offered. Large selection with competitive pricing."
good,"The work is hard but simple. Stock the shelves, clean the backroom, unload the truck. It's exhausting sometimes but if you like physical activity it's great."
good,Great company to work for if you love animals. Its fast paced but lots of fun. You are always busy weather its with customers or tasks. Staff and managers are awesome. And you get a discount.
good,Very fun workplace. Very competitive with selling products. Great experience with working with the Groomers and Bathers. Good job at learning different products for different types of animals
good,"We have the opportunity to greet every pet and help their pet partners get the right solutions for all their pets needs.  Lots of time to educate pet Parents and get to know the pets.  Offer great products.  Our discount is second to none. 50% off proprietary brand dog and cat food every day, plus a free 6 week training course for our own dog. "
good,"I think PetSmart is a great place to work if you are between jobs, need a second job or in school.  If you're wanting to promote within the company, just let them know during the interview process and again at least 2 months later."
good,"Great team in the salon and hotel very good at keeping up with walk in services and willing to lend a hand to other associates in need. Very busy during peak times and season. Customers could be very rude due to area, but was overall great. Sad to leave."
good,"Animals are my passion, so working in PetSmart just made sense to me. I worked in the PetsHotel, which was incredibly rewarding. I enjoyed conducting play times the most."
good,"The best part of working with the pets is that you can see how happy someone is when you help them find the right ""pet"" for their lifestyle. The worst part is getting those people that don't care about your advice and just want to stick the goldfish in a bowl until it dies.  "
good,"I came into Pet Smart as a full-time associate. After 2 years, I was promoted to Warehouse/Stocking Manager and I greatly enjoyed this position. It was an excellent experience and allowed me to obtain many skills (customer service, forklift operation, merchandising, conducting monthly inventory) that have proven useful in my other endeavors."
good,I truly enjoyed working with the animals everyday. Customers were great. Had excellent benefits like heath insurance and paid vacations. Great place to work if you love animals.
good,"Check and maintain electric pallet for use. Pick and stack items on pallet, wrap and store pallet to be shipped. I learned how to use an electric pallet jack. The hardest part of the day was trying not to get hit by others riding around on their pallet jacks and forklift"
good,"fast paced but also relaxed atmosphere, friendly employees had lunch brought in when we meet qouta and bonus's for meeting quota. as long as you worked they didnt say anything about jokin around some"
good,"Great place to work for college students or older candidates. Not career oriented unless in management, but great chance to advance to that also."
good,I enjoyed working there it was a nice place to work working there I worked mon thru Friday and I enjoyed that a lot.  I was in good company working there.
good,Greats environment to work in fun relaxed and easy going hardest part of the job was no receptionist on busy days or running out of supplies otherwise great company
good,It was fast paced and highly competitve. The company was good and the vacation time they give you was nice. It didnt take long to build up and nice amount of vacation time.
good,It was a very fast paced job that had plenty of customer service experience. Training was very good and the hours were flexible. I had plenty of help while working there and loved the animals.
good,If you love pets and are patient this is the place for you. It is very rewarding seeing a pet happy and healthy. Especially when they come in happy to see you.
good,This place was awesome! I really miss it here work was fast pace but fun because of all the animals! the management was great and the company really cares about its employees! great place for anyone looking for a part-time job!
good,It was a blast working there the people are great and work experience is worth it if you want to get into customer service jobs. Always ask question if you can.
good,"work was good I like working with a deadline at hand makes me work hard. the atmosphere needs improvement but professional etiquette was outstanding"
good,"it is a great place to work. the benefits are awesome, and most of the time management is on top of things properly. I will say some on the rules should be modified and properly done."
good,"I work in a salon with people who are like family. There is always someone willing to help if you have a difficult dog. Some pet parents can be hard to deal with, but there are some that are wonderful and truly appreciate you."
good,"I learned a lot about working and handling animals at Petsmart. I cared for them by preparing meals, walking dogs, cleaning rooms, bathing dogs, doing nail trims, and working with pet parents to ensure we cared for pets properly. We work as a team and learn from one another. We get extremely busy during the holiday season and summers."
good,"It was a full day, I was always alone in pet care. It sucks because it is a lot of work for one person, having at least two people on the job works so much better."
good,"A typical day at petsmart starts off slow,a few customers here and there. Stocking happens during any down time we get. The afternoon is usually the busiest. Before closing you make an announcement about how long till the store closes. We cash out our last customers locked the doors behind them shut our systems down. We then would put any returns we had where they belonged and then straightened the store up to expectations."
good,"PetSmart is really great for those who are in college. The only con that I would say is that the wage is the bare minimum and not a living wage. Depending on your management, you will get the schedule you ask for. Due to school, I requested to only work the weekends and will fill in during the weekdays if needed, and that's exactly what they gave me which is nice."
good,"This job was the most fun job i have ever had. "
good,"Working as a stock associate at PetSmart was a great first job. I learned a lot and improved in many ways. Attention to detail was very important as I had to make sure products were stocked correctly, neatly, and before the store opened."
good,PetSmart is good about letting their employees move from department to department to find their own niche. Efficiency could be better at PetSmart but I believe that starts from above just the store's influence.
good,"PETSMART is like most other large companies in that the work is only as much fun as you put into it. If you like your co-workers, the work is pretty fun. Most of my managers were like-able and understood what it was like to be in a Stock Associate's shoes, and would regularly work with us on tasks instead of ""ordering us around""."
good,"I got the job I applied for. Management really cared about the people and pets we serviced on a daily basis. I would definitely refer recent highschool grads or college students to this job,"
good,Petsmart is super fun! You get to see animals all day long and they are very flexible with your hours! Everyone is very professional and they all love their jobs.
good,"If you like animals, this is aa good place to work. This is a job and not a career. Typical retail environment. A very good place to gain experience about all animals."
good,"Dogs, super cool grooming manager, can advance from bather to groomer, the busier it is the better, occasional tips, reasonable pay, organized workplace"
good,i 10/10 would work at petsmart again. co workers were cool and managers were laid back. it was kinda understaffed there was more customers than we could handle at times
good,"I loved this job! I'm a huge animal lover so this was the perfect job for me as there was always an abundance of dogs, cats, etc. Most of the coworkeres were friendly."
good,"At its core petsmart function like a typical retail store. There are sales figures that need met, percentages in sales vs. traffic. All that you would expect. The difference is that it is pet oriented so you spend a lot of time being around all types of animals, particularly dogs. If you are a cashier its pretty straightforward, just provide the best customer service and ring people up as well as doing some stocking or cleaning around your area, depending on how the Merchandise Leader runs the stocking."
good,"Wasnt a bad place to work. Everyone was nice, and my manager was thoughtful. Typical day was fast paced but not overbearing. the bonuses are worth working hard and hitting 100%"
good,"A great place to work if you love animals, i learned more about pets, and how to watch for emergency pet behavior, you also clean and make sure all pets are taken care of with food, water and clean rooms at all time."
good,"offers decent pay in a fun but hard working work environment, lots of work advancement opportunities, management communicates well and clearly so you know exactly what you need to be doing and given the tools to do it"
good,You stay busy while working here. Customers are mostly friendly. The animals are so adorable. I learned a lot working here. Associates work together as a team.
good,"fun times and great managers.always smiles on everyones face..........always had breaks and great work life balance. alwasy meeting new people, new dogs."
good,"In all my years it's hard to give an overall review. It honestly depends on the store leader. I've seen a lot come and go. Basically, if the store manager sucks the job will suck. If the store manager is dedicated, and cares it's a wonderful place to work. The only overall negative thing is the lack of job security with the retail apocalypse. Watching other retailers next to you shut down, and seeing sales drop, wondering how long it will be before it spreads. to your store."
good,My first two stores were fantastic! My last store was great until we got a new manager who played favorites. She was let go shortly after I left due to this. I feel that the company as a whole has great values and does right by the employees.
good,The staff was fantastic in helping me learn and grow in the position I was in. There was always room to make friends there and it was great to help all the customers who came in.
good,"Customer care I loved seeing the animals. I learned my best experience at Petsmart I was taught by great managers on balancing my drawer, counting money phones etc."
good,Good place to work. I am a groomer so it is 50% commission. The Policies are sometimes annoying but they are there to protect you and the pets. They are not a bad company and do a lot to help pet adoptions nation wide.
good,"All the managers knew what was going on with the store and capable of clearing up issues. Good team environment, communication was a huge part in working here and everyone got along. Closing and opening are the best shifts to work, they allow the most time for employees to mingle and create a good environment."
good,Fast paced work environment. Worked 4-10 hour shifts and had Friday Saturday and Sunday off. Had a sale 2 times a year where you could buy discounted products really cheap.
good,Pet smart was a very good company to work for. They give you many opportunities to learn many different things They also have a great management system. They also have many great charities  and help adopt pet pets.i Think this is a good company to work for all around.
good,I have learned a lot about animals at my current job at Petsmart. I enjoy my coworkers and some of the customers I have been able to help and meet on a daily basis. Its quick with getting to every customer and grabbing products for people. Also when stocking it is very fast and efficient pace to move things quick but also keep things organized.
good,"The GM is a nice guy-tough but nice! Assistant mgr is annoying lol"
good,I loved the job was fasted apce only down fall when I went on medical leave for a hernia they let me go upon returning to work adnt old me to reapply after 6 months
good,The managers and other co-workers would help the newer hire on to help them do a better job in the field. Managers knew what they were doing and would help when a situation arise.
good,It was a good work environment with competitive pay. It does tend to get stressful sometimes working in the grooming salon and can be challenging to work with misbehaved dogs.
good,It was fun to be given the chance to take care of animals and teaches you a lot of responsibility. I really enjoyed the working environment and the discount was helpful since I have pets of my own.
good,"Very fun place to work, relaxed, and you get to know your coworkers well. There is some difficulties to the job, same with any other, but the competitiveness is fun and exciting."
good,Put pressure on everybody to sell training classes..merchandise was to be worked fast. .Working with the animals was fun and stressful when they became sick.
good,I learned a lot about animal care and nutrition while working there. The team was always friendly and kind. It was a pleasant work environment and I loved it.
good,"One of my most favorite jobs. Loved being around all the different animals and getting a chance to learn about different care techniques and needs for all the species. "
good,"Worked there for 8 years. I saw a lot of improvements and a lot of set backs."
good,Great and clean place. Staff is very friendly. I would fully recommend this as a good summer job or a great starting out job. you can work your way up very easily.
good,If you love working with people and animals of any kind it is a very rewarding job. You get to help both people and animals and it makes you feel like an overall better person. Although can be very stressful.
good,Would recommend to those who just turned 18 (for non-management positions) or those any age looking into management.  The location I worked at was only busy weekends (had 2 cashiers going all day) and got a little busy during the weekdays when people got off work (had 2 cashiers working on and off).  It's a really great job for those who love animals (mostly dogs & fish) or those who want a laid back job.
good,working at Petsmart was fun getting to see all kinds of animals was great. unless you plan to work there all your life it's a job for a college student or a teen looking for some extra cash not really a career.
good,"Pet Smart offered a great experience, in that I was provided with a fantastic two week training period, the guidance of previous professionals, and continuous on the job training."
good,"It's a good job. Hours are fine, and the enviroment is great. I worked in petcare, so my day was spent cleaning aquariums, and helping customer get the suppiles and correct information about their pets."
good,Stocked inventory and ran thecregister. For me the register was difficult with face to face customer interactions.  My coworkers were great and the managers were very helpful & nice.
good,"Cashier was easy and hard depending on the time of day or year (holidays). Learning the basics was easy once you do it enough. Managers were great and helpful, hard to get full time or get pay increase."
good,"Awesome place to work, but you must put in enough time as a part time employee before full time is available. Pet smart also does not pay very much even as a salary manager. But extremely relaxed and friendly environment."
good,"fast paced work environment with good training and leadership"
good,"As a bather, you can possibly get pulled from your job to do quick services. This can be difficult, especially if you are behind. The dogs were the best part but not every dog is the same. The people working there were wonderful. The stress and unpredictability of each dog can be a little trying but otherwise it's a great job. The end goal is to be a groomer."
good,"PetSmart was a challenging company to work for because the pressure of selling pet training classes sometimes overshadowed your customer service scores and sales.  Overall, when you had solid plans in place and had all of your associates bought in on this purpose then it went smooth."
good,"getting computers booted and kennels ready for dogs being brought in, starting first baths or answering phones, interweaving nail trims and grinds between baths and taking more appointments. cleaning at the end of the day. hardest part is managing the heavy influx of clips/grinds sometimes and the most enjoyable is seeing an animal nice and clean after. workplace and management generally lax but sometimes they push for more when you know an animal is too stressed."
good,"spent 8.5 years with them, upper managment support sometimes unorganized and infrequent . the chance to move up from store level is non existent , did love the teams at store level"
good,PetSmart is a very good place to work. But if you are looking for something with steady hours it's not the best option. This is a really good job if your looking for part time but of you need full time some PetSmarts lack the overall hours to give you full time. And there's not much chance of  being promoted.
good,Fun place to work with a good team. Great management team willing to work along side you. Enjoyed the variety of animals and people that came in on a daily basis.
good,"Monitored security issues and kept shrinkage low."
good,This was a fun job. I love animals so it was nice to work with them every day. It was fulfilling to help people learn the correct way to care for their animals.
good,"my typical day at work was good, I would clock in and start my cashier, working at pet smart was a good place and I have learned allot more about customer service , My manager was very nice and vey easy to talk to, pet smart was a very clean place for customers and pets. there was nothing hard about working at pet smart, i am very easy going person  and My patients with work is awesome . the best part of pet smart was working with the customers and seeing different personality's and all kinds of pets come in ."
good,I’d recommend anybody to work here as long as you’re willing to work fast and accurately. Otherwise you’ll never make it. It’s a very fun job and all of you coworkers are nice and helpful when needed
good,"Management didn’t seem to understand the difference job requirements for our position on a day-to-day basis,  supplies were always out and on the back order,  many safety concerns for pet and employee safety."
good,"The job required a lot of learning, from processes, to caring for customers and pets. It is an amazing company to work for. there is an absolute amount of growth opportunities to grow with the company and the sky is the limit with hard work. It really pays well if you show great ethic and determination. Management teams are absolutely fun to work with. they show recognition for the good work fulfilled. I have learned to be able to point out my strengths and weaknesses so I can be able to fix whats holding me down with all of the support from their teams. Teamwork skills are something I have bettered after just the first month. They set a friendly environment that makes it comfortable. One of the hardest parts of the job is having to break out of a bubble, they make it easy, but teamwork is a big emphasis in this company and the job really pushes you to get comfortable doing so. But the great thing is you get to hang out with animals everyday. From dogs being brought in, the regulars who play in the day camps, seeing dogs constantly getting groomed and coming back with crazy coats. Even in the selling side of it all, theres adoptions, where you get to work with shelter teams and help get pets into a forever home, or caring for the reptiles and little furry animals, its a pleasure to be able to come to work and be surrounded with creatures. The company really shows care in their employees, and it shows when you get into the store with an instant feeling of excitement."
good,I've been there for 13 years now. It's like another set of family.  I do think we should be paid better and there should be more advancements for people.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at PetSmart.  I worked in animal care and cleaned, fed, and cared for all the small pets they sold.  The procedures in place for the animals' safety were good and (at least where I worked) everyone followed them."
good,Good experiences with management and Team. Management is Supportive and flexible. Team works well with each other and helps when asked. Everyone seems to enjoy their job
good,"Enjoyed working at PetSmart, however I worked a shift that had me working 2-9am and it became too much. Job was great. People I worked with were polite and friendly."
good,My team at PetSmart felt like a family. Tight knight and supportive.  I didn't like working with cats that were up for adoption. Broke my heart. Would have worked there for years if I didn't have to move.
good,"Much different than working at a private company, much more fairness and equality in availability of work and how many animals you groom, would definitely continue to work for them"
good,cool and stuff. Love it and really enjoy who I work with. I don't understand why this is even needed. Why do I need to write a review about my current job for?
good,"I really love working for this company, I have been able to transfer to 3 different stores and my original store is always willing to take me back. The only thing I do not like is the up sales they want you to do at the register, puppy guides, training, donations, etc. It just gets to be too much at times. And when you work in the store the only full time employees are the managers, most time I average 15- 30 hours a week ( on a good week)."
good,Great to work when you get to talk with customers about their special family members. Great training program to learn nutrition and animal behaviour. Chances to travel to see trade shows
good,"Pretty efficient management, Corporate seems very greedy though and that effects the very important associate/customer relationship. Low level management is awesome, Corporate management places money over customer satisfaction."
good,Loved my job.  Would still be there if they had not relocated to Pennsylvania. Management was fair and wages were decent.  Home life and work was balanced.
good,"Maybe different locations differ, but this location in particular is not a good place if you're trying to move up in life."
good,it was fun to work with people and educate the on pet care and health of the pets. the leads and managers were always nice and understanding. the coworkers are very helpful
good,"If I could have I would have stayed at this job. The hours were long and the job was extremely hard, but the pay was worth it. I worked at night si it made it difficult to continue to work there."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working with Petsmart, I always liked the fact that I can always pet a dog or cat when I am having a horrible day.  I was promoted quickly through this company and found it to be quite competitive - which was fun for me.  I quickly saw advancement and the only reason I left the company was because I ended up dating a co-worker, and could not get a transfer for my position so I left the company."
good,Pet Smart is a great place for students to find part time work while they are in school or for someone who is looking for extra work hours. If you enjoy animals then you would enjoy this position.
good,I enjoyed working at Petsmart I was able to be around customers and help them with their needs. I was able to work and help my fellow employees. I was also able to train new employees.
good,very fun loveing job fast pace great first job i would offer every one to apply if they actually hired people cool work culture thank you have a good day
good,"My days were short and early, so the best for the wanting to relax until something else happens. Management is ok, not the best when it comes to being fair. I could not be scheduled for 5 days, and then get a note my next shift when I wasn't there for almost a week. They have too many people or arent smart about how they handle then hours to give people. I would only work truck days, and then when non-truck days are happening they would let some random cashier or someone of another department stock, messing up the neatness on the shelf or mistocking. The enviroment is friendly. If I'm lucky I get to pet an animal or two, or I just get to converse with coworkers for a short while. The hardest part of my job is not getting help for the entire side of the store I have to stock, which was all the dog food bags with weight ranging from 4-lbs-50lbs of food. On average I stocked mostly close to 0.5-1 ton of dog food. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to listen to music while I work."
good,They were very flexible with my work schedule to allow me to switch up my hours when I needed them. If I did not have to move out of the area I would have stayed employed.
good,"great place to work, friendly employees,Flexable shifts,"
good,This place is very fun but can get very busy. just be prepared to work and the company treats you right. Definitely would recommend to a friend. Can be a Fast paced environment
good,"This job is really fun if you enjoy working with and around animals. It was tough waking up early in the mornings to stock shelves, but as a cashier it was enjoyable to meet new people and interact with animals."
good,"working for petsmart was fun, fast paced and always different. there was structure, but at the same time you were always doing different things. i started in petcare and cashier duties. providing great customer service and exceptional animal care is our goal. the leaders were great and i loved my coworkers. the hardest part of the job was angry customers. just learning how to handle tuff situations. the most enjoyable part is being able to provide and care for every persons animals."
good,"PetSmart is such an odd company to work for in the sense that your experience will be completely contingent on the store you work at. Because of the sale of live animals, customers that try to argue about sales can be all the more frustrating. Many times there are customers that do not have adequate set ups (ie: fish tanks, hamster enclosures, reptile habitats) that want the animal anyway. And if you care about the animals, you generally try to refuse. If you have managers that will back you up when it comes to customer conflicts, then you won't have any grief - but if not, then your experience can be completely miserable and this is absolutely the kind of job that can send you home in tears every day. It's a great place for animal lovers to expand their knowledge of exotics, but keep in mind that there WILL be a sale of animal to an under educated customer that you won't be able to stop - and it will break your heart."
good,Made great friends here; love working with the dogs; my manager is awesome though the assistant manager can be abrasive; need to move to a higher paying job
good,"I was lucky enough to work at the Woodbury, MN PetSmart location (store 467) - and had a flexible and supportive boss. At the store level, there is a ton of respect and power given to the employees in regard to initiative and problem solving. The managers oversaw scheduling and ordering, but we had a lot of input. Especially in the grooming salon and Pet Care where the employees were considered the experts and were given control of how to meet their department's requirements - within reasonable parameters."
good,"Everyone was working great and employees got along as well as normal organization.A new store manager came in and started firing people that had been there for 5+ years, anyone having benefits."
good,"I learned a lot working at Petsmart. As someone who has only had fish for pets, I had no idea how to take care of any other type of pet. Working there for the short time that I did, I learned all the different types of pets one can have, how to take care of them including feeding, maintain health, what to do if they're sick, where to keep them, and so on. This job also taught me about what good customer service looks like. I liked this job because the managers were always nice and very helpful if their employees ever needed anything."
good,It depends what store you go to on their level of caring and knowledge. My former store was great until management changes. Lots of management through the whole company that should not be in a management position.
good,It was a great place to work at. I enjoyed the people I worked for as well as the work I did. I only worked 3 days a week which allowed plenty of time for me and my family.
good,"good workplace to learn,forklift , cherry pick ,picking , scanner hand gun .Excellent management , satisfy on my job.safety workplace.excellent team work ."
good,"Honestly, I was really sad leaving the hotel. I worked there for at least a couple years and you get back the effort that you put in. Raises are competitive so long as you're willing to put in a ton of work and show that you deserve it. My main joy in this job is by far the amazing coworkers and being able to love all the animals! There is a lot of cleaning involved and honestly cleaning up after over 100 dogs during busy seasons can be pretty gross. "
good,very fast paced job. weekend shift from 5am-5:30pm. good job and great pay. you go around on a power jack that has 2 pallets on it and you pick orders from a headset
good,"very fast pace, mutli-tasking type of job, dealing with not only grooming but customer service, walk-in service, answering phones, bathing your own dogs, scheduling future appointments."
good,"Lead Cashier. was responsible for the other cashiers and their drawer. Night bank deposit perfect every day Also filled as a dog bather."
good,it was a fun place to work at kept m busy and active and met a lot of people and loved working with animals like taking care of the cats and kittens waiting for adoption.
good,"While working at PetSmart, I learned how to balance many different jobs within my day to day job. Having such a fasted paced environment taught me how to prioritize certain tasks and delegate to my associates. Time management was the key to being successful."
good,"I was the project superintendent n 2 projects for Pet Smart, their construction team was great to work with, Both projects went very well and both came in on time"
good,"My only issue with PetSmart, is that for being there for more over 6 years; I am making JUST over min. wage."
good,Pet smart was a great place to work very fun and relaxed. You get to play and interact with the greatest dogs. And learn alot of new things. I reccomened anybody work there.
good,"Interesting job, I learned a lot about pet products especially dog and cat food.I also worked with a dog and cat rescue group who brought their animals to the store. I also worked with a dog and cat rescue group who brought their animals to the store. I was also in charge of closing the registers in the evening, closing down the grooming salon  and making sure that all the animals in the store were in clean cages and had food and water. I enjoyed working with the customers and working out any issues they had with the store or its employees. All in all it was a fun and challenging job and I would still be working there if I had not had to relocate!"
good,"Had fun working in petsmart, relaxed environment, got promoted fairly fast. Management was very nice, I loved working with the animals. stocking freight ."
good,Extremely fun and enjoyable part-time job that offers great scheduling and a very enjoyable environment if you like to work with animals. You get to learn a lot about each animal in the facility and advance quickly so long as you have the ambition and ethnicity to do so.
good,"Good, fun, down to earth people. Best managers in retail. Customers suck. 30 minute lunch breaks. Managers try working with your schedule. Typical retail with decent people."
good,"Go in 6 am clean fish tanks/certain animal cages depending on what day"
good,Was at several stores but they overall are the same.  The difference is the higher people in command they usually could care less about the individual associate even though they say different.  The company has no direction in their policies and what they want to do. Make policy one day and the next day change.
good,The work is easy and all you have to do is whatever you are asked. It is a great place to learn about pets as well as retail experience. Overall its a nice starter job or part time job.
good,"§	Safely operate Sit Down Counterbalanced forklift"
good,"not reviewing, hate that this forces you to review as I would prefer to review based on compete experience including leaving company as i work here i can not do this"
good,Payroll is my only complaint.  Not enough hours to balance tasking with customer service.  High expectations with tasking and customer service.  Customers can be picked about grooming.
good,"its a good job if you can handle the bad dogs, that bite and dont want to be groomed. if you can learn how to work around that you will enjoy working here"
good,Order picking was the task  preformed on a daily basis.. This was a very fast paste enviroment. Over 40/50 trucks to be loaded on a single shift. Timing was top priority..
good,"My current employer has been great to work with.   My typical day begins with a race track tour of the store and then a check of daily emails and directions from corporate.  Then onto the tasks at hand that are happening or need to happen that day in question.  "
good,you are given tasks and a certain amount of time to complete them. must have complete awareness of your surrounding and the product being picked. everyone has to develop a plan of attack that fits their abilities because you can fall behind.
good,"Working here I ensured that customers had everything they could need for any problem or situation they were in related to their animals. From the foods and what went in them to the care, love, and help of their furry friends... I did it all. I worked as a cashier leading customers to products as well as a stock crew lead to ensure goods were present for customers if and when they needed them. By working in all aspects of the store I was able to see to it running like a well oiled machine as well as realize the potential of many positions and skills throughout my experience. Working with customers allowed me to develop personal skills and a more empathetic approach to dealing with sticky situations. I also learned how to receive a truck, work an electric pallet jack, worked hand in hand with managers to close and open all aspects of the store.I worked many different shift lengths and experienced a work environment with peoples of a variety of backgrounds and ages. One of my most demanding challenges I experienced was the physical labor involved in working many pallet trucks with a small crews help. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see new pet adoptions and animals of all sorts and shapes."
good,"Relaxed environment yet goal oriented. Amazing management makes a worlds difference in how employee's perform at work."
good,I have a passion for animals and Pets Smart gives me the opportunity to care for and help others care for their pets. Also I work with a great time of people.
good,"the job was fast paced yet fairly simple with a great emphasis on customer service, my managers were all well trained and likable and I would have more than likely continued to work here until I moved if not for some unfortunate life events"
good,"My experience at the store for the most part was dealing in the petshotel the flooring in doggie daycare was not the great and spacing could be cramped. Did not like the fact that we could not kneel, sit, or lean on anything. Also did not like the openness of the facility where patrons could see everything and record the associates"
good,"This job is a fast paced, fun job that lets you take care of animals as well as help other people out with their pat care needs. If you love animals, this job is for you."
good,"PetSmart employees are given a large responsibility, however they are not expected to do more than they can handle. It's a dirty job but it's very rewarding!"
good,"Easy money, all you do is stand at the cash register for cashier/sales associate position. Good environment, good people, get to play with the animals, but boring."
good,"Petsmart is a fun and exciting place to work! Honestly, you never know sometimes whats going to walk through the doors!"
good,"It's a great place to work. Typical day consent of puppies and the occasional irate customer, but that kinda situation is easy to diffuse. The workplace culture is all about SELLING."
good,"It wasnt thag bad of a job just wanted to do something differnt to do.i had help customers be on cash registir. "
good,There were always ups and downs with certain employees as there are everywhere. Overall anyplace you work with animals such as this is a great experience and rejuvenating.
good,"I loved working at Petsmart. The customers, the animals, the other employees and my managers. Everyday I went to work was a blast, I love animals and helping them with anything they needed. Petsmart is a wonderful place to work."
good,"Working at PetSmart, I started as a bather in the grooming department and worked my way up to management. I enjoyed the job and the task of dealing with people and animals each day but ended up quitting due to a drastic move in location."
good,Petsmart was a great place to start out.  Decent Management and treated animals right.  Management stood behind their employees and worked well with my schedule.
good,Company is privately owned but still very much run like a corporation.  There are lots of incentives for advancement and the daily dose of puppies is nice.  Very fast paced.
good,"I really enjoyed working at PetSmart. Everyone that I worked with was really friendly and easy to work with. I wasn't too fond of some of the customers, but it happens in retail."
good,"One of the best jobs that I've ever worked. Great atmosphere and I loved being around all the animals every day. I don't recommend it, if you have a fear of rodents, reptiles (including snakes), spiders, or bugs. There is some heavy lifting, but it isn't too bad."
good,loved working with pets and there owners. fun environment to work for. great management to work under. enjoyed working with my fellow employees. fun place to work
good,Great job because i got to create my schedule. I enjoyed the pets and pet parents. Thanks to commission I was able to make some really great money. I was able to design and expand the training curriculum in order to meet the needs of the pet parents.
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work; the management is friendly, the staff is great, and the pet parents really don't cause a lot of grief or frustration. The best part is seeing all the animals and having animal lovers in the store all day."
good,Great place to work long term. if you put in the effort you can advance into management. Groomers and dog trainers make the most and are the biggest asset to the company
good,Not a bad job to have. Hard to get a full time position. Started out as a truck unload-er. I accepted the custodian position a few months in. Hardest part of the job was to make sure the entire store was spotless for when the RDO or upper management came to do walk through s. Helping customers was fun because they expect you to be a expert in animal care.
good,when i first started i was strictly stock team and was very fast paced  and early hour. then after being there for a while i moved to cashier and later did a little of both. the hardest part of the job was the demand for multi tasking being able to sell product and stock in busy hours.
good,"Lots of busy hours as a groomer, pay is well and full time work is offered. Store associates have little pay and hours are constantly cut. Recommend staying in salon."
good,"I have loved my 4+ years so far, and i have loved working with dogs, and loved meeting new friends, and meeting new people. The job can be challenging in the end sometimes but it is totally worth it!"
good,"Interact with customers to help them find the best fit for their pets. IF you love working with animals and are looking for an environment to expand your knowledge and truly build pet based relationships with customers in a mostly relaxed environment, PetSmart is a good fit."
good,"I cannot speak for every store, but at my store we wanted to do our best to make sure our animals were well taken care of for our customers. A typical shift included me bathing and doing basic grooming, such as colors and accessories. I would also do random walk-ins, usually to have some nails ground, so if I was washing a dog I would have to quickly finish or have a coworker watch my dog in the tub. Weekends could get very busy: at one point I was the only bather on shift, and I got 10 dogs to bathe in one hour! However, we had a lot of high traffic at our store due to our area."
good,"Effective leadership, company seems to do well in my area. I mean, hey its petsmart, it is pretty much what you would expect of a company as large as this."
good,The environment isn't bad itself. The only bad things is that everyone is in a rush in the morning to get things stocked and ready for the day that everyone is in a bad mood.
good,"Staff is friendly, encouraging and helpful. Management is willing to work with a difficult schedule to help with school and other part time jobs.                                      ."
good,"overall, this was a great place to work. some job positions are more exciting than others, but that can be found at any job. the biggest thing about this job is that you should accept a position you would really enjoy or work your way up to it."
good,Offers a very rewarding experience if you have a love for pets. Allows for you to meet customers needs for their pet care. Share your love of pets with customers.
good,"I worked at Petsmart in Sacramento as volunteer work. I specifically helped in the cat section. My duties were helping to cut the cats nails when they got too long, spend time and interact with the cats, and also to groom them occasionally."
good,"You get to interact with animals on a daily basis. In the PetCare department, you take care of the animals and habitats daily."
good,i love working at petsmart because i love animals and having the chance to work with them everyday makes me feel as if i would not care if i was paid a check because i love the job that much
good,"Great place to work, always busy day to day.  Never the same routine every day and enjoyes working the pets and customers that came into the store everyday"
good,"Things have been changing the last two and a half years.  Management titles, policy and procedures, as well as upper management. I believe the animals in their care still are of the utmost importance. But things are in flux, and during such a period it can be difficult to adjust for some. New hires will find it easier, but or at be a bit distracting for those new to the scene with the crossover."
good,Good place to work. Working with a large team in several department's to help serve pet parents and giving them the best possible service. Possible to grow in many areas of the business.
good,"It was a fun place to work, most of the management was great. Working with the animals and customers was fun. It can be stressful managing the care of the animals."
good,Loved my time with Petsmart. Great company to work for and great management. Love meeting new parents and their pets. Was great with getting time off if needed. Flexible with shifts
good,Strong structure and resources. The store support group was available any time and very dedicated. Safety and culture was the most important aspect of daily routine.
good,I loved working at Petsmart. Everyone was very nice. I made some very good friends while working at Petsmart. I loved being a bether in the salon and working with the dogs.
good,"Working here is a lot of fun, but it is also challenging. I take care of the animals we sell, and while it can be a positive experience, it can be a challenge when the animals get sick."
good,"Good place . Always makes sure u get a lunch break, time off requests r granted, they pay u good and value there employees. Company promotes from with in, Actually really does and dosent just claim to."
good,"Petsmart was a pleasure to work for. It was always a friendly environment, We had a great staff along with management who accompanied all of their employees."
good,"A typical day entailed taking care of the in house animals. Including birds, reptiles, fish, and small animals. As well as helping customers with the pets needs. I learned basic customer service skills. Management was typical retail management, either they were kind and liked you or not very kind and disliked you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the animals."
good,"Provide in store customer service, responsible for the health and safety of the pets.  Clean and interact with pets and connect with customers to provide the education needed for a lifetime of care for their pets. Responsible for keeping stock organized and on store shelves.  Execute pricing, re-organizing, and display set up.  Greet customers upon arrival and ensure they have an outstanding shopping experience."
good,Petsmart of Orchard Park is a very educational place to work that teaches responsibility in pet care as well as customer service.
good,"Everyone within the company has immense love for animals, whether they are working with them directly (i.e: PetsHotel or Grooming) or assisting with bettering an animals life (i.e: customer service, general floor labor).  Depending upon location, compensation for the work was above average but not great.  The management team assisted my growth as a leader and manager."
good,Everyday at work was different and fun. I loved working with the animals. I did not have to hard of a time doing my job and the days flew by. I would have loved it more if i actually got to work more than two days a week.
good,good overall company. steady scheduling. overtime is lovely. management for weekend nights are the best. attendance is a key. very productive job.
good,You really have to care to learn stuff other than what the training tells you other wise you wont make it up the ranks. The hardest part of the job is having to meet the labor laws for the company
good,It was a very good work environment with very friendly staff. I was always greeted with a smile before during and after my shift.
good,"I worked at two different locations, Wichita Falls and the Colony. I preferred the bigger city store, because of the energetic staff and the Doggy Day Camp."
good,"Good management, fair pay and works well with any schedule. Your day varies with whichever duty position you hold, but pet care was one of the most fulfilling positions with this employer."
good,This place had a nice atmosphere with friendly people to work with. I felt very comfortable and welcomed while I was employed with them.
good,"We've had lemurs, sphynx cats and all sorts of all exotics in between come through. Great place to be! Most customers are the friendliest people that you can come by."
good,"Management is pretty good, associates are great to work with, and the company as a whole is excellent as well. No real complaints."
good,A day at work here is everything but dull. I loved being able to work with animals first hand I gave them their baths and did everything to make them look and feel better. Working with the owners as well was a good experience.
good,"You have to be really quick and deal with a lot of different situations. I've learned a lot about retail while working here. Management is okay and co workers were the best while I was working there. Hardest part of the job was how much work there is to do in one day while balancing customers, but it was worth it to experience working with animals."
good,They had all the machinery that was needed to get floors and restrooms clean. And doors and windows cleaning to keep the store clean and trash out . I really appreciate working there the years that I was working there.
good,I was able to expand my career when I went back for my grooming lisence and was with the company for many years. I made life long friends and when I relocated to florida I was able to find a opening and transferred and had no issues.
good,"PETSMART is a good  place to work for both associate and Management. Where else can you go and shop with your dog? The hardest part of being in management is the way you are treated by the associates and upper management. Associates can make up anything they want to about managers especially after you have talked to them about there attendance ,tardiness, productivity and they call in to corporate about you and upper management will come in and fire you for saying things about them and you never said them at all. What is the reason they have managers? Just let the associates run the stores because they do anyway and  you as a manager have no way to defend yourself. With all the positive things about PETSMART  defending yourself against associates, customers, associates family, upper management makes it real hard to feel good about working here."
good,"The staff at PetSmart is great! You must be an animal lover, and everyone seems to really love their job. I left this position because of school hours, and I planned on moving out of town at the time, otherwise I would still be there. For having animals in and out, PetSmart in Mt. Pleasant, MI is very clean, and goal oriented with their sales. A very fun, happy atmosphere to work in."
good,It was a fun working environment dealing with alot of people and getting to learn alot of new things. I loved helping customers find items they needed and knowing they were satisfied with their visit.
good,"The Store Manager clearly cared about the animals, and frequently visited the Hotel, but the Hotel Manager was lazy and rarely got off his chair during my shifts. Aside from that, due to working overnight I was in my element, the job itself was one of the best ones I ever had. The day shift could be taxing, but it was an easy job and you got to spend 8 hours with a room full of dogs. If I could still work there, I would."
good,"Pretty fast paced place to work, some days there is a short period where there's not much to do. Great environment with co-workers. I enjoy working with the animals. Just wish there were more work days  given."
good,There is a good bonus you get to work around animals and help save animal lives.They also teach you a lot about animal food and how to keep them healthy.
good,Great training program for potential groomers. Plenty of hours and taught me a lot of safety guidelines necessary for the field.
good,"I helped unload product shipments and stocked the store shelves, as well as cashier when needed. Assisted customers find products as well as recommend products that were best suited for their pets."
good,"A typical day at PetSmart was extremely busy. I learned great customer service skills, management skills and time management. The management is understanding and peers treat you with respect. The hardest part of the job was adapting to constant changes within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people and pets."
good,"learned alot about warehousing/good co-workers"
good,Working with animals is always an awesome job! Who wouldn't want pooch cuddles all day long! Fast paced and busy. Be ready to be wet when you get off work!
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, and how to work as a team. The managers and employees are very kind and willing to help anyone in need. The hours a pretty flexible but you don't get more than 25.00 hours a week because they don't really hire full time. I learned how to cash out customers and work in a retail setting, this was my first real paying job and I enjoy it very much."
good,A day at petsmart was stocking and customer service. I enjoyed my supervisors and stuff all friendly and got work done. I enjoyed helping customers find what there looking for and communicating  with them.
good,Customers know your name and associates are treated as family.Its the small things like that along with work/life balance that brings a smile to your face everyday as you enter through the door!
good,I would go back to pet-smart if the opportunity presented it self. The work environment is always positive. Anyone can do the job
good,Love What I do and the advancement with the company. Have been able to make lasting friendships with each store I have worked for.
good,"A typical work day is 8.5 hours with a 30 min lunch break. The amount of safety protocols are amazing. I did not like the scheduling system, with the salon open from 7:30 to 9. The hardest part of the job will always be the physical demand that grooming takes."
good,"during the five years I worked there I have seen many highs and lows, but the highs greatly outweigh the lows. Great environment and positive costumer experiences. All employees seemed to genuinely enjoy working there and with the pets and pet owners."
good,"It was busy and very corporate. Always got lunch, staff as friendly and helpful. At times it was difficult to keep up with the work schedule but overall it was a good experience."
good,"Working at pet smart was a very good expierence, the staff was very nice they showed me the ropes fairly quickly and they made the enviroment very comfortable to be apart of."
good,"A typical day for me was working as a cashier, helping to stock shelves and collecting donations for the local SPCA.  I learned all my cashiering skills from this job and a lot of my people skills as well. My management was very organized and reliable in terms of giving me hours and my co-workers were easy to get along with. There weren't many hard parts about my job, I struggled at first with cashiering but managed to pick it up easier than I thought I would. I really enjoyed this job, if it weren't for school (I am graduated now) I would still be working there."
good,"Fast paced but well managed.  Great job and learning experience.  Your receptionist resume should include your experience using phone systems, copiers and printers. Word processing skills are a must, while familiarity with Excel, desktop publishing or industry-specific software can give you an edge. Be sure to play up these assets."
good,The job itself wasn't hard and the people there were nice. It pays very well and the up management was good to everyone and was very friendly
good,"I got to work with many dogs while working here and it was a lot of fun.  I started out training dogs and began in the grooming salon bathing dogs too.  Dog training was fun, had to find people who wanted to get their dogs trained, and sell classes to them.  I had a lot of happy customers because their dogs got trained and they received a lot of knowledge in my classes.  I liked bathing dogs, it was a easy job and fun, usually got really wet, but that's okay.  A typical day would be get in, look over my schedule to see how many classes I had and get prepared.  When I didn't have any classes, I either ran the cash register, answered phones, walked around and try to sell classes and cleaned and straitened the dog aisles."
good,The best part of the jobs is working with the dogs. the job is super flexible with hours and the coworkers are great. Ive learned so much about dog behaviors and enjoy every moment.
good,"I worked for PetSmart for several years and were generally considered some of my best. The work atmosphere is very laid back and enjoyable. At the store I worked at, the mangers did an amazing job of hiring the right people and there was very little turn over. Unfortunately the pay with only slightly above minimum wage and was very tough to move up to a higher position."
good,"Great environment"
good,"I loved working at PetSmart, it was a fantastic job and truly taught me a lot. I had the opportunity to work with dogs all day long, and while not all dogs were the friendliest I still always looked forward to going to work. I learned how to multi task at a very quick pace while maintaining the highest level of animal safety and customer satisfaction. I also learned many sales techniques as part of my job was to sell the services that I would be providing. The hardest part of my job would have been cleaning. The most enjoyable would have to be the loving dogs I had the chance to work with."
good,Petsmart is a great job to work at. It can be very stressful to work at sometimes. My Co-workers were great and upbeat! To work at petsmart you must love animals and be  passionate about animals and helping people.
good,"I really enjoyed my experience at Petsmart overall. Wish they could keep managers for longer periods of time (when switching from Manager to Manager all the time, it can make the rules and regulations and how everyone does things complicated or varied. So then when someone who HAS been working there a long time has a manager tell them something completely different than what you were taught.. can make life irritating.) "
good,"I've been working here for about 3 years as a Petcare Specialist for the PetsHotel.  I've never been interested in moving up because I am a full-time student, had a second part-time job and additional volunteer work.  I kept this job because it was very stable, and very flexible in my hours and they paid the bills.  I like my coworkers for the most part, so it was a good fit for me."
good,A fun place to work. Have to work  every major Holiday not a fan but i love the job. Wish leadership can be more understanding and work more as a team.
good,"Management is fair, and hours are very flexible. Highly recommended for a first job. Fun work environment, and guests that are usually in a happy mood."
good,"Fast paced goal driven environment. Logistics and Inventory experience. Learn to work not only with co workers, but also customers."
good,"I enjoyed working with the dogs and customers. It was a positive encouraging atmosphere. The crew were like family. I loved bathing, cleaning kennels. Just any type of interaction with dogs I enjoyed."
good,"This is retail at its best.  It is not hard to get ""unconditional love"" from your clients.  Makes all the difference when your customers appreciate you and your efforts.  Of course, I am speaking about the many pets I come in contact with.  For the most part, pet parents are step above most retail customers in the part that their children are all loved.  Customer service is what it is all about at PetSmart.  If you don't live it, then you don't want to work there."
good,"Fun place to work when your customers are sharing their stories of their best friend being a dog, cat, or other, great atmosphere when everyone shares in the environment."
good,"Often very fast paced, depending on the day there can be a constant  stream of customers from the start to the end of the shift. The management was very friendly and happy to help."
good,Similar to that of which goes on at Pet Supermarket. I enjoyed leaning about animals as well as helping customers make the best choice of pet and/or product.
good,"Got to learn about animals and dog training. Fun experience to take care of the animals and see what needs they have. The employees were fantastic, fun, hard working and good team work. I loved seeing all the different types of animals."
good,"Definitely a place to work if you love animals. Walk, play, bathe, feed dogs and cats. interact with the daycare and dog training"
good,I enjoyed working there. I drove a forklift and cherry picker in order to replenish company product. I got along with all of my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was maintaining production rates after I had started a new medication.
good,I hate corporate and how the policies have changed. The local store and employees and management are awesome though! Corporate is all about profit now instead of animals.
good,"A typical day is consider helping pet owners spoil there pets with treats,food, and toys. Enjoy working with the team. Love most about the job was the interaction with the dogs."
good,"This job was both a blessing and a curse.  I enjoyed playing with the dogs but at the same time some of the tasks got tedious and repetitive at times.  The only true downside was dealing with a dog with an attitude problem.  Other than that, it was a fun job."
good,"fun and productive place to work..i learned alot from the group of girls i worked with, they all  became apart of my family. i especially loved and looked up to my salon manager she had taught me many things that i will take with me and  hopefully will be able to make her proud. its like any other place of employment it has its ups and downs and hard to deal with situtions but everyone puts forth an effort to try and ease these situations as they arise..i have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is the pets and their parents seeing them come in and then when they come back to pick up there pet and the reactions and gratitude you get, knowing that you have made them happy and their pet looks and feels good was the best part of it for me...there was no better feeling for me at the end of the day"
good,"To make enough money to really support yourself working at Petsmart, you really need to be a full-time associate-- this means being a dog trainer, a certified groomer, or a manager of some kind. A regular part-time associate would need another job or supplimental income to pay regular bills."
good,A great place to work as a student. Willing to work with your schedule. Learn time management and leadership skills. Also get to see pets very day!
good,I would usually get to work check with supervisors to see how sales were going.  Then get ready to go out on the floor for more sales. Also I would check with other associates to see how there doing.
good,A busy place to work that's requires time management. I learned a lot of patience working here and flexibility. Management is very positive. Hardest part of the job is there is little room for error working with animals to keep them safe. I love working with animals because it makes me happy!
good,"most enjoyable part of the job is all of the customer interaction as well as helping pet parents with their problems and issues with owning a pet.  Co-workers are all very helpful, we have a great team.  I work mostly making sure that the shelves are full and resets are done with new product as priced correctly."
good,"Stock room needs more attention before shutting down at night, but otherwise great workplace. "
good,This location is no longer in business. Compared to another Petsmart I worked at this store was much smaller and slower. Most of my time was helping the few customers that came into the store or walking around looking for something to do.
good,"The basics of working at the hotel is...it is HARD work. If you are afraid to sweat this is not the place for you. But if you love dogs, like to laugh, enjoy meeting new people (pet parents), then this is an excellent first job. Pet hotel work helps you to develop time management, customer relations, multi-tasking, and problem solving skills. It also builds leg and arm muscles...and most of all patience. Hard work can be fun..."
good,good place to work able to advance quickly was able to join the safety club. got to teach team members how to drive forklifts. got to do premaintant on forklifts to keep them safe and in good running order. i guess the hardest part was the long hour at the begenning when we were the only warehouse.
good,"I enjoyed PetSmart as my first job. "
good,"A typical day at the PetsHotel would include checking in and out animals, making sure they have been fed, their cages are clean, and the animals are eliminating.  There are lots of charts required to make sure the pet is in a healthy physical and mental condition and they are given exit baths and nail grinds."
good,Petsmart was my first job and it was really exciting and fun to work there. I ended up staying for seven years before moving on.
good,Great place to work where the leaders are genuinely concerned for the welfare of associates.  Leaders across the board share information and resources as the business needs dictate.
good,"Reports, research, resolution and process of Vendor invoices. Time Management. Collaboration with peers and vendors. Work Interruption from System errors was difficult. Enjoyed creating good rapport with Vendors. Completion of projects within deadline provides sense of accomplishment and satifactory work."
good,I like working for this company you get to work with animals and people all day. All my co worker are easy to get along with. and the management is great.
good,"Wonderful place to work. All employee's work as a team and provide top notch service to all customers. Through the training you gain a knowledge of pet care, cashier work, and emergency situations."
good,I really enjoyed my time and experiences while I was with the company. I met and worked with some wonderful coworkers and Pet Parents.
good,"the best part of my day was getting to see the variety of dogs, the staff were awesome like a family, for the most part the management was fair. I learned a lot about animal health and the benefits of high quality foods."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at PetSmart was being able to be part of the customers experience. I learned so many new things at PetSmart having to deal with a lot of different animals.
good,"A typical day at work starts differently depending on what area you're working in. As a pet care associate, I start my day by feeding all the animals in the store and checking in on any sick animals in the back. This can include giving medication. Depending on the day, I might have to do a full clean (Cleaning the entire section for certain animals: Reptiles, birds, small animals, etc.) This takes about 2 hours and is usually the responsibility of one associate. I would then spend the rest of the day helping customers with any questions and providing them with any materials they would need to own a pet and occasionally selling said pet to them. Upon closing, it's very similar to opening just without the feeding process. Checking on all animals once again, making sure health is optimal and giving any medications needed. "
good,"This was a great place to work for a long time.  The former executives put a lot in place to actually live the mission that they wanted, which is rare in this industry.  The metrics were tough but obtainable.  They rewarded well those who performed, and performed consistently.  Under the new ownership, there is a lot of concern regarding the direction they are taking the company. The culture of CARE is out the window, and replaced with the typical micromanagement.  While there were areas to improve, the Payless-ification of the company will be its downfall."
good,Working at Pets Mart was a fun and yet eventful experience. Various animals and pet parents . While being a cashier with the company i was given to opportunity to become more acquainted wit pets as a whole which gave me a broader horizon of understanding them.
good,This was one of my favorite summer jobs while I was in college. The people I worked with were fantastic and the environment was amazing. We should all be so lucky to have a temporary job like this one/
good,"This job can be difficult for animal enthusiasts, but, at the end of the day, nothing beats helping an animal find the right home or the perfect solution. Definitely a great place to work."
good,"assist customers, be a cashier, restock, pick up carts, sell animals."
good,"It was great working with animal. I loved the environment, it was a great experience but not something I'd like to do forever."
good,I worked in the hotel caring for the pets. I absolutely loved working there. They were amazing and completely understanding.
good,"Some days are slow, some are so busy that you barely realize 4 hours have passed. Most of the co-workers are great. There's a variety of personalities there. Some people there really do work hard and are willing to help if they can. Others make themselves look busy, but they're not fooling anyone."
good,"Co-workers and managers are always nice. "
good,lots of advancement opportunities for those willing to put in the appropriate work and behaviors.  Great people passionate about pets.
good,A typical day at work was cleaning and dealing with dogs and cats when I started I didn't have certain knowledge of pets and now I learned so much from the quality of foods to even realizing the stress level of a pet. The hardest part is dealing with a lot of barking and the pay is a little over minimum wage.
good,Working here wasn't that bad. Our jobs were completed on time.  The management was there for us if we needed them.  The employees felt comfortable about going to management with any problems that they had.
good,I have grown and expanded as a person and manager throughout my twelve years at PetSmart. I am looking to use my skills on a new adventure.
good,My friend called me about a dog adoption event @ PetSmart Northwest area in Southern Nevada so I said okay. I walk the dogs feed & clean cages it was fun. @ the end I got free Disneyland pass. This was in early 2010. All in all I had a great time there no problems ppl were friendly weather nice & love dogs.
good,I enjoy working at petsmart i learned a lot of new information about pets how to keep them in better health.  Everyday at work i will help and greet customers with what ever they need from carrying there items to there vehicles to giving them advice on there pets. most of my co-workers are great at team work for the most part. The hardest part of my job is the constant heavy lifting. the most enjoyable thing i get to do threw the day is get to help customers with there pets i like to help customers with there issues that they are having at home and mostly they will come find me personally at the store to thank me and to show what a difference i have made.
good,"I have been with this compyany for 2 years, and everything with our management is awesome, they come and help you if you need help. The coworkers are excellent they have an upbeat personality and vibe that makes working there so much fun. I would say the hardest part of the job is selling salon add ons and selling classes. The best part of the job is having all of those excellent pets coming into the store."
good,it was great my co-workers was great as well. I learned new skill like driving a forklift. also getting to know the people an their pets was an good experience.
good,do what ever task were set for that day and work on the schedule and close registrars. Sometimes you would do price auditing and also help with price adoptions. If the hotel got back up you would help with that to .
good,"Great employees usually, always great to talk and hangout with pet parents, and usually a great work environment. Got to play with a lot of cool animals."
good,If you like Petco you'll like working at PetSmart. Its nearly identical with the duties and skills that you need to work there.
good,"A typical day at work involves using industrial power equipment to fulfill order shipment needs as necessary. I have learned to be punctual and work quickly to ensure that the correct orders are received in a timely manner. Management is always interacting with the other workers, making it a positive environment. There are ping pong tables available to play on in the break area, and a horseshoe pit outside the break room. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor, but it is rewarding knowing that we take care of pets and help with adoptions of animals, as well."
good,I was a part of the start up in this DC. The first year we were the worse DC in the network. By the second year we were the best across the board due to management change that drove the building in the right direction. Petsmart continued to grow in my career there. The was plenty of opportunity to advance within the company. Petsmart was a very good and experience that thought me so much in my career.
good,"Each day I am either in the Pets Hotel or cashiering in the store side."
good,"Petsmart at Merrium,Kansas has help me grow through the years of me working there. I have learned to trust your employee's and always work as a team! Team work is everything there you have to be able to communicate and understand your co workers. I have learned you treat customers as if they were your family, show them the up most respect and always stay true to your word. The daily deeds of working at petsmart is always finish your obligations and always connect with  the customers. I have work in the pet-care department for a year now and i absolutely love it! we have customers they just stop by to tell us how their pet is doing and ect. the most important part of this job is helping the customer with any question they have, so we must always have knowledge on a broad spectrum of animals"
good,"Although you have your normal cats and dogs, at Petsmart I got to work with all sorts of animals. It was my job to take care of them and teach others the proper care for them. At the location I worked, the entire Petsmart team seemed to be very friendly and very helpful. The manager actually takes more time to care for his employees than most other managers I have worked for. The hardest part of the job was waking up early to feed the animals or change out bedding. This involves having to be there 3 hours before the store opens. The best part about working here is seeing the smile on a child's face when you help them pick out their first pet."
good,The most enjoyable pat of this job is getting to work with all the animals. The hardest part is maintaining the dogs when they get into a fight and getting a little stressed or scared after it occurs. The co workers are fun to work with for the most part.
good,"Great company to work for, and got to interact with people and animals on a daily basis!"
good,"Really nice work environment in a less stressful job for a Retail. Manger was great, so is the employee. Learned a lot about the requirements of Animals."
good,"At Petsmart a typical day would be setting appointments for the dog groomers, answering phone calls, Bathing the dogs while keeping the kennels and washing stations clean and orderly. Calling customers, taking expresses, and helping the dog groomers with extra tasks for example, sweeping up front. I learned about being independent and responsible for myself and my own work because it was up to me to get certain jobs done on time and correctly. The management was there when needed. my co-workers were all hardworking and we worked together to get our job done. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the workload was manageable and when it wasn't that I got the help I needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the animals and having the customers happy with the work I did."

good,PetSmart has a great mission and the ability to work with pets is a privilege.

good,Most all employees are generally engaging and very helpful.
good,Good place to work.  Loved the other groomers that i was with.  Management was a little slow responding to us if we called them.  Worked with a fantastic groomer with 30+ years experience. Most proud and enjoyable part of the job was seeing how the parents and dogs responded to there groom.  Hardest part of the job working with angry customers.
good,"This was a fun job, seeing many different types of animals walk through the door was fun seeing. It was a retail world with retail bumps in the road. Good sense of humor makes the day go by faster."

With working with everyone there they are nice and enjoyable people to work with.
good,Great place to work.  Team work very important as well as customer service
good,"Management is varied based on your location, but I have had managers who maintain a healthy attitude and respect towards associates. Corporate weighs heavily the perceived importance of metrics like sales and customer satisfaction percentages, sometimes to a fault. Benefits packages for full time employees are pretty good compared to other retail in this day and age."
good,I loved working with animals while at PetSmart and seeing regular customers. I could no longer advance with the company as I was already in a management position but it did open doors for me and allowed me to get out of the retail setting.
good,Fun to interact with customers and their pets. Customer satisfaction at its best
good,"great job just does not pay enough, team that really cares about its employees"
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customers with there needs, or the pets needs"

good,Typical warehouse job. Lots of mandatory overtime. Easy to move from order-filler to forklift driver little time. Friendly atmosphere/people. Most enjoyable part of the job is the money.

good,My time working at the PetSmart location i worked at was a very pleasant experience. The management at this store was always understanding and willing to accommodate to your needs the best that they could.
good,i enoyed the work environment the hardest part of the job was dealin with dogs because ou never know when a dog is in a bad mood. you definietly had to be precautious
good,"Tasks vary from day-to-day, obviously it's busier on the weekends and after 5:00 PM on weekdays, but that is to be expected in a retail environment. I learned a great deal about proper animal care ranging from fish and hamsters to dogs and cats. Management treats employees fairly on most levels and reciprocates respect to hard working employees. Co-workers are numerous and diverse. The hardest part of the job can be keeping up with the pace at which policies change, it was a completely different company when I had started compared to when I had left. The most enjoyable part is being around friendly animals for a good portion of your shift."
good,"petsmart is a classic example of a huge corp atmosphere with the excessive checklists of over the top rules and procedures that must be adhered to. the hourly pay ranges from around $12-$14 depending upon shift, which is better than the surrounding ottawa DC's, such as Kohl's... productivity rates that employees must reach and maintain are very high, especially inside the each pick modules. The employees must go all out for the vast majority of the shift to avoid the risk of being coached and eventually losing their jobs. Management team is generally respectful and approachable but also very robotic and by-the- book like company drones..overall though, good place to earn a steady income just as long as you can consistently work physically hard."
good,Good place to work but you really are only once person in a huge company. People don't mind stepping on you to get ahead. Was paid well but hours sucked and had a hard time with them working with my schedule.
good,"I started with price changes and price audits. Changed P.O.G.s and stocked. Then I would be a cashier. I helped customers on the registers and on the phone. If I was on the floor, I would assist customers there."
good,"A typical day at work consists of documenting services provided, answering multi-line phones, scheduling appointments, greeting customers, determining best services to offer, provide customer requested grooms for individual pets, and maintain safety procedures and sanitation for the salon."
good,A good company with suitable pay for a part-timer. Worked there for two years and learned how to represent a company through sales.
good,Love working with animals and was always great to see an owner happy when they came to pick up there pet.
good,"Work is fun, fast paced, sometimes challenging but overall I accomplish my set goals and leave knowing I have done well."
good,great attitudes
good,I learn so much about kinds of animals and the care for them. I became very professional. I save some animals' lives which I am very proud of. I enjoy working with my co workers and educate customers about their interests in certain animals. I should of went to school for vet tech. My father always calls me Dr. Dolittle.
good,"PetSmart is a good company to work for. Its a nice environment to work in, as you get to interact with cats, dogs, and other animals during most every shift. Most stores provide a positive environment that fosters a feeling of enjoying your job. It is more difficult to advance in certain locations, leading to a high number of manager transfers. Pay is very average for retail."
good,Animals are first and foremost always. It feels good to work with a company with its priorities in the right place.
good,Fast paced retailer that continues to find ways to improve. Impressed by the level of alignment around the company's core values.
good,"No two days are ever the same. An extreme focus on the customer is required, and a love of pets is a must."
good,"petsmart was exciting job and i learned alot there, i learned about how to take care of cats and dogs better"
good,"i love seeing pets! i dont have my own, so i treat them like my own."
good,Great opportunty to work with people who love either their job or the company they are doing business with. Every day you meet and interact with people that WANT to be there and help!
good,working with the people and animals was life experience i learned alot about how to take care of dogs and caring for them
good,"I have had the pleasure of working with dogs and cats for over two years. On a daily basis, I would make sure the dogs had fresh water and played with them from 9a-5p. Me and my co-workers worked together as a team to make sure the pets were happy and healthy. The most enjoyable part of the job was building a loving relationship with several of the animals and their owners too. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the mgr turnover in my area and missing the dogs while they were away."
good,Fast paced always overwhelmed with stuff to do. Managers work long hours and do a majority of the work.
good,"A typical day working for Petsmart was different almost everyday. I worked different shifts week from week. Sometimes I would come in at 6am to help unload freight 3 hours before the store opened. As a lead cashier, I wasnt primarily on the cash registers all the time everyday. If we started to get busy then I would help out on the registers but during downtime I would help stock items, reorder items that we were out of, unload too much cash in my cashiers drawers and make deposits to our safe. I loved working at Petsmart because I love pets. People would bring in therir pets to shop and I loved saying hi to every pet that came in. Customers would also bring in exotic pets which was a wonderful surprise! If I was the closing lead cashier for the night, I would count down my cashiers drawers, report the daily sales we made that day, and process deposits, and order money if needed."
good,"Great entry job for kids in high school, also great job for students going to school to be a vet. Pay is minimum wage but raises are decent."
good,"The care of the pets while in our care is the best part. Taking care of their needs & getting to know them and watch them grow & develop over the years is amazing. Building relationships with the pet parents, priceless."
good,"Good place to work, compensation is good for retail and amount of work asked of their employees. Only downside is the opportunity for advancement, vary far and few between unless your willing to move around the united states."
good,I worke at pet smart for 7 months and was almost given a managment position but then had to move but the job was great and I love the people I worke with
good,"Although it has been several years since I've worked here, this is still my favorite of all the jobs I've had. Everyone has their gripes with work, but this was one job where the only reason I would not go in was if I was legitimately ill. Even on a bad day, you got to pet some dogs and cats!"
good,"I have been in retail 20+ years, and this is the best home to job work balance I've ever had.  Great values and Leaders.  Clear direction and expectations.  Things change constantly, as retail always does, but there are no immediate penalties for not getting things done.  Most enjoyable part of the day is dealing with the animals, of course, and actually the PetParents are pretty great to.  Hardest part of the job is probably dealing with associates not being on time and upholding their work standards."
good,"I only left because I was pregnant and later moved before I could return to work but I loved the establishment, crew and goals. Management we respectful and understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to do work with animals and perhaps the most unexciting was stocking."
good,"working at the only micro store in toronto was fabulous and fun, never a dull moment . super kind coworkers and a busy environment made the best work place !"
good,"I enjoy the staff, all the people I work with are great and management does a great job listening to staff concerns. The work hours are flexible as well which is good."
good,Petsmart is not a bad company to work for but they will push you to see what you can handle. They are very compassionate and basically become your family.
good,"PetSmart is pretty easy we all kinda work as team. you get some benefits even as part time, stay frisky and happy and life is pretty easy. Management can b difficult to talk to about days off but its a small store with minimal workers so its to b expected."
good,"I love my job at the Pets Hotel. I was easily able to climb the ladder and became an Assistant manager within the first year of me working there. I love the clients that come and their pets. I have a super flexible schedule and am able to go to school full time while working full time. I get great health benefits and paid time off. "
good,"Started as an overnight pet care and moved to a Senior Petshotel Associate over the course of my time. Overall I really enjoyed working for the company. When they were bought out, I didn't enjoy it as much, but I worked to care for the animals and that made it better. Like any job, there was stress and toxicity but management handled it if brought to their attention."
good,"I loved my time at Petsmart. Most of the time the staff is wonderful, and the workload is good for what you get paid. Management is very understanding and helpful. "
good,Petsmart is a great job to learn customer service skills and team work. Team work is almost the most important part of working at petsmart. You have alternating shifts where the next person coming in will either have to take care of your slack or be able to make progress on daily tasks. Taking care of animals is pretty easy as well as keeping up cleanly standards.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at PetSmart. I worked with an amazing team and it was the best place for me to start my employment history. I learned a lot of valuable skills working with other people and in customer service. The managers are more than fair and always willing to help you do your best every day. They understand that everyone is going to have a rough day at some point on the job and they help you get back into a working mindset on those bad days. The most difficult part of the job for me was waking up at 5 AM for the days I was assigned to bedding changes in the Pet Care department. My favorite part of the job was definitely working in the fish department considering I now have 11 aquariums. Fish are definitely a life long hobby of mine. Overall, it's a fantastic place to work and build lifelong people skills."
good,"Working for Petsmart gave me the opportunity to grow and retain a self of pride in my work, which meant to always give 110% at every task given to me. I was able to work my way up the ranks and excel, Personally the work environment was amazing and comforting."
good,"This job is very stressful, but in this company under the right leadership it is very easy to grow and move up to new positions. I have been with PM for 7 years and moved up 3 positions. I have to be very flexible with hours I work, but its worth it."
good,"The company was a good company to work for everybody is nice and respectable , I enjoyed working around animals and people I would of continued to work there but there wasn’t enough hours"
good,fast pace  long hours  decent training  but could be improved   good job if you work hard  pay raises could be better   based on  over all work and attendance
good,Very inconsistent hours. Great place other than that. Easy work and nice people. They try as hard as they can to make it a team effort and not just collect your paycheck and go. They pressure you way too much about sales and different discounts to the point where you're worried if they are going to give you less hours if you are low on sales or something.
good,"Petsmart is a fun place to work. You always get to see a bunch of puppies that come into the store. The company offers some 50% off the product the is owned by the company, 15% off all product (employee Discount)."
good,Good place to work. Fun environment. Look forward to going to work on a day to day basis. Has potential for being a great job for the right candidate..
good,It is a good job if you want to learn and grow. It was just a part time job for me but I enjoyed my time there. Some issues with management between the two stores I have worked at.
good,The company does well striving to follow its mission statement and what the company stands for. Customer focus is key and the priority that drives the business. Now with Chewy it is the largest pet supply retailer.
good,I liked working to deal with dogs of all breeds and ages. The management on the other hand was horrible. The salon manager at Midland Texas is a horrible one. Welcomes drama and behaves very inappropriately with the employees there.
good,"Loved working at petsmart great environment. Fast paced easy to learn, very hands on with the animals. Loved working with peoples pets. Cons though we cater to customers to much they expect to just get what they want and we let them, it's a bit infuriating to deal with so many entitled people. Other than that love it."
good,"Honestly it’s a good paying job if you know what your doing, it’s based off of 50% commission. No hourly unless you don’t make commission, but you would have to push sales yourself. I always made more then 700$ A week. So yes it’s a great job but it is quick, sometimes stressful and you have to be good with time management."
good,PetSmart was a very faced environment. We were offered the opportunity to study course material fitting for the job and given a small pay raise after completing a series of tests associated with the study material. I learned a great deal. Within the first month I was able to confidently help customers I many different departments.
good,"While I worked here, I was able to establish good working relationships with all of my fellow staff members, whether they be managers or associates. This made working at this company great, as we were all on the same page and everybody had a shared sense of respect for one another."
good,"The store has a great environment, staff, and customers. Willing to cross train if you ask and always willing to show you new things at the store I worked. However, the hours are terrible. You work about 20 hours a week."
good,Petsmart is an equal opportunity company that is a great place to gain experience working with animals. That being said it can be very fast paced and stressful on busy days. The management that I experienced at Petsmart was great because they are willing to work with you and are very understanding. There is also great opportunity for career advancement if you are willing to put in the time and work.
good,petsmart is a great company to work for and management is easy going and very understanding. Working is fairly easy and does not require overtime even though it would never be a bad thing to work there for longer hours. Environment is great and there is never a bad day considering we work with dogs all day. weekends can become hectic but very manageable.
good,Typically part-timers work between 4 to 6 hours a day and are able to get a day off as long as it's two weeks out. Very friendly and approachable managers that are there to assist you when needed. Simple job with reasonable pay.
good,"My experience working here was generally positive, they start you out working as a cashier and gradually move you around upon request. The amount of hours you work per week fluctuates greatly even with open availability, little to no weekends off. I worked anywhere from 18-30 hours a week depending on scheduling. Staff were friendly and often times helpful when needed."
good,"Fast-paced job, have to be able to work under pressure and multi-task. Customer service skills needed. Friendly work environment. Have to be a team player and be able to work on you own."
good,I really liked working at Petsmart. The only complaint I have is that the last management I had inefficient.  All of the other managers I had with the company were great to work with.
good,"A typical day is very fast paced with alot of tasks to complete. Every associate has a passion for animals and were involved in supporting different animal charities. Management provides a great culture and work environment. I had the opportunity to learn about shrink control, merchandising, and learned how to give great customer service as well as how to educate my customers on proper pet care. They have great benefits and offer a employee discount."
good,I love working here. Due to the location we do not get a lot of business so getting hours at the store is limited so I need to make more else where. Getting hired is easy which makes it hard on me because not everyone completes their tasks and then leaves the next employee to clean up after them. This is what makes the day fast paced because you have limited time to get daily responsibilities done. There are several employees who I believe should be fired but management does nothing about the lack of work on others behalf. I get along with all of the employees wonderfully. We are very close knit and have a sarcastic humor among all of us.
good,Once familiarized with the inner working of the place you fit right in. The staff are very friendly along with customers who frequent the place weekly.
good,"I absolutely LOVED my first store. Management was responible and punctual. I advanced fast in the company, and needed to relocate to train people who wanted to listen to me. New store has terrible management. Rude and full of attitude. There are nice people in the haystack, but yeah."
good,its great to see all the different dogs come in   some come for just a visit or salon appointment or training.  its a very interactive place between customers and employees and a very soothing place to be employed
good,The environment at Petsmart is great. I loved being around animals all the time. Most customers were nice and it was overall a positive workplace. I think is a great part time job and a good job to have if you want to learn more about pets.
good,Its a great place to work. I started working as a revualr associate and then got promoted rigbt away. So hard work pays off there and they recognize and appreciate it.
good,Great place to work under correct management. Fun environment with animals everywhere. Easy to be recognized for good work ethic and constant management reviews.
good,"I worked as an early morning stocker at Petsmart in Loganville,GA . I honestly loved working there, the only reason I left was due to a family issue that is not Pet Smart related. I had to go out of state for an extended period of time."
good,"I really, really loved working here. They each you so much about animals and working with fellow animal lovers created such an awesome learning environment. There was one bad seed manager but she left the store and the new manager was flawless, he was super nice and understanding. The only cons for this job is they don't pay very much, I worked in the pet care department and it is very laborious. I did eventually leave because the pay wasn't quite making the cut anymore."
good,"Its the only job that I had a set schedule and I like that very much I work 3 days at 10 hours and have 4 days off.  It's great that's why I like it "
good,Love this place family first type of environment everyone worked as one hours were great an the benefits were a bonus weekly pay as well. Always was a way to stay busy.
good,"I cared for the small animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.  I made sure that customers went home with the right products to insure their new family member  would live a healthy and happy life."
good,"I worked the evening shift from 1:30pm-9pm. I would come in, put my bag in my locker, and go into the play area Keep an eye on the dogs and play with them, pick up after them, make sure their water bowl are filled, and that all the dogs are getting along. You sat in the play camp from 1;30 until about 5 when they are taken back to their kennels for their dinner and we go to lunch. When we get back from break, we each take one side and let out the indi dogs one at a time for individual playtime (you'll learn about this when you start). After all dogs are walked and in their kennels, we spend the rest of the night cleaning. Usually, we can get all the indi dogs done about 7-ish and then we stay our the side we're on and clean all the kennels, suites, and playtime areas. Throughout the day, every hour or so, we go around checking on all the dogs and cats to make sure their kennels are clean and they have water. If their kennel is dirty, we clean up after them and replace their bedding if needed. And that's it. Easy work, chill coworkers, positive atmosphere."
good,"I held my job at Petsmart for a year until I had to leave for school. I had amazing coworkers although I did not get along with one of the managers. Overall, it’s a great job to get customer service experience and paid the bills while I was in school."
good,This is a Great place to work out if you like lifting and bending your knees as well as quick paced and the  smell of dog food  and ready to work 10+ hours a night.
good,Always learning different things always stay busy if your not getting fish for customers or showing or selling other animals you can always keep yourself busy by facing shelves. There is always something to do. Walking around asking customers if they are doing okay if they need help or just getting ready for the next day or shift.
good,"It was relaxing to work at PetSmart, as the Night Care Pet Specialist, but at times, it was stressful. There was a lot to do in such a tight amount of time that it was difficult to remember what had to be done. In addition to this, it was difficult to balance my education along with working there."
good,This was a very enjoyable job.  You not only got to know the pets but their parents too and develop a relationship with them.  There were also many charity events at the store that were fun to participate in.
good,PetSmart loves pets and believes pets make us better people. PetSmart will be the trusted partner to pet parents and pets in every moment of their lives.
good,I had a lot of fun working here. I left because I wanted to broaden my resume. It was fun educating customers about animals and also to be around animals. I've learned a lot from this job.
good,"I get to meet people's dogs every day while doing simple enough entry-level retail work with some pet care mixed in. And I genuinely like most of our managers, the only annoyance is a variable schedule and occasional lack of hours."
good,I've worked in the grooming salon for years now and it is a friendly and demanding environment. Groomer's pay is based off commission so you get out what you put into it. Great place for the motivated employee!
good,"Very fun environment and fast paced, I wouldn't have left if I didn't move, I miss it all the time, my manager was great and always made sure everyone was taken care of."
good,"I truly loved working there, I loved helping people and their pets. I felt like I made a difference in peoples lives and their animals, I enjoyed interacting with the customers as well. I felt that I wasn't allowed to go into other parts of the store so I left, but I would definitely recommend petsmart to people."
good,"Over-see 180 employees, 6 managers, 6 supervisors. Worked with each to set and obtain goals. Strong management culture, worked well together. Hardest part were the hours. Best part was the positive environment."
good,"This location specifically, is a great location to work at. Everyone has great teamwork ethic here and treats you like family. Management is amazing here. Always on top of things and have your back when you need them. No drama is tolerated at this location and you are surrounded by animals making it difficult to ever be upset. It also gives you a feel good feeling because you are giving animals homes, especially when it comes to the cat adoption centre. Most of the cats come from a high kill facility and deserve healthy homes and love and we make sure they go to the best homes possible. If you're ever upset, you can just go cuddle up with the cats in the cat adoption centre."
good,"I feel working retail anywhere anymore is going to require someone that can handle a disgruntled customer effectively. It would be the same as working in the service industry. A typical day at work for me would involve customer service and interaction. I needed to know how to spot critical signs of stress for dogs and cats, and act quickly should the situation call for it. The vast majority of managers are very helpful, and willing to help solve problems with you. "
good,Loved my co-workers and thoroughly enjoyed my first experience in a retail setting. Working with the pets and parents was awesome. I would and might return in the future.
good,Since the first day I started working at Petsmart I enjoyed working there. My coworkers made me feel welcome and a lot of customers became really close friend almost family members in my eyes. I've learned a lot of basic care and some experienced things about multiple types of animals. Management has shown me a glimpse of what it's like to be manager and to deescalate bad situations with customers.
good,it was amazing coming in daily to an endless line of the cutest dogs and since I just had to bath them it was so much better than having to give hair cuts and even when I was pulled out from the salon I didn't mind because pet people rock
good,The perks of getting to interact with the various types of pets on a daily basis were great. People were genuinely happy and appreciated your thoughts because by helping their pet you were like helping their kids.
good,It was a good first job to have everybody was nice there and very helpful also a lot of people really enjoyed the atmosphere and the politeness that the store provided. It's just a really good place to work
good,Working at PetSmart has provided me with the knowledge of how to work in retail. I was working with many hard working employers who made my job much more successful .
good,expect you to do your job and stay on task. I learned teamwork and good work ethic. Management let us know what was going on week to week and what was expected from us.
good,Advancement is always possible within the company. Interacting with customers and pets is always fun and exciting. Every day can feel like a new experience.
good,"Petsmart was a great work experience.  It not only helped me gain work experience, but allowed me to grow as an individual. The team was very helpful and willing to assist in any way possible."
good,"PetSmart is a fun place to work for seeing all the dogs. The people were nice and fun to work with. However, scheduling was not always done and they did not always work with my availability."
good,"I was a full time night shift worker at the Pet Hotel, not in retail, but I loved my job. I worked full time, the pay was well worth it, and the job felt very rewarding."
good,"It doesn't get much easier than this for a retail job. If you can't handle this, then there isn't much else out there for you. The stock is minimal, animals are easy, few employees to work with. Good luck."
good,"I honestly loved my job. It was very friendly environment. Never had rude customers, always helped customers to leave with a smile on their faces. Loved everything about it!"
good,"If you have to work in retail, it's a great place to do it. They treat you well, train you, and their expectations are realistic.  Bonus: You get to pet dogs at work!"
good,"Loved working with animals, loved working with the public. Great co-workers, everyone helped everyone when it was super busy, which was most of the time.  Management were great at first, then someone new came in and upset just about everyone in the store. Many groomers walked out, which made it impossible to continue here. I learned so much about caring for animals & animal behaviour plus working with pet parents in the salon and around the store. Workplace culture was so friendly and based on Customer Service Excellence, pet & associate safety and helping out your colleagues.  It broke my heart to leave as I'd finally found a job I absolutely loved."
good,Petsmart is a place where team work is a must. You really learn to depend on your coworkers for help with difficult animals.  It is a very fast paced place to work.
good,Working with or educating those with animals has always been a goal of mine and I was able to accomplish and exceed my expectations with this company.
good,"Depending what field you go into at the store you will be very happy with what you are doing there."
good,"Its been over a decade since I worked for PetSmart but I loved it. Management was great, co workers were great, plenty of opportunity for training and advancement.  Working with animals and animal supplies all day is amazing."
good,"I have had the pleasure of working here for nearly five years, the staff and management have been nothing short of great to work with. Throughout my time here as a pet care associate, I have not only learned how to interact with customers, but also learned how to work with a team that shares the same passion, and interests as I do. In my department, we are responsible for caring for the small animals, reptiles, and fish, as well as preparing and educating pet parents on the needs of their new pets. I love it because we continue to learn something new every day, from each other, as well as pet parents. I enjoy working with the animals every day, although sometimes it can be tough to send them to their new homes once you create a connection with them!"
good,I enjoyed my time at PetSmart. Management and team were very nice and helpful whenever they could be. I worked in the salon and had a lot some issues with fellow employees and their need to cause problems and create a hostile work environment. Abilities to advance in the company are offered in a timely fashion to anyone who is working hard and creating a positive atmosphere.
good,"I like the fact that the management is willing to work with you, and the fact that the staff there is easy to work with. Great people, great management, and an overall good place to work."
good,Good place to work. Ive been here 10 years and like working here. I have learned a lot about not only beong certified on different equipment but how behind the scene we help the stores flow.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of opening the store, unloading trucks, stocking shelves, training new employees, manager on duty, operating registers, price changes, counting the safe, closing the store."
good,The management team is the best. Typical day is not too stressful and easy going. This is a great job for college students. The most enjoyable part about the job is the dogs.
good,I loved working there. If i hadnt have moved i wouldnt have ever left! I could work for that company my whole life and wouldnt have any complaints! I love seeing people bring in their animals of all sorts. The only down fall is when i would get my paycheck id always end up turning around and spending it all on the things they had there! I couldnt help giving it all back...they have such great product and low prices. I wish i could work there again sometime!!
good,Overall they are a great company to work for. Benefits are very important and they provide employees with many benefits. Also the pay is very competitive.
good,Fun environment especially if you love animals. Good starting pay and their is room to expand and go up the ladder. They are very flexible with availability and request offs.
good,"If you were scheduled to a certain time, plan to be there around another 2 hours. At my location nothing was ever done on time because of horrible under staffing, apart from that it was a fantastic place to work for"
good,"I love PetSmart and I shop there almost exclusively when it comes to my pet products. I love them because of what I learned about their company and their business practices from two years of working there, and by far, they are the most enjoyable corporate company I've been involved with by far. "
good,PetSmart is a strong and face paced work environment. Dedication and great work ethic will get you very far with this company. Having strong positive attitude and flexibility will be very beneficial.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Petsmart, particularly in the Petcare department. You basically clean animal cages and assist with guests purchasing pets. Sometimes you may be asked to cashier. I've worked at two different Petsmarts and I will say that each experience was different. Management and co-worker attitudes do matter a lot with the overall happiness of the store."
good,"The thing I really love about this company, and my store in particular, is that all the employees really care about the pets and want what is best for them."
good,"PetSmart was a wonderful and fun place to work. as a cashier, I would assist customers with finding store items, and maintaining a quick and efficient pace of work to avoid crowding in the store. our staff including the managers all worked very well together to maintain a safe and clean environment."
good,"Promotions are hard to come by. You are never ""ready""  to be promoted. It is a great company to work for though. Very fun and eventful."
good,A typical day at pet smart was very enjoyable. Working there has taught me how interact with customers. The management was superb along with my co workers. The culture at Pet Smart was very loving and hard working. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was interacting with different customers.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and greeting customers everyday. Spending a moment with a customer or hours with fellow coworkers made work exciting and interesting. I loved going to work, answering questions a customer had, and interacting with coworkers as a cashier or when organizing items of the shelves as a team."
good,Really good company good work schedule friendly environment and co workers.  Management tries to the best of their ability to be fair and take care of their associates.
good,I loved working with the animals on a daily basis. Loved working with animal lovers.                                         .........................................
good,"A typical day at work would start with me greeting whoever was working the Pet Care department before me, and receiving the keys and work phone from them. I would ask what tasks were completed and what still needs to be done to determine what needs to be completed. I assist customers as I complete required tasks, and when all tasks are completed I focus on caring for the animals, such as making sure all bedding is clean, all food and water dishes are clean and filled, and making sure all the animals are healthy."
good,It was good until idiots started cheating the system by cancelling orders to boost rates doing the ones they wanted. After the system changed because of employees taking shortcuts the job got a lot harder due to rate changes.
good,"I love working at PetSmart, they are nice, laid back. But there are no opportunities to advance in the company, corporate doesn't communicate very well leaving customers to leave frustrated."
good,Discovering customers needs in relation to their pets. I've learned to listen to customers needs and provide them with solutions. The management in the store motivates me to provide consistent results. The hardest part of the job is dealing with multiple people at once and the best part is meeting new and regular customers.
good,Would have given it 5 stars if the pay was better. But I love my coworkers they are hardworking and funny. I love working with all the different types of animals. Some customers can be annoying but that's expected. Pay is small (near minimum) but you get good discounts. Scheduling flexibility is average not great. My scheduling manager got annoyed (despite me saying before hire that I'm in college I'm going to switch a lot). Animals are totally worth it! :)
good,"Overall PetSmart is a great company to work for. It is retail, so there are constant changes and pressure to get more things done in a shorter amount of time, but that is to be expected. Customers really love being able to bring their dogs in the store and it always brightens your day to greet the pets in the store."
good,"Work day could be very stressful and busy, but its really fun if you love dogs and making them gorgeous! I learned a lot about how to care for dogs and cats the best you can. I also learned a lot of interesting techniques for grooming! I love my co-workers and I am thankful for my leaders. The absolute hardest part of this job is the ""misunderstood"" dogs. However, building relationships with people and their pet children is the absolute best part of the job."
good,helping costumers with various issues with their pets. Good co-workers always willing to help. the most enjoyable part of the work is when you got to spend a few minutes with the different pets of the costumers.
good,"Working as a pet stylist at Petsmart is fun, challenging, and creative! The most difficult part of the job is grooming animals that don't want to be groomed but but making them look and feel their best can be very rewarding."
good,"Work day is relaxed and comfortable but productive. "
good,"Management at my location is great! They understand the employees weaknesses and strengths and make sure they reward those who go the extra mile. I have only been an employee here for short time, but I am determined to go further in this corporation. The customers are great and I have already made many friends!"
good,"i can honestly say working at petsmart, I've learned a lot about customer service, co-workers were very awesome always there when you need help with anything. managers are always there if any troubles you have or if you need more experiences in certain areas, they'll teach and work with you."
good,"How can you not enjoy your job when you're working with animals? :-) I made a lot of good friends while working here. Many genuine people with big hearts. A typical work day... hmm. There is never a ""typical"" workday when you're working with animals. Especially when the animals are aloud to come ""into"" the store. But... truthfully I really enjoyed that part of the job the most. The hardest part of the job... I can't think of one ;-)"
good,"Working with others to help them take care of their pets was a great experience and the co-workers were a hoot to work with. "
good,As a full time College student any job that can help provide experience and a friendly environment is always welcome. Its a legitimate corporation that hires the right employees to work for them
good,"When I started with the company they had great values about the pet and customers, however since the British company took over the seem to care more about profit than the well being of the pet, and customers.  The set stick guide lines and when you follow them and a customer complains to corporate they seem to have no idea what the guidelines are."
good,working to keep the animals clean but also safe is not so easy. you must get them completely clean but also safe. And also stay on top of answering phone calls and keeping the customers happy when coming into the grooming salon
good,I enjoy going into work because i get to interact with both pets and pet parents (as we call them). The co workers are great and makes working enjoyable.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was being around animals all day and getting to bond with them. A typical shift for me was being in doggie day camp playing with the dogs for 4 hours, putting them back into their rooms, getting food ready, feeding the dogs, cleaning rooms, doing laundry, taking care of feeding cats and doing their tender love and care time."
good,"Constantly pleasing the customers and pets. Caring for the animals that are for sell, cleaning work station and always going to the extra mile for the pet parent and pets."
good,"My job provided through funding from PetSmart Charities was actually ran through the Sullivan County Humane Society. The job consisted of running the spay and neuter grant as well as the education and community outreach aspect. The most challenging part was being one of the staff, but at the same time being completely separate. I could help my colleagues with very little due to red tape unless I was willing to cut my hours and be there as a volunteer, even when my own work was complete. It was a difficult balance of doing my duties, yet not belonging and having a say in many on-the-job issues. It could have been much more clear, but the learning curve that I dealt with for the grant I'm sure the board did as well. The best part of my job was feeling so accomplished when I realized how much we achieved with so little time! I gained so much knowledge and experience from this job, for which, I am very grateful! My relationship with the veterinarian, my colleagues, and the children and adults of the community will continue to be an asset in my life."
good,"Greet pet parents and assist with purchases. Most customers who come in are very pleasant. They focus on keeping associates up to date on safety and policies and procedures. Well balanced company, I have been with them for many years."
good,The management was great and the employee's accept you very easily. The job isn't to hard grasp and is easy to gain a footing in the company.
good,"PetSmart is a wonderful place for a college student to work. It gave me the opportunity to gain valuable experience, while working my way through school. Every policy and procedure is there for the safety of the animals and customers. My co-workers are hard workers, and care about every animal that comes through our doors. In my experience my managers have been hard working and positive thinkers. My job at PetSmart will be a part of my life that I will look back on positively."
good,PetSmart is in my mind the clear choice for all pet purchases. The job is a joy because you work with great people and get to see people at their best. Since changing from publicly traded to a privately owned company some changes do not make the greatest sense but if you are desiring a career in retail I havent worked for a better more fufilling company.
good,"As a pet groomer, I worked not only with the pets but the people too. I learned patience and how to deal with difficult clients. I loved this job until it became more about the money and less about the pets. My co workers were the absolute best."
good,"During my time with PetSmart i had a harm and loving environment. The management was very caring, and also my co-workers were very helpful."
good,"I work early mornings so the typical day at work starts before the sun comes up. My job consists of keeping the store properly stocked and inventory counts correct. Your learning experience can vary depending on how you approach your job and how your stores management team is. In my store management is willing to help you improve your skills and create a better running environment. It's difficult to move up because there is a low turnover rate so people tend to be there for years. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of communication with my team, follow up, succession planning, development of my team, and the overall safety, well-being, and morale for all the associates, customers, and pets in my store. The most critical thing I learned is that you must delegate out tasks and workload with thorough follow up in order to be successful. The management is great and supportive and also challenges me to think of ways to become more effective and efficient on a daily basis in order to meet metrics and goals."
good,"The company itself is great to work for. It all depends on which store you land in as to how management will be. The benefits are fair. Working in the hotel was great, compared to the store. The hotel is the only department I'd ever want to work in. Working with the dogs is the best part of the job."
good,The job it self is nice. The core management team is awesome and are always looking to help. It's a good starter job with room for advancement in the company. It's always nice getting to work with animals everyday though they aren't always fun to deal with. Always keep in mind that animals have emotions too. sometimes they are happy and sometimes they just want to bite you.
good,Management was fairly unorganized and training for new managers was lackluster. Pettiness in job culture could have been store specific.
good,"I had no experience with pet outside of cats, but after working for three months I had learned about more animals than i thought could be pets. Management has been extremely helpful in my career development and encourage me to explore new opportunities and ways to make my work experience better. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching children with animals."
good,"As a dog bather, I got the runt work in the salon.  However, dog bathers have an opportunity to become groomers.  The only thing is groomers are required to work full time, so I wasn't able to.  It can be very busy, but likewise, it can be slow.  The people are wonderful and the best part is working with dogs.  You learn a lot about customer service with this job.  When you leave, if you decide not to become a groomer, you will always know how to trim your own dogs nails and brush them beautifully."
good,Constant contact with pets and their owners. Anyone interested in this job will have to love pets as you are playing with dogs that range from 5 lbs chihuahuas to 100 lbs German Shepherds.
good,"I liked it @ Ace Baking also. "
good,"I have been working with Petsmart for over 3 years now while attending college. I like that my schedule is flexible enough to do this even while working full time. My current store is not as great as my old store in Leesburg, VA, however there are a lot of great people working for Petsmart. Some not so great ones too, but overall I have enjoyed my time with the company."
good,"A typical day at work was busy and productive. I learned how to better assist people on the floor and how to care for animals better. The management was always friendly and tried to make everything fair, for example if one associate had an eight hour shift and had already been on register for four hours and another associate had a four hour shift and had been on the floor for an hour they would try to make sure the associate that had a longer shift got some time off the register. Most of my co-workers were easy to get along with, sometimes there was a lack of communication and someone would get upset when they couldn't take their break when they wanted to. The hardest part of my job would be the communication between the cashiers break times. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the customers and their pets. I always loved assisting customers and helping them find what they needed to better take care of their pet."
good,"Playing with pets and having fun."
good,"Great to work with all of the animals! Great environment! Management was crumbling while I was working there, store manager was fired, assistant manager used to yell at associates over intercom and did not even try to help customers. He ended up quitting soon after. New manager spoke disrespectfully to employees, when I put in my two weeks they got upset and told me not to come in and they would give my hours to train another associate. Its a shame they ruined such a great workplace."
good,"It's like any other retail job, stock shelves or talk with customers."
good,"A typical day is spending a few hours in camp with the dogs. Playing with them, cleaning up after them, making sure they don't play too rough or fight. I also clean rooms, prepare meals, clean dishes, etc."
good,"I am currently working with PetsMart on a part-time basis to earn a few extra dollars for some life changing events. Since working with this establishment, I have learned how the world of retail works when it comes to customers of the four legged type and I have found it to be quite enjoyable."
good,i had troubles trying to make the rate system and ended getting myself in a hole
good,"Great tips, flexible hours, great boss. The evenings went by super quick on the weekends and I made awesome tips! I got to have a lot of fun and met a lot of new ppl."
good,I loved my job so much mainly because of my customers.  They would come in regularly and I became close to a few of them
good,This place is great and offers great advancement and benefits! You learn a lot but being soaking wet all day as a washer and having to lift heavy dogs and always having hair in your nose is a bummer. You did earn tips though and it was rewarding. I just wish the pay was a bit better for the work you do.
good,"Great Employees, great management, and a great job to have.  The customers are a joy, and so is the work crew.  It's a great starting job, but it's rather hard to move up"
good,Petsmart is a great company to work for. My only reason for pursuing another career is because groomers work solely on commission. This means if a customer decides not to bring their dog in for grooming then that is commission we do not receive. This makes paychecks different every week and difficult to pay bills. Petsmart does have great benefits and friendly people to work with. My co-workers will be the hardest part of the company to leave.
good,Management needs work. Easy and fun work. Good pay for job. not good at scheduling.
good,"As a cashier it was pretty simple exchange money and handle returns while making sure to be upbeat and that all needs/wants of customers were met. If we were slow walk around and provide customer service. As a petcare associate you have more responibilities. Opening procedures require you to clean habitats and check on the pets health as well as feed everyone. Closing procedures require double checking animals for low food and water and health. During the you catch fish and other animals customers want as well as answer questions about pets and point them to the best products for the job needed. Management knows how to run the store and did a great job with that but lack with personal skills with both associates and customers. Co-workers are fun to work with. I love catching fish and talking about them and tanks and really helping customers understand their pets and giving them the best care. The hardest part were the hours of being a manager and stocker. I had to come in at 3am. As manager not only did I have to work early mornings but I had to work changing shifts in the same week, some days and some nights. It was hard to have a sleep schedule and me and my work suffered due to that. As manager I opened and closed the store. I reported to store and opperations manager daily.I counted down tills, received the money truck and the delivery truck. I performed hourly inspections of salon and adoption area. As manager they were unwilling to work with my vacation and my schools breaks. Actually told me when I could take my vaction as in they gave me a specific week and said you"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at PetSmart. They really want to make their stores easier to run. I learned more at this company than I could ever put into words. Being part of the New Store Opening process for several years enabled me to work with nearly every department in the Corporate Office. I worked closely with HR, Store Operations, and IT. It was very rewarding to be part of teams that listened to issues and worked together to resolve them."
good,PetSmart is a fun place to work. And very busy as well. Something that I love about PetSmart is that it is very sensitive to accommodate the needs of it's associates. Such that for college students it is very accommodating with scheduling.
good,Great place to work. I enjoyed everything about the job. They do however promote based on seniority before promoting for abilities and skills.
good,Very easy to get along with Store Manager. Very fun experience. I loved training dogs here! Great pay with commission benefits. Awesome learning experience I can use throughout life.
good,Petsmart is a fun place to work! The customers are great and seeing their pets is fun.
good,Typical day at work includes ensuring all customers are satisfied when they are leaving the store.
good,"PetSmart is a really good place to work for people who are looking to have a stable part time job. The people are nice and they pay pretty well, also you can have a pretty flexible schedule."
good,"PetSmart has been pretty good to me, you get what you put in and also just hope you have a good management staff, I love my job with a passion but they just don't pay my bills."
good,I worked for PetSmart in the 1990's and have regretted quitting ever since. That job was the best I have ever had. I want to work there again and have been trying for years now. PetSmart is better that Disney!
good,"I enjoyed working for PetSmart, The only complain was the hours."
good,Typical day at work is you go in and get the job that's needed to be done. Very routine so there is no confusion. Very hands on with live animals and reptiles. Fun place to work if you love working around animals.
good,If you love dogs and cats. Great job .Managers and staff very knowledgeable to help with customers questions.   Flexible hours and they promote within the company
good,"when i arrive I do a walk though the back to make sure the dogs are taken care off and everything is up to date. "
good,Working at pet-smart you gain a lot of knowledge with the health and safety of animals. You excel in customer service and learn new things everyday. The environment is friendly and open to anyone who is passionate with working with animals
good,"This is a wonderful place to work and I was incredibly sad to have to leave it. The manager is wonderful and she trains very well, the animal care is of optimal importance and the tore is set up very nicely. If this job had paid more I would have never left."
good,"PetSmart gives a lot of opportunities to expand knowledge with several types of animals, as well as gives incredible opportunities for advancement. PetSmart tries to promote from within and will give a current employee a chance for an advanced position before interviewing outside applicants."
good,"I started off as a bather in the grooming salon in May of 2013 and after about six months I had graduated from their grooming academy training program, and began working full-time. I started earning commission by January of 2014, which is 50% per dog groomed. We were encouraged to upsell products, which was easy and to build a consistent clientele by calling customers for reminders and handing out our cards. I worked in Tomball, so we really had to hustle on that front as business was a bit slower due to large number of mobile grooming businesses and other independently owned boarding places and vet offices in the area. Other salons (suburban/inner city area) are regularly fully booked, no questions asked. I appreciated the opportunity to learn a new skill and the supportive company culture."
good,"PetSmart is a very supportive environment to work in with a high percentage of staff staying on for many years and plenty of opportunity for growth and to move up within the company."
good,"Petsmart as a whole has wonderful values and their mission states they are there for the pets. With awesome opportunities to advance into management, fair pay, and great benefits for the full timers. I love this company and I'm sad to part with it."
good,"I loved my job in belleville Illinois, Co-workers were great. Got to learn something new everyday. You will meet all kinds of new people and learn about the proper care for those animals. Hardes part of the job was when I had to relocate."
good,"I enjoyed my job quite a bit, but I am trying to start a business in dog care and didn't want to violate a non compete, so I left to start my own company, and am looking for a part time job to help me supplement my income while starting up."
good,"As someone who cares about animals, I feel like taking on a job at PetSmart is a big chance to learn more about pets, how to properly take care of them, and educate others on how to do so. My managers were always respectful, It requires a stomach, diligence, and patience - but it pays off."
good,"Petsmart was very accommodating in many senses. A typical day would vary depending on if I worked the register or in the grooming salon. The register handled greeting customers, answering phones, answering customers questions along with directing them to anything they may need help finding. Cleaning the register area and keeping aisles in order would be done once I arrived to work and maintained throughout the shift. In the grooming salon I would make appointments, handle walk-ins, bathe any animals I had for the day, along with helping my coworkers with any animals they may need help with. The register is secluded from much coworker interaction whereas the grooming salon is much different in that aspect. The hardest thing to handle would be an upset customer since they can be difficult to please once they're upset with an item or service. On the flip side, the customers can also be the best part of the day, especially when you build rapport with them and you both end up making each other's day better."
good,It's a great place to work. You get to learn great customer service skills while working in a stressful and loud environment. It gives many opportunities to learn about different types of pet care
good,"groom up to 6 dogs a day. i bathe then give them there hair cut, as well as answer the phone, making appointments, and checking in/out the dogs. sometime it can be stressful but its manageable"
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work.  always had something to do when I came in. There were never really any slow days. It was always go go go, which was nice. I learn many skills through there monthly training program. The pay was decent, and I learned a great deal about pets and products."
good,"Petsmart is amazing! Great place to work, the salon is a blast. But, you have to wait to become a groomer. If youre willing to put the time in to work hard and learn quickly, you can probably go to academy in a year, maybe less if they have the space and youre good. Be patient. Its worth it."
good,My experience at PetSmart was very fun I was a early morning stocker and cashier and they actually taught me a lot about how to handle money and how to operate a cashier and how to stock merchandise how to do a lot in the beginning of my work experience as a 17 year old kid I feel that was one good job I actually could of stayed at forever but nothing last forever but all in all thumbs up to PetSmart.
good,"A typical work day revolves around pet care and customer service. I learned how to work in a team when taking care of animals in the store and how to handle animals brought to the store. Management was great and very flexible with scheduling. The hardest yet most enjoyable aspect of the job was working with the animals, as you learn the many different ways to take care of them."
good,"Each day was a fairly good day learned a lot about replenishment"
good,"I really enjoyed my time with PetSmart. The customers and their pets were awesome. The employees were awesome to work with too. It's just very difficult to keep everything maintained and all systems running if you are a non-salaried manager. And you are not given many hours to keep the store staffed either. Otherwise, I would recommend PetSmart any day as a great place to work!"
good,"Great place to work! Upbeat environment and so much room to grow, especially if you wish to climb the corporate ladder. Highly recommend working here if you have a passion for animals, and are eager to help educate customers!"
good,"I started working here after I turned 18, I love the work environment and also love the management. It was a really fun job and I wish I could’ve stayed they just didn’t have the hours I needed. Really easy, and fun and you get a hang around with little animals every day. What more could you ask for!! They are so keep up with your raises and how well you do at work it makes you feel really appreciated."
good,"I love pet smart a lot, especially in LA but it really depends what management you get. Sometimes people get and ego trip and its no fun to go to work. Other places its a wonderful time and you love working almost like your not working.Grooming was the best, I cant speak for different jobs in the stores."
good,Managers are friendly and understanding. Work hours are flexible and you can train on other departments. The best part is seeing cute dogs and other animals.
good,I managed a PetSmart before it went private. I cannot say what the culture and work is like today. But it was amazing pre-buyout. The employee turnover was nonexistent.
good,Petsmart is a productive place to work but it is also a fun place to work. They have a great schedule with associates working 3-4 days a week. Starting pay is $13 depending on the department you are in
good,It's great experience to learn how to become a groomer by starting as bather  and working your way up. There's room for advancement and great knowledge about products and services for the pets. You learn to sell the best for the pets and bond with many dogs . It's great learning experience in the corporate world and policies and safety procedures for the pets. You learn to do the best for the customer and there pets.
good,"Although weekends got pretty busy, I wouldn't say an average day was super busy. And by busy I mean customer busy. On the slow days I would clean any fish tanks that need it, that was most of how I spent my shifts. There always seemed to be another tank that was dirty. Throughout even my worst shifts I think all the the whole team was always trying to help eachother. I think we communicated very well on where we needed to be and where someone was needed for customer service and ect. As petcare specialist I take any returns. Petsmart has a 14 day health guarantee. So no matter what reason we took in returned pets. This was the worst part of the job. I hated seeing the animals I helped care for and maybe got a bit attatched to come back dead. I wish there was not such a big return policy because half the time I did not want to give the said customers another pet. My favorite part of working here other than greeting all the dogs and their owners, is closing or opening. This is when I would handle the animals the most. Checking on them and trying to reasure them that being handled was not the worst thing in the world."
good,"I learned a lot at PetSmart about canine behavior, hard goods and pet food, and customer service. The management at my location was good."
good,"I love PetSmart all the people that I work with are wonderful and helpful. It was a great experience to learn about animals and working here, it got me to put my dog on a better food, so thank you. However, with my pay I cannot move out on my own."
good,"I enjoy the work I do at petsmart and take it as a great opportunity to teach people about animals and their proper care.Some days they expect a lot to get done in short amounts of time while also trying to assist customers. I do not like leaving things unfinished. Raises are very minimal, the discount could be better."
good,The only reason I wont quit this job is simply my love for the animals. I would do anything for animals in need. The Job itself is INCREDIBLY TOUGH. Its something that must be completely thought out if you wish to join the salon  work force.
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work, the coworkers are all friendly and helpful. everyone gets along, if you do not know something you can go to anyone that works in your area for help."
good,Did enjoy working here temporarily. Cowrokers were fun and interesting to work with. Didn't have any problems with management. Pay was pretty fair and could bring my own dogs in to bathe for free. Got discounts at any PetSmart location. Can be really stressful at times as a bather because bathers must take all walk-ins and normally there is only one bather there at a time. Manager was great and I really enjoyed working there.
good,"In a typical day of I would manage the in-store inventory by stocking the shelves. I learned a lot about the product, the purchasing and ordering system, and time management. The workplace culture was laid back, stressful at times, but very enjoyable. The employees were dedicated and focused and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was controlling the inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the other employees."
good,I was hired on as a Merchandise manager and worked my way up to store manager. The hardest part of the job was the specialty area of the small animals. Otherwise I enjoyed the job very much.
good,"All I did was take care of cute dogs and get paid for it. Sometimes the dogs sucked, but you always find a couple and become best friends with them. It was great."
good,"depends on your store, but the managers and staff at my location are amazing. Great pay in the grooming salon, and they send you to grooming academy where you are trained to become a groomer and you get paid:)"
good,"My typical day would be restock shelves, unload trucks, customer service, assign work to other stockers, gather shopping carts from parking lots. I learned how to care for many animals, leadership skills, and how to work as a team. Most the work was easy, only difficult part would be cleaning up the animals mess if you don't have the stomach for it, and working with the interns who were all high school students. Some just don't listen. The actual employees were all fun and easy to work with. The managers were awesome always took care of us, never to mean as long as we did the jobs they gave us."
good,The manager was a good and honest man. I was always hwppy to get there. The crew made you want to work harder. They offered benefits that were inexpensive.
good,"Not a bad place to work. I have been there for over 6 years (5 of which were spent as an associate, the rest in management). A great group of people to be around. I have learned so much about animal nutrition and being able to solve customer problems about their pets. I have learned valuable communication and customer service skills that I will take with me forever. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with unrealistic corporate expectations. Management can be rewarding but its not always a walk in the park. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is the animals by far! I love being able to go into work every day knowing that I get to see some really cool animals and help people find solutions and products that will help their pets. It's all about the pets!!"
good,"The management stands above all in employee appreciation, training and life's unexpected challenges."
good,"Very fun place to work great people customers. Laid back management but able to get the job done, Very quick paced working environment. Very warm and welcoming staff"
good,"pretty good place to work not horrible not great, I wouldn't say that this is a place for a career rather a good temp job or a job while you are in school."
good,Working for a place that has constant people in and out of the store really keeps you on your toes. You learn to multi task helping multiple customers at once while also still performing your job duties.
good,"I definitely enjoyed working at Petsmart, management was very kind and helpful in answering any questions I had in the beginning. Relaxed work environment, great place to work if you have love for animals of all sorts."
good,"Everyday you are met with different questions from different customers and sometimes you just don't know the answer so it is great to be able to learn with the customer and gain that knowledge. It's also very rewarding when you can help a customer with anyone questions they have regarding their pets, especially when they are new pet parents."
good,"Very busy days, Learned proper grooming techniques and pet anatomy, management is extremely understand and helps a lot, depending on the store you're at the culture can get very overwhelming, time management in a busy salon, the coworkers i get to see often"
good,I liked everything about PetSmart I just hate the long hours. I love to work long hours but not constantly everyday 6and 7 hours a week 14 sometimes 15-16 hours a day.i don't like never having a weekend off. My only off days was thru the week and I only had 1 day off sometimes never.
good,Petmart loves pets. Sometimes it means that they don't stick up for the employees and take the customers side. Working for Petsmart is a great way to be able to meet like minded pet lovers.
good,PetSmart was a good place to begin a grooming career. Working with multiple groomers with different years of experience and lots to learn from. I was able to begin my grooming career with them and enjoyed furthering my experience.
good,"This job was enjoyable.  I started as a part-time employee, worked very hard in several areas of the store, and was offered a full-time position because of it.  Pay could be better, but its' retail."
good,While I was volunteering here it definitely gives you good hours at the adopt a thon usually about 4 to 5 hours and that goes to my volunteer hours for school.  Great work environment and it's clean.
good,"Slow-high traffic/customers, learned a lot about the nutrients and ingredients food, specifically about pets. Management is great. Workplace culture is great. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of animals, not very hard, co-workers are very sweet and helpful."
good,I loved working here. The co-workers and the relationships you build with the pet parents are really nice. The breaks are fair and the busy days aren't so bad if you just stay focused. I miss here and would love to work here again!
good,Great work place and the best people in management. I love he fact that they take time and give out care cards to acknowledge the hard work we all our doing to make it a great place to come and shop.
good,"Overall Petsmart was a fun place to work, if you don't mind talking with customers about their pets. The environment was friendly I enjoyed working there"
good,"While its wonderful being able to work at petsmart and around all the animals and you will be learning something new about them everyday,  you will run into someone who knows nothing of pets on a daily basis and will have to teach them how to properly care for their pet, while most pet parents are caring for their pet properly many don't and will look to you for guidance on how to"
good,"Petsmart was a pretty cool place to work I worked evenings, made some great friends some I am still friends with to this day. work was fun because I was picking and packing things for customers for their pets or horses."
good,"I have not worked in retail before and this was a different experience;  however, I have to admit that this could not have been a better company to start. Petsmart is the best job I have had in a long time that I feel excited to come to work and love it. The management are great at what they do and care for all their employees and get to know each and every one but also maintaining their professionalism. The job work is never hard and anyone who is dedicated to their work can complete all task assigned to them. They make sure that all their employees have learned all the necessary information so that we can better assist the pet parents. The co-workers are friendly and welcoming. The managers do a great job at picking the best for the company."
good,"Would go into work and check how many appointments booked for the day. Check in customers and promote sales. If slow would do call log list. Groom dogs, go out on sales floor to promote marketing. General cleaning."
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work.  They understand the meaning of family and the importance of life balance,  They have a wonderful charities team that puts a strong love of animals' before profit. They care about their customers and continue to improve the ease of the customer experience both in stores and on-line.  The associates are great and have a very high work ethic. "
good,"I loved working here! I especially loved being able to provide complete grooming services for my clients, as well as being able to accommodate every individual pets needs within a timely manner!"
good,"For the amount of work I did, I felt slightly underpaid. There were always plenty of duties to be done. There were just the right amount of breaks. The other employees were for the most part nice and helpful. I was never asked to do unreasonable tasks."
good,Everyone here was nice to work with specially in the grooming salon. The management was great. I worked in grooming and on the floor.
good,"The management makes this a great place to work. We have fun as we do our assigned tasks, and it truly feels like a family you work with, and not just random people. Even the pet parents become family. We have so many regulars, and their dogs and cats become your extended family. I love everything about the job, and especially love the opportunity I have to work with the different animals we have at the store. The company principles are awesome, and they have helped so many animals find great forever homes through their charity program. The only difficult thing is getting out of bed at 3 am on my early days!"
good,"I personally loved working for this company because I love animals so much. I was able to wake up, go to work, and see adorable animals."
good,"Coming into work and making people and their pets smile is a day to day achievement. The management listens to your needs and helps you reach your goals. I have amazing co-workers that lift you up when you are down and celebrate with you when you achieve something great. To me, the hardest part of the job is making sure every customer leaves happy and coming back."
good,"I started out being a pet care specialist, I would come into work check the charts to see who needed to be fed, walked, bathed who was checking out, who just checked in...etc. I would go into playrooms with them and play with them and stop any aggressive behavior, put them back in their kennels, clean up after them, check who needs meds, clean the empty used kennels at the end of the day."
good,"Working in the grooming salon requires a lot of work but it's worth it. Sometimes there are dogs that are hyper, aggressive, or too scared to function, but if you love animals, you'll love this job. Sometimes the animals are frustrating but you just have to remember they're someone's baby and you'll have patience again. It's rewarding because you can easily move up in the company and acquire a career, you get employee discounts, and you acquire priceless knowledge. PetSmart genuinely cares about it's employees and all animals. it funds charities and has adoption days quite often. I wish I had never left, I miss it so much!"
good,petsmart is a great place to work! Everyone including the customers are wonderful to be around. Management cares about your well being and development.Fellow associates all work as a team and are outgoing. Customers are always welcomed with smiles and give them right back.
good,"If you love pets, people, and have great customer service skills then this is def. the place for you. Like with any job the people you work with can define the work environment. In this case sometimes the management can be inexperienced and only be in their position because of the time they been with the company or who they know despite their ability to manage."
good,Good culture and enjoyable workplace. Alot to learn and be accountable for with a large payoff. It takes alot to maintain pet health.
good,"Enjoyed the relationships you build with Pet Parents. Very rewarding career. I have learned many skills that I utilize in my personal life. I have worked with some amazing people, and have enjoyed working with them as a team."
good,"Love working with people and animals. Great management, and overall fun environment to work in. Just wish they gave more hours."
good,"A typical day consisted of all tank maintenance for the assigned animal group that day(birds, small animals, reptiles, fish, etc.), morning or night feedings of all the animals(if opening or closing shift), assisting customers with any questions they may have regarding pet care information or pet product recommendations, opening cages to let interested customers interact with the animals, catching fish and crickets, cleaning and restocking all pet care supplies, and running the cash register. I learned tons of background information on a variety of animals and animal care products in order to provide the best customer service possible. My managers were the best. They were very understanding, helpful, constructive, and genuinely had my best interest in mind. All of my co-workers were great as well. The hardest or worst part of the job was having to cover cashier shifts when we were short our normal cashiers. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting excited new pet owners with the perfect pet for them!"
good,"Having helped out in several other PetSmarts, the store in Fairless Hills, PA definitely had the best management team (myself included). I have given feedback that the salon managers in high volume salons should not have to groom and/or have an assistant manager, which PetSmart is now working on putting into place!"
good,"I was fortunate enough to be part of the opening crew of a brand new store in my town. The Crew we have is amazing, our management is fantastic, and we've got a brand new store to call our own. Primary responsibilities are taking care all of the animals in store and selling as many Puppy Kits and Moss Balls as you can. I work in the PetCare Department which can be stressful at times but rewarding when you have down time with some of the critters in store. The Chameleons like to rest on my shoulder and we take a few trips around the store to finish opening duties which is pretty cool. (Playing with the Cats is awesome too!) While our in store management is fantastic, I just feel like whoever designs the stores has no idea what it's like to be a PetCare associate. Everything looks nice... until we go to use it. The designs of the Tank system, Cat Adoptions, and Small Animal Habitats are all aesthetically pleasing... functionality wise... very poor."
good,"-Oversee that associates are being productive with daily tasks."
good,"At work I'd spend time helping other groomers and bathers to finish their dogs as well as finish mine. I learned many skills. Such as time management, team work, people skills. Management is good, though it can be slightly difficult trying to find the right manager to talk to about a problem. My co-workers are great people we laugh have fun talk about all things all the while getting the job done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with certain people and dogs. The most enjoyable part are repeat dogs that everyone loves to see because they want to be there and love on everybody"
good,"The company itself is a pretty great place to work for, you get to see and meet new and old pet parents and help them really understand their pet better. Management is pretty good as far as not always being on your case and really trusting you unless you give them reason not to. The worst part of the job is the inconsistency in policy and procedure. Every manager kinda has their own idea on what they think return policy should be. The best part is that if you have a great team like I did you all will get along super well and a lot of times it doesn't really feel like work."
good,PetSmart is a fast paced environment with fun energetic associates.  I've always loved animals and PetSmart gave me the opportunity to learn many skills in the animal care industry.  The opportunities for career advancement are excellent.  I started as a cashier and was promoted to pet trainer in my first year of employment.  I currently work as a dog groomer.
good,"PetSmart is a family oriented place that is great to work for.  They are accommodating with schedules for employees that are working and attending college.  I have learned a lot from my co-workers and the management at this job, and have been trained in every aspect of the work environment."
good,"If you want a rewarding career that loves you back, then apply at PetSmart! It is a fun place to work and shop!"
good,"Very busy"
good,"A typical day for me consists of assisting and connecting with customers, facing, feeding animals and giving them fresh water, pet sales, fish sales, bagging crickets, and cleaning."
good,"it was a great place to work. great animals. great experience. great petparents. just need to multi task a lot, be able to work with no supervision sometimes, and handle customers and people."
good,PetSmart is the first job that I've actually looked forward to going everyday. I have worked at various other retailers and this is by far the most rewarding. I would say mostly because of the animals.
good,"Whether you want a fulfilled part time job or are looking for that career path you've always dreamed of, Petsmart is an excellent choice.  From friendly staff to help you if you need help."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this position with PetSmart. Learning how to care for small animals such as Hamsters, Guinea Pigs, Snakes, Turtles and Fish was a real treat- and I got paid for it! The environment was always maintained by staff and there is a real sense of teamwork here."
good,"A typical day would start by getting the shelves stocked, pets cages cleaned and rallying the associates to achieve a common goal.  I learned about how to properly care for many types of pets especially about pet nutrition.  As a Manager, I learned the importance of communication and getting associate buy-in.  As a leader you cannot be successful by yourself, you have to build an aligned team.  Co-workers are very supportive and are willing to help.  The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain a good work/life balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is promoting an associate that you mentored to the next level."
good,Challenging and fun company to work for. I learned a lot to help in future career.
good,"as an early morning stock associate, I think it's a nice place to work, the co-workers are good folks, open minded, and great to work around."
good,"A nice beautiful job this was, i had an amazing experience working for the pets and there parents."
good,Working here was a good job. I got a raise every six months and I was able to train in other departments.
good,My job at petsmart was great i got to work with dogs and wash them for pet owners. I also got the chance to goto grooming school and learn everything a person needs to know to groom dogs by doing it at school for a month.
good,"A typical day at work for me depends on the position that day if it is GSA I handle paper work, reservations and check in or out customers. If I work as a PCS I work one on one with the dogs or cats."
good,PETSMART is a nice place to work. stores are all ran the same its organized. its not as customer friendly as it was and pay roll was cut but who hasnt cut payroll these days. its great working with animals and helping people with thier pets. they spend alot of money on training employees. promotions within friendly.
good,"I've been working at Petsmart a little under a year, but the people there are like my family. We always have good times, and since it's a small store, we have gotten to have a great relationship with all of our customers. We know all the animals by their names the second they walk in the store. We have music playing 24/7. Everyone is friendly, outgoing and it can be a lot of fun at times. A lot of hard work goes into making this store look the way it does. We want customers to feel that every day they come in, the store looks like it just opened, and I feel we succeed in that. We make them feel welcome, and at home when they come in the store and always make sure they leave happy. We love animals and make sure that every day we remember that, while yes it's about the pet parents and making them happy, but at the end of the day, it's all about the Pet's, because those little guys are our best friends."
good,The work was never difficult and often rewarding. The people were especially nice. Overall I would highly recommend this job as part-time work for anyone looking.
good,I loved working for PetSmart! If I could have found my position over here I would have just transferred over. The only downside was the early mornings.
good,"Petsmart is an amazing experience. Fast paced, pay is good, paid time off and flexible with your schedule. They take great care of their employees and customers"
good,I love working here. I always look forward to going to work! The people are friendly and I am always lucky enough to learn new tasks. I would always recommend working at PetSmart!
good,"Working in the PetsHotel is tedious after the holidays, I love all of my coworkers and all the furriends I’ve made there. My store manager is really cool and so is the PetsHotel manager, they’re very lenient on phones but don’t be on it too much."
good,"I really enjoyed working for PetSmart. Some stores are better then others, but the store i worked at last was amazing and the people cared about pets."
good,If you are an animal person then this job is for you. Pet smart has a very friendly environment. With great people and a great management team. I would recommend this positions to any animal lover.
good,"Most of the associates I work with feel underpaid and overworked."
good,"As a sales associate, I was mostly in charge of the cash register as well as exchanges and returns. It was not a difficult job but they do expect you to work hard, as with any job. I do wish that I could have gotten more involved in the animal care aspects of the job."
good,"petsmart was my favorite place to work by far, I was on the register daily ready for customers while working around areas making sure they wee clean and orderly. the management was good and the other employees were great to work with. the hardest part of the job I would pick would be having to take on many tasks when I needed to be on the register."
good,Petsmart was actually my first job ever. I was 18 at the time just graduated and it was an 2 hour bus ride from where i lived. It was cool i learned a bit and my co-workers were super nice and we actually had lunch break.
good,I am retired so for me it was fun working at Pet Smart.  Would recommend it highly for someone looking for part-time work.  I was a cashier.  I liked helping the customers.  There wasn't anything hard about working at Pet Smart.
good,"Great place to work if you love animals. Always opportunities to cross train in a variety of positions. Genuine people, positive attitudes and great motto."
good,"I work in the grooming salon so I'm not sure how it is in the rest of the store. They started me as a bather and within months I was going to groom school. They pay for school as well, though you do have to sign a 2 year contract with the company. The job can be stressful but if you love dogs it's a ton of fun. There's room to make a lot of money off of commissions, too."
good,"I worked in the Small Animals Department. On a typical work day you would stock product, clean fish tanks, and other animal cages. You would also help customers learn about the animal that they where going to buy, and make sure that they had the proper stuff for them."
good,"I like the people I work with. The store managers are great and easy to get along with. They let you know if your doing a good job ,which keeps the morally up!"
good,You really get to help people care for their animals and you can see that with all of the staff. Everyone is so passionate and helpful. 9/10 would recommend.
good,"In the Merchandise Inventory Leader (MIL) position it is constantly changing and new things keep getting added on to our plates as the company begins to further develop. We have been all about ""task elimination"" but it is far from that case. It has been nothing more than creating more tasks for the MIL and adding more workload with less payoffs. It's a great place to work but as you move further up this particular roll in the store is the hardest one possible. It involves taking care of the entire store, presentation of it, inventory management, price management, ordering product, on top of other management duties."
good,I was only working at petsmart for 5 monthes before I was promoted to associate lead with keys. Petsmart is a great place to work if you like fast paced and competitive work environments.
good,"Did my job well. Good company to work for, they care about there employees, unfortunately was laid off to cut backs. But an over all good company to work for"
good,"The management team is always there to help you, when you require it. Not so bad productivity rates. Free food during holidays is always a plus. Sometimes the music is bad taste."
good,"Managers are kind, work is fast pace but not grueling, fellow associates are polite, customers are easy-going, but pay and hours are limited as well as ""moving up"" in the company. It would be a good part time job for a high school kid, but it does not pay the bill for a person with college debt and everyday bills that need paid. You can apply for 28 hours a week, but that does not guarantee you will get scheduled for a full 28 every week; corporate can cut hours without notice, so budgeting can be difficult when your paycheck is not consistent."
good,Great company that provides excellent training and upward movement opportunities. Good benefit package which also includes employee pets health care. Caring company that provides opportunities to get involved with the community and give back to families and pets.
good,"I enjoy working at PetSmart and my time there as a Pet Stylist has been very educational and enjoyable. "
good,"This was overall a great experience for me especially a my first job PetSmart was definitely a place to get used to, learning different ways to work like the register and stocking and gathering carts at closing was definitely something to get used to, especially being in high school at the time. Overall a good experience working here."
good,Petsmart is a fast paced environment that always keeps you on your toes.  It promotes confidence and courtesy with customers and co-workers alike.  They always put quality over quantity.
good,"fun place to work with great people"
good,PetSmart has provided me with tons of great opportunities and has helped me grow as a person as well as professionally. Everyone is always super friendly and gives 200% to whatever they've got on their plates.
good,The job is great and the customers are the best. Only thing I would say was bad is that the managers have their favorite workers and make it known.
good,Petsmart DC is a great place to work.  The management has a pro associate philosophy.  As a supervisor the work was not stressful and I had plenty of time with my family.
good,great company for advancement opportunities. just got bought out.  lots of changes.  company stratigies and alot of layoffs.  not sure of its future.
good,Petsmart is a great place to expand your knowledge of pets and customer service. The management is very supportive and everyone feels part of the team. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping customers find the perfect pet and educating them on how to make their new pet comfortable and settled into their forever home.
good,"Great people to work with, just not considerate of your schedule. I didn't really have many problems with anyone or anything in this job, just that there wasn't much opportunity for growth."
good,"Working in the grooming salon you do meet a lot of new friends. A typical day as a bather would be to look at your schedule of dogs coming in, making sure you stay on time with dogs coming in and out, answering phones, taking walk in services, and reminder calls for next day appointments. I came into the company not knowing anything and now I know how to properly cut and grind a dogs nails, express glands, and the safety precautions of working with animals. You're co-workers and managers become your second family, but I have heard horror stories from other stores of employees not getting along."
good,"If there’s one thing I have learned for fact working at Petsmart is that time management can make or break you. It took me trial and error to figure out key things to mastering time management. It became almost critical to work at a faster pace, because anything can happen at any given time which could possibly slow me down. Under a great deal of stress it can become increasingly difficult to finish my work. In order to compensate for lost time I would have to utilize any and all tools given to me, example is asking for help from other associates. Of course nothing goes without payment and I’d be sure to offer up any of my free time to help out other associates when they need a helping hand."
good,"Cashier at front of store and helped customers upon need. "
good,"Started as a pet care associate and worked my way up to management. Very good pay, especially for retail, Good customers. Hours are slightly less than desirable though. 6am opening shifts for pet care, 2-3am opening shifts for stocking."
good,"I love my job it is upbeat and the people i work with but i need something with better benefits and better money. I would love something that revolves around sales and working with people. The best part of my job would be working with people. And getting to know different things about people. The hardest part of my job is working with some of the people that do not understand the rules that are made by our managers about there pets staying with us. My management is great my managers are great people that listen to what we need and what our problems are, and what we would like to be changed. I have learned many things working in the sales world working with the people. I am a very organized person, some say a little to organized. My typical day at work would be working with the people and getting to take a care of the amazing pets practically there children. Its amazing getting to see people so attached to there animals and taking care of them the way they do. All together i love working with people and helping them get the care and respect they deserve and earned."
good,"my job is not a job, it is a joy to train pets and their pet parents to make sure they have forever homes and are not turned into a shelter. It is my love and compassion I have for people and animals that drives me everyday! I have learned more about life from the dogs I have trained and also making their owners more aware of how to enjoy their pets and be responsible pet owners. My co-workers are wonderful, we are all team players, in work and in life. I find the most difficult part of my job is when a long time client tells me of the loss of their pet, I grieve with them because of the relationships that we build through the years. I am now training second and third generation dogs with the same clients due to the relationships that we have built together."
good,"A typical day at work at PetSmart consisted of cashiering and stocking between customers. I learned how to balance tasks without compromising customer service and how to close a store at night. "
good,"Working with this company has been one of the best experiences I've had working. It has been an excellent job while I've been in school, because the hours are so flexible, and within the first year I was promoted from a simple cashier position to a trainer. This position allows me to utilize the things I've studied by letting me work with people in a way no other job has ever allowed. I get to study their behaviors and help them adjust those behaviors to better suit the needs of their pets and help in the forming of forever bonds. I get to utilize my knowledge of psychology and behavioral sciences every day. Which is exciting and fun."
good,"The best of my job was able to see all the happy dogs and able to help the clients with their needs. "
good,"PetSmart is a very easy going company. As it grow it has to learn to adapt to how fast its growing without overburdening their employees and still providing the best customer service I have seen a store provide.  I love the closeness of our team and we all contribute something different to our departments.  Every departments has its pros and cons, but for the morning crew at times it becomes hard when too many ""tasks"" are due in one day.  But as the company grows I am sure the company will improve the communication between corporate departments to ensure the easiest flow for the retail stores."
good,making sure each order was picked accurately . inspect each order and dock number
good,"Good company, everyone works as a team. If you like to help people learn about new pets or the pets they currently have this would be a great place to work. "
good,"Physically demanding job with long shifts, but you feel appreciated by the company, and they always make sure to do what they can to help out the surrounding communities. Pay is very good for the type of job and area. Management is professional and pleasant to work with. "
good,A typical dayis always fun and full of laughter being able to get to know so many customers and their pets is wonder report. I learn every day we have excellent co workers and the management staff just do a super job. Interacting with all the pets is most enjoyable for me.
good,I had a great experience working here. The management team all clicked just right to keep a fun and energetic workplace for the employees. Pay and benefits were a plus but the ability to advance so quickly was the best of all for me. I was a bath and brush doing grooming type work and if it wasn't for needed to relocate due to unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances I would have went to their grooming school program. Will always see as one of my favorite places to have worked.
good,Happy customers and friendly staff. Fulfilling job helping pet owners learn about products & helping their animals live a long and happy life.
good,"This place is an excellent place to work if you enjoy animals. prefer a job with a lot of social interaction, and like to be busy throughout your entire workday."
good,"The people i worked with plus the customers that came in, made it easier to have a good attitude when clocking into my shift. Management was always easy to talk to and open to questions. They never gave me something that i couldn't handle and if i couldn't do it alone there was always a helping hand nearby."
good,"Compaired to all my other jobs I've had Petsmart is one of the best. Very little drama, they make sure you get enough breaks so you're not exhausted and dreading work. Management is absolutely fabulous, it's so nice having people you know will have your back as leads and management. I go to school and work 30 hours a week, they are very understanding of my college schedule. ITS very much a team environment, I absolutely lover my team."
good,This was a great first job for me! I loved seeing all the animals and the customers were great as well! I very much enjoyed my time working for this company! Very relaxing job!
good,"Typical day at work - Teamwork is paramount because it gets very busy. Following the regimented tasks helps keep the confusion down, but there is still a never-ending amount of havoc in retail with limited staff. We all make it through. "
good,Petsmart is a great company work with I would highly recommend them to anybody That atmosphere is very fun to work and the people are great I would definitely recommend this company to anybody to work for they are very family orientated and just all-around a great place
good,Everyone who I have worked with was rather laid-back in terms of personality. They are hard-working though. Through PetSmart I was able to gain a lot of knowledge about all the pets in our care as well as dog and cat food.
good,"i worked here seasonally, but the management  was organized and knowledgeable, staff were helpful and practical. Fair hours and reasonable but lengthy training. the grooming area was very small and the A/C didnt work which was a big issue, having up to 30 dogs in a 40sqfoot area with 6 groomers and tools, customers in and out ect it was hectic but everyone did the best they could. i enjoyed the hard work and thrived in problem solving."
good,I really enjoyed my time at PetSmart. I worked at 2 different stores and everyone was very friendly. Employees get discounts on everything in the store and it made taking care of my pets when I was having trouble financially very easy.
good,Working here has been great! Love all the people and pets here. Everyone is super nice and the customers are absolutely great! I would suggest working here to anyone.
good,it was a veyr fast paced envoriment haveing to care for 20 to 150 dogs daily. It enhances the love and care for animals. the manegment is excellent and get the job done.
good,Working at petsmart was amazing. Many of the other employees are college aged but all are very knowledgeable in their respective fields. Hours are short but you have the possibility to work other peoples shifts. Overall an amazing work experience.
good,"It was a cool job, I ran into a lot of enjoyment everyday and learned much more about animals. Also I was able to work another job with this one. The were very lenient and understanding."
good,As a manager in any retail establishment you have your good days and bad days but seeing the animals that would come in would brighten up anyone's day.
good,"good company to work for with chances to move up, they recently went private which in my opinion makes PetSmart a much better company to work for. I enjoyed being able to interact with the animals."
good,the typical day working at Petsmart is always something new everyday. I learned how to handle different types of animals and how to count inventory. the location was well managed i would work there again if asked the I worked with were great people and very friendly. The hardest part of the job was the over night shifts (9 p.m - 5 a.m) I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to all the different customers that came in and helping them out with what they needed.
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work for. There is always opportunities to learn things that excel your chances of "
good,"The pay was great, and the company works with your schedule especially if you're in school. Management was great, and every day was a competition to see who ""rocked"" the best. Hardest part of the job for me were the summer days with no air conditioner in a factory!"
good,"I enjoyed working for this company I just wanted them to work with me on going to school."
good,"• Greet customers as they arrive at the store and provide them with information about products and/or services"
good,"Petsmart has been nothing but good to me since I have started. My mangers are great; they listen, help and push me to be better than I already am. I get along great with all my co workers, and we all look out for each other if someone needs help. I love being able to help customers take the best care they can for their pets and being able to connect and make relationships with them."
good,"I enjoyed Petsmart, I was primarily in the aquatic/small animals department and in charge of monitoring aquarium chemical levels and ordering fish and such. I also cleaned and took care of all the small animals including, but not limited to feeding, watering, medicating."
good,Interactions with pets is the best part of working for petsmart!
good,"Took their time to train me with bathing and grooming dogs.  If there was a dog that made you feel nervous or uncomfortable, you didn't have to groom them!"
good,"A typical work day is helping where needed. I have learned to be a Teacher's Assistant at YWCA, Young Women's Christain Association in Flint, Michigan. I worked with 3 year olds and some days with school aged students with homework, meal, lunches and some entertainment as policy of YWCA. I have also started my own business called My Special Promise. I have learned to ship and receive and stock shelves for customers to buy. I even set up a couple of deliveries to their house special orders. I am going back to school for Management in Retail Enterprise with a minor in Human Resource and Development. The hardest part of the job is not knowing when to come in as hours change weekly. The most enjoyable part of the job is looking at customers faces smiling as they leave."
good,The managers are amazing and do their best everyday. I can definitely say that the hardest part of the job is the customers.  They show no mercy to any employee.
good,"I worked for this company for 4 years. Within my time at Petsmart I learned to be a dog groomer at there academy. I highly recommend working for this company if you're interested in working with animals and would like to work in a ever growing clientele based job. It is fast paced, and they offer opportunities to advance in the company."
good,"A pro employee company with excellent benefits. "
good,Working at PetSmart was good experience. The management is unorganized and lazy but they were really cool and chill. They treat their animals very well and they care a lot.
good,Fun place to work. Learned something new everyday. Customer service and sales driven. Crew was great to work with and always very helpful. I was a cashier most days. Sometimes I would help with stocking or assisting customers on the floor.
good,Hardest part of the job was assisting rude customers. Managers were great. I only worked less than 20 hours per week and was able to deal with animals.
good,Was hard work but enjoyed it. People were easy to get along with. Pay was good. Clean place . Very warm in the summer . They treated us to lunch often to show appreciation
good,Great environment and staff. Easy to move up to management if you work for it. Always worked around my personal life to make my schedule work. Highly recommend for students.
good,great place to work plenty of opportunity to advance. management was very flexible when working with my schedule. also had great benefits and team work environment was very friendly .
good,"A typical day at work here was mostly filled with not only stocking inventory on the shelves in the store, but also taking any overstock and putting it into the inventory room. it was also filled with assisting customers with any questions or concerns, and keeping the store clean."
good,it was a very interesting job I would actually recommend it to students/teens across the globe. if you can get the right team that is.
good,"a typical work day, difficulte and productive"
good,not a place for me. i don't like being a cashier its not enough for me. i want a better purpose in life this job lost me. i left because my car whet down.
good,"Its okay just don't expect to much. You work at your own pace, either way they don't really care as long as you show up. I work hard but its not a requirement at all."
good,"as a bather i had so much fun working there, just be prepared to get soaked in soap and water and get snapped at a few times. its a great work environment when you have the right people working around you"
good,Nobody really back each other when it came to products being distributed and to many chiefs not enough Indians. They would confuse each other n the rest of the people working there there was no communication between managers.
good,"I loved working at petsmart, the co workers and managers were very friendly. Cleaning up and restocking the sales floor and ringing up customers made the days go by fast."
good,"Management was usually good, work well with schedule. Coworkers are helpful, it was a laid back job on weekdays. Stressful on weekends. Customers were not usually hard."
good,I worked as a Pet Trainer at another location for over two years. I transferred and the management at my new location was absolutely horrible. I loved my job and took a pay cut to be a Pet Trainer. After the transfer I was miserable. Management is key. Otherwise the company is GREAT! Training dogs is GREAT! Dealing with micromanagers is HORRIBLE.
good,I loved learning about grooming dogs and all the different processes that in order to get the perfect groom. The problem was only a certian amount of hours they had to split between bathers resulting in me only getting 10 hours a week.
good,I loved the animals and the regular customers. Its like working in a tiny zoo. It is a surprisingly technical job for all of the little details you must know about various animals.
good,"Company cared more about your safety than your production, which made me feel great knowing that. Management was decent and did bbq's for employees and raffles and bonuses when deserved"
good,typical day vat work would be stocking n cashier when i originally applied for dog bather n they had me doing everything but that but other then that it was a very nice place to work with including the animals
good,Educating customers about animals in the store. Help maintain a clean work environment. Working with animals is great! Its enjoyable to work with people who enjoy the same things you do.
good,"- The day drags, when you only get 1 dog a day to groom."
good,"I had a lot of fun learning at working for petsmart, most of the time there was a great atmosphere and great coworkers. "
good,"The tasks for this job are wonderful! Constantly learning and growing. Unfortunately the management team is quite, blase. Couldn't care less, unless if it personally involved them."
good,"pet-smart as a whole wants you to grow within their organization, they want to see you move up and grow. the bather life is stressful because the shop and shop manager expects you to perform 11 tasks at one time"
good,"My experience working with dogs all day is a dream come true. I learned responsibility, time management. The hardest part is dealing with over protective pet parents. Most enjoyable part is the time spent with 15 dogs in a room."
good,"Assisting with questions and answers about pet supplies and pets. Stocking of shelves, Taking of fish inventory when it come in. Cleaning of fish tanks"
good,"I came from an amazing store in AK and then transferred to one in TX the store manager could not care less about his employees and that in turn makes his employees not care about the store at all. It looks very unorganized, employees walk around with their phones out, eat food while helping customers, don't ask customers for help unless they come and ask for it first. All this would not have happened at my first store. The experience really varies by store."
good,"I loved my job with PetSmart. I got to work with dogs all day, and make the pet parents very happy.  I managed to gain a lot of regular clients while I was at PetSmart. My co-workers were great and we always had fun while we were at work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the high volume of dogs that needed to be bathed and groomed."
good,Had a pleasant time there while I was there. I like working with animals. Was fair and just most of the time.
good,"Customer Service, Cashier, Overnight Stock, Price changes, Ordering"
good,"Going into work at Petsmart was one of my favorite jobs ever. I started out as a stocker then became Lead stocker after 4 months, that was until I hurt my back in when I was out at training in my guard unit.Then I was transferred into the petcare department and learned about fish and hamsters. I learned all the needs of the animals in that department. I was already a bird specialist as I bred them for several years, so I became the expert on every animal we carried. I still am more knowledgeable about animals to this day. I was trained in learning how to do epog's ( electronic planograms) which was very easy and I began to do them frequently and very often. I was a stickler for presentation and wanted to go into that position, but was denied several times from having an upfront attitude.I didn't sugar coat things like most people do. The hardest part of working for this company was there time management. They did not give the proper scheduling for customer service in certain areas of the store that was necessary to keep customers satisfied with their needs.The manager was never there enough to see what was needed for the weekly schedule.It was hard being the only one in the section when you had fifteen people waiting to be helped for live fish, crickets, hamsters, etc. The complaining on staff happened quite often and was not changed. It wasn't the complaining on the person in the section it was for the understaffing of the section itself. I did like and get along with all my co-workers, but yet there is always one you don't get along with. I had became Lead in my section after"
good,"I got horrible hours and got randomly 2 weeks off. Couldn't pay my bills with the kind of hours I got. I do not recommend the Independence, MO location for that reason, especially for the seasonal postition"
good,Used forklift to stock store and unload truck pallets they have very nice people working thier I love their grooming and training station plus their all linked to one another
good,"great company, poor health benefit options and poor management. otherwise a decent place to be for a few years.The company doesn't really check into associates as much as they should."
good,"loved being around the pets. easy to get along with co-workers, wish I had more hours. got to interact with different type of animals. close by the home."
good,"The management has no respect for their employees, they will change hours with no warning or consent. They only feed the animals basic food which leads to them becoming malnourished. Management takes no suggestions from staff."
good,"Ok place to have a part time job for college Students or another part time job. "
good,Work here for too many years dissatisfied with the job and the direction of the company. I enjoyed the job in the begining. Over the years it has changed and to me is distasteful.
good,"Caring for and cleaning up after visiting pets, Hardest part of the job was making great connections with each pet and them having to leave, very structured company with great caring and mature people."
good,"Flexible schedule, decent hours, fun people:"
good,"A very positive and fun company to work for. You learn a lot about all types of animals, and can help educate others. Management is really nice and helpful."
good,I loved going to work and seeing all kinds of different animals and help pet parents in finding anything from medicine to food to hair care !!!! I like it here i didn't like the management though.
good,"i enjoyed my time at petsmart . "
good,"Petsmart was very good to me. I was part time and I received north of $8/hr. A typical work week would be between 18 to 28 hours. It would get insanely busy, with some of the worst customers you can imagine. On the other hand I met some of the nicest customers you can imagine, and being able to meet new dogs and learn about them was a benefit. "
good,"Fast paced work environment, great management and many opportunities to work in different areas of the store."
good,"PetSmart has always been an awesome place! I love my co-workers, my managers, and my job! Surrounded by awesome animals, always see something new each day!"
good,"I would work with all the animals we sold in the store. Small n Fury, Fish, Reptiles, and Birds. I would feed all the animals and clean out their homes. Help customers find a new animal to add to their family. Help find food, toys, cleaning products, and so forth. I enjoyed helping family's shop for their kids first pet. I learned so much about different fish and which you can and can not put in the same tank. Learning about different birds and small and fury animals as well. I enjoyed this place as my first job."
good,"I really have enjoyed over the years working in customer service. If you love pets you will enjoy working for this company. This job is not difficult. I have learned how to train your dogs, fish, reptiles, small animals, and pet hotel. I highly recommend this job to pet lovers."
good,the store was very hectic. Managers didn’t communicate well with each other and their coworkers. Some managers were very lazy and most times wouldn’t even assist coworkers. They mostly have women so they’ll put them to do heavy lifting of dog or cat food instead of helping instead.
good,"Great place to work and learn about animals and retail experience. Quick paced and career advancement is a goal for the company, they like to promote within. Must be willing to learn quickly and on your toes."
good,"Extremely busy and at times very stressful. Enjoyed unloading trucks and maintaining the mix center. It was quite involved, unloading freight, documentation of the loads for discrepancies, taking photos of damaged loads, filing reports to corporate regarding problem loads. Data entry of invoices, inventory of product in mix center lanes (cross dock staging) twice daily, maintaining a clean work area and getting product to the stores in a timely manner and correctly."
good,"The people are so kind and the managers are very nice. Easy to work with and get along with. Only problem is they are very unorganized and change too many things, makes it hard to keep up with."
good,Working at PetSmart was a lot of fun but there’s not much opportunity to grow within the company. Although they are very accommodating for part time people in school.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for PetSmart. Nothing wrong with the job specifically, or the type of people that you usually work with. However after the company sold the new owners started going through and changing a lot of policies and procedures that did not need to be changed. Causing a lot of the work to become unnecessarily stressful and frustrating."
good,"Not terrible. Simple job, fun work days. Management could use work. Favoritism is showed. Flexible schedules. Will work with you on hours and days off."
good,"Why I have to write something????????????????????????????Just don’t make friends here. Stay to ur self , do ur job and go home because  it’s not worth it."
good,"Pros include: 15% employee discount, 50% off bag of PetSmart brand dog or cat food monthly, several paid sick days. Cons: selfish/stupid managers, ever changing schedule, being forced to go with no lunch break, clopens (meaning you close and then open the store the following day)"
good,Its a alright place for a starter job not really a good place to stay at prices are way over priced and never get hours like you would like its really both a career job if you ask me
good,"A typical day at work was always great, hanging out with animals is my favorite thing as I have five pets of my own."
good,"If you can find the right leadership team, this company is a pet lovers dream. Not only do you get hands on experience working with the pets, but you are taught extensive knowledge on the best care for pets from small to large and the clientele are just as wonderful as the pets."
good,All places have good and bad.  I love my coworkers.  Not alot of room to advance in petsmart.  would rather hire outsiders then promote workers.
good,They were willing to work around my school schedule and also around my appointments when I was pregnant with my first child. However some of the management was a bit critical when it came to their evaluations.
good,PetSmart as a company is wonderful to work for but when you have to deal with non supportive management it makes the workplace a sad place to be. the hours are not many the work is dirty and fast paced but if you are a pet lover and truly willing to put up with all this its worth it!!
good,"wish the pay was better I would have stayed forever. Fun environment, they stick to protocol, they care about the animals just as much as the numbers and the employees."
good,Manage the pet care dept. Handle a team of 4 or more. Set up meetings for the team. Close and open the store. Answer phone calls and handle any situation. Demonstrate customer service each day. Place and check in deliveries. Preform inventory in the department. Price changes weekly. Manage the cash registers and the store safe.
good,"It is a fun place to work as you meet lots of interesting people and their pets. I have learned a lot about different types of food available to pet parents. I can do numerous jobs there such as cashier, planograms, stock , pricing and out of date. The hardest part of this job is the way they do scheduling."
good,Bathing dogs is not a easy job. But the people I worked with are great.
good,"As a guest service associate I get to meet and greet all new customers, and talk to all our regular customers which can be really rewarding. The hardest but funnest part of the job is taking care of the pets in our facility. There are times when dogs will fight and we have to be quick to separate them and keep ourselves as well as them safe. Our management always helped to get any duties done, some co-workers forgot to follow rules and when I saw that, I made sure to let management know and the problems were always taken care of."
good,Good Company and has a great future. Need more defined opportunity for growth
good,PetSmart is a great and inclusive place to work. Everything and everyone are welcome and helpful. I would like to keep a lasting relationship with this company.
good,Overall great place to work. Everyday is a different day. The people are nice and helpful throughout the daily process. I enjoyed working for this company.
good,It would get stressful but everyone there was very helpful. If I needed help someone was always willing to help. I felt accomplished when I was able to complete a task that was harder.
good,Petsmart was a good place to work I loved the fast paced job the hours were good and the people were very friendly I worked with the process of picking items was not hard at all
good,"Petsmart is very simple but there are different tasks you could be asked to do. Whether is cleaning, restocking, or even dealing with animals there is always something for someone. I love it there!"
good,It was very productive but overaly fun. I get to see the pets that comes in. Get to pet some of the cousterms pet dogs. The staff was really nice and also between breaks wasn't that bad.
good,I have a good day everyday a work. I Love my job & I Love working with kids. No hard work & I love the teacher everyone is nice. I can see about my kids
good,"Good, fun, nice culture, good place to work, nice management, good culture, learn a lot of new things, respectful, sharing culture, good salary, flexible hour"
good,Bathing dogs trimming their nails brushing their teeth cleaning their ears entering their information on the computer scheduling appointment answering the phones cleaning the salon.
good,"Very much enjoyed working at PetSmart; it was quite relaxed and not competitive, my coworkers and I had good rapport and we would always help each other out with customers, which was always a pleasure. You get to know a lot of interesting regulars and it's fulfilling to know that you're helping people with their pets."
good,"I love animals so this was a great experience. An easy job for me to do! I shampooed, clipped nails and groomed dogs. I also helped schedule appointments and kept the salon clean."
good,It was a very fun place to work. I don’t regret it at all. I enjoy going to work all the time. It’s good if you need a part time job and a relaxed environment.
good,"It was my first job while I was in high school. I learned how to clean their cages, feed them, give them water, and sometimes let the cats out so they can get their exercise."
good,"The company itself is pretty good to work for. Basic customer service, retail. Making sure the shelves are full and customers are assisted are the biggest goals of early morning stock team."
good,Working at petsmart was fun. Got to be around dogs. Co-workers were also great people. Best part is when you got to see a dog get adopted and find a new home.
good,Before hiring a salon manager make sure they’re qualified and trained in that environment. For them to arbitrarily change work hours on part time employees availability without asking is ridiculous which drove me to leave
good,"Great place to work if you love animals, don't advise if you are squeamish about cleaning up the little gifts incoming pets leave you as a memento of their brief stay."
good,Sometimes I get mad at my managers or coworkers but in the end it is a great company to work for. Management is friendly and pay is good. Working in the salon is stressful but you have the opportunity to earn tips for the dogs that you groom or bathe.
good,"I love The team , everyone is helpful and the environment is such a great place as well. I love the work i do. Everyone down to the managers are very helpful and understanding"
good,"Everything about the job is great ! Great management , co workers, it’s a great & welcoming environment. Everyone is so helpful and treats you like family."
good,I had a good experience at PetSmart.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  We worked well together and the management supported us with any guidance necessary.
good,I always loved working at Petsmart it was always fun and I excelled in my department. Petsmart is one of the best animal retail companies in my opininon.
good,"There were Tons of opportunities to lean and grow. Close to home, easy commute.  I worked as s cashier, aquatics dept, grooming and on the sales floor."
good,"Petsmart was my favorite job, my co workers were very helpful and positive to work with. It was overall a great experience. I would recommend working there to anyone."
good,Overall a great and friendly place to work.  You can bring your pets with you to work.  The culture in the corporate headquarters and field operations is great.
good,Enjoyable work if you have a passion for animals and enjoy working around people. Very satisfying to know you can educate someone to the better care of their pet.
good,"PetSmart has the best options to work with animals and people alike. The company is very kind about working with you if you have a family emergency, illness, or personal situation. The way they apply their policy on the care of pets and pet parents are amazing. I would recommend working for this company."
good,"My time at Petsmart was great, I loved the job and I loved my coworkers, I mostly quit because it was too far of a drive for how I was paid and I couldn't keep up with it. I loved working in Petcare, working with all the customers to help them choose the right pet for them, and also caring for all the animals. For the most part the atmosphere was pretty relaxed, even though the area itself made it kind of a quick paced job. My favorite part was definitely caring for the animals, and helping them find their forever homes. The hardest part of the job, was making sure they were going to good homes, and making sure the people were well educated to care for the animal. It was all still very enjoyable though."
good,"Great work environment, however it can be stressful due to there being so many people without adequate spacing in the salon.  Management really cares about their employees and customers!"
good,"I enjoyed spending my days working with animals. Whether i was preparing the meals, in camp with the pets, cleaning kennels, I always enjoyed what i was doing."
good,"I loved my ability to grow with the company and the lifelong skills I've learned. Now I can take my grooming skills with me wherever I go. I loved the opportunity to make commission, so I had some sort of control of my salary."
good,new to company and from the outside it had been a great move for me.  I am challenged each day and trained on new procedures daily. I am happy I made the choice to come
good,This is one of the BEST jobs i have ever had. Great atmosphere to work in. The staff are great the customers even better but the BEST part about the job was the special guests that came in with their owners.!!!
good,"Fast paced, but fun work environment. Workplace culture was upstanding. Excellent grooming program. Great learning experience. Scheduled work shifts varied from day to day."
good,I learned so much while working for this company. I was given so many opportunities to grow and advance in my career that I had never had before. The team work mentality in the store I worked in was amazing. All managers functioned as a team and it made for an amazing environment to be in. I also loved helping pet parents out with their various needs and loving on all the pets coming into the store.
good,"I would answer phone calls, schedule appointments, groom dogs, and deal with customers. The hardest part of the job was the chaos that comes with animals. The most enjoyable part was feeling a part of a team and having purpose."
good,"Petsmart is a great place to learn how retail can be. While it was stressful, there was almost always a dog around to pet when things got a little rough."
good,"This job has taught me how to utilize organization skills to help other people. Also it shows me the impact I can have on an animals life, as well as the pet owner's. I have a Rottweiler, for me, taking a step forward to help educate and assist pets makes a difference."
good,"I loved working there. Great job for animal lovers! I had to leave to focus on my Senior year of High School, but I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Ensuring shelves and storage areas are stocked with the right product "
good,I really enjoyed working at PetSmart.   The people who work there really care about animals and as the store Pet Trainer I was able to work with a large variety of dogs.  I was a great experience.
good,Petsmart taught me all I know! They were hands on with training and kept us on our toes for sure! everyone was nice to work with. The only downfall was the lack of space in the back with so many groomers working at once as well as lack of dryers and tubs! Working with friendly  people makes the days go by faster!
good,A typical day at work included scheduling appointments on the computer. Bathing and grooming dogs and clipping their nails. Answering phones and cleaning the salon.
good,Great opportunity for most people. Not great for someone with a family. Long hours and very stressful during the holidays. Very easy to work your way up.
good,"Obscenidades, lenguaje discriminatorio o cualquier otro lenguaje no apropiado para un foro público"
good,It is a good place to work if you don't have kids. I have 5 kids and they require alot of attention. working nights is not good for someone who has kids and wants to spend time with them.
good,"Honestly, this was my first real job outside of my fathers dental office and it was one of the best, most rewarding and responsibility driven jobs I have had. You are at the mercy of taking care of so many sweet animals that just want to be loved. One of the best jobs for a teenager!"
good,This location has a great team. They are supportive and are always willing to help you learn and succeed. The managers are also approachable and very accommodating.
good,When I started the manager was willing to work with me in moving into grooming. Once being there the head manager said I was only hired for petcare and wasn't willing to help me move or grow.
good,I was very young when I worked here I learned a lot about customer service and stocking merchandise. It was a great place to start learning how to be an example employee.
good,"This is possibly the best company I have ever worked for. the slogan is ""where pets are family"" yet they treat employees as family too. I would highly recommend."
good,"I've been working as a cashier at PetSmart for about 5 months now, and I absolutely love it! The work is not hard, but can be stressful at times. The management is great, and they are willing to work around school or other job schedules. This is a great job to have while you're in school."
good,"Awesome people to work with, fun environment where customer service is placed very high on the list. Products are always at their best and the store appearance is another top priority."
good,You learn so much at Petsmart while your time there. Information that follows you even after you stop working there. I loved working with all the animals and greeting all the pet parents.
good,I loved my time at petsmart everybody did there job and everybody was responsible and respectful and got there duties done that they had it was a mellow place to work at manager treated everybody with respect
good,"Good place to work if you love animals and building a strong bond with customers. You learn a lot about products, as well as pets. Fun energy and potential."
good,Petsmart allowed me the opportunity to work one on one with individual and their pets. I was able to understand  the pets needs and it allowed me to build a relationship with the pet parent. Very satisfying and rewarding career.
good,working with animals and people great leaders and growing oppertunites you get to teach kids and adults the nature of different species of animals and how to take care of them and also hpw to handle / train them
good,"PetSmart es una empresa de animales encargada de administrar comida, ropa, juguetes, etc."
good,The managers are helpful. We are rewarded often. The pay is competitive. Overall it was a good experience working here. If I wasn't moving I would stay.
good,"While working at Petsmart I was part time and would usually 6 hours a day for 4 days a week. I learned almost everything I know about animals while working those two years at Petsmart. The previous store manager, while being a very easy person to talk to was not a good manager and would act more like a friend than a boss and would not take any of the store problems seriously unless his job was in danger. The workplace culture was diverse and like with anyplace you work their was conflicts between workers but for the most part everyone was friendly and willing to help cover other peoples spots if the store were to get busy, which was often. The hardest part of the job was when a customer would come in and we did not have what they were looking for and would have to tell them to go somewhere else to find what they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the joy on a customers face when they go home with a new furry friend and a new addition to their family. Out of all the jobs I've had in my life, this was my favorite place I have ever worked and the job where I learned the most."
good,Fun work environement. Lots of cool products to learn about. Great building relationships with customers and their pets. Good team building job. Enjoyable place to work.
good,"A typical day of work involved working the register, helping customers find items within our store, providing helpful information about the production PetSmart has to offer, promoting the services PetSmart has to offer, and providing a positive and upbeat checkout experience. "
good,It’s not a job for everyone. You have to have a passion for animals if not then its no fun. I love working at petsmart. It’s stressful at times but I never feel it.
good,Petsmart has changed a lot since I was hired.  The company has gone through many ups and downs and leadership changes at a corporate level.  Eventually it will even out at a store level but the transition from public to privately owned company was a challenge
good,Petsmart is constantly busy so you are never left without anything to do. The customers are pleasant and you get to work with small animals everyday if you are a Pet Care Associate.
good,"Was a great environment to work at. Loved the stocking duties I had as well as the cashiering. Got to work with the customers on many different duties, whether it was search for an item or check them out or even give information."
good,"Working at petsmart was overall really fun and you learn a lot about animals and environments you never even knew about. The customers who came into petsmart were my favorite because we both shared a love for animals so everyone was always so nice. If you have a lot of allergies or even the slightest allergies to animals or HAY then i wouldn’t suggest working here because i was miserable every time i had to do bedding changes. As a pet care Associate you’re always doing something, if you have down time you’re scrubbing tanks. If you’re done scrubbing tanks you’re cleaning out bedding. You practically get into trouble when you aren’t doing anything. Make sure if you get this job that you have comfortable shoes because you will be on your feet the entire shift. Also the animals DO bite. The hamsters have broken my skin many times and have even bitten customers. "
good,"store walks, safety walks and the pets were great.  the store was laid back, the pet salon not so much, a lot of attitude in there, but with a commission job it is to be somewhat expected."
good,My job was to handle transactions of products from the store to check out people and make sure their experience at the store was excellent. To provide great customer service
good,The atmosphere was great. It is a fast paced environment but everyone was friendly and the manager genuinely cared about the associates. I liked the lunch hour it was longer then most places.
good,It is a very competitive and nice place to work. I recommened this for anyone looking to get a skill that they can take with them the rest of their life.
good,"I really enjoyed working at petsmart. The staff there is amazing. They were friendly, encouraging, and hard working. My job wasn't too stressful, although I stayed busy at all times."
good,"love the job and the work"
good,"	Overall floor care maintenance throughout hospital to include routine and special strip and wax projects."
good,"its a fast-paced store"
good,With me being so passionate about animals I absolutely loved the experience i had working here. It was a great place to be. I enjoyed how much I was able to work with the pets as well as the pet parent. I loved how impiortant my role at the store was. I appreciated the fact the a mistake of mines could be detrimental to the company. That kept me on my toes .
good,"Best job I've had. "
good,"Worked for several locations while in college. I went from big city to small town and the work ethic was very prominent. I loved having some of my regular pets coming in. Make or break your day some of them. I had a lot of fun. However, I did understand we were working with animals. Sometimes they are unpredictable to say the least."
good,It is hard work but when I got the hang of things it became a lot easier and I was excepted by everyone who I work with and we all have a lot in common.
good,Completed diet preparation and assisted in animal care. Interacted with customers and assisted them with their needs. Maintained day-to-day records. Observed animals to maintain animal health and habitats
good,Enjoyed working there very fun and fast paced the people there are very friendly enjoyed everyday there always was learning something new and enjoyed being part of the team
good,This is not a good place to work if you are looking for work / life balance. The processes and procedures change every week and there is no update until you have messed up.
good,Employees were friendly and management was great. Very flexible around my school schedule while keeping my work hours in mind. I met a lot of new people daily which gave me the opportunity to advance in my communication skills.
good,"It is an okay job, dealing with the animals is so fun, but you do a lot of work for not that much pay. People in the same position can also make a lot more than you. They say you can get lots of advances but you really don't, no room for full time unless you are a manager."
good,"It was quite literally part of my job to get on the ground and play with puppies when they came in. How can you go wrong with that?  It really is a company with a great procedures in place, they take time to train you properly, and then have high expectations going forward.  You've gotta love it!"
good,"As a groomer, a day starts with a list of up to 10 dogs (per groomer) to bath, dry, and groom in a timely manner.  Time management is important.  Some dogs have a specific early pick up time, others were scheduled for after work pick up.  There is very little time for a break.  Often the grooming process is slowed or paused for any number of reasons: pet parent client check in, pet parent product consultations, aggressive and/or undisciplined pet behavior.  Management was somewhat lax in the salon. The team of groomers got along well.  Each groomer had their own pet client list.  Groomers paused personal work to help fellow groomers with challenging dogs.  It was a necessary protection not only to the dog, but also the groomer.  Dogs dispositions change when they are faced with unfamiliar environments, loud noises, and uncomfortable tools cutting near their faces."
good,I was a manager of many different areas of the store. I primarily worked with trucks and the stocking of the store. I had so many different duties in this job.
good,"Set up cash drawers and begin selling products to the customers.  Answer any questions the customer may have or refer to management.  Closing included returning merchandise to the shelf if sellable, straightening items on shelf, counting down registers, restocking registers with bags, register paper etc..."
good,"I liked working here because of the flexible hours, and the culture that was encouraged within the store. Customer service was always easy to provide because training and management made it feel like a family atmosphere"
good,coworkers very nice .everybody was very outgoing and patient . they were always willing to train and help other people out no matter what . Had the ability to work with pets .
good,"I learned a lot about exotic pets while working here. I also knew that PetSmart is retail, so the objective is to sell, sell, sell. Because of that I wanted to work somewhere were the objective was truly animal care, which is why I left in September of 2012 to work as a Veterinary Technician."
good,Challenging role and the best part is can get pets to the working place. Friendly and helpful atmosphere. Work load is heavy and tuff at times to complete in a day.
good,Bosses and coworkers were always awesome and super understanding. They were always there when you need something and were always open to learning and teaching you new things as well
good,I love my job. The people I work with on a day to day basis really care for one another and the management is always so willing to help in any way they can. Marion Petsmart is a great place to work!
good,I loved to work here. It was so fun to be able to be around so many animals all the time. I had a lot of fun and learned a lot. I was a cashier so I got to see everyone!!
good,"very helpful coworkers, proper training, cleanliness, the animals are amazing and the job is lots of fun. Very rewarding experience."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs because it really taught me a lot about friendship and customer service. I was in college when I was working at Petsmart and they were always understanding about my lab days, which were wednesday night so i always had that day off. The manager who wrote the schedule usually always considered the days I was not available. If she absolutely needed me she would ask first. I was given 30 hours a week some weeks which was fine with me because I needed money to come in while I was in school. The people who work there are always so friendly and ready to help you. I like to consider myself one of the friendly associates and always wants to help and teach customers about the care plans of certain animals and fish. After a little while I then learned how to use the cash register so I could help them whenever they were behind. I was the all around employee I did whatever I could to make sure the day would run smoothly for everyone."
good,"Flexible hours, good pay, lots of hands on work. Got to handle animals all of the time. Not a good place for those with fear of reptiles. Only complaint was lack of security measures."
good,great company. wonderful people. fantastic cause.  Helping others find what they need in order to fulfill pets needs and dreams.
good,"Love all my merchandising companies including this one, I am still on call and love the diversity of assignments, Such a great company to work with."
good,I enjoy working at Petsmart very much. A typical day involves putting customers and their pets first which is the greatest feeling in the world. I have learned how to read body language of dogs and that has helped me become a better pet parent. The co-workers and managers are very helpful and always looking out for the well being of you and your clients which is all you can ever ask for.
good,"customer service multi phone line, deliveries, inventory, 10 key, deposits, cash handling, manage 15 people a day, filing, schedule making"
good,It is a great place to work the customers as well as the employees are very friendly as well as welcoming it is very easy to catch on to the work experience and a great learning experience
good,I have worked at fur to feathers for 3 1:2 years! I love working and caring for animals! And i enjoy the independence i have in doing my own schedule and consults! I am allowed to everything on my own
good,"A typical day at work would be getting to the store around 8:00am cleaning the cat cages one at a time wiping them down, scooping litter, refilling water and food, and giving the animals some love. Then moving on to the back rooms. Treating sick animals, refilling their water and food, spot cleaning their cages and filling out a chart with what you had done for them and whether they had improved or not. Next I take care of the animals on the floor refilling food and water, spot cleaning and checking to make sure they're all healthy. Then I feed the fish and spot clean their tanks. "
good,"if you're an early bird then the position (early morning stocker) is the job for you, also if you like dogs because on the weekends is when the store is at it's all time high with customers for obvious reason"
good,I did everything from stocking shelves to writing schedules to P&l.  I learned you have to learn all aspects of the store in retail.  You have to be able to jump in where needed.  Management is good when they work along side of you and they earn your respect.  The hardest part is getting employees and staffing to show up to work.  The most enjoyable part is customer and interacting with public.  When you are able to service the customer and create a relationship they keep coming back.

My co-workers make the job enjoyable, we work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is the stress level and knowing how to handle it. Also trying to avoid being bit by dogs.

The most enjoyable was working with the animals that would accompany the pet parent into the store."
good,"I am a pet lover so when I got this position I was in heaven! I started as a sales floor associate and within a couple months was asked to go to the grooming academy to become a groomer and of course accepted it! Customers there are extremely friendly (for the most part) and I loved my team. I ended up going on maternity leave after 2 years of working there and when I returned, to my surprise, found out we got a new manager who ended up pulling me into his office every day telling ME 'how much I hate my job and I should quit' and after a couple weeks of that was fired. He also fired basically the entire store and quite within a few months after that. It could be an amazing place to work as long as you dont have an evil manager!"

good,I mainly worked doing stock and as a customer service representative. I learned about a pets health and the best brands of food for dogs and cats. Management was good but sometimes forgetful in trying to do extra training for individuals who were supposed to be doing more. Co-workers were nice and easy to work with and very helpful when needed. Hardest part of the job was keeping up to date of what was the best product. The best part of the job was working with the animals.
good,"I came in as a bather and worked hard to prove myself within the company, management promoted me to full-time and sent me to grooming academy where i was trained to become a professional pet stylist."

good,"Traveled around to different petsmarts and harris tetter from florida to north carolina also did winn dixie from florida to georgia  "
good,"It was more than a retail company. Petsmart genuinely cares about the animals and customers it provides supplies for. The hardest part was the customers that didn't understand that a speech impediment (stutter) does not directly correlate to intelligence, or a lack thereof. The best part was helping all the customers find the best product for their pet."

good,"Since I'm a huge animal lover, it was a great fit! Interacting with the pets and seeing the reactions of the pet owners after picking up their freshly cleaned dog was always the best part of the day."
good,"I spent six weeks just in safety and product information training. Everyday was very busy when I was working in the grooming salon as a groomer's assistant. I enjoyed being at work, and was surrounded by coworkers who were true professionals. I also worked on the sales floor, and was cross trained throughout the entire store. I learned how to quickly and efficiently answer almost any question, or help any customer that came into our store.  I also enjoyed working hands on with all of the pets in the salon. It was a great feeling when I started to receive request bath appointments. It was a compliment anytime a pet parent trusted me to take good care of their pets!"

good,"I ran the cash register and assisted Customers."

good,This was a volunteer job that I took on as a part of my high school credit program. I helped out animals that were either abused or just found on the street which to me was heart warming. I learned a lot about animals and how to care for them.
good,"Good Company to work for."

good,"My position at consisted of helping a pet parent with all of his or her pets needs. Whether it was on the floor helping customers become familiar with the products or at the register answering any questions a pet parent had, the customers always left the store satisfied. Petsmart associates work together as a team to make sure the customers are well taken care of. The hardest part of this job is trying to find a food the is suitable for the animal, considering the animal's allergies, the size of the animal and the best price for the pet parent. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to see and play with all different types of animals."

A day in class was the best part of the job. Getting to teach pet parents and their dog how to do certain things; for example, Sit, Stay, Down, Take it, Leave it, Loose Leash Walking, Heeling, Tricks like shake, Rollover, Play dead. The hardest part of the job was having to end training class, then wait until next week to do it all over again. Training is such a wonderful job, and the most enjoyable job. "
good,"Compiled incident, investigation and medical information for record and review purposes "

good,the job was great treated all of us like family. the oay was ok for the amount of work you did but if you love to learn this would be a great job for you.
good,PetSmart is a fun yet challenging place to work. The associates and customers are great!
good,Everything I have learned is due to the excellent managers that I worked with over the yrs.Get training modules and training tools. Great employees that are very passionate and caring.
good,I love dogs but I think coming home smelling like a wet dog everyday was a big negative.
good,"Awesome Place to work, Friendly Associates and cool Management"
good,My introduction to suggestive selling it was also my first real introduction to customer service atmosphere and real stocking (breaking down pallets rebuilding palets and puttin them back in the stocking area for later distribution throughout the whole store.
good,This was a second job while working with the State of Florida. I loved coming to work. The managers were wonderful to work with. This was a very supportive and fun environment to work in. I enjoyed interacting with customers and animals.

good,"Definitely one of my favorite work experiences. It was very easy to fall in love with the animals, the employees were cool too! Hard work, long hours, could get messy at times, definitely not for someone with a weak stomach! Gross but worth it!"
good,"this is a great store. one of my favorite jobs, but i feel like i was discriminated against when i worked there. i felt like i had to quit because we got new managment and they were accusing me of doing things that i would have never done because an employee that i didnt get along with told them far fetched stories and they automatically believed her, yet when the other management was there, they really enjoyed my work and what i did for the company, and nothing like what i was accused of ever happened. i felt like i was forced to quit the job that i really loved."
good,i really enjoy working at Petsmart the staff is hard working and laid back. i also enjoy the challenges of completing my work on time

good,It was a great place to work! Just wanted a career! Other wise very pet healthy/happy place to work!
good,Productive and fun place to work. Learned different processes. Hardest part of job was getting crew inboard with company restructures.
good,"Overall this job is a fun place to work at. With seeing all the different animals everyday is what makes this job exciting. The average work day is slow and boring i'm not gonna lie. I worked at the register and you were not allowed to leave the register, so it was very boring just standing there waiting for a customer. The management was very nice and helpful when they can. I also learned a lot about animals in this job as well. The hardest part of the job would have to be the goals they have you do at the register, for example having to sell these puppy kits at the register to customers was a little frustrating but is doable. Also the breaks are only 30 mins lunches."
good,"It is nice to work for the company because you get to interact with animals constantly and you get a discount for your animals. The hardest part about this job is whenever you see customers bring in animals that are obviously not treated properly, but you cannot really do anything about it."
good,"Working there is easy but there is a lot to do. in petcare you take care of every animal on the floor, sick ones, new ones, also customer service, meaning having to get crickets and fish, and showing animals."
good,Was a great place to work for if you liked working with animals the management were nice and very knowledgeable and helpful as well. I would recommend working  Here if you enjoy dogs.
good,"Petsmart was a very fun job. I was able to be promoted multiple times and enjoyed each part of my job. It paid decently at the time, however I felt the work schedule was not fair. I would close at 9PM and have to be back at 4AM for the freight shift. I did enjoy the allowed overtime and being able to work in all areas of the store."
good,Great job if you love animals. Definitely work there if passion is big for you. You're given the task to educate yourself and others to improve quality of life for the animals you are selling.
good,"easy money, easy life, just love the animals, super unorganized company, it can be stressfull and rough to work for them. sometimes i just wanna cry in the back room cause of how mean customers can be"
good,"Working at petsmart could be very relaxed and slow or fast paced and hectic, however managers where always there to help when it was needed. I was able to interact with many different pets, as long as it was respectful"
good,Everyone starts out as a bather. If you want to move up and go to academy to become a groomer you can. If not then you stay a bather with no pay raise.
good,"PetSmart offers training in their different animals they offer products for with earned raises.  I found it a positive environment to work in. "
good,I loved working at petsmart. Unfortunately it is not a company to work for if you have a family.  Pay is not good and hours are difficult.  But my manager  at the time was great and I would go back.
good,The fes problems i had was with the hours it wasnt nearly enough and when i tried to transfer to a diffrent store the other manager wouldnt return my calls and i had to constantly call back to to talk to someone
good,"It is a peaceful environment and usually your coworkers are flexible and will work with you for shift pickups, etc. Its a relaxed type of job to have."
good,Fun and caring place. if you love being around animals its great or as a job while in school. Always lots to do not much down time so make sure you don't want a lazy job.
good,Now I am an opener so I come in open the floor. Which consist of making sure all the pets have fresh food and a clean habitat. Bag Crickets for customers and feed fish. Take care of any sick animals. I do deep clean so I have to do more work than most associates. (This is the short version.) Managers are ok some are better than others. T.
good,"Pet smart was the only job I stayed for more than 2 years. My experience there helped me gain my knowledge of being a sales person and customer service rep, cashier, and animal lover. I started out as a cashier at the costa mesa location and moved to being a bather within 6 months, I was able to transfer to the GG location within a year or so. At first it seems like a stressful job when it's busy and customers are every where, but the overall environment is laid back and fun. I learned a lot as a bather and I don't regret it. I would have moved on to the small animal/ fish area if I didn't quit... Management is tough there and they don't take mistakes lightly. Each part of the store is it's own little clique so if you're able to know all of the areas within 2 years you'll be fine. Playing with puppies, learning from all kinds of animals, and being able to advance within reasonable time are the highlights."
good,Fun and challenging job as a dog groomer. Long shifts but decent pay. Pretty well managed. Room for advancement. High stress and not the job for you if you don't like to get dirty.
good,I enjoyed the pets and learned new things each day. It was fulfilling to work with and help others with a similar love for animals. This job required having energy and being on your feet the entire time.
good,Great first job i loved helping everyone and seeing all the animals that came in. I learned how to be a people person and learned alot about the products and to be fast pace as a cashier.
good,Petsmart has changed a lot over the years but still maintains a high standard when it comes to the product that they deliver and services they provide.
good,I like coming to work getting to see my Regular Pet parents and helping them with their Pet Needs. I have always enjoyed  Customer Service and Helping People. I have been Customer Service Oriented for 25 year's.
good,"I loved this job very much. I enjoyed working with the animals and all of the responsibilities that came with it. I had to move due to family reasons, or I would have stayed."
good,Very friendly and fun coworkers. strict but fair employment. Nice and understanding. flexible hours and willing to work with you to improve and get the best out of you.
good,While working at Petsmart I learned a great deal about what it means to be a leader. My day to day consisted of a lot of customer service and dealing with difficult decisions. The entire staff is friendly and willing to help when needed.
good,"I absolutely loved working for petsmart, although the management I worked for were under achieved for the roles that they had. Was a professional pet stylist for over 3 years and  love what I did"
good,"grooming, bathing dogs. the hardest part was being the only male. the most enjoyable part were the dogs, I love animals .It was a fun place to work."
good,"it was fun to work at petsmart people there are supportive and reliable, they encourage you to do better. "
good,"A normal day at work for me is showing up and waiting to start while i walk around and look at the animals, i'v learned a lot about different animals and how to care for them, and the management is always friendly even when chastising, my co workers for the most part are hard working and relaxed individuals, I'd say the hardest part of the job is not having enough hours thearfor, enough money to pay rent, the most enjoyable part is seeing people come and go with their animals of all types."
good,"There is always opportunities to advance, but it is not an easy job."
good,I enjoyed working with the dogs and the challenge it provided.
good,"Its repetitive everyday"
good,"A typical day at work basically bringing the store to life, learning the product throughout the store and having great customer service.The enjoyable part is getting thew customers what they need and making them happy."
good,I loved working with the dogs. Was honestly the best part of being a bather! In the Bullhead City Arizona location my coworkers were amazing! They made me feel like family since day one! The San Bernardino Store were very rude and did not make me feel welcome at all. I dreaded going to work most days.
good,"All the co-workers are fairly easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep busy when you are a cashier considering you are limited to how far you can go. The best part of the day is when I can get off the register and provide customer service and help do some things in pet care. I can only get crickets and feeder fish, but I love it."
good,"I spend the majority of the day assisting customers with their product needs. I answer and direct phone calls to the appropriate departments depending on the need of the customer. During the course of the day I provide care to sick and injured animals in the form of medication and document management. I work as a member of a dynamic group of employees, therefore communication with my fellow employees is a critical part of my work day. I have learned to adapt to an ever changing work environment due to the varying requirements of the animals under my care, as well as the customers that I assist. I enjoy the fast pace of this job and the interaction that I have with customers and my fellow employees."
good,"A typical day for me was to come in jump right on the registrar or on the floor. help customers, clean and organize the store. However I was told when i was hired that there would be opportunities to go into different job services such as aquatics , small animals, etc. But when I was asking for those opportunities as they presented them selves I was never afforded the opportunity. The management was great understanding and friendly and caring."
good,"Great company to work for with flexible hours, and a great environment. The customers are friendly, and the manager is understanding in different situations."
good,"Pros:"
good,Working with dogs is very rewarding. Co-workers are friendly. Managers are very understanding. They Accommodate to you're schedule. Break time is fair.
good,"I really love working at Petsmart Hotel because I love getting to be with the dogs the entire time. Supervising the dogs while they are in camp, or individual play times allows you to build relationships with the dogs. They are all so loving and sweet."
good,I really like petsmart. It was such a great experience working with animals and getting to know them a little by little every week they come back for their grooming appointments.
good,I enjoyed working here very much. It was a pleasure to be surrounded by pets all day. The staff is very knowledgeable about their departments. There are very few opportunities for full time status with benefits.
good,This was my second job and it was a fun one! I developed my customer service skill and had so much fun with all the animals. The hours were extremely flexible and it was interesting the things that you would learn.
good,in the begining it was working well however there were some individuals that were toxic to the company and are still currently employeed there. which is why i am leaving
good,Everyone I work with are amazing. Managed very well. Would like more hours. I enjoy working with all the animals there. I feel I have grow great relationships with the people I work with and it’s a very team oriented job.
good,PetSmart is a really exciting place to work. You never know what animal is going to walk through the door. I worked at the cash register and would help with stocking/changing stickers.
good,I learned a lot about pets and common problems they have. Managers are not strict. The worst part about the job is that it can be boring and the air is very dry and dusty. I love greeting all the dogs that come in and taking to people about there pets.
good,I  had a great time and really saw life from a different view working with great people day in and day out. They are still my friends to this day that I have come to rely on to this day.
good,"Great environment for a business, customers are kind and associates are easy to communicate with positively and knowledgeably! Loved getting to know regular customers and their fluffy friends!"
good,"Typical Day- Based on whatever your hours are you worked from start to finish"
good,I started out as a dog bather in the grooming salon and transitioned to being a cashier. I don't have much to complain about or say about petsmart most of my experiences have been positive
good,Must be competitive. Fast-paced environment. Customer service is the heart of the company. The customers satisfaction is what makes the company thrive.
good,Love the animals and the quiet time in the morning stocking and then seen chill animals that made it have a lifting feeling in the environment  when you worked.
good,"i come into work, i take care of my morning duties, sweeping around the register watering the cat grass, dusting the registers, down stocking the treat wall etc. I learned a lot about all different types of animals and breeds about their well being, types of food that would be good for them, bathe them, etc. We have daily meetings,  also for positive reinforcement we receive these care cards, that describe the great performance that we execute. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with shady customers, as well as scammers, which are customers trying to scam you out of money or their products. Finally the most enjoyable part of the job would have to being playing with and interacting with different types of animals all shapes and sizes."
good,"If you’re just looking for something fun part-time and if you’re good with people and dogs, then there’s no reason for you to dislike working here also my manager and coworkers were the best"
good,A typical day. Expect to be warmly greeted by all leadership. Expect your managers to want to get to know you and be there to support you and your life. Expect to have opportunities for advancement. Expect your fellow associates to help you when you drop a pallet and to correct you on a process you may be doing wrong. Expect help and respect in all areas of the warehouse. The living wage is fair.
good,I enjoyed working here. The managers cared about the store culture and the employees. The atmosphere was enjoyable to work in. They really cared about the customers and their pets.
good,i loved working with petsmart and i would love to go back 1 manager i had there wasnt the greatest and was not impressed with him saying i could be rehired later he was lying and just was not cool at all!!
good,I didn’t get much real training. And within a month I was training a new employee. Everyone is nice and you build bonds with your coworkers. You have to be able to work under pressure and never take anything personal.
good,"Working for PetSmart is a great place to start for animal lovers. Getting to spend time with the animals learning new things from experience, seniors, and management. Managers take initiative to ensure every worker is trained correctly, and aware of opportunities for advancement. Overall I loved working for this company, my managers, and with my team members."
good,It was always pretty calm and very fun to always see dogs and cats. The hardest part of the job is by far when a family is about to put down their dog. its rough particularly if its a regular.
good,The staff at PetSmart is very friendly and helpful. Since coming to work with PetSmart they have enabled and helped me advance my career. They even paid for a trip for my training.
good,"I don't want to write anything about this job, I don't want to give my opinion, it was an okay place to work, and this was a great place if you needed a first job and what not."
good,"This was my first job out of high school.  Petsmart gave me a chance to work.  I enjoyed my job, especially interacting with the customers.  I also enjoyed working with the pets.  My immediate supervisor was wonderful to work with.  The only thing that I didn't like was the job was seasonal."
good,you must have a passion for pets. i do and did. great place to learn and care about our furry friends. darrel and cathy at brannon crossing location in nicholasville ky are awesome people to work with!
good,I loved working at PetSmart my co-workers were amazing and the customers were happy with an open ear and Help on better care of animals. Every once in a while there was that one customer but my co-workers were always there to give encouragement. Management was understanding of life issues and willing to help how ever they could. Sadly unless your full time no benefits but had opportunity for growth.
good,PetSmart is a really fun place to work. It is full of people who love animals and want to provide them and their owners with the best equipment for them and their pet.
good,This company TRULY cares for their pets and the pet parents.  Completely focused on the needs of each animal/guest.  How can you complain about petting puppies daily?  Love.
good,"It was an interesting place, management was lacking when I worked there with customer satisfaction. It was more structured like a high school drama set, which is expected in a younger work environment, but unfortunately they were elders who were the main culprits of spreading unnecessary gossip."
good,worked in receiving stocking shelfs..keeping back room in order. customer service...giving  advice to customer....cleanup and assisting managers during no receiving days
good,Petsmart is really enjoyable because of the animals that pet parents bring in to greet you. i learned quite a few things about different types of animals.
good,"9am to 8pm"
good,"I loved working at Petsmart because I love animals and was excited to work around them. I loved that pets were allowed inside the store, it made the job more fun interacting with the owners and their pets. The management came up with fun ideas to keep it a friendly competition within the employees."
good,"The store I worked at was a cut-throat,stressful, environment with to many people working in the groom shop. The manager and her friends were prejudice, critical and gossiped. They took all the easy regular pets and gave out the matted hard to do ones. But the company was fun to work for. It was a good learning experience and I was able teach associates along with clients about animals."
good,"Really enjoyed my time there, thought me how to interact with different people. Problem solving and attention to detail.Provided me with the necessary experience to move on to a better job."
good,"The best part about working for petsmart were the animals and the returning customers."
good,"I gained a more strong passion for working with animals. "
good,PetSmart is an amazing place for people just starting out in the work world. Unfortunately they do not offer full time unless you are lucky enough to get management.
good,Overall a great place to work . If you aren't a favorite you may be in trouble. You have to kiss a lot of butt to make it in this little company. I learned a lot of different types of animals and how to care for them .
good,"I grew up in a small town so my social skills were a little on the downward side. After moving to San Antonio in order to attend college, I began working at PetSmart. On the first day, my coworkers made me feel at home. My management was also very socially active. There was no workplace drama and what not. Just a place that made it easy to connect not only to co-workers but to customers as well."
good,For a year i worked as the CEL Pet Care manager and i loved it .. until store managers chanced and then there were a lot of issues not only with me but the other managers and staff as well.
good,I loved volenteering there and loved the environment. I never felt under pressure and if I had any questions there was always someone to help me out. Loved the work space and everyone was so friendly and inviting.
good,"I load trailers to be delivered to the retail stores. I have work in all department here. Order Filler, Receiving , Shipping"
good,I was able to learn more about animals I wasn't very knowledgable about and gain some hours and experience to help me in the future when I apply for veterinary school.
good,"Wonderful place, good pay, nice crew, and management. Over all I loved this job.  You get to gain knowledge about pets while sharing it with others.  Enjoyable."
good,"I love working at PetSmart since I'm such a dog lover and I get my fill of all of the animals there.  I have learned a lot about pet safety and the care of special need dogs.  I love all of my co-workers, they are so nice and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is getting down on my hands and knees to clean out kennels."
good,"The hotel is a great place to work if you love playing with dogs all day! Although they are short staffed most of the time and the manager is not very good, the people there are very pleasant."
good,"I worked at the Pets Hotel. I supervised Doggie Day camp and ensured that each dog was happy and safe. "
good,"I loved working at Pet Smart! I love animals anyway. So working there was a plus being around them all the time. Coming out after getting groomed, the dogs seemed so happy!"
good,Was a fun place to work at. Management was great always seem to look out for you. I would work here again. They encourage entrepreneurship and allow limit growth.
good,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. They provided training in anything I wanted to learn about pets. I left because I had to relocate closer to my family. Overall, PetSmart is a very good company to work for."
good,"Met a lot of people that have helped me grow as an individual and professional. Learned a lot of life skills and more customer satisfaction skills. Most enjoyable part was working with animals, seeing animals all day, and getting to know customers and build relationships."
good,"Every day is something new, depends on what dogs are boarding or staying there for day camp. Most people are friendly but you'll always have a few crazy ones. Must definitely not mind cleaning up after dogs all day and understanding that you will see nasty stuff!"
good,I worked very hard to establish myself as a hard worker. I loved working with animals and doing what I loved best.The only reason I didn't stay longer was I was in a car accident and their were no positions when I was able to work.
good,"Usually I just help the customers, make sure to keep up with the animals and making the store look good."
good,"a typical day at work includes feeding and cleaning pets. supervising safe play. Ive learned how to handle dog fights in a face way, understand critical signs of stress with pets and safe ways to treat animals. my co workers have to work as a team to get over a hundred  pets taken care of. the hardest part of the job is time management, because the high volume of the facility, we must be very flexible. i am very passionate about building bonds with pets and the pets parents. having a customer feel safe about leaving their pet in our care and knowing said pet is happy is very full-filling."
good,"Bathing dogs"
good,"I would groom approximately 3 dogs a day, answer phones, schedule appts., ring up customers at end of groom."
good,"Everything is great. I would say the hardest part is the walk-ins. We have set appointments to get dogs done in a specific amount of time, but its the bathers responsibility to take walk-ins (nail trims). Its tough when we get multiple nail trims at once, and then we're rushing to get the appointment dogs done on time."
good,"i wold go in and check on the cats and dogs, then record the dogs intake and out put, feed them fresh food and water every 3 hours, then buff the hotel floors and clean the hotel windows, and in the morning i would clean the cats cage and give fresh food and water."
good,"I got to take care of all kinds of animals in the store and help Pet Parents with their pets. I loved my job... that is until my co-workers made our department a hostile work environment. Both my supervisor and manager were unable to successfully put an end to the insane amount of drama brought on by my co-workers, so I decided to leave my dream job and remove myself from a toxic workplace. I'm hoping to be able to work at another store (hopefully their management is better structured and successful at handling unprofessional employees)."
good,"Provided excellent customer service in a fast-paced sales environment.  Sold services to customers.  Answered telephone calls.  Accurate and comfortable with currency.  Provided a safe and comfortable environment for customers.  Knowledgeable in hazardous materials and hazardous waste.  Achieved sales plan expectations.  Trained and developed new associates.  Interact with often hostile clients.  "
good,I enjoy working at Petsmart. I have met many friends through the company. The benefits are great for full-time employees and not bad for part-time employees. The schedule can be hard and unpredictable at times because it is retail.
good,"While it was very fast paced, I had a blast working for Petsmart as a salon associate. I liked the recognition programs and the close knit group we were. "
good,"I was responsible for bathing the dogs in the salon for the groomers, also trimming nails, cleaning ears, and basic trimming of hair. I learned a lot about different styles of hair cuts and more about how to communicate with customers and how to clearly communicate. The management at petsmart was outstanding, they communicated well with the other employees and didnt expect too much from them. The co-workers were friendly and very good at their jobs and worked well with others. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an unsatisfied customer and trying to make everything right with them. The most enjoyable part was totally transforming a dog from a dirty backyard dog to a show-dog."
good,The only problem I have is that there are very little advancement opportunities. I have been part time for 3 years and seeking full time. Its hard to make a living when you can only get 24 hours a week.
good,"It is a wonderful place to start out and get experience. Although tedious at times, it is fun and welcoming. There are friendly co-workers and managers who are always available to lend an ear or a hand. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate and disappointed customers, whose demands cannot be fulfilled at such a small establishment. The most enjoyable part of the job is handling and caring for all the animals who come into the store on a daily basis. I learned many home remedies and store bought remedies in caring for all types of animals."
good,only worked there for a little bit but learned soo much
good,a typical day was picking and picking or loading and loading trailers.i learned how to drive forklifts at petsmart its where i got all my experience.management was good everybody got the chance to work in every department.people there always willing to help one another.the only hard part was that you had to do a certain percentage of work per week.petsmart is a fun place to work seening all the stuff they have for all sorts of aniamals.
good,Love it and the experience is great for caring for pets. Managment is kind of poor. Co-workers are kind of weird. Harderst is waking up at 3am. Most enjoyable part is interacting with pets.
good,Provided a much needed service for the community for over 5 years and will one day open my own grooming salon.
good,nice and clean environment filled with animals. On a normal day i work from 1-9pm. From 1-5 i stand in camp with about 17 dogs monitoring the dog making sure they are great health during their play time and from 5-9 i do walks and clean up the atrium.
good,"typical day started for me in the evening and was very exciting, always learning new things about animals. management was great and understanding. My co workers were great as well, many good memories. hardest part was maintaining the animal habitats, best part of the jod was the sales experience."
good,"I loved working at PetSmart, and the only reason I do not still work there is because it didn't pay well enough. In relation to other retail jobs though, I would definitely call their compensation competitive, and the health insurance was great (both FT and PT employees can get insurance, although I believe it is quite costly for PT). I got to work with animals all day and assist people with their pet problems. And I feel that PetSmart genuinely cares about the quality of the work that they do and the pets they sell. There is a definite focus on the care of the pets that you don't see in other pet stores. I have worked at two different locations, and am familiar with management in many Columbus area locations as well, and I have never had a problem working with any of them. I would definitely recommend PetSmart to anyone who loves pets."
good,Relaxed atmosphere. Great learning environment. Employees assistant program really works. The only drawback they do not promote within. My store manager is very enthusiastic and easy to work with.
good,"I have learned a lot working for PetSmart. I feel like a part of a team , all of us working toward one goal and that is our customers are happy and like coming to our store."
good,Employees are encouraged to acknowledge the pets as well as the pet parents. It's almost like getting paid to stop and play with the pups. The discounts are awesome as well!
good,Petsmart is a fast pace job that takes a lot of attention to detail as you work close with all types of animals needing very specific habitats and medical needs.
good,Really loved working at PetSmart but they  were not able to give me full time after working there in multiple positions for 2 years. Also it was minimum wage and I just wasn’t making enough money. Absolutely loved the job though.
good,"I love working there it is a small family. Everyone works together as a team. You get to work with animals all day. See new and regular, you make very good relationship with pet owners and regular customers. i loved working here."
good,After working for Petsmart for three years I am happy with my experience. At times the job is very demanding and it requires time and patience; yet the job is excellent and I’ve made great friends with my coworkers
good,Being a stocker for Petsmart is definitely a competitive job.  It is a race against the clock every single morning.  Employees must be able to lift more than 50lbs at a time and be able to pay close attention to details.
good,"So far things have been great. I have only been working here for about two months. I really like the fact that the rules and regulations really do make things safer for their employers, pet parents, and pets. It is a very busy place to work though, so you must be able to handle multiple tasks at once while also taking care of the well being of yourself and every living being you come in contact with."
good,It's a good company to work at. The job is fairly easy and incredibly fun. I am always happy and looking forward to go to work. The managers are great and very understanding.
good,"Since I am a pet trainer, my typical day at work starts with calling my pet parents, getting ready for the day's classes, editing my class schedule, general cashier help and customer service within the store, and finally teaching the classes scheduled."
good,"I personally never applied to the store I work for. I was a volunteer for the cat adoptions, and was asked to apply with how often I was there for the cats. I have been there for a quite a while and I really have no complaints. We don't pretend we know stuff. Even in the training videos, it says ""its okay to say you don't know."" don't lie to the pet parents. If you don't know, say so, you can always ask a manager or another associate. It did take some time to get used to saying ""Pet Parents"" and ""Can I ASSIST you"" but I like my job. When you own a lot of random pets like I do, it comes in handy to work at a pet store."
good,I was pregnant and high risk so needed something for the time being. They worked with my schedule well and when I was sick they understood and help me get through it!
good,"A person must love animals to work here. There is an issue with communication between stores. Pay is not great, but decent. At times associates are asked to do more than is worth their pay."
good,"I enjoyed my time at PetSmart as I love animals. The work is high paced and you do deal with some, let us say politely, interesting customers. You can tell who really wants to work there and who doesn't."
good,I had fun while i was here. It was a quick paced job. The people were fun to work with. I learned many things I didnt know about different pets. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help fellow pet parents with their furbabies.
good,"It was enjoyable getting to learn new things nearly every time I was in there. Whether it be taking time to visit with pets and their owners, or learning new things about different products to help animals, it was a great place to work."
good,"My experience with PetSmart has and is still a great one. The hours are pretty flexible and the managers are all very kind, understanding, and helpful. Whether it's a first, second, or third job, I do recommend the experience of working at the Willow Grove PetSmart."
good,"The dogs were very loud and the work was not easy, but the sense of accomplishment when all was said and done was well worth it.  Also the money was good and there were tips."
good,"Great Job,Friendly staff , good environment and responsibilities were easy to handle and complete , How can you hate a job where you get to play with dogs all day"
good,"working here was pretty nice, i love working with animals so this gave me that advantage. the people werent exactly the best, seemed like a lot of drama for a place of work. felt like highschool."
good,the workplace is what you'd expect working in retail. However its great being able to meet all the animals and helping their owners. management while i was employed there was extremely resourceful
good,i love working here. i just wish they gave more hours but as part time associate you can only work up to 28 hrs and no more. The environment coworkers are great though and seeing pets all day is a plus. i love it
good,I loved the atmosphere of Petsmart and the productivity at the end of every shift. I learned a lot during my time working at Petsmart and gained more confidence in myself and my abilities.
good,Our days started as soon as we opened and ended at different shifts. We always worked as a team and made sure we all were a family and gave our best every shift we worked. Each summer we could get as much as 170 animals in our hotel at one time. We had our over night workers and then we had our normal day shifts and took turns with them and evening shifts. We also made sure all animals had the correct amount of care each day and night. There were also our extra coupon activities and sales each month. There would be picture times with animals and family and in front of fire place during Christmas and other ones for other holidays. WE ran a very clean and fun environment for all to appreciate every day. We took into  consideration any time a pet was lost or would get loose outside the hotel and made sure that we helped all guests with this or any other problem. Pet Smart Hotel is a very good place to shop and use for your pets and for your employment. Management is always helpful and the most difficult is crazy day camps or clean up time for pet or rooms. Being able to become a part of a pets life and their pet parents lives is very rewarding and the best part of the job. There is always new ways to care for the pets at Pet Smart Hotel and always directions to follow.
good,I loved this job and the team that I worked with. I would recommend this position to anyone who asks. However I had to leave due to poor management making it hard to keep my position. With constant changes to the schedule on a day to day basis without warning. It became an issue and I left the company.
good,I wood like to work at petsmart it is fun work there I wood greet the cumtomer as they come in the store and thank them have them come back to store to
good,"I started at Petsmart when I was 18. It's amazing and fun. You learn so much and your coworkers all love animals as much as you, so it's always a blast. They don't really pay anyone enough to ""live"" off the salary, but when your fresh out of highschool or in college it will definitely cover what you need it to. I stayed on Part Time for 7 years because it was just such a fun working environment."
good,I work all positions so it gets a bit crazy sometimes abut the job is nice. Hours are less then wanted at times. Pay is not the worst. Always have something to do.
good,"When I worked for Petsmart in Sherman Tx, I started off as a cashier then got moved up to the fish department. I got paid weekly. The store manager helped me whenever she could and had wonderful customer service."
good,"I really enjoy working at petsmart. Every one that works there does a little bit of everything in which we all help one another out and try our best to support everyone. I really enjoy that i get to work in close quarters with animals and also their owners because you get to meet different personalities and also you get to see just how owners get to interact with their pet and they like to teach you new things as well. Most of the time you get to stay pretty busy at the store with helping clean, stock shelves, help a customer, or care for the animals we sell."
good,I really enjoy my job but they keep hiring people and not giving the people there the hours they deserve. They give the hours to new people. If I could get more hours and make at least 9.00hr i would definitely stay.
good,"PetSmart was a great place to work. Everyone who worked there had a genuine love for animals and it made a very fun and enjoyable work environment. Management at a store level was great but at a district level was very difficult to work for. Standards were not equal for every store and made for some difficult work relationships. Working retail is not for everyone, especially during peak seasons, but it definitely gave me a lot of skills in dealing and working with the general public"
good,"If you love dogs, this is the place for you. You get to interact with every kind of dog and truly can show your passion and enthusiasm for animals. "
good,As a new groomer you can’t beat Petsmart.  It’s very rare to find any retail company that offers the benefits that Petsmart provides.  You can actually support a family as a Petsmart groomer
good,"If you love pets and pet people, this is the place for you! Friendly and caring staff, great products, and fun opportunities to meet new pets make this job worth while."
good,"Petsmart is a wonderful place to work and I would recommend it to anyone looking for work. The pay isn't great, but the management is amazing and helpful and are willing to teach you new skills."
good,great place to work if you love animals! friendly and understanding coworkers. i learnt a lot about customer service and the right way to treat and care for customers.
good,"I worked in the salon as a bather. I didn't like how the groomers treated us like servants, because they work for commission. But the actual job was great. I got to spend all day with dogs. lol awesome."
good,I worked for PetSmart for over 2 years and in every department and not once did I come across a negative person. Everybody was always uplifting and passionate about their job. PetSmart cultivates a positive atmosphere and produces happy employees AND customers. Such a great experience working there.
good,"Love working at petsmart, but the pay is horrible especially for supporting a family."
good,"Great place to work, ready for a change in life and career.. I learned alot about being an agent of change and a motivator of the masses. The hardest part of the job is home office folks have never, in most cases, worked in a store. They have no idea what it takes to run a store and to accomplish all of the tasks and goals set forth."
good,"if you like animals, and you like helping people with their pets...then this is a perfect place to work. you meet alot of new pet parents and you get to learn from other associates"
good,"I like it, the animals are fun and adorable. co-workers are nice, customers are usually easy to deal with. One of the managers I can't figure out if it's just his personality or if he gets annoyed super easily, he's not bad to work for though"
good,"Very slow for now, learned how to bathe dogs and learning how to groom, management is slacking, workplace is fun, hardest part smiling all the time, dogs"
good,"Great mission and goals."
good,"I enjoyed working for PetSmart, I get to meet new people along knowing their pets, its very proactive never a doll moment the Coworkers and Supervisor where very cool and courteous. if I would get the opportunity to work for PetSmart I definitely would."
good,"I loved Petsmart, I liked meeting and greeting all the customers and their pets as they came into the store. The atmosphere working there was usually upbeat.  The hardest part of the job for me was closing, we had to straighten up the entire store after a busy day it could get pretty messy.  My managers were great and worked with me on my schedule to allow me to come after I dropped my kids off at school and be off when it was time to pick them up. I usually only worked one day on the weekend. Which gave me time with my family."
good,if you can sustain a busy moist day around lovable dogs then working in pet smart salon is the right thing for you. bathing brushing cleaning out their ears there wasn't a moment i didn't enjoy around them.
good,Constantly work available whether on the phones or fulfilling orders in the warehouse.  Product knowledge is helpful when dealing with customers on the telephone
good,"It's an awesome place to work, management is amazing. They will take you into consideration with regards to your schedule. I love working with all my co-workers, they will help you out to the best of their abilities."
good,"Petsmart was a fun workplace to be at. I love animals and working/meeting new people. I would interact with the animals daily, clean the cages, feed them, help answer customers questions, take out garbage, sweep and mop floors."
good,"I really enjoy working for Petsmart the customers bring in their pets every day.  We had one customer who would come in and bring their monkeys with them.  I thought that was pretty cool, you never know what your gonna see day to day.  Management overall was very nice never had a day I didn't want to go to work.  Our main goal is helping the pet parent find what they are looking for.  I'd say the hardest part of the job was planner when cat food or dog food needed to be reset, everything was all over the place, was hard to find the label.  The best part of the job was seeing people and their pet leave happy."
good,I love working at PetSmart.  I get to meet many animal customers who I have come to know by name.  Working with other animal lovers is also very rewarding.
good,I overall had a very great experience and loved the atmosphere. I felt very accepted by the management. I'm aiming for earlier hours than night shifts!
good,"What isn't fun about spoiling animals? I loved working there since we had many of our own animals, mainly reptiles."
good,its not a bad company to work for but some of distract manager do know what they are doing and it take a great team to get the job done right. hard word pays off.
good,Love working with animals and people!love helping pet parents with making decisions on what they purchase for their animals.love interacting with the pet parents to make sure they are well informed about all of our products and how we can help make their pets lives easier.
good,High volume inbound call center. Highly motivated employees were knowledgeable on pet products being sold through the company. Management team and sales team worked very well together and it was a joy to work with everyone.
good,"typical day at work:"
good,I loved working at Petsmart. It was a wonderful experience where I got to work around animals and learn new things everyday about animals. My supervisors and coworkers were really friendly and nice. We all worked well as a team.
good,Fun work place with constant change and evolving culture. Great work/life balance in retail. Allows for a lot of development within each store
good,"Although advancement was a challenge, you were always encouraged to develop your knowledge and skills.  Co-workers generally had trouble in the beginning learning the team concept but once on board joined in developing a unity of the team."
good,The job itself is fun and busy work always have something to do. All the managers are nice and work hard. Hard to move up though and pay is impossible to get up. Worked their for a year and only got a 18 cent raise in that entire time. I would still work at petsmart if I could have gotten full time and a decent pay check.
good,good company to work for. high energy needed for the weekends. management was great and accepting. allowed to have tattoos and piercings no colored hair
good,"Was a good job, it is fun working with this customer base. The downside was it took forever to get a decent promotion, and they don't always promote from within they will skip a well qualified individual within the company to hire from the outside"
good,"my day would start at 7:00 am"
good,"Petsmart is a good place to work. You'll be able to learn a lot about pet products, food and other miscellaneous knowledge that can come in handy."
good,The store was constantly busy since it is the only of its kind in this area. Working in the grooming salon was the best. Got good hours and made excellent tips daily. Long hours and hard work though.
good,Great work done here. Fun place to work. Nice managers very helpful people. great environment.
good,My current position at Petsmart is a Pet-care associate. I am required to provide adequate food and water to animals on a daily basis and advise customers with their shopping experience. I learned how to care for types kinds of animals.  The hardest part of the job was contending with our unceasing inventory.
good,"I love the company i work for but i just find my self constantly having to juggle my school life and personal life due to the up and down hours and times i have to work. I just wish for more of a set schedule and i know it has a lot to do with management, but maybe some sort of policy could change things?"
good,"I loved working at petsmart, its pretty easy to advance into a higher position. All my coworkers were really good people to work with...I would work there again."
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work, it had great benifits and nice people from customers to co workers. Working there was probably one of the best things that i loved doing. I worked hard and i loved my job. Helping customers and the animals made me feel like a better person. The management was great as well and the co workers all worked hard day or night. I would work for them anytime if they asked me to come back."
good,"Basic retail environment"
good,Petsmart was one of the best jobs I've ever had and wish I didn't have to leave.
good,"Petsmart has changed my life...as cashier/customer sevice rep I encounter many different situations, all of them learning opportunity. All my managers do their best to balance staff and customer needs; they have all been supportive and respectful."
good,"I enjoy coming to work, never a dull moment. I learn new things everyday. Get to interact with so many customers and get to learn about their pets. Everybody that works there is a team player."
good,PetSmart was one of my favorite jobs I have wroked at because everyone was so friendly and understanding.
good,"Petsmart has been one of the most enjoyable job I have. A typical work day for me was supervising associates, assisting customers, and playing with dogs and cats. I have learned an abundance of information about pets that I will take with me forever. The management at my store was excellent, he was able to get things done without micromanaging. I have made many life long friends with my co-workers. I was the best man at one of their weddings. The hardest part of my job was being required to work all major holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job were taking care of the pets and customers."
good,I was a lead cashier and also a product stocker. All of the managers were very kind and helpful with assisting both customers and employees. I was able to learn very useful customer service skills
good,Great Company. They really care about their employees. A great corporate culture and lots of great benefits.
good,I loved the environment and people. I was promised to be promoted to pet care but it never happened.
good,"It's a good place to work especially if you are animal focused, good benefits and pay scale for the grooming industry. There is a good management team to help you achieve your goals."
good,i loved working with animals it’s what i’ve always wanted to do but the manager was very rude and snobby and i told hr many of time times and none did anything about it so i quit because i could not take being in a environment where i was constantly put down by her.
good,"I would still be working there if it wasnt for the fact that I had to move for college. Super fun, engaging job with plenty of work to do, and a great way to share your knowledge of animals."
good,Pet smart was the best job I've had so far. I loved my coworkers and managers and even the customers were pleasant to be around! This company really takes care of their employee's
good,"Working at Petsmart is such an amazing experience to have. Being surrounded by puppies, dogs, cats, birds , etc is such a nice feeling and very therapeutic!"
good,I very much enjoyed working at Petsmart and loved working with the animals. It is certainly a very full job and you are never bored on the job. The training doesn't give nearly enough information on proper care and there are some issues with the husbandry but it is overall a very good place and everyone really does care about the animals.
good,This job was a very good fit for me because it was filled with dogs and some cats. You will never have a moment of down time but that makes the shift go by faster. You will be a part of a big family in the salon.
good,Enjoyed every aspect working for this company. The store lacked inventory but still offered plenty of services for customers. Animals were taken care of quickly and with out hesitation. The staff kept the store clean and organized. Wonderful experience.
good,Amazing pets  fun to work there  good co workers. I loved meeting new pets and building relationships with customers and pets.  I was excited to see the regular customers each week.
good,Loved it there they were a very incredible company to work for. I had an awesome time meeting new people and being able to interact with all of the wonderful pets.
good,Management is super friendly and great to work with. Learned alot about animals and their maintenance. Best part of the job is getting to see all of the animals.
good,"The interview process was quick and to the point."
good,I loved working at petsmart. I started as a cashier and left a pet care associate. It’s a fun place to work if you like animals and like helping people find solutions to their pet care needs!
good,"Great place to work, management is wonderful as well. I learned alot there from working as a team to working in a salon environment. I would recommend any one to work there"
good,"if you love animals this is the place to work. As a sales job, you will need to have some level of competition, but all my coworkers were always fun to be around. The hours were very flexible with my school schedule, which was probably the hardest part of the day, and I could get more hours by doing stocking in the early hours which was very beneficial. Plus you get to see puppies every day!!"
good,Petsmart is a company that changes direction  often. They keep you on your toes. But I believe that is simply one of the expectations in retail? Retail is a tough business and developing applications while trying to run the business is tough.
good,"The management team is so great, I still go back with my dog and the managers know me by name. They are professional and helpful and the workplace is very fun to be in if you love animals."
good,"My time spent working there was really fun and exciting , the events we planned were always different and very cute to be apart of, the greatest part was the managers are all very nice and understanding of your abilites and challenges and work with you to get you to where you need to be at to succeed in the position you are trying too!"
good,There is a easy and set routine at work that is very simple to follow and will make work go by smooth and fast. My co workers are fairly nice and cooperative and teamwork is the main skill that you need for this job.
good,"I would say that if you personally dont ,"
good,"Working at PetSmart was super fun, the employees are upbeat and the customers were always upbeat as well. Working with the animals and seeing people bring in their dogs was always fun. The pay isn't great, and it's hard to get full time."
good,"a typical day is slow and helping customers (depending on the day) with concerns they may have for their pet or a pet they want. i've learned a lot about different kinds of animals while working here (ex: feeding snakes once a week, reptiles can't have tap water without reptisafe)"
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking care of all the animals in the store, that means feeding, cleaning, and caring for their overall health while maintaining excellent customer service. This type of work environment really teaches you to value all the animal species in the store, and that there's always an opportunity to learn something new. The management and all other associates are always willing to guide you if you have any doubts. It's really an excellent work environment for any pet lover and for students that love animals."
good,"Working with the animals and being hands on is really exciting and fun, the pay is good if your willing to put in the hours. "
good,the job i work in is the pethotel and its very fun you get to spend the day with dogs and get to just chill most of the time. the staff is very friendly and they all care for the animals and want the best.
good,"I enjoyed this job, except for the hours.  No set schedule.  You can not usually have a bad day working around animals.  When kids come in with their parents to adopt a new pet, the excitement they feel is infectious!"
good,Nice company to work for. Working with pets is very calming and fun. There are opportunities to learn more every day. The most difficult thing was being paid by commission and hoping that co-workers would be fair in setting up appointments.
good,"A lot of the cashiers are younger and it is there first job. As long as you can look past the inmaturity, it is a great place to work with good benefits."
good,Great job to work at people are friendly and if you do your job everything will be easy depends on your work ethics but other then that I had fun there
good,"Petsmart was a great job, however I am looking to become a salon lead/manager and they aren’t hiring, that is why I am looking to find a new job. I am wanting to advance with my job."
good,"Working at Petsmart has been a very fun and fulling job. I love working with both the pets and the pet parents. I am type person of who loves all animals, so finding a job where I can take care of them is a nice thing to have, it feels like I'm doing what I love."
good,The job was amazing. I had the pleasure to interact with many creatures that I dont encounter on a daily basic. I made many great relationships with my co workers and customers.
good,Best part of the jobs were all the animals. Worst part of the job was you couldn't really explore different positions. Could not evolve into something more.
good,sometimes trying to get resets done on-time cause be over welming because they don't allow enough hours to complete the task. management is pretty easy to get along with.
good,"Good people to work with"
good,Very faced paced and high demand. As long as you don't have a family great place to work for. Weekends and holidays are required so be ready to give those up.
good,I highly enjoyed working here. The only reason I left was because I got pregnant and working two jobs is tough. The managers and the people were great to work with.
good,Great place to work if you could get the hours promised. The people are great and if you like animals this is the place to work. You get good discounts for being an employee.
good,"Simple job, good for students who need to make a few extra bucks. Working at the Pets-hotel means interaction with dogs and cats on a daily basis. You are entrusted to care for dogs and cats who are deeply loved by their own owners."
good,"I adored my job at Petsmart. My days usually including harcuts on 6 or more dogs. I enjoyed interacting with customers and pets. The workplace had a very high stress-level. The hardest part of the job was the stress and the amount of scrutiny we were under by the company. My manager was decent. She was very high strung. All in all, I learned to trust my instincts. I learned that doing a good job, and being on task without bringing personal things to work would be most beneficial."
good,Best part is seeing all different pets coming in to the store and helping customers find here forever pet. Always busy but never a dull moment. Really great to work with all of the animals in the store
good,"very fast paced job. lots of safety policies to follow (reasonable because you are working hands on with live pets), can be stressful at times, the hardest part of the job is the physical strain it takes on the body."
good,"PetSmart had a wonderful approach to customer service and made it comfortable to work at the same time. Management is sometimes promoted on a popularity scale, rather than whom the best associates may be."
good,"Checked in clients in grooming salon, answered questions for customers about petcare, food and over the counter medications. Helped customers pick right pet for them and their family."
good,The hours were flexible and worked really well with my personal and school life and activities. I loved working with then animals and the people who usually shop there are kind so it was always fun.
good,"Fun place to work at, loved my coworkers and managers. Had regulars in the store and got to know their pets and regularly help them with problems. Left because it was too much to balance two jobs and school, and I was making more money at my other job."
good,"I loved my time at Petsmart. If more opportunities were available I would have stayed with them for much longer. A typical day would look like extinguishing all associate fires in conflicts with eachother or customers. My managers have always been incredibly supportive people. The hardest parts was the inconsistent hours and the corporate demands with little to know recognition for the ""little guys."" My favorite parts of my job was the staff, these are just simply great people."
good,I first started out working on the floor as a cashier and sales associate. I then was moved to work in the Petshotel.  I learned a lot of different skill sets and marketing strategies from my time at Petsmart.
good,"Besides some drama working there was amazing.  The pet parents,  the animals I got to play with on a daily was worth any drama.  I worked the hotel and worked art he front desk  booking appointments.  As well as in the day care room"
good,Pet parents are great. Enjoyed working in the PetsHotel. Working in the hotel was very fast paced but never boring. Management was very easy to work with along with other co-workers.
good,"All of my coworkers are nice and make sure that things are going well and help when help is needed. I feel comfortable asking for assistance if needed. You also receive 15% off when you start working, which has definitely come handy."
good,"Leaving this job is going to be hard for me but I have better opportunities I cannot pass up. The team they have built is so absolutely amazing, always willing to help, always caring, friendly. Management is super understanding and flexible willing to work with you and around you schedule with proper reasoning and notice."
good,I was a cashier for petsmart for 3 years. The work is easy. The managers were nice in my store and I never really had a problem taking days of when I needed them.
good,"Everyone at my location enjoys working there, as do I. I would recommend working here, as long as you are serious about your work and really considerate with ALL the animals; they are family to each and every one customer and mean more to them than you think."
good,"A typical day at work is stocking, cleaning, working with the pets, and customer service."
good,I love working here. It is the perfect first job for dog and cat lovers that work hard. All the people are kind and so are the pet parents. In all this is the perfect place for a good job with caring people all around.
good,I love everyone at Petsmart. Working here is great.I worked with amazing people and customers. I close the store and managed the money. I have dealt with some customers who are not happy but i think over all i dealt with them great.
good,"Petsmart is as laid back as it gets. With the right management, and a great team, being a pet care associate is the dream job. You can learn so much about your basic pets that you never knew about before. the training and resources here equip you to always have the right answers for customers. Working with customers can be rewarding because they are usually laid back people if they have a pet. Task completion can be complicated on a busy day so time management is essential. Helping a customer save money is more rewarding than you may think. What goes around, comes around."
good,"This place is fun and active. I love working at the Pets hotel. Taking care of cats and dogs is not the hars part. The hard part is seeing them go home because you end up bonding with the animals. The people that work here are so passionate for animals. The associates come back just to see which ones are there because they love them. Its a great, fun, energetic and understanding work environment."
good,"Working at PetSmart was one of the best employment experiences I have ever had. Though it was only seasonal, working with animals and looking after them was more than a way of income. It was getting to know the compassionate staff who set examples of hard work and meeting every animal's singular needs. We all had an important responsibility to look after, play with, and dedicate ourselves to the animals for their comfort and well being. Never did I wake up one morning, dreading going to work. It was in fact, quite the opposite."
good,"I was on a great team that traveled to all of the distribution centers throughout the year. My manager was always there to assist me with whatever I needed. Workplace culture was mostly good, however there was a bonus that we competed for and I didn't see that as fair to all of the people on the supply chain team."
good,"Petsmart was a very rewarding job experience for me. Great management and customers alike, and I made a lot of great relationships that have lasted to today."
good,Overall a great company to work for; my store is still a relatively new store and because business is slow they cut the hours of part time employees
good,At my time of Employment there were a few problims with Drama in the work place thought it seems to have been taken care of now. it is a very fun place to work and if you love animals even the bad days will be worth it.
good,"I love working At Petsmart, it's laid back and fun but when something needs to be we just do management doesn't tell us what is needed done. The managers work with u and help anyway they can."
good,"I loved Petsmart, I loved waking up at 5 am and getting to feed and water all the little sleeping animals and baby the sick ones in the back and teach kids about them. this is every bit a dream job you would imagine it being, but it still has a few down sides..."
good,As a part time employee I enjoyed  working for PetSmart. My job wasn't glamorous but I got it done. I really enjoyed when I was to work the customers and the management was the best.
good,I truly enjoyed my time with this company and felt at home with them. The basic day to day stayed the same with assisting customers and running the business but every day was something new. Pet Care is an ever fluid area of change and in order to excel and stay in the industry for long periods of time you had to be adaptable and always willing to learn as new innovations were presented.
good,Great place to work. You cant have a bad day when there is always a puppy coming through the door. Basic customer service and retail skills.
good,"Great place to work at if you love pets, hours fluctuate. Good part time job and can easily move up if you work hard enough. easily to get along with co workers."
good,"The people are so welcoming, and friendly, makes you feel excited to go to work. I work in the grooming salon and it is like a family in there, everyone gets along so great, there is always laughing. It's a wonderful environment to work in. The hardest part about my job is dealing with some uncooperative dogs, but its also the most enjoyable part of my job. I have learned patience, how to control stress in stressful environments,  and how to handle unhappy customers in a professional manner."
good,"Great place to work and grow! Love going and seeing and playing with all of the dogs. If you want to learn about exotic pets, then this would be a great place to start!"
good,PetSmart was a good job with a great environment. I had a lot of fun working with the animals and providing information to families looking for a new pet. The management was great and I had the most amazing coworkers.
good,management is pretty helpful and cool. not the best starter job. has to be ready to handle whatever comes. grooming dogs is not easy. prior animal handling experience necessary.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at PetSmart. The store staff is always friendly and easy to work with, and the managers are very approachable. I never feel truly stressed out after a long day of work. Which greatly helps me pursue my academic life."
good,PetSmart has given me the necessary experience working with animals while also providing excellent customer service.
good,Petsmart is a fun place to work.  The people there love animals and have a great sense of humor about their jobs.  They adhere properly to all safety regulations and protocols.  I trust the PetsHotel completely with the care of my pet.
good,"I loved this place.  Easy job if you can talk to people.  A little frustrating at times, mostly because of co-workers who don't seem to  want to treat the animals how they should be."
good,"I was a cashier at Pet Smart for the few months I worked there. I have a passion for animals and I LOVED being around them everyday. I had ""regulars"" that would come in and see me and know me instantly and talk away. I knew them, their needs, and their pet like they were someone in my family. This job was one I'll remember forever. My coworkers were absolutely amazing. I loved going to work because I knew I was going to see friends! These people can work and help costumers with questions one on one and still be some of the greatest people you will meet! I loved Pet Smart everyday I worked there."
good,"Kinda hard to mess this up. Easy to understand, easy to learn, typical positions for a retail/department store. Animal care and meeting new pets were the perks. Not a glorious or high paying job."
good,This is my very first job while I'm still in high school it was like one big happy family we all had each others backs and we all helped out
good,"PetSmart is a fun place to work, if you love animals. The only problem would be that management can be hard on you sometimes for stuff that you can not control."
good,"Pet-Smart's managerial team had adapted a wonderful ""open door policy"" for all of the employees which created a great trusting and cooperative environment and work ethic. I had a great time training my peers as well as learning from them during my time at PetSmart and I loved the family-like atmosphere that surrounded us as a collective. As with every job, the potential for challenges was there as well as difficulties that took a collective effort to get through, but knowing that the resources and support was there was just the incentive needed to get through whatever obstacle was placed before my team and I."
good,"A typical day at work for a cashier- you come to work, go to your register or go on the sales floor and help customers, do returns, or help speciality. If you're closing, you stay a bit later to help clean up. I learned so much about pets working here. You learn a lot. I also learned a lot about being a leader, because you do get the opportunities to lead the team in various ways. I love the management at my stores. It's definitely a lot of different personalities, and everyone's amazing in their own way. The managers are understanding, and give the associates opportunities to move up. The co-workers are good, too. They're all nice and will talk to you. The hardest part is remembering everything because it's alot of learning and it is a big store. When you get the hang of it, it's a pretty easy job. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing all the puppies and sometimes they become regulars and you get to watch them grow and become adults and that's always fun. If you love animals, you will love this job"
good,Enjoyable. Need to find something I can use my degree. I loved working with everyone but I want to branch out and actually use my degree. Learning about all the animals was a good start. I love the science aspect of petcare.
good,"Customer service, time management, reviewing products and services with customers, promoting and executing sales."
good,A typical day would involve being welcomed by the Petsmart team and reviewing any needed improvements. Petsmart had a more than welcoming and efficient team. I enjoyed seeing animals and assisting pet owners.
good,working at pet smarts was a good place to work as I work with lots of animals and meet a lot of costmoer to who I had to help out with thing I also and to look after all the animals in the shore to
good,"Nothing but good things to say about this company. I loved working here so so much."
good,"Not only do you work all day with animals, but you get to light up families lives with a new pet! You may have to clean cages, but you also get to nurse sick animals back to health. You unfortunately have to handle crickets and fish and reptiles, but at the same time, you are caring for a creature that will be going into a family soon. Work hours are set ahead of time, and they are really great with flexibility. Never short on hours, and most employees are so kind to work with."
good,"Managers were very willing to help associates on any tasks. Also gave a lot of responsibility to employees on selling, negotiating, or saving a sale."
good,"A typical day for me in Pet Care is making sure the department is running smoothly.  From deep cleaning habitats in the morning, to making sure other associates have done their responsibilities properly, to making sure shelves are stocked and customers happy.  The management has been great, overall.  I have really learned how to manage people well, in a better environment than the banking world that I came from."
good,"stocking, setting up displays, and helping customers. i learned a lot at these job like how to operate a forklift. the management was pretty good tell the end of my time there. most o my co-workers where hard to work with. putting up with some of my co- workers. helping customers."
good,"come in help customers enjoy conversations with your co workers and customers"
good,"I show up to my job at 6am and start my day in the back, organizing which boxes will be broke down to be placed on the shelves. Opening the store by 9 we need to at least have most of the pallets done i allow typically a hour per pallet. Once the store is open I would either be assigned to a cashier or stay as a stocker. Most of the time I stay as stock. While being in stock you still need to provide customer service by asking customers if they need help finding anything or if i could provide information on any product they might not know too much about. I enjoy my job every time i go in there is always a new experience."
good,Giant Corporation with Good benefits and lots of opportunity for advancement and learning all aspects of pet care.
good,"I find pleasure in fulfilling the customers need. I have gained praise from my managers and supervisors; they are very motivating. I carry out every task with great responsibility, no matter how small. It is important to plan out your daily tasks and execute them with efficiency and within a reasonable time frame. "
good,"A typical day as a dog groomer includes lots of sloppy kisses and belly rubs.  The interaction with the Pet Parents is largely focused on determining how they view the end result.  I listen closely to what they are saying, repeat it back in my own words, and print out a service card with instructions that the rest of the staff would understand as well.  "
good,"I would have anywhere from 3-8 dogs in one day. The management was a little loose on the enforcing of the rules, but overall good. I loved my co-workers. The hardest part was the fast pace, but it was nothing unmanageable."
good,"great place to work for , not all the managers are great but every once in a while one person will shine bright. the job is only as good as you want it to be ... but it is a great place to learn a lot"
good,"PetSmart has a great leadership training program for in store management. Advancement can be attained very quickly with proactive-positive performance. "
good,"I will deal with customers on a daily basis. Some examples of what I do when interacting with customers is:"
good,"I loved working with the customers and pets"
good,"PetSmart is a very busy and lively retail environment which allows people to bring their pets into the store. There are several different aspects to this company from Dog training to Grooming and the PetsHotel. All of the PetSmart associates and managers have a great love for animals which in turn creates a very happy, positive work environment. This is a great option for students who love animals to seek employment. There is much room for advancement for individuals looking to stay within the retail and PetCare environment."
good,"Arrive at 4 am unload truck into shipping area, check manifest, supply store with goods. Once stocking is completed continue to provide costumer service while improving look and placement of store goods."
good,"very easy "
good,"I was the lead cashier, pet care, customer service, stocking and then became a bather.  Fun job if you love pets!"
good,I have a passion for loving animals. One of my best experiences working as an assistant groomer. Showing animals compassion was the best feeling.
good,Petsmart is an enjoyable job for someone who enjoys working with dogs and cats and who loves to see the improvement they help to accomplish in pet behaviours. This workplace is never the same and very fast paced. It als gives you many different jobs to do within the workplace so that you are never bored of just doing one thing over and over again. 
good,"The flexibility with my schedule is great, management is pretty laid back. The Salon Manager is very competent and stays on top of things. Store Manager genuinely cares about his employees. Most customers are friendly and love their pets! I like that my job gives me the opportunity to educate Pet Parents on things such as flea/tick products as well as proper maintainence of dogs' coat, skin, nails, ears and teeth! "
good,"Things are great. Sometimes a little busy, and dramatic but great none the less."
good,"Working for Petsmart is definitely a joy. The company in general is fantastic to their workers and their main focus is EVERYTHING customer service. 'Pet Parents' come before any and everything else. They strive to make a positive work environment and provide each and every associate what they need to advance - whether it be into management, or just to excel in a certain department within their store. The scheduling is simple, the base pay is good, the breaks are fantastic and you learn a lot from this job mainly because of all the hands-on, customer oriented interaction you get and receive. The only downside is that now, you cannot receive more than 28 hours per week if you are part-time. Their scheduling system will not allow it whatsoever, whereas before, a part-time associate could get upwards of 30 to even 40 hours every week if they are good at their job and lucky! Because of this hour cut issue, many associates are striving to find other means of employment or at least look for second/third jobs. Unfortunatly, there are no at home/web based jobs for this company unless you are a part of corporate (and live in Phoenix, Arizona) or in Human Resources. "
good,"*A typical day at work includes, working with customers and their pets. It is my job to give pet parents an enjoyable experience with Pet Smart."
good,There are three essential parts to working as a PetSmart associate:
good,I would have stayed at PetSmart but I had to travel a great distance to get there. Loved working there as the environment is great.
good,Is a good company to work for. they only allow you to work part time unless you are in salon or management. the mangers are always willing to work with you on situations and they are willing to help you learn but not so willing to let you have a job advancement.
good,help customers find their needs learned alot about the pet industry and basic knowledge of how to run store inventory and customer relations great co-workers didnt find any part of job hard most enjoyable was meeting new people
good,Opening the store and getting cash drawers counted before leaving the safe room to distrubute them to the 4 registers. Logging in shipments. I learned how to multi-task proficently and and motivate co-workers to stay focused on they're jobs thru praise and a variety of incentives. Keeping supplies in the store most times that all my customers wanted. Serving people the way I loved to be served and watching them smile and compliment the service they recieved in our stores. I pride myself in inspiring co-workers and myself to give smiles first along with great customer service. The employee wins first cause smiling makes you feel good no matter what else may be going on. And customers are much more inclined to buy and return where they feel cared for and served well with a smile.
good,"I learned a lot about the distribution side of retail work. Advanced through positions within the company. Learned about supervision, work flow, inventory control."
good,"A typical day working for this company was like giving candy to kids,it was awesome.I learned alot about pets and how to operate the forklift,the management was great.My co-workers were the best,we had lunch partys all the time.The hardest part of the job was looking out for secret shoppers,and the most enjoyable part of the job was the team work."
good,I was fortunate enough to be hired into the number one store in the company with the number one area trainer. This allowed my dog training skills to go far beyond that of a normal store trainer. I loved both the store manager and area trainer. The best part of the job was getting the chance to talk with and help fellow dog lovers.
good,"A typical day at work would start out with customers needing assistance finding an object or having questions about something towards an item or there pet. I learned about all the different types of animals and there needs whats best for them as in food toys and other products from dogs to cats reptiles and rodents (Mice,Rabbits ect.)Management was always helpful when having questions about stuff that eaither customers nor co-workers knew the answer to. They also kept up in doing a good job with telling employees what needed to be done during opening time and closing time. As for my co-workers they were very easy to work with and helped out alot when i asked some were difficult when i would ask for assistance but the job got done. There was Nothing really to hard about working for Petsmart you just have to be quik and constantly on your feet. The thing i loved most about working at Petsmart was seen all the different pets that would come into the store with there owners learning about them and bieng able to pet them and give them treats."
good,I throughly enjoyed working at petsmart. They train very well and advance quickly. Also offer other advancement opportunities.
good,Working here has taught me a lot. The staff here are always super friendly. Never judgemental. Always looking out for you to succeed.  Willing to teach.
good,"At Petsmart, there are lots of learning opportunities when it comes to interacting with pets and customers. This job gives you great customer service training to assure that their employees meet at customer satifactions during their visit to the store. PetSmart has great work advancements and a flexible schedule to accommodate your needs."
good,I enjoy working for the company it’s very nice and laid back with nice co workers and pets and the pet owners are nice also. Good experience and good hours
good,Management takes care of their employees and cares about their levels of comfort as well as their effort on the work floor. Pay was very good and I can’t wait to hopefully return.
good,Each day is never the same except when it comes to making sure all animals are taken care of. Other than that there is always something new to learn and do in your store.
good,This is tge most amazing job I've ever worked at! I love it an never want to leave. It would just be nice if they were willing to pay the part time employees a more livable wage for the work they do.
good,I loved working with the dogQQs and cats. I loved being able to relieved of stress cause I was around animals I love. The manager and coworkers made sure we had a way to work and had the help we needed. We looked out for eachother. If your not comfortable doing a task their always someone else willing to help.
good,great place to work. positive working environment. customer service is hard. but mostly enjoyable customers. hours are good and pay is well if you work hard and deserve it
good,This was as great job. I worked there for a year and would still be there if health issues hadn't come up. The only issue is there isn't a lot of areas of advancement.
good,"It's a fulfilling job to work with the animals and help people understand the care of them more, but the customer service aspect is what kills it. Still a good experience overall though"
good,"I used to work here taking care of the animal habitats, I would always come back home extremely tired from all the hard work I had to do because it's a very physical demanding job but I never complained once of being stressed out or being treated poorly by customers. It's a very fun job to have, in all honesty I wish I could of stayed but getting $ .05 and only working less than 20 hrs a weeks wasn't enough for me."
good,Absolutely loved caring for the animals and returning customers. I loved the knowledge I learned about each and every pet. I enjoyed my managers and still enjoy interacting when I come in to shop .
good,"Have worked there 7 years. Love the job. Great management team.  Would like to see better pay,  feel like they do need a better training  program as far as new trainers"
good,"I stared as a cashier when I first got hired, friendly staff and environment, pet parents where always nice and eager to have a better understanding of their pets, later I promoted to pet care associate and worked with taking care as well as selling animals for a forever hone"
good,"I have loved working at petsmart, they have taught me many things and have given me many skills to take with me wherever i go. Great place with great people."
good,"Getting to work at petsmart is fulfilling because you are able to help pet parents make educated decisions on supplies and care for their pets, you also get to meet some strange people and some really cool pets."
good,"I always had something to do when I came into work. There were never really any slow days. It was always go go go, which was nice. I learn many skills through there monthly training program."
good,"I worked in the petcare department while also being a cashier when needed. As soon as you get your job down, it is so easy. Don't slack off if you are in petcare because you are working with animals not just products."
good,You will meet a lot of people. See a lot of animals. They have different areas to work at. Management was really complicated. Co-workers were awesome to work with.
good,I love this place not only for the people but also for the dogs. It’s a fun yet challenging environment. The pay is low but it’s a good extra pocket cash if you need it.
good,I learned an invaluable amount of information about animals and how to provide the best care for them and the nutritional value of most animal food brands
good,Petsmart pets hotel is a productive and fun place to work if you love to interact with dogs and cats alike. Employees make you feel welcome and at home.
good,This is a great company to have many opportunities for experience and careers. They strive hard to set a positive and happy atmosphere for their employees.
good,"Working at Petsmart was a great overall job. The management was great, the customers were great. Petsmart is a very welcoming community, where the love for animals is fantastic. The dedication towards the customers as well as the employees is very overwhelming,"
good,Absolutely loved working at PetSmart if you love animals then this is a definitely a good place to work. Working in the Pet Care Department was a little stressful having to take care of all the animals and deal with customers management was poor and the hours were okay the only benefit of working here is if you loved animals
good,"Assisted customers on a daily basis, with decision making, and answering any questions or concerns regarding their pet or items."
good,I worked in the hotel and it was a lot of fun. You worked on a team to maintain the animals that stayed within the hotel. This is a good job to start with if you never had a job before.
good,"Coming to work at about 4 am and breaking down the received pallets, or working their stock in the back room. I learned even greater time management skills, team work and work place safety. Management was a fun extremely helpful group. The coworkers were some of the most fun colorful people I've worked with. It was also nice having lots of regulars with some beautiful animals coming in. The hardest part of the job was often I'd work 12 hour shifts that were fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around animals all day and being able to interact with almost all the animals."
good,"PetSmart puts the pets first and that is important, but there are may policies and procedures to follow and the changing schedule can make for a stressful experience"
good,"scanning items then shipping them. scanning carts, loading the trucks, anything they wanted me to do . it is a big a warehouse. It was very hard work lifting up heavy."
good,I loved working a PetSmart.  My co-workers there truly loved animals and were fun to be around.  I gained a lot of valuable experience while studied to get my CPDT-KA certification.
good,A typical day would be clock in and make sure the registers are clean and ready for business day to begin. Make sure that all stock and shelves are fronted. Greet customers in a professional and warm manner. The workplace culture is very friendly and exciting especially when customers bring in their pets to the store. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to spend with all the amazing animals that come in the store. The best part of the job is the people you work with.
good,"The work was mostly quick paced and collaborative because you’re working with animals who are often energetic and require exercising, grooming and cleaning after. The collaborative part comes in ensuring the animals are safe and cared for in regards to the guidelines and tasks in place."
good,"need more hours, more positions for part time employees, more store meetings explaining new policies, more training for managers on how to handle employee relations"
good,"A variety of duties such as scheduling and payroll. Customer Service is priority of course. Making sure the pet parents needs are meet."
good,Love my job! I love getting to see all the cute animals people bring into the store. Makes my day so much brighter! Never a dull day. Everyone is so welcoming. Work is easy and never too stressful!
good,"I live working here, it is clean, almost everyone is extremely friendly and customers are almost always happy. I have had to diffuse a few customers but it is not too hard if you play your cards right."
good,"A regular day in the grooming salon is fun and fulfilling, being able to enjoy the dogs that come in is the best way to spend the day."
good,Really enjoyed being able to work with animals everyday.  The other employees were friendly and team players. Required a lot to be a team leader but it was worth it and made sure I knew what was required of me
good,"I really liked my job at petsmart. It is a very fun-filled first job and if you like it enough, there is more than one way to advance throughout the company."
good,Great company very fun work place that took care of their leaders.  Very strong on safety and standard work.  Great job promoting from within and having great work life balance.
good,Loads of room for advancement if that is what you are looking for. It is retail so be ready for evenings and weekend work. Customer service is an asset .
good,I loved walking into work to see my co-workers and then to greet customers. Going to work there was the highlight of my day all the time. I enjoyed it more than anything.
good,I come in early in the morning and have tasks I need to complete and it is an easy to follow the structure. Fun to see all the different animals come in to the store.
good,Work culture encourage a strong team environment. Workplace culture provided the ability to grow within the company. Hardest part of the job was willingness to relocate out of state for corporate a position.
good,Excellent working experience and training for many different fields. Management works with their employees for the ultimate working experience. Would recommend to anyone new to the working world
good,Petsmart will teach you a lot about animals and will show you important items you would need for your animals needs. Taught me how to medicate and restrain different animals.
good,"I've worked for Petsmart for 10 years and have had a blast. Who wouldn't love working with pets and get paid to do so? The grooming salon is the fastest way for any associate to gain full time status. Money is in the grooming salon. Your pay is an average of what you produce on a weekly basis. "
good,PetSmart is an awesome place to work! The people that work there are friendly and helpful; the customers and pretty generous as well minus the few difficult ones from time-to-time.
good,"Our salon/ store was low volume so work is relatively slow paced. I love the opportunity to work with pets daily. The job culture is fantastic. PetSmart makes recognizing employee's hard work a priority. Management feels like family. I enjoy getting up and going to work and I feel that I have gained life-long friendships during my two years working there. There are advancement opportunities, but they require you to work full-time. As a college student I had to deny promotions and make less than half a dollar more an hour than I did when I was hired despite being told I am the best they have at my position. That has been frustrating, but is mostly just a conflict of interests on my part."
good,"The Norman Ok store was very good. I loved the environment, I would have stayed here if there was more room for advancement, but overall a great place."
good,"Petsmart makes you feel you are a part of a family. They make you feel like you can do anything you have wish of, and they are very supportive within your career with them. They enjoy training and offering people positions."
good,"Good place to work for part time work for extra money"
good,"I really enjoyed working at PetSmart. During a typical day, I would clock in, go to the back and see what tasks have been done already, see what time I was going into camp and then do a bed and water. I then would just do other daily tasks during my shift. I thought the management was great and so was the culture in the workplace. The hardest part of the job was having to having other employees who did not want to work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the animals and meeting all the pet parents."
good,"Management when I was there was a little bad with favortism, but in all pretty good people. The workplace is great as long as you love working with animals. Being a cashier as I was you see and deal with a verity of animals coming in and out of the door. The hardest part to the job is really just cleaning up any animal messes that pet owners missed or decided not to clean. The most enjoyable of course would be working with a verity of animals."
good,"fun workplace, enjoyed the pets and people had a great supervisor, i had gotten in a bad car accident that is the only reason why i stopped working there. i loved the company and the people"
good,I loved working here in the Pet Care Department. Learning about and working with all of the animals was a lot of fun. Was a friendly atmosphere and met a lot of great people.
good,"I personally really enjoyed working at my pet smart location."
good,"PetSmart was by far my favorite place to work. Though I wasn't there as long as I wanted to be, it was still an amazing work experience. It was my first actual job and I honestly think it was the best choice. Easygoing and a good learning experience."
good,"Good Place to work, safe environment fast paced work which made time fly. shifts for 1st and second were 10 hour days 4 days a week and then third shift was 3 12 hour days Friday Saturday and sunday"
good,I enjoyed working with animals everyday and seeing how people interacted with their pets. This job was a fun environment and a great starting job but for me there wasn't much room for advancement or much of a path to turn that job into a career.
good,It was a very fun and stable job environment. From the time that we arrived around 3am we would arrange the pallets and begin stacking and dive straight into work. My time at PetSmart was very fulfilling and the management taught me many things on dealing with the many and many request that customers have. Most enjoyable part of the job would be every two hours we would take a 5 to 10 minute brake and step outside and talk and enjoy the cool morning air.
good,I would definitely recommend this job to someone who is a people person and has anxiety. This job is challenging at times but it is something that does not induce anxiety often
good,"The managers are as good as they come and you don't have to worry about suddenly being fired, problems with the schedule, or even with the work that you are doing. All of the coworkers are friendly, too. They expect you to do your job and do it right, but if that job isn't the right one for you, there are plenty of opportunities to change departments and moving up to manager only requires that you do your job well and be reliable. The schedule is also flexible and can work around yours, especially if you have schooling."
good,"-fulfilling and feeling important"
good,"Working at Petsmart has been a great experience. They pride themselves in cross training and ensuring that you are knowledgeable through all aspects of the store, regardless of where you end up as far as your working position. Everyone is outgoing and personable, and gets along great with no typical drama within the workplace."
good,I would definitely work there again if I went back into the pet industry!!! They are pretty knowledgeable and allow proper training for employees to get that way.
good,"I enjoyed working at Petsmart, and the Petsmart I worked at was the one on Feedwire Road. I specifically worked in the Pet Hotel and I was a Pet Care specialist and I loved it. I did also work as a cashier. The people I worked with were very nice and it felt like a second home to me.   I would recommend this to any of my friends!"
good,"Petsmart was my first job and I loved working there.  Leadership from on site managers, but especially corporate, could be iffy.  It was a great stepping stone for me.  The say they want to train and retain great associates, and they train us very well, but their policies for retaining their associates just don't work.  The pay raises after one year working there are annual, and not only that, they are insultingly tiny.  If you want a raise at any other time of year, it takes  practically an act of congress.  PetSmart doesn't fire people.  People mostly quit and find better pay elsewhere."
good,"I had a blast working here. Managers are nice and fair, environment is friendly. I loved working with the animals. They do not ask too much of you. Great place overall"
good,This is definitly the job I have enjoyed the most. Handling animals and customers. Making sure all pets have a family and working with such amazing coworkers.
good,Very easy going and pet user friendly. Even if you do not like pets it is an excellent place to grow. They definately put their employers first and ensure you are okay. As a student they worked with my schedule.
good,"Very nice people long hours, lower pay than average in big box stores. Pets were fun."
good,"Interacting with different people and how they each approach their pets as if they are their own children is amazing.  Face paced environment to keep up with all those fast paced dogs, yet calm and slow paced when interacting with birds and guinea pigs.  PetSmart truly has a place for every kind of person AND animal!"
good,Stocking shelves and waiting on customers. Helping customers find the right product for there pet. Enjoy watching customers bring there pets in the store.
good,love the company. terrible work schedules. not for someone with young children. schedules are too random. other than scheduling the company is great to work for.
good,This company has always worked with my schedule for myself and my family. They are very accomidating for kids still in school. The pay is ok for a part time job. Management is always fun and not overbearing.
good,"A typical day at work is quite easy and very rarely stressful. You will learn how to handle pets safely and about their products. Management is okay depending on location. Hardest part of the job is to memorize all the product information. Most enjoyable part of the day and its everyday, is playing with the animals and helping pet parent find what they need."
good,"Best job I ever had!  All of the adorable fun loving pets and stories and pictures. Seeing all of the puppies grow up. Some very interesting pets that come in such as a miniature horse, pot bellied pig, sugar gliders, parrots, snake, sugar gliders and bearded dragons to name a few! Employee discount but still rather pricey."
good,I loved going to work when i was working at pet smart. one of my favorite jobs. i loved dealing with different types on dogs. working at pet smart i was nothing but joy from the managers to my co workers.
good,Amazing starter job! Moving up in petsmart if your willing to work is very easy! They will help you the whole way through if youre willing to help yourself!
good,"Great people and company. Although the culture has definitely changed since the company went private, I still believe in this company and what it stands for."
good,Run cash register and clean the front of the store. Offer valid insight to customers that I've learned through the company training. Offer details about our products. Face and stock merchandise as needed.
good,Besides during the holidays hours Dwinddle and they hire like every 6 months. It's a nice place to work. Some friendly staff.
good,"I come in with a positive attitude. I go to my register and I make sure my area is prepared for the day. I take care of our animal loving "
good,Great staff and very productive. Environment is family and friend oriented. Also we take pride in care. I've learned alot about communication skills and knowledge of different breeds of dogs.
good,This job has been one of my best jobs over the years. I very much enjoy the people I work with and the opportunities I am given to learn and improve on a daily basis.
good,this team is one of the best teams I have ever worked with. Everyone respects  and relatively gets along with each other. because of this everyone works harder and more efficiently.
good,"Great environment to work, loved my managers and coworkers the only reason i left is because the pay isnt what i need it to be great if you're going to school or just a young kid trying to have some extra pocket money...and the customers are mostly great too!"
good,Typically work place for being a large company. There is room to grow into a management position. Overall an okay company with a good work environment.
good,"A typical day at work will always include helping customers, which is a big aspect that Petsmart takes pride in.  Not only do we help customers, we always make time to take care of all the animals, which means feeding, , and cleaning all the cages.  "
good,I love animals so this job was a blessing. I was exposed to animals every day. I learned a lot of taking care of animals just by looking at the products and from the training.
good,"Fast-paced, friendly co-workers and good pay"
good,"Although I did not own any animals, I loved working for this company. Not only did I learn about so many types of animals, I had the privilege to meet so many pet owners and share the love they had for their pets. That was the most rewarding part for me."
good,"In a typical day I help check in an average of 70 dogs into the facility for camp or boarding. We usually load four camp rooms ranging in size and temperament of the dogs. I spend the next several hours of my day in a playroom with 12-15 dogs at any given time."
good,Good people. Good hours. Nice location. Good training. Team work is great. Management is understanding and accepting. Adorable dogs and they provide great training.
good,"fun place to work, loved working with animals, minimum wage pay, great employees, flexible hours, if working in the petshotel you have to work holidays."
good,Wonderful company who care about the well being of not only the customers but the staff as well. I learnt how to bath a dog and do general grooming of dogs. Co-worker are friendly and very willing to teach you how to do things. The hardest part of the job was learning the computer system and all the prices for different dogs. I enjoy everything about this job.
good,"It was a fun job but my hours were randomly drastically cut, forcing me to quit. Plus, there were NEW people making more money than I did and that upset me. I miss working there though, it was so positive and my coworkers wonderful."
good,Working with Petsmart has been life changing its gives you the opportunity to work with individuals that share the same passion as you.
good,"I enjoyed working here very much. The hardest part of the job was lifting the heavier dogs, and dealing with the grumpy ones. The part was being around animals all day long!"
good,"i enjoyed working for petsmart the people are fun and the animals were great. ive learned so many new things ive never thought id learn from there. animal care being one. i learned about animal habitats,different food for certain animal breeds and so much more. Even if it was animal related i learned about retail. pricing things and going by a planner for setting up new product."
good,"PetSmart is a wonderful place to work. They work with you so you can work and go to school. It is a fun, friendly environment."
good,Petsmart is a wonderful place to work if you love animals and people. The people who work there are are wonderful and kind.
good,"Its a great job. Hard work is demanded everyday, always something to get done. You can move up quickly in the company if you get the job done and show them that you want to. Hardest part was just the truck day and that's just because there is so much to get done in so little time and it is not an option to not get it done. I loved playing with the animals the most. The customers were usually happy and that made my job easier knowing that they were going to leave happy."
good,The management of the store and all of my coworkers are very fun to work with. Can be trained in several departments which can be a good change of pace.
good,"I love working for PetSmart.  Teamwork is important there and management is very supportive.  3 days a week, I train dogs and instruct petparents, and 2 days a week, I am responsible for the needs of the other small animals, lizards and fish.   There is no hard part to my job...For me, petcare is my playground, and training is my passion"
good,"I love working with Petsmart!  The people I work with are excellent, and I love the clients.  They even work with your school schedule!"
good,"•Assisted customers in the check out line as they purchase product"
good,"my day would start at 2am and I would  most of the time work at least one weekend day. this job especially overnight you would have to trust your team to show up on time and everyday, a lot of times they would be late so it fell on you to do your job plus theirs."
good,petsmart was good to me and my needs. I would recommend working here to anyone. everyone from a student to someone who needs extra money on the side.
good,I love Pet Smart with all of my heart. The hours are great for a student and it is perfect for anyone who loves animals
good,"During a typical day, I helped people out until about 5pm, then I had to begin closing my section and help people at the same time. I fed the animals and made sure their cages were clean, and then went into the back room with my pager and took care of sick animals while waiting for calls. Management was great, except for one of them who tried to convince me to quit college to stay there! My co-workers were magnificent. The hardest part of my job was listening for calls while doing so many other things at once. I enjoyed working with our resident bird in the store and hung out with him whenever we weren't busy."
good,Ive been with this company for a while and I like the employees I work with. The management there is excellent always allowing an open door policy which is wonderful if I have problems with anything.
good,"PetSmart has a wonderful culture and, where I worked, and really seems to put customers and pets first. I loved working there and only quit when I moved."
good,Took care of animals thru out the night. Very little stress did feeding and cleanings
good,Walk around and helping people when needed and then you close which means feeding all the animals and etc.
good,"Great opportunity to advance"
good,"By far one of my favorite places to work for. Both customers and pets  were wonderful. I loved playing with the pups during day camp, or simply having one on one time with them."
good,Petsmart was a great company to work for. I enjoyed working 7 years with them. I had a wonderful management staff and looked forward to being at work. I learned many wonderful job skills and was surrounded by great animals and people .
good,Extremely secure company to work for with room for advancement and wonderful compensation
good,I loved PetSmart...My boss was a great person and I loved working with all the animals and people.  I learned a lot about the care for pets and what was good for them as well as what wasn't.  The people at PetSmart are great also.  Had a wonderful time at work each time I went in.
good,"A typical day at work is never that same as the day before. We have various duties and responsibilities that need to be fulfilled by certain times of the day. "
good,"PetsMart is a great place to get to watch puppies and other animals grow up and ensuring life time care for the pet parents. As a manager my priorities were: time management, associate knowledge, health of pets, customer satisfaction, and shrink and safety. Management works together to fulfill all roles within the company and the associates have a genuine interest in being part of customers lives and the care of their pets. The hardest part of my job was when animals would die or become sick. The most enjoyable part is being able to walk pet parents through new habitat set-ups and seeing them come back for future purchases and remembering me."
good,"My typical day at work always began with something I loved to do. Working with animals is one of my strong points, I love them no matter the breed, or species. The best part was being able to connect with the customers through their pets, seeing the different people and what types of animals they enjoyed. The management (for the year or so I was threre) wasn't quite concrete so I don't really have much of an opinion when it comes to that topic. Nothing at the workplace came too difficult, and I wished I could have stayed but the lack of career advancement is the only reason why I chose to move forward on my own."
good,"It was nice to work there, but it can get very competitive about who gets to bath or work on the dogs."
good,"Keeping the clients calm and at ease, pay attention to strange behavior, how to associate myself with others that have issues going on in there lives, very hardworking, dealing with different emotions on a daily basis, seeing them happy and getting them clean from the issues that they were having."
good,Great Place to work. Every store is different. I have worked in two stores in two states and enjoyed most of my time there.
good,"A day at PetSmart is filled with variety and constant movement. I spend the day informing customers on our products and about the animals. I also maintain and log information on sick animals that are in our care, as well as administer medication. It is an environment that is constantly changing and I have been able to adapt to the changes very easily."
good,"Typical day is helping C-Level executives & customers…"
good,"The Frisco location is very busy so there was rarely any idle time, but when there was it was much appreciated.  Our salon and store manager are awesome to work under/with.  They listened to employee needs and made positive improvement with their control.  There is always a mixture of personalities, age ranges, characteristics any where you work and ofcourse there were differences of opinions/moods but in reality we were a team and worked as one.  The hardest part of the job is learning that a pet that you have groomed for awhile has passed away, I grow a bond and relationship with all my clients/customers and it feels like Ive lost a part of my family.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the look on a pet parents face when they pick up there pet from a day at the salon...or when someone has rescued a pet from 'a ugly situation' and brought the pet to us to be pampered and loved on."
good,"Oversaw all deliveries "
good,"I Very much enjoyed my work time at Petsmart. Helping with stocking shelves and working the front end had to be my favorite. I have learned a great deal of how to have amazing communication. The customers really seemed to enjoy seeing my while I was at work."
good,worked with a great group of people.  Had a great opportunity to operate different equipment.
good,A typical day at PetSmart was enjoyable. Customers and Employees always happy.  Management did their best to get your requested days of.  Everybody (including Management) helped out with everything.  Worked with all different types of animals. Hardest part of the job was going into work at 4 A.M. at times.  Most enjoyable part of working at PetSmart was seeing customers who just adopted a pet and are very happy.  
good,"bathing and styling animals was a fun job. fast paced and stressful at times. learned how to groom and take care of dogs. management was great in sending me to grooming school. co-workers always battling to see who would get the next client to walk through the door. the hardest part of the job was definatly working for commission, but seeing how well the dogs came out after i was done with them made up for it."
good,"My days stared early stocking shelves, then one would work helping customers with there pet needs or cashiering. I learned how to do plan a grams, price changing, cashiering, customer service, and important information about pet food and supplies. The management there was always willing to teach me new things about different aspect of the store. Except for the short hours I enjoyed everything about my job."
good,"great place to learn a new trade, its always a new day. you wont have the same day twice. Its something new every day you come in."
good,"I loved working for Petsmart. I got to greet customers, helped them with any questions they had about products and sevices Petsmart had to offer. I got to see all the cute & adorarable pets that would come in. I was a lead cashier and enjoyed having more responsiblities."
good,"I loved working here over night in the pets hotel, We would chill and clean, and play with animals all night it was a great job for someone who doesnt have any real bills or responsibilites. I was a college freshman when i worked there so it was awesome. to have n extra 220-280 a week for working usually 4-5 nights a week in such a laid back environment."
good,"I absolutely loved working at PetSmart. I loved the people I worked with and the majority of the customers that I met and served on a weekly, sometimes daily basis. The store was easy to learn and the rules and company policies were easy to follow. I would work here again now if I could :D"
good,"Honestly I love being a bather at PetSmart. It's a lot to take in at first but once you get used to all the policies and all the information thrown at you it gets easier. I get to meet tons of interesting dogs on the daily and have fallen in love with a lot of them. I get the chance to see uncommon breeds in my area like the Irish Wolfhound, Standard Schnauzer, Olde English Sheepdog, the hairless Xolo, and so many more! The hardest part of the job has to be the stress. There are days where I don't get the chance to sit down and breathe all day in an 8 hour shift because there's so much to do in a limited amount of time and everyone and their families tries to enter our small salon and the phones are off the hooks at the same time and dogs are barking their heads off... it can be an absolute mad house sometimes and it makes you want to rip your hair out and well-I think you can imagine. But I wouldn't change it for the world, it's an absolute awesome experience and if you have a passion for animals this is a great way to start a career. Disclaimer: if you have a short temper really think before applying, there are a handful of untrained dogs who sadly don't know any better and won't think twice before trying to bite your hand off if you even look at them a wrong way..."
good,Petsmart was my first job and on my first day I was welcomed with open arms. I worked with animals which is my lifetime dream. It gave me so much knowledge and I would recommend it to many.
good,"Petsmart was my first official job, and my current job. Everyone has good vibes all the time, the customers are great, and associates take care of each other. I always have a good laugh with my co workers once in a while. The energy there is upbeat, there’s always something to do and it’s just overall fun being there."
good,"Amazing to work there if you love pets, also great opportunity to learn new things about animals and to growth with the company. The leadership is very friendly and helpful"
good,"I loved working here. I absolutely love animals of all kinds so this place really stood out for me as an employee. The timing just wasn't right so I had to leave, but I was the happiest I had ever been while working here."
good,This job is perfect for people who have a passion to learn about and take care of various types of animals. I learn something new every day and I feel that I have become a better person because of my experiences.
good,Best retail to work in when you get to surround yourself with pets and pet parents. The most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with the pets. The hardest part of the job was running out of product that the customer wants for their pets. The culture was very good because everyone that worked their was very passionate about pets.
good,I learned so much from everyone that I worked with and always felt comfortable there. I love animals and getting to see them everyday and learn how to take care of them filled me with a sense of purpose. Organizing adoption days and working with local shelters was also a really great part of the job. The hardest part was pitching any of the promotions or coupons we offered but once you find your rhythm it gets easier.
good,Great job to earn good money and have fun. Flexible part time hours and management was nice and caring. I would recommend working at Petsmart to learn customer skills.
good,Working for petsmart was the best learning experience and best team I’ve ever worked for and with. Learned a lot about retail and how to build customer/associate relationships. Very knowledgeable about animal care since working for them.
good,Benefits were very minimal. Pay was capped after a certain amount.  Pay not enough for tasks done. The culture in the other hand is great and if you are looking for a fin part time job this is it!
good,"I worked at this location for under a year and they quickly became my best friends. I felt respected, important, and part of the team. The animals were treated with the best respect, we were all there because we loved animals. You don't need much experience to work there, but you need to be willing to learn how to do the job properly. The only downside I ever had was when people would come in for the job and not really care about the work we were doing. I would have stayed there for much longer if I didn't have to move away. I was a cashier for the first month and was promoted to Pet Care Leader after that (due to the position being recently opened and the most appropriate person for the job was leaving and the others were only part timers, so I was fortunate) but it is pretty easy to move up in this business as long as you do your job. This was my most favorite job to be honest. Not only because I got to work with animals on the daily, but I met some of the best people. If you have the chance to work here, do it."
good,"Working at Petsmart was a wonderful experience that I would gladly take on again. Day to day work was fun and I was always excited to see I was on schedule, coming in with a happy face and ready to work. The hardest part would be some of the heavier or more aggressive animals, but coworkers were happy to lend a hand getting a stubborn or large dog onto the table, or calming an animal they knew was troublesome. "
good,"On the one hand, it's just another retail store. The routine shelf-stocking and other retail tasks are something you'll either hate or not. That's up to each individual. But the interaction with pets, especially dogs, makes this an outstanding place to work. As with all retail chains, the local management team has far more impact on you than the people at corporate headquarters. And each individual store is what it is. Some are great. Some are adequate. Some will steal your soul. But if you work at a Petsmart store, and it become unbearable, a transfer to a different store can be just as effective for making things better as a whole new job."
good,"If you want to work at a place where most everyone is sweet and smiling, Petsmart is the place. You can completely form bonds with your customers to where they will always want specifically your register or your help on the sales floor. Yeah cleaning up dog dumps sucks, but almost everything else about working here is so intrinsically satisfying."
good,"I would not recommend this job for anyone that is looking for a full time career, there are not enough hours , and not enough pay. If you are straight out of high school this is perfect for you as they are flexible with your schedule, I now stock part time, managers are awesome and work with your schedule.Work is a little physical just make sure to get some sleep the night before , also the hours are usually 3-4am until open , we can wear whatever we want just as long as we are dressed by the time the store opens. Just work hard and be a good person and you will last here."
good,Pros outweigh the cons. Good benefits. Management inconsistent. Customers are generally loony. Too much drama in the salon. Too many rules back there as well. It killed our ability to do our jobs correctly and efficiently.
good,It was a great interview. Both people who interviewed me had lots of good questions on the task they would have me do. I didn’t feel nervous at all & was very excited to have the  opportunity
good,PetSmart is a great place to work. They are flexible with hours and really find a schedule that works for you and them. I started off As a PetCare Soecialist and now I am a dog bather working up to grooming. I loved everything I did in petcare! Taking care of all the animals and helping pet parents get the accurate information. I cross trained in grooming and found my passion.
good,"Petsmart DC is a nice warehouse in terms of operations. Best part is 4 day work weeks (4 10's) with flexible overtime if wanted, or even 3 12 hour shifts with 4 days off. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement and cross-training. Great place to build a resume to carry over to other jobs. Unfortunately, management sees it as a revolving door as well so it's a luck of the draw as to who favors you or not, and they will come and go every other month. Every time someone new comes in you'll never know how things change and some times people will be fired in droves to make it appear they are a hardliner for their new bosses. Long term job security is abysmal. They excel at engagement and are professional. A bit yuppy-isn and smug at times, but better than some of the places I've worked at where your boss is berating you over minor mistakes. All in all a great place to work if you're job hopping in this post-career McJob dystopia we live in."
good,"I just recently got this job and the interviews were easy, and I had to go to 2 interviews. First was with the Manager for the Pets Hotel which was 8 minutes long and the second was with the Store Manager which was about 12 minutes long. The ask you the basic questions and discuss the scedule and such. The hours at the store for the overnight position at the Pets Hotel is from 2100-0600. The dress code for the overnight position is street clothes. You will probably be working by yourself if theres less then 80 dogs to take care of. If its over 80 then theres two people working. The first 3 times you come in will be paperwork,  training on the computer,  and just collecting all your info. It took me 4 days to get this job from application to being asked to accept the job. Got called the same day my 2nd interview was. Can take about 4 days afer your 2nd interview. So overall its easy to get the job if you have experience."
good,"I only worked part time which is a 4hr work shift. The amount of hours overall depends on # of staff and hours required so you never know from week to week how many hours you will get. The hardest part of the job was keeping busy as a cashier on slow days. You can straighten the front row near the door but it can be quiet. The most enjoyable part is dealing with the customers especially those that brought in their pets!"
good,Working at Petsmart is awesome. We are like a family there. It’s amazing to be able to worm with a group of fast paced and talented people while at the same time feeling at home.
good,Some days at work it can be stressful if it's busy and we weren't given the hours for an extra hand but overall I enjoy working at PetSmart. I enjoy the team environment where we all actually work as a team.
good,"Employee benefits are above average, Great culture that tries to source foods from responsible companies. Supportive management, The only downside is the typical retail one - the store is only completely closed on Christmas Day and Thanksgiving Day."
good,"Pros: Great management, hard working co-workers, wonderful customers and their animals"
good,"Buen clima laboral, buena empresa, buenas prestaciones, buenas instalaciones, pet friendly por supuesto."
good,i worked early morning stock usually from 12 to 8 and i liked getting home in morning. but if i ever was tired then i would sleep a good part of my day away. overall fun easy job just as long as you can lift around 25 lbs
good,"My managers were excellent with interpersonal interactions with both coworkers and customers, my hours were fair and flexible, and they worked with my other job as well as possible. I had no issues getting more hours or getting days off, and I was often picked for special projects that reflected my specialties and skills. I was treated as a peer instead of just an employee. "
good,love to learn about taking good care of your pets and get learn how to groom that's a plus great people to work with and fun environment. GREAT PLACE.
good,"When I worked here i was a bit younger, but i made great friends, also management was pretty great as well, really loved this job, pay wasnt great but retail usually isnt, I really loved this once i started in the salon"
good,Laid back environment. Easy going staff and coworkers who become much more. The company takes really good care of you by the means of if you call out you don’t get in trouble and if you a long as get your work done you’ll be fine. Thirty minute lunches.
good,I like working with animals this was my first place I worked at that gave me a opportunity to move up. I started off as a bather then they sent to me school to become a dog groomer. good experience
good,"Great staff, best managers. Grateful to have had the opportunity to have worked among them. Would definitely would have considered staying if it would have been beneficial to the changes in my personal life."
good,"Very positive atmosphere to work in, other staff and management is fantastic to work with. Best work environment i have yet to work in. Its a place you can enjoy coming to work."
good,"It has been years, but I enjoyed my time at petsmart. The team was amazing, more like a family. Management was flexible and respectful. If it wasn't for school and advancing my career, I would have stayed."
good,"All depends on store, but overall a nice place to work. My store had amazing management, everyone was helping everyone, no fend for self mentality. We all worked together to drive sales and hit the Mark's that we needed to (or were aiming to) hit."
good,"I love working here it is a very nice place to work, the customer is very nice and I love work with some of my coworkers, So manager really care bout the hard work that you put in its always about the bad that you do never the good even when the good out way the bad"
good,"This job really kept me going. A normal day consisted of assisting customers and facing the store during open hours, and completing closing procedures after hours. Closing procedures included making sure all animals enclosures were clean, provided clean water and fresh food, treating/observing/interacting with animals in isolation, switching from day to night lights, changing sump filters, and taking out trash. Management followed an open door policy and ran with the company goal of providing the best service to pet parents to assist in bettering the human-animal bond. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a pet-parent leave the store happy with their PetSmart experience."
good,you come in and you have pallets that come in that you have to stock on a daily basics. how to be a team player and how to work together even if you have problems with a person you work with.
good,Family work environment and management was outstanding. If someone have any personal issues going on management would help that person in everyway possible if needed.
good,A very fun and active place to work with plenty of opportunity's to broaden your overall knowledge of products and animals. One of the best places to work.
good,I was proud to educate people on proper animal husbandry and care. Hardest part was learning and seeing how many people neglect their pets or are unaware of the amount of work and care that goes into owning one.
good,Would usually start shift off with quick meeting about focus for day and then jump in to customer service and store duties. We had a great vibe at the store I worked at with good employee relations and made shifts fun and enjoyable. Loved seeing the pups!
good,If your looking for a place that treats its employees fairly and has good oppurtunities for advancement if your willing to work for it this is a great place for that. Management when I was employeed were the best I have ever experianced they check on new employees regularly and training lasts 2 weeks where they have you assigned with an experianced member to ask questions and relay knowledge. Staff is polite and friendly to everyone and extremely helpful.
good,I love New Animal day its dope. The people are dope and honestly I can't think of very many bad things to say about this job. The animals make the job worth it just by itself and even makes it easy to work with everyone even if they are a bit abrasive.
good,"This company is amazing to employees, the benefits for full time employees are amazing! If you are looking for an inclusive and fun work place, this is perfect."
good,"My time at PetSmart was enjoyable and will always have a place in my heart. I just needed to move and needed more money and more freedom to do that. I smiled every day from not only the animals, but from positive customers as well."
good,"Working at Petsmart provides excellent opportunity to learn about animal care for pets of all types, as well as nutrition and training information, and allows you the opportunity to work with the public to better care for their furry family members as well."
good,"As a stylist apprentice, I work hands on with dogs. Grooming requires lots of patients as some dogs can get aggressive. It can definitely get stressful being surrounded by a lot of dogs but it is the most fun job to work in."
good,Well organized and well run. I was encouraged to learn new things on the job constantly; a promotion of some kind was definitely in the future. Managers were incredibly knowledgeable about different kinds of pets. It was wonderful to be surrounded by people who really cared about animals.
good,Working for petsmart was a very fun experience when I was in college I got to do what I enjoy doing in shipping and recieving and I got to enjoy all the pets and I enjoyed helping costumers with theres
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work because I got to work with dogs and their owners. Although Petsmart managers sometimes don't have the time for groomers in the salon, they were helpful and supportive when we needed them. The people are what really made the job pleasurable. My coworkers and I had fun times working together. I also found it rewarding to groom these dogs and interact with their owners. Petsmart was able to make the job exciting and fulfilling while still maintaining a professional environment."
good,"Pretty good place to work at if you love dogs. You'll also love the job if your interested in taking care of cats, as well as being a sales accociate."
good,I loved working there sooo much . It is probably my favorite job I've had as a young adult . The atmosphere is so warm and happy . There is always something to learn. I learned sooo much working here.
good,"Working for this company I loved it at the start but I also was a assigned a manager job that the last manager left the store a mess for four months that I had to pick up and complete in such a short time. The hours that were scheduled for my employees made it hard for me to have them work on projects. It had made it impossible to complete our jobs on time which came down to just me being the only worker in the store for a few hours before I had to open it. "
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the customers very friendly.  I preferred working in an office doing clerical work though.  I would recommend this place as a great starting job for young adults and for senior citizens.
good,"Pet smart is so friendly,  you make a family. They are there for you when u need them. They are all about healthy friendly competition. And management is great"
good,managed people - pet partners are fun to work with very different than any other retail company.  hours were okay except had to go in on holidays and feed animals
good,"Everyone was so friendly and helpful, made you feel welcome.  Training was good, someone always there to get from if needed, made sure you were taken care of."
good,This job is a very rewarding type of job when you help someone find the right product to help their dog or when someone needs help I can help put them into the right direction if I can be no help to them at all. It's a very fun and fast paced job. You get to see all sorts of different animals and watch the kids face light up when they get a new fish or a new hamster.
good,"loved this job!! good management, ok pay, benefits, and friendly environment. Only reason for leaving was lack of hours available to me. would recommend this job to others :)"
good,It’s fun to work st Petsmart  we have animals like fish birds Guinea pigs and snakes breaded dragons Chinchillas we also have grooming and an hospital in the back
good,Retail work is very hard and doesn't give much help with balancing a family life.  Hours are never the same and that makes it hard to enjoy your family and get an education
good,Only downside is you can't take all the animals home with you! I wish starting pay was better. Great managers and coworkers! Hardest part of the job is leaving when you feel like there is so much more you could do!
good,"Fast paced, always eventful, fun knowledge of animals and unique job tasks to complete regarding all pets. Busy calendar to maintain store order. Not enough hours allotted to competing tasks sometimes, short staffing due to small store size and lack of foot traffic. Culture of store is great, great management."
good,"Had a great time working for the company. However this was also a long time ago and i know things have changed since then. Really enjoyed the employees who were committed  to their jobs and, and enjoyed coming to work. Always took great care of their animals for sale and adoptions. Just at the time there was no room to move up in the company."
good,The environment is fun and enjoyable. The work is hard but the coworker are very helpful and like to assist one another. Management is kind and reliable.
good,"its a fun and very educational job to be apart of !"
good,Great management that is flexible with work hours. The team works together to make sure all pet parents needs are completed. I would recommend this work to anyone who loves animals.
good,"Most of the days, we had stuff to do so the days were never boring. Working with the pets was really fun. Most of the customers were friendly and loved to have conversations with us employees."
good,"I enjoyed the interactive, fact paced environment. Pet lovers need to work here. I gained lots of knowledge, and the staff all have many things in common so its easy to work alongside them."
good,I was just driving a forklift picking up and dropping off loading and loading them in the right trucks. but overall it was a great work environment and very safe.
good,"As a stocker I came in at 4am - but often the truck wasn't there until 5 to 7am"
good,"I really enjoy working at PetSmart. I work in the grooming salon as a bather and even though the job is tough it is very rewarding and I love the dogs so much. It is truly a pleasure going into work. The only issue that I have with work would be the amount of pay I get versus my travel expense. Both of these are of no fault of PetSmart. When I first started there I was living close to the store, but due to school I had to move and now am 40+ miles away, being paid a little over minimum wage an hour for part-time work is not enough to sustain me in my daily life."
good,Good place to work. Had a great team that I worked with. Holidays little stressful very busy. Lots to do. Have lots of mini events over weekends. Management is good
good,I think this job was a great job for my girsdt job I loved it! Working with animals was fun. The management was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this job to people.
good,This place is a great place to work overall. Coworkers and management are excellent and the company is great to work for. Unfortunately the pay is just too low.
good,"Great place to work, great communication between co workers also. Can be stressful especially in pet care. You usually are thrown into it not really knowing what to do."
good,"Working at PetSmart was so much fun. Seeing all the different animals and their owners was always fun. It's a rewarding job, especially when you get to help."
good,Petsmart is good first job to have especially if you are going to school. It  Working here will give you a lot of flexibility. I met very interesting customers and built great relationships with coworkers.
good,I would work here again. The company downsized my position and I was offered something else but decided to leave instead. A great company that cares about their employees.
good,"My job was to be a groomer. So I helped customers, answered phones, made appointments. I also groomed and bathed dogs, clipped their nails, and just so much more. Overall, this was a nice place to work."
good,Petsmart is a good company to work for just as any job if u get a strict manager it gets harder to enjoy your work. But right now we are getting policy changes so it harder for older employees to shift to the new policy but the new people are taught the new policy when you start.
good,This was the best job I have ever had! The people I worked with were so amazing; we all got along so well. Management always answered any questions I had as soon as I asked. I miss working in the fun enviroment.
good,Absolutely love this job. At my store we have amazing staff and managers who are a joy to be around and make work fun to be at. I have met many friends here and everybody at the store feels like family. Sometimes we get unpleasant customers but we get full support from co-workers so it doesn't usually affect us throughout the day and we can get over it relatively quickly. There are a lot of regulars who are very nice and are quick to tell you how thankful they are for your help. I have gained valuable experience working here that will help me further my career in animal care as I worked with animals everyday I worked there. Would recommend this store to anybody.
good,"Petsmart has good team skills, great with working around employee school schedules. great effort with keeping up with and maintaining store and its cleanness."
good,"If you are interested in retail this is an ideal fit for a summer internship.  You will receive hands on training, meaningful projects and mentorship.  The intern cohort is comprised of mainly undergraduates but there are positions in Merchandising and Store operations for graduate students."
good,"I've never enjoyed working for a company they I loved working for petsmart. Everyday we encounter a new animal with different needs, and I was able to learn so much from each new animal. Everyday a new pet parent would walk in and expect a book full of information said within 100 words."
good,Great atmosphere and learning process at Pet360.  Work life balance was great and team members support eachother and help eachother learn and grow in your career.
good,"Work was consistence, but there were cutbacks on hours. They were willing to make me a supervisor but with no pay increase or more hours. I always tried to do more in my job description."
good,"I absolutely loved my job, but the pay was not great. I was a dog trainer and found the job extremely rewarding. Management at the time was pretty good but there was always room for improvement. I left due to the need of an increased wage."
good,I really loved my job here. Everyone was so nice an helpful.i was super sad when he had to leave to take care of my father before he passed away.the pay was great I thought sn I was always busy doing something.
good,Petsmart in Bellingham MA is GREAT to work at. Pay isn't the best but work environment is excellent. Awesome management. You have to deal with the rude customers like any retail job but that would be my only complaint. Management takes care of their employees and really does seem to care about us.
good,"estaba encardo sobre un grupo para acomodar el producto bien para que los cliente lo vieran, asistir a los clientes y sus mascotas en encontrar todo lo que busquen y necesiten."
good,"I meet awesome Pet Parents and their animals, while giving them advice and support to make sure their animals are happy and taken care of based on their needs and wants."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in and looking at the daily work task sheet and managing your time to complete every task. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the animals and seeing dogs and puppies everyday.
good,PetSmart has been a wonderful source of income and responsibility for me since I was in high school. I am now in teacher's college 6 years later and they have supported me every step of the way by working around my schedule and providing me with enough hours to supplement my education.
good,Fun place with lots of room to learn and grow. Good people to work with with great management for the most part. Not to keen on giving breaks though. r
good,"I loved this job the day I walked in. Everyone is accepting and willing to help out the new employees. It's a little fast paced sometimes, but you're never not busy."
good,"They are Extremely flexible with hours, even if your needs change from month to month. The pay is well above minimum wage. There is a lot of online training but once that is done they just throw you in, but on the plus side, everyone is really nice and will help."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the dogs and cats that came in.A typical day at work was cashiering and listening to customers concerns with there pets and giving the best advice possible or giving them resources to places that could help them.I guess the hardest part was stocking the big bags of feed but even that was not really that hard.It was a pleasure working there and I thought everyone was a joy to work with.I think when you work with animals it acts like a kind of therapy,and it reflects in the associates and a lot of the customers."
good,"PetSmart gave me my start in the grooming life, and for that, I thank them. I have enjoyed my time with PetSmart, and am looking to leave only because I feel that I have done everything I possibly can do there. "
good,"It's lovely. The salon treats you well but ours are scarce as a bather. They will put you through grooming school, it's a great offer. Very nice coworkers and lots of puppy kisses."
good,"I loved grooming for PetSmart. Most groomers don't get the kind of benefits that PetSmart offers. The health insurance is great, 2 weeks paid vacation as well as sick leave are only a few of the great things they offer."
good,My location was very fast paced on weekends and nights after a work day. You had to be able to multitask and communicate efficiently in order to succeed.
good,"Great employers and employees fun job to work at . A great place for pet lovers . Friendly pet environment,  and you get to play with all the animals if you work in pet care ."
good,"I enjoyed working at PetSmart.  I was a pet care specialist.  I have had a lifetime of experience working with pets and exotic animals.  I raised reptiles while in college to help pay my way.  This job was a way for me to be around animals daily.  I helped pet owners with questions and was able to provide information that was of great value to them.  The animals were also a great responsibility, we had to make sure they were well fed and in great health.  I had so much previous experience working with animals as I was also an assistant manager at a Pet Store in Minnesota."
good,"i truly enjoyed working here. It was a very happy and helpful job to me. Especially because i love animals, i was able to learn a lot about animals."
good,"The job was challenging, always changing, interactive and fun. My co workers were outgoing, friendly, and helpful. I enjoyed working with all the different dogs and cats."
good,I'm part-time so I have no benefits and being there for such a short time each day you don't really have time to be trained in many other jobs. If it were full-time it'd rock
good,"A typical work day as a petcare specialist involves customer service, basic stocking, care of all animals in  store including feeding and habitat maintenance, and consistent problem solving and communication."
good,I work with a great team and I am equipped with the tools to be a great leader amongst my team. Very supportive environment.
good,"A typical day started out with turning on all dryers and setting up kennels. After that was done then you started accepting your clients in and taking their specific request on services that were to be performed. The management that was there at my time of employment was very personable, very considerate, family oriented, compassionate and educating."
good,"I loved my time at PetSmart, I loved the company as a whole, they offered fantastic benefits to their full-time employees and really made sure that the hardworkers were thanked and recognized.  Honestly, for a retail company, they are one of the best, and I would go back in a heartbeat now that they are finally opening a store close to me!"
good,"petsmart is a great company and i loved that job so much. great management, awesome customers, great work, and just an overall fun amazing job."
good,The great thing about the job is that they teach you everything thoroughly. They give you plenty of time to understand your job. The management tries to make it as fun and safe as possible.
good,"A typical day consisted of doing group with the day care dogs & single play times for the dogs that couldn't be in groups. My co-workers were great, but the hardest part of the job was definitely during check ins and check outs."
good,"It's a great company to work for. Everyone who works there shares a passion for pets/animals, so it is easy to find common ground with co-workers and managers. Most managers are great, and they do not forget the human element when dealing with associates. It was like a family."
good,"Petsmart is a great place to work with a good environment for growth. The management does their best to help you succeed, and the employees are generally very helpful and nice."
good,"The grooming salon is a very fast paced environment, but very rewarding. The hardest part of the job is handling dogs that are stressed, as you often times don't know how they will react or behave. Everyone is very supportive, and willing to help if you are having a stressful day. The girls that I work with are wonderful."
good,My typical day at work is good one sometime i will have my moments but i just brush them off and keep moving. I learned a lot how use tool give dog awesome bath and trim their nails. Management is wonderful can't complain. I love the co-worker make my day and there like family. The hardest part of the job is sales and sometime the customers. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing different breed of dogs and see how there going act for the bath
good,"- I learned more about cleaning as you go around the store paying  close attention to detail"
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work, you're always busy, constantly on the move. Interacting with customers is a must, no matter what part of the store you work in. It's a great environment, as long as you're good with animals and pet parents."
good,Every day at PETSMART was wonderful! I absolutely loved working with my managers and co-workers. Being with dogs everyday and playing with them was so rewarding. Dogs that needed individual attention were the most fun to work with. They always seemed so grateful that you were there for them.
good,"I've learned that pets are part of the family, not just an animal that lives in (or around) the house and home.  I work hard to make sure the 'Pet Parent' is fully aware or learn new facts on how to teach them to become better Pet Parents and to help the lives of the animals that they take care off.  Whether its the food they eat, or the area where they sleep and so on. "
good,"A very enjoyable place to work, a nice team environment with supportive management. I appreciated everyone pitching in, and the pets were a delight to be around."
good,Great at understanding and managing schedule around work.  Helped with speed and accuracy around warehouse and moving products.
good,"I love working for PetSmart. I think it's a great company, and if the way the grooming department was run was different, I might stay there forever. But I love grooming more than PetSmart, and with all the limitations and misinformation in their grooming department I feel like I'm only allowed to grow to a certain point in my grooming knowledge before I have to stop utilizing the new techniques I learn. The management is awesome at some stores and not so great at others, like with any company. Awesome benefits for full time employees, nearly nonexistent for part time."
good,This was my very first job and I couldn't have picked a better place or establishment to start at. The managers are very appreciative with my hard work and happy spirit. Working at this establishment has allowed to understand the work environment and helped me to develop excellent customer service skills. I learned about different types of people and how every situation should be handled with tact and professionalism. The hardest part of the job is not being able to help every individual because of the constant busyness of the store itself. Aside from that the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction i get when i am able to help a customer in need and allow them to leave with more knowledge then when they first assessed.
good,"For a typical day, which was for me a closing shift in the Pet Care Department, I would 'do my rounds' and check the animals for food, water, health, proper sign-age, habitat display, etc., as well as assist customers throughout the day. I would also spend time cleaning up messes, scrubbing tanks, organizing the department, as well as backing up cashiers, and occasionally getting carts. I would break for lunch, repeat all that stuff I just mentioned, then go home."
good,"I enjoy my volunteer time at PetSmart, the co-workers work well together and the management appreciate all the workers do to ensure a safe, happy environment for the cats and the ability to have them adopted into a good home"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the variety of animals that come into our stores. The pet parents as well as the pets have varying personalities and are always a pleasure to help. A typical day at work does involve a lot of running around to help customers, stock shelves, and manage associates. What I have have learned from my experience at Petsmart is that everyday may bring a new challenge but challenges equal growth. I have also learned that every person has a soft spot for an animal."
good,"I loved it here, this company it's fun with great management and the supervisors and the workforce here are great. It's just the health benefits take to long to be able to acquire them since you have to be a full time associate but other than that I love this company."

good,"I really enjoyed working here, everyone was really nice and helpful. I was a cashier so I got to greet customers, keep the front area clean and organized, and processed transactions."
good,"Volunteering at Pet Smart was such a fun job! I personally love working with animals, and with this job, I gained so much experienced with pets and interaction with people looking to adopt the pets. The reason behind my 1 star for Salary/Benefits was because it was pure volunteer work and I was not paid.  My co-workers were also wonderful! The hardest part of the job was having to deal with stray cats who were very viscous! The most enjoyable part of the job was just overall meeting new people and adopting cats!"
good,"great place to work at once you understand all policies and procedures."
good,"When I first went into this interview it was just as a seasonal Cashier position but when I got to talking with the manager I told her about my interest in hotels and she was really excited that I wanted to work in that area. 5 minutes into the interview I was already told that she liked me and we went over to the hotel in the store to take a tour of the place. It was really amazing that I would be able to get hotel experience and work with some of my favorite animals."
good,"Getting to know the pets and pet parents as well as educating the pet parent on the best choices for their pets relationship and health. I was taught a lot about looking for key ingredients in food that best fit the pets needs and pet parents budget. Seeing a lot of the same customers helped build trusting relationships with the pet parent as well as the pets. As usual you have some co-workers who slack and cause others to pick up more of the load, but 95% of the people that worked with me were very friendly."
good,I love working with the animals and their parents.  I enjoy greeting the customers that come to Pet Smart.  We all work as a team in order to get the job done.
good,"flexible hours, good work environment, best part of the job is the pet parents bring their pets, the hardest part of this company its hard to move up in management and higher salary positions, you learn a lot about animals so its a great jobs if your an animal lover"
good,I love this job.! It is great the people here are really good to me.! They are fantastic people. There are a few things i didn't like but they are good to me all in all.
good,"A typical day at work. Emptied used and empty kennels of dirty bedding or towels and brought to the laundry. Took out all food dishes so they could be cleaned and prepared for breakfast. Made sure each pet staying had access to clean and fresh water. Communicated with the evening staff on any special notes regarding injured pets or pets that needed special attention. I cleaned and prepared kennels for future boarders. I cleaned all windows of any suites or playrooms. I washed and scrubbed the playroom floors, emptied and filled the cleaning buckets. Cleaned any equipment used from the day crew, I mopped and cleaned the department. During day shifts, I helped give pets their food and assisted them with bathroom breaks. I helped the day crew with check ins and check outs. I was put in a playroom with anywhere from 5 to 15 dogs at a time to let them play appropriately together. I loved working with my co-workers, they were helpful and informative when I was training and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job there, was trying to get back on track with daily tasks if there was a set back with a certain animal or situation."
good,groomed and bathed animals.scheduled appointments. I really enjoyed working while I was there.
good,"Everything about working at Petsmart is amazing. From the management to the customers, I have nothing bad to say about any of it. Best part of the job is all the animals that you see everyday."

good,Its not a bad job. Very enjoyable and you can learn a lot just by working there.
good,"I would work back here in a heart beat. "
good,"I would go to work everyday, unpack the products from boxes, and stock the shelves. I learned how to be organized and how not to eat so many dog cookies. My boss and co-workers were nice and helpful to me when I need help from them. The hardest part of the job was carrying the boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the money at the end of the month."
good,This company taught me quite a bit about the practices of management and the aspects of the retail world. In 4 years I advanced to 3 positions working my way up the corporate ladder. The practices of this company prove to be about the connection between pets and their pet parents. I would work for this company again or any of their competing companies that are involved in these types of practices. Makes for a great working environment.
good,What I appreciated mostly than other people who worked in the company was that it had a strong since of what was right and what was wrong.
good,"A wonderful staff and company that always cares about family first. "
good,It was an awesome experience. I gained a lot of confidence and management skills.
good,"Several hours before the store opened, I would care for the animals. I would clean their cages and tanks, provide food and water, and distribute medicine to sick animals. Once the store opened, I would provide customer service when needed. I enjoyed working with the animals, but at the time I was going to school and had accepted a higher paying job, I needed to give this one up."
good,"working in the salon as a bather is sometimes hard and you want to just cry and quit, but the coworkers and managers are worth it :)"
good,"Working for PetSmart has its perks, being around animals and making sure that all pet parents have the best possible nutritional value for their pet, regardless of what kind. Customer service would help with customer feel like they can trust employees in regards to their animals ."
good,"There needs to be fewer managers on staff and more actual employees! Also, they need to stick two cashiers up front all the time and not expect you to do other duties whilst cashiering."
good,"People were great work with, sometimes had nasty customers. People were honest."
good,great atmosphere to work in plus you get to interact with animals everyday. overall great pay and benefits
good,"Petsmart helped me gain corporate management skills as well as how to properly keep a safe, sterile enviorment for the pets in the PetsHotel. All of my co-workers were a pleasure to work with and advancement will happen with time and preperation. You can grow here."
good,Working for PetSmart has opened my opportunities for me. This place is a great place to grow if you up in the hard work and dedication.
good,A typical day at petsmart is coming in prepared to keep the customers satisfied and making them and their dogs have a wonderful experience.I have learned that you will have good days and you will have bad days but when you do your job the right way everyone will leave satisfied.The management is wonderful and a great help teaching us how to have wonderful customer service and keeping us on our toes at all times.My coworkers are wonderful great help when u needed them the most.The hardest part of my job was trying to make sure everyone was happy and cleaning up after every shift.The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing everyone leave happy and the compliments that the customers give me for the great service or performance  that i preformed.
good,Main manager was rude and mean to my salon boss. She was fake to her employees and then she act all nice to costomers. Bi Polar manager. LOVE my salon boss and coworkers. Good place to work just management was fake.
good,Was rough to wake up at 5am everyday to stock but work is work. I learned how to use a pallet jack for the first time. The managers I worked with were really focused on completing their jobs. My co-workers were a nice bunch of individuals I was glad to have had the chance to work with them. No part of the job was hard. Getting a chance to see what real management is like was the best experience I took in.
good,"Checked pets in and out of salon to be groomed. I mostly bathed and styled the dogs, especially the large dogs, they were my specialty. I learned how to more professionally groom dogs and cats, even ferrets and how to clip birds wings. I had pleasant and easy going co-workers, as well as management. We would have pizza parties, prizes at meetings, and even celebrate birthday's. The salon team gathered as a group and celebrated Christmas together, which was very nice. The toughest part of the job was an unsatisfied customer or having to refer a pet to a Vet because it was so badly matted. "
good,bathing the dogs was my favorite part especially when the pet parent requested me. i learned to do their nails first then go to bathe them. the managers are cool they care about the animals and the customer and always out them first. sometime when i had a big dog that was old it was really hard to dry them. i enjoyed the animals and bathing them
good,"Typically, day to day, I would work the cash register, handle money regularly, answer questions customers (Pet Parents) had, as well as pointing them in the right direction toward a product they needed. I'd also train Pet Parents and their dogs normal obedience cues, as well as more advanced tricks for CGC (Canine Good Citizen/ Therapy Dog), and selling training classes to Parents. My co-workers and managers were all wonderful, and they were the most enjoyable part of my day. They definitely made the job much easier. "
good,Good place to work. You get a chance to interact with the people and their pets. And if you are really really an animal person you'll love it
good,I loved working here. I got to play with animals all day and educate people on how to take care of their pets.
good,"I receive animals, supervise and execute the pet care department operations, function as a liaison between associates and management, train new associates, am responsible for filling the stock on the endcaps and in aisles, work the overnight planner resets, help to develop other associates within the department, along with working one on one with customers on a daily basis."
good,"Coworkers were awesome, the managers weren't as awesome though. Very antisocial and ""fake"". Not welcoming. Wouldn't help with schedule issues."
good,I think it was a great start off to growing up and learning for my jobs ahead to learn more then im young
good,"I worked with the animals. took care of fish, reptiles, birds, small animals. helped customers with questions and concerns. Help place the right pet for the families needs. help with weekly truck etc."
good,this was awsome because while i was with H.O.P.E i got to meet so many new people and i also got to help out so many amazing puppies.
good,"u basically know what to do has the day started so u went in check the sheduled, get your table ready. start grooming"
good,i loved petsmart the friendships i built there i still have to this day! it was just wonderful working there
good,I am a perfectionist and I enjoy making someone's furry loved one look beautiful.
good,"Great place to work,get to play and work with cats and dogs. Would recommend working here."
good,Every aspect of the job gave me a sense of pride completing both simple and complex tasks throughout the workday. While working 3rd shift I experienced many situations where managers were very helpful and able to keep me on task and work towards excelling within the company!
good,"I really love how PetSmart is and the friendly people at PetSmart as well, I learned how to fill out report cards for the dogs to give to the owners to show what their furry children have done in Day Camp. I also learned out how to fill out health carts for cats and dogs whenever they are sick or have another problem that should be recorded."
good,Friendly and great place to work  learned a lot about dogs and grooming  for the opportunity to move to the next step and become a dog groomer  due to unfortunate circumstances I wasn’t able to
good,"I absolutely love working with animals, I absolutely loved working with petsmart in the grooming department, customers and pets were an absolute pleasure, as well as my co-workers/ management, the only reason I no longer work here is because full time hours are only offered to managers and groomers... so ultimately I needed something more to maintain my family ☺️ Would definitely recommend this job to a college e student, or someone just looking for a supplement job,"
good,I stock the shelves at the store with items Petsmart receives from their truck. I ask customers if they need any assistance. I bathe dogs in preparation for them to be groomed.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was working with my coworkers who became life long friends and dogs, any job you get to work with animals is rewarding to me."
good,Everyday I went to work I did not feel as though i was truly working. I enjoyed working with animals and the people at the work place. The hours worked well with what I was needing at that time.
good,I luv the people I work with.  They are all younger than myself.  I'm the oldest person in my store! We truly love animals. My manager is understanding but gets things done.
good,Na na na na na I love it there so much friendly people and loved the animals and people and the experience of working there would go back any time I enjoyed it
good,"My managers at PetSmart are some of the greatest store leaders I have ever worked with and help to ensure the safety and well being of all team members. There is fair compensation for the amount of work you are required to do, with reasonable shift hours and a fun environment. I love working here. The discount is also really helpful if you have pets of your own."
good,"The most I can say about my time at petsmart as you were respected. Now you must know your stuff, such as which dog food for which and it can be a ver hard task take to learn all the foods. But the managers are there to hep. I loved the people I worked with, we ere the embodiment of a team."
good,Management is firm but fair. Everyone genuinely cares about each other and we all work as a team. There is great communication between both co-workers and management.  Also feel we have the greatest customers come in that are very appreciative of the assistance you are able to provide.
good,I enjoyed working at PetSmart lets of awards selling pet training and getting these people off the right start for their puppies and kittens one place shopping for all your pets need' s for the  life of your pet I worked for PetSmart for 13 years
good,"the dogs are adorable.  Theres even a radio in the play room.  However, when I asked if I could do other things in the facility, like cut hair and give exit baths, they said yes.  However, they wouldn't let me out of the dog play area."
good,PetSmart culture is progressive and fun. Employees are upbeat and the business model is still dynamic and developing. Working with animals and team work minded people is common for the company.
good,Good company. I really like the animals and the people are thourough.The management have been patient with me and have opened me up a little. They have been good I just need Full Time .
good,Store Manager was the best boss I've ever had. The culture and morale of this company is all up to the store management.  The work was easy and the workload bearable. There are opportunities for advancement if you're not an idiot or lazy. At least thats what it was in 2011.
good,"I worked as a cashier, then with the small animals. After that I worked as a dog bather, then I was trained as a dog groomer. I liked the training that I received. Everyone there has a love of animals."
good,"Working at PetSmart was a good job because you were surrounded by good coworkers and a different types of animals. I also loved being able to help pet parents when they had questions, to be able to point them in the right direction."
good,I had so much fun working at PetSmart. If there was one closer in my area I would still be working for the compan! You can learn all about great deals and help pet owners find amazing food or treats even toys for their pets. Plus the outfits are amazing!
good,This company was great to work for with many opportunities to move up in the company.  They take care of their full time employees and offer an ok benefits package.
good,A pleasant place to work. I enjoyed my management team and coworkers. We were all focused on serving the needs of Pet Parents. In retail your schedule is likely to vary. As a Pet Trainer I worked many evenings and weekends.
good,"Each day is a new day often filled with exciting and different challenges. I've grown within the company, as well as, learned new asks that can be used in the real world."
good,"There is not really any comments to give. Job was great. Not really any issues. Worked an average of 45hrs, and managment was respectful and caring. Will stay there."
good,"co workers are great, animals are cute, managers are fun. Having the monthly videos to know more about the products PetSmart carries especially the dog food because, we can start to figure out what is best for the pet parents and pets nutrition and needs"
good,"Working at Petsmart was absolutely the best. Management was supportive, teamwork was fun. The job itself was productive, and our events were always packed and filled with joy."
good,"Love the pet-friendly culture at PetSmart. Managers and associates are friendly, animal-loving, great people to work with. Working here gives you something in common with your fellow associates and your customers so talking and making friends is very easy."
good,"I would recommend anyone looking to work with animals and very nice people to work at Pet Smart either full time or part time. "
good,"Petsmart is an excellent place to work, specially if you are an animal lover.  The management team as well as the employees are amazing.  I absolutely recommend Petsmart."
good,"You get to work with animals all day, the people here are always upbeat and ready to work. We have times where we have to be serious but we also have many more times where we can joke around and have a blast."
good,A wonderful place to start your career with pets. Options for advancement and flexible shifts. Allow you to work in multiple positions until you find the department which fits you best.
good,"If you love animals, even if you're on cash, you still get to meet animals people bring in (mostly dogs) and give them treats. The conversation topic is usually people's pets, which is always a happy topic, so grumpy customers are uncommon. This job is what all general part-time jobs should be like. They treat you well and have reasonable rules. The only thing I really wish would change is for them to update some of the needs and requirements for specific animals like rabbits, guinea pigs hamsters and more. Recent scientific evidence shows our ""basic needs and habitat requirements"" are incorrect, the main thing being that these animals need way more space than we say they do. Literally all of the cages marketed to hamsters are unsuitable for a hamster to live in, more than half only being suitable as a travel cage. The hamsters cannot be upgraded to a larger animal's cage because the bars are too far apart and they can escape. On the other hand, guinea pigs and other animals are suggested to go into a larger cage marketed to a larger animal because it has a better amount of space."
good,Everyone I worked with was great and reasonable. The only thing is upper management puts too much pressure on the email capture and the amount of people not buying stuff. Some people come into pet stores to look at the fish. I can't help that.
good,"I loved going to work and seeing all the different babies that were with us that day. It was always a good time with the dogs in camp, it could get stressful sometimes but you just need to take a step back and breath. My manager was amazing aswell as my other coworkers, the manager over the store was very rude though."
good,"There are plenty of opportunities to advance, there are fun on-campus events, there is an onsite gym, daycare and cafe for lunch.  And you can bring your pet to work!!"
good,"I really just wanted the job while in college for the summer. They were very flexible with my internship schedule and the environment is fun and happy. There is no way that seeing pets everyday can make you unhappy, and the people that work with me were very positive and you can tell they are happy doing what they do."
good,"Management was excellent."
good,"if you love working with animals, you'll love working here. You create a bond with regular clients and their pets, everyone you come across feels like family there."
good,"Retail is retail, so you'll interact with customers all day. PetSmart customers are more demanding than other retailers I've worked. Many customers come in looking for advice for their animals with no idea what they're doing and they don't really want to take your advice, either. Be prepared for customers to think you're a vet and to be offended when you tell them they have to take their dog to an actual vet."
good,"The three years I spent at PetSmart were positive and formative as an entry to the workforce. I began working there part-time in Highschool and eventually moved to full time, working in shipping and receiving. The company provided forklift safety training and certified me so I was able to develop the skills I had learned going forward."
good,From the first day I felt welcomed. Everybody was willing to help me and show me what I needed to do. They were very understanding when I had questions and will miss all of them.
good,"I got to take care of the dogs and cats that were being boarded there. I was responsible for the check-in and maintaining cleanliness of the cages. We had play rooms for them to play in and took them on walks for exercise. Some dogs were nice and others not so much. Overall, I loved animals and how everyone worked together"
good,Had fun working with pets really enjoyed the customers. the management team was very supportive  and the store was well maintained. I would recommend it as a place of employment.
good,I loved my time at Petsmart. It was a great stepping stone into Corporate America. It taught me the fundamentals that I use daily with my current job. Very fast-paced and detail oriented as well as customer service as #1 priority. I loved seeing the wagging tails as the customers would walk in the store and learned a lot about pet health and nutrition which is a plus since I have pups of my own.
good,The employees at Petsmart make sure they are as educated as possible to be able to help customers out as best as they can. They make sure to take care of the animals and treat every animal that comes in with love. They take very good care of their employees and leave room for advancement with working with animals.
good,This was probably my favorite job in general. I have even thought about attempting to go back. I love working with animals and teaching people how to care for them once they become a pet parent.
good,"I was hired on to work two separate summers here and would definitely go back again. They were really flexible with my hours and were willing to give me the shift that worked best for me. I generally had 30 hours or more as it was normally busy but if I needed less because I was busy they were able to redistribute my shifts easily. My managers were kind and attentive so I never felt that I couldn't approach them if I needed something. The environment could get stressful at times but mostly it was nice to get a few hours with the animals and then focus on the nitty-gritty. Overall, I would recommend PetSmart to others looking for a part-time job where they can advance and gain skills fairly quickly. It was a wonderful place to work."
good,"Working at petsmart is a very fun and social place to be, you get to interact with all the different breeds of dogs and there owners and find out how they blend in with the families and there temperments."
good,"How can you go wrong working with animals? Although stressful sometimes this was a fun job. You never knew what you were going to see walk in the doors. Dogs, cats, lizards, pigs, etc. A really interesting place to work."
good,"One of my favorite places to work! Especially if you love animals. Hours are very different from one day to the next. Good job for students and people without children "
good,"This is the best job I have ever had. My management team COULD NOT be better.  My work environment is steadily paced, I get to interact with pets all day, all jobs are relatively easy, flexible hours, my coworkers are like my extended family. Company has good values."
good,Its a great place to work. The people are all wonderful and the managers are extremely relaxed. I was only minimum wage worker so unfortunately there weren't very many career advancements for me.
good,A typical day was fast paced and stressful but it was all to take care of the animals. The job required you to think on your toes and to pay attention to the animals at all times.
good,Pet Smart is the best place I've every worked. The managers are amazing and they are extremely flexible with your schedule. I would recommend working here to anyone
good,"I love the environment of this place, I feel as if I connect more to the customers relating to animals, I usually will build a strong bond with my customers and I always jump to help when someone seems like they might need help finding something. Even if they do not seem lost I will check on them anyways just to make sure everything is going smoothly for their shopping experience. I have bonded with all of my coworkers in a wonderful way and the management as well.. even if there is someone I don't find to be my favorite person I still try to treat them with the same respect as everyone else."
good,This is an extremely fast paced work environment. Almost everyone is willing to assist you when needed. Management team keeps you updated and is willing to give guidance.
good,"I loved my job there. I was having a hard time with my son whom had medical illness and how to understand how to help him, raising 2 teenage boys and work a full time job. I lost my only son to mental illness and lost my job. I still have nothing bad to say about Petsmart. I love that company, I am stronger now and have been and I had to move on and get a job at Veyo. I want to move on and do more for members/patients/ people and help them. I want to be with a company that will help me with that. I have a lot more knowledge and strengh. I know I would be a great part of you team with a lot of knowledge. I have over 15 years experience working with customer services. I love helping out others. I am very compassionate and caring, integrity, thorough and love to learn new and different things every day."
good,"Management was great and I enjoyed working there very much. Being a cashier was fun, you were able to meet a lot of kittens and puppies. You were also responsible for taking care of the cats that were up for adoption by giving them some love, replenishing food and water, washing down the kennels and changing litter. The hardest part of the job was when I first began my position, I was learning how the computer system worked on the cashier tills and trying to understand it."
good,Great place to work. Great staff and amazing management. Only bummer is how greedy corporate management is and how annoying all the donation drives are.
good,"I absolutely loved working  for this company, if you have any interest in pets and need extra income this is the job to have. feels good knowmulting the animals need you,fun to play with throughout the day. also sharing your love for animals with others."
good,"When your products and services involve live things, you'll never know what every day brings. From the pets you carry, to the service dogs in the salon and hotel, you will never be bored. and have challenges and joys every day!"
good,"If you love animals, PetSmart is definitely a great place to start out in, the people are friendly and the employees are usually there for the same reasons as you. If there is a PetsHotel, I highly suggest applying there."
good,"Most of the day center around customer service and the pets that comes into the store, Coaching the associates and teaching them how to drive sales through getting the customers to the items they are seeking and getting add on sales. Also making sure the trucks are getting to the floor to make sure we have the merchandise on the floor for the customers. For me my job was to see that we had the schedule completed on time so the associates new when they were working and to have power hours covered each day. Our culture was a culture of care for our customers and associates. The hardest part of the job is just making sure all planners and pogs get completed. I enjoy working with people and seeing the pets when they come into the store and also training the associates on the proper way of getting things done the right way."
good,"There is opportunity to learn as much or as little as you would like to within the company.  You can read manuals, shadow others, or just attend meetings to listen to what goes on in areas where you want to learn more, and they welcome your questions and feedback.  Can share ideas across the network and with corporate as well, though this is usually only if someone takes the initiative, so it may be better to have more scheduled, routine meetings to push this collaboration.  It's a quick-paced environment, but they do their best to keep everyone happy with relaxed dress code, fun events, free food, and the ability to being your pet to work!  The company overall does good work for charities as well.  Nice to be proud of where you work."
good,"As a support manager I trained and educated all new hires on cashier skills and current employees on new policy.  I was on of the top sales associates for dog training classes. Opened and closed the store, ordered all change for the tills, made deposits, and managed customer service. trained and earned my dog training certificate."
good,I loved working at petsmart and it really sparked my love for pets to an even higher level. The only problem I had was with my co-workers in the grooming salon. The girls in there were very cut-throat and did a very poor job training. After my training they insulted me often and blamed it on me as to why I didn't know many things I was suppose to. I love constructive criticism however I didn't feel like this was very constructive. I loved all other aspects of working in the petsmart community!
good,"I loved working at Petsmart. There are two things you need to work here. One, be friendly and customer service oriented. Two, a love for animals! The job itself is fun and always different!"
good,"Things can get very busy and stressful sometimes. However, the team tends to stick together and help each other through any hard times. Most employees are dedicated and caring. Best manager I have ever had. Customers are usually very sweet."
good,"Loved grooming and teaching people to groom. Loved managing the shop and building the business. Lack of computer system for record keeping and someone dedicated to answering the phone and interacting with clients made job very stressful. Hard to finish grooming on time when had to answer the phone 25 times while grooming one dog. Also, bathroom at back of store required leaving the shop which slowed us down because customers requested assistance when we were seen on the way to the bathroom. So breaks and meals were difficult expecially during holidays."
good,PetSmart is a great place to work for a pet lover. Getting to work and learn more about animals was a great experience for me. The staff and management team worked really good together.
good,"A typical day at work was taking care of the animals and making sure that they got the medications and feed that they required. It also involved deep cleaning the cages, misting the reptiles, and keeping the back room clean. I also bagged fish and crickets for the customers that requested them. "
good,Overall a great learning experience as far as working with animals . And learning customer service . As well as learning to deal with difficult situations
good,A love for animals and lack of fear is necessary. It is a dirty job but well worth it due to the many cute animals you get to play with and you really learn a lot about dog behavior.
good,I had a lot of fun working here. I love Animals and was able to interact with them regularly and get to know some of them and their owners. I had to leave them because i moved and would work for them again if i was able to make a bit more. Glad i picked this place to gain my workplace experience.
good,Great job to start off in if going into the animal field has its ups and downs like any company but they take care of their own. All management want to see employees succeed. Great first job!!
good,"I like working for PetSmart, my managers are fair and very willing to support me as a trainer. I am starting my first training classes soon, and I am looking forward to it."
good,"I loved working for Petsmart! It was the first job that I got to experience what good management looked and felt like. They were always encouraging me to do my best and assured me that mistakes happen and it was okay, just to learn from them and don't make the same mistakes. They were always willing to listen to any concerns I had, or any personal issues I was going through and worked with me when I needed time off or a personal day. Overall incredible place to work, including great benefits and fair pay."
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, they help my animal handling skills grow exponentially. My co-workers made it enjoyable to come to work and made the day go by easily. I regret having to leave the store I have become so attached too."
good,Petsmart was one of the best jobs I could have because I have a passion for working with animals and the co workers and manager were the best to work with !!
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and their animals. The job in its entirety was a great place to work. The management team was great to work for, I would work for this company again."
good,i had a great time working for petsmart the environment was nice the store was always clean the customers were always amazing petting dogs and cats was a plus
good,"Come and play with dogs and cat, help customer to make the best decision for the pet, teach the dogs behaviors and people friendly. When we have a customer for many years and the pet pass."
good,"I really would like to help out with the dogs please. I will start my job December 1st. And I will always always come after school. I also have a disability including Autism, assburgers, OCD and another one I totally forgot just to let you know."
good,"Early mornings and late evenings are very slow and gets boring, however the mid day shift is extremely busy, fast paced and sometimes hectic. The team of employees are always there for each others needs and questions. The PetSmart team is truly a family within itself.  Head cashier is in charge of being on the busiest register in the store. Occasionally I would have to switch placed with the floor walker and approach customers , identify their needs and assist with merchandise selection. The hardest part of the day is a hour before closing time, one employee has to ""face"" the entire store, while the other employee stands at the register. ""facing the store"" means that every can of dog food and every item on all the shelves must be facing forward and stocked properly."
good,a typical day at PetSmart is going in with a positive attitude and thinking how many customers can I make smile today. I did gain a lot of knowledge in the 5 years working for PetSmart. Hardest part of the job was not being able to take home all the cute puppies!
good,I love working for Petsmart and all the opportunities of meeting other pet parents and other pets. I have learned how to handle complicated situations and learned so much about animal care there is to offer. It's really a fun place to work at.
good,"I loved my job because I love pets. I was the Inventory Manager  I worked day and night shifts with a lot of merchandise to stock with very little help. This was explained to the Director and nothing was done about it, which made the job challenging wasn't the problem with being challenging but the expectations were not possible."
good,"I LOVED working here. It gave me the chance to learn about and play with the animals. The best part was when I became a dog bather. I enjoyed the group of people that I got to work with everyday. I wish we wouldn't have had to relocate because they were wanting to send me to grooming school, which would have been AWESOME."
good,PetSmart is a very driven employer with much more of a fast-paced process than most retailers.  The culture is wonderful with animal interaction and focus.
good,"Management at the location I've worked at has only changed once and both managers are great. They are understanding of personal issues and health issues."
good,"I wish they had more positions available for Full time positions at this business. It is the main negative thing I have to say, I enjoyed working there, however the pay and hours were just not cutting it anymore."
good,"Every morning I would open the door and turn off the alarm, then grab the scanning gun and scan every empty shelf in the consumables department, print out the report and get those empty Areas filled. That was priority before the store opened."
good,"Always be on time and be passionate about what you do. Keep busy, be helpful to customers. Always use hop on dogs/cats and make sure to keep your eyes on them to avoid accidents."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed my job at petsmart, management was very well run, along with always plenty of hours and shifts. Also room too move up if motivated too do so. Only complaint would be not enough money as I'm used too waitressing which makes a significant amount more."
good,I love my salon manager. She will work with you to make sure you get the best training and support when you get hired with us. I've been with the company for almost a year and I've never had anything bad to say about them. I love the team building that we have within our salon and love that we are so small that new associates getting started with us don't feel lost.
good,"I loved working for Petsmart Pet hotel. I broke my heart resigning from the job. It was a fast paced, physical, challenging job, but i loved every minute of it! Working with the pets was such a pleasure and developing relationships with the Pet parents was very gratifying. I still miss that job and if they ever open one close by I'M THERE!!!!!"
good,I enjoyed working with petsmart because of the people there and getting to help pets. It's a very fulfilling job with great associates to work with. I would recommend petsmart to someone else to work at.
good,"The workplace was fun and very energetic, a good team work environment and highly productive. Very diligent staff and caring towards the pets and very informed on the products they sell."
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work at. If you really love animals, you will instantly enjoy working there with helping customers feed their pet the type of food they want based on the type of diet they are looking for. You will also learn a lot about many different types of animals and how to care for each of them. The benefits are great if you are able to be full time and the management team are there to help answer any questions you my have or help in general."
good,"Each day is different. There are different tasks to complete, different pet parents to assist, and different questions asked. I've learned how to properly care for animals and how to recommend the proper pet for pet parents along with operational skills including interviewing, hiring, coaching, training, payroll, and managing different types of associates. Hardest part about the job is the commute. Benefits and advancement opportunities are great. Workplace culture is fun but is changing under new company leadership."
good,"I had the opportunity to work for one of the best stores in the region, clearly because of my manager. I was promoted three times by the same person. I was sent to a struggling store to help get it back on track, and it was extremely different there. Those positions made it clear to me how important management truly was."
good,Different job titles. Great learning experiences with different animals. Employees are great to work with. Fun interacting with customers and their animals.
good,"The supervisory staff was very respectful and professional. The co-workers were friendly and fun to work with. The hours were reasonable and steady."
good,"Flexible schedules."
good,Working at petsmart you had great hours able to mov e to a diffrent positions in the store when they open up. The management is wonderful and respectful and they listen well to all your conserns and help to fix them
good,"Working at PetSmart is like working with your family. Everyone gets along great and we all compliment each other in the work we do as we all pitch in to help out where we can."
good,"PetSmart was a great environment to work in full of energy and no lack of people to help out. I learned a lot of great ways to talk to people about sensitive topics and how to think critically to help people solve issues with their pets. I worked in the Reptile, Fish, Small Animal, and Birds section which cause me to need to learn a lot information quickly and be able to apply it to everyday situations. My co-workers were all very nice and never gave me any problems or issues and management was great and very understanding especially with me being a student. They hardest part of my job was not all the cleaning or taking care of animals or sick animals but was diffusing situations when a customer came to the shop upset or nervous. I made it my duty to make sure that every customer I came in contact with left our conversation with an answer and a smile. Which leads into my favorite part of the job which was being recognized for doing well. I was given employee of the month for that exact duty stated above. I loved being recognized for going out of my way for each customer because it made it even more worth the trouble."
good,Love meeting all the pet parents and helping them connect with their pets. Fun safe environment to work in. The people I worked with were amazing.  Miss working there.
good,I am an honest hard worker and am excellent in cust service. 20 years exp love working with animals and people. Love to help. Always on time. Looking to learn all I can.
good,"Working at PetSmart was a blast! Management was very friendly, my coworkers were very kind, and the job itself was a blast. I didn't work there long enough to be able to advance, but some of my coworkers were able to advance during the time I was there. I would recommend working here!"
good,I always looked forward to working everyday.  My co-workers were awesome and the animals loving.  I learned skills in animal handling and feeding as well as care that I would have never gotten unless I had worked there.
good,I worked at many different Petsmart locations and all though all of them are nice. They are not all the same and are run very differently from an employee stand point. I was a manager with the company and even in that position you can move stores and have different ways of doing the job. Overall I loved my time with Petsmart and I would say its a good High school college job but I wouldn't make it into a manager life job.
good,"I think this will be the rite job for anyone who love animals because , I love dealing with all type of animals including exotic pets. I've sold all types of reptiles and I done very well with getting to know them an know what will anger them and what will not anger them, I have a strong bond with animals so I am looking forward to working here and being able to grow in this job will be a dream for me."
good,"PetSmart was my first job and the management team was very helpful from the start and did a good job at teaching me how everything worked. My co-workers were just as helpful as my managers and still are. "
good,My work environment is very enjoyable. I interact with customers daily checking in pets and checking out pets. I started as a bather and now am a groomer for 3 years. My salon manager is awesome she worked with my school schedule also if I have any questions with grooming I can ask and she will help. Salon manager has 20 plus years grooming. Managers in general at petsmart I don't think they handle the workers that are in subordinate properly. I love what I do and where I work the hardest or challenging thing for me would be speaking to a Spanish speaking customer. I am not fluent in Spanish but it has gotten better.
good,A typical day at PetSmart was basically the same as a day at Camp Bow Wow.  Except PetSmart was way more relaxed and they were not as strict on care for the dogs and their facilities than Camp Bow Wow which is why I left PetSmart for Camp Bow Wow.
good,"I love that you always have something to do when you walk in! I've learned how to manage my time in order to accomplish all tasks I've been given, even with some complications or interruptions. Management overall was decent, but my co-workers are all amazing people! The worst part is when people don't care about what I'm telling them and not wanting what's best for their new pets. The best part of the job is seeing how happy I can make someone by teaching them how to properly care and love their new pet!"
good,"Petsmart; a fun place to work, you never know whats around the corner! You get to see the cute puppies, you have the opportunity to see the newest fashion and apparels; interesting things for your pet . At Petsmart you have the pleasure to learn so much from different peoples and how to communicate with different personalities, how to accomplish new things, and most of all, discover who you really are with the help of your co-workers. Unfortunately, it can be stressful with aggressive dogs or cleaning someones elses mess ( the dogs ) but the most enjoyable part of the job is that people know you love what you do. You can be yourself, have fun , laugh, make silly sounds and guess what? you get paid for it! Seeing the smile of someone walking away from a groom there first visit happy and cheerful, is priceless.."
good,"I enjoy my day at P-------. My day starts by doing some paper work that includes things like negative inventory, things to be written off or returned. I then assign tasks to other associates to do daily opening tasks like feeding the animals and sweeping. I then would count tills and the cash float and then open the tills so that they are ready for when the store opens. I have a very good relationship with my fellow co-workers. We all work together as a team and always know how to get things done while having a good time. The most enjoyable part of petsmart is when customers come in with their dogs and puppies looking to get something new. The dogs are always so joyful. The hardest part of being a supervisor at petsmart is having to deal with unsatisfied customers. Although, over time I have learned how to find a happy medium with the customer with both parties leaving the conversation happy and content."
good,Love being around animals and people who love animals. The environment of work is great and the management. I replenish the store and answered questions to pet parents.
good,"Petsmart is a corporate box store, which such tends to get a bad reputation. However, in my short tenure here, I have found the pay structure to be above average, the atmosphere to be quite refreshing, and the potential to advance in the company to be very realistic. Great place to work and I love animals!"
good,"learning each day how to care for animals and why people pick the animal that they did."
good,I love working with the customers (pet parents) and their pets.  Their is nothing better than being able to help a pet parent with their four legged family members.
good,"Loved working at PetSmart and would advise more people starting out to work there as well. Met a lot of great people there and the hours worked well with my schedule outside work. Managers were very understanding if something came up whether it is an emergency or sickness. Associates worked together and had fun working while getting the job done. Plus you get to see dogs, cats, birds, fish, reptiles, etc... Great place if you are a lover of animals, reptiles, and fish. Pay is low, but it is a retail job. Don't expect a high salary. More than minimum wage."
good,"A typical day at work consists of juggling your responsibility to take care of either opening, mid-shift, or closing tasks while keeping your commitment to providing excellent customer service. Management is approachable and great about accommodating employee needs and my co-workers are a diverse group of long-time employees. The hardest part of the job is learning about all the various pets and their needs, products, and services that PetSmart provides only because it's information-overload. The most enjoyable part is the satisfaction you get in making a difference in a pet's life whether it's from direct contact with the pet or educating the pet parent on how to better provide for their pet for a better quality of life."
good,Petsmart is a good place to work for. The hardest part of the job is dealing with frustrated customers but there is always a solution! It is so fun to see dog's and other pets come in. It helped take a lot of stress out of the day!
good,"-Groomed various breeds of dogs."
good,"I like to work with the animals. The staff is trained very well to take care of the animals that are for sale, and the company in general has great intentions for said animals. As for my coworkers, they are all so friendly and helpful and very motivated to keep the animals clean, fed and healthy."
good,"I'm a outgoing go getter searching for a good company that values hard work and determination. I am a self motivated person, very productive and dependable. I can work very well alone or as a group, team. I am skilled at training and leading a group of associates."
good,"As a specialty retail organization, Petsmart is sometimes overlooked in the retail world as a powerhouse. But the truth of the matter is Petsmart often sets the standard of what true customer service really means. The typical customer experience starts in the parking lot before they ever make it in the building, and is followed through during their entire shopping experience. For this company the average customer spends 20-30 minutes in the store. With management focusing on customer service, the evidence trickles throughout the associates cleanliness causing a very low profit-loss margin."
good,I got to work with the animals up til i was five months which i developed pre-eclampsia and caused my feet to swell something offer which then i moved to be a cashier and sat on a stool which i later had to leave when i was six months pregnant due to doctor putting me on bed rest
good,"Honestly, this is thee best place I have ever worked!!  hard to get full time, for me at least, due to my position."
good,"I worked as a cashier, along with helping to stock shelves and  helping with pet care. I learned so much about customer service, things that I will be able to take with me wherever I go! I enjoyed my co-workers, and the management was wonderful! They enforced the rules, but weren't ""mean"" when they did. I loved going into work everyday, and regret that I ended up leaving! I would work for this company in a flash if I ever got the chance again!"
good,As one of the team leaders this job was truly fun.  I learned a lot and management made work fun!!!  Even though the work was heard they allowed us to have fun doing it.  I learned how to drive different forlift and was allowed to lead our daily exercise session during start up.
good,"PetSmart is one of the most fun places I have worked yet. The managers treat you with great respect, while also making it a welcoming and just fun place to be. The customers help this as well, as people that come in with pets to shop for said pets are typically on the nicer end of the spectrum when it comes to customers. The pay is also better than most retail, my only complaint is that they refuse to move me to full time, which I can only assume is to save them money on benefits. Overall it is a great and fun place to work with an awesome staff."
good,I have had so much fun as a cashier at petsmart playing with dogs while ringing up customers. I just wish they paid their employees better.
good,Just a great place to work.  It isn't just your normal Retail business.  You can't go wrong working with peoples pets and helping them find the things they need to be able to care of their pet needs.
good,"A typical day at work for me starts very early, around 4 or 5 am. I clock in they immediately check and preform price changes. I then get with a manager to figure out my next task which could be clearance mark downs or most likely helping complete load. I am cross-trained as a UPC specialist, stocker, and cashier. I've never worked harder at any job and its really built my character. I am now stronger and have become less lazy. Everyone I've met working while at Petsmart have all been wonderful people, I truly enjoy conversing with them. Every manager I've worked with genuinely cares and does whatever they can to make you a better worker. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is stocking heavy items, but its making me stronger. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing price changes now that I know where all the products are."
good,"I love working in management at pet smart, I have learned so many skills, and have personally advanced myself. My coworkers are great I have a great stocking team. I applied for pet smart because I love animals, and that is exactly what I got, I have learned so much in these past two years about all animals, and me sharing my knowledge with customers is another way I can help save animals."
good,"Friendly coworkers, lots of dogs, i learned how to clip nails and grind them a lot faster now, also more experienced with dog bathing and drying, the managers were nice, the hardest part was dealing with customers, the most enjoyable part was working with the pets!"
good,Great company to be a part of. They really take care of their employees. There are alot of rewards a benefits to being a part of petsmart. Just the other day our salon won $100 gift just because we won a contest that consisted of pretty much doing our jobs. It does depend on your management on how the atmosphere is but I really enjoy working for Petsmart.
good,A job at PetSmart should interest those greatly interested in the field of animal behavior and customer interaction. Those wishing to pursue a career with consistent friendly and personable people and creatures may definitely wish to inquire about the careers they have offered at PetSmart.
good,"A typical day starts with a meeting about daily production goals, safety announcements, and weekly trivia. Ive learned to drive a pallet rider. Management seems unsure of how to do their job at times, often asking for one thing but then never acting on. They are bosses not leaders at Petsmart. Co workers are alright. Of course getting 320 people in one building is going to cause some trouble from time to time, but its mostly all good. The hardest part is meeting production on a weekly basis as the company continues to make production tighter and tighter with each year. Basically working employees way too hard for the money."
good,PetSmart is an AWESOME place to work. Especially the one in Rocky Mount. Everyone is family there. You learn so much about all types of animals. Everything about PetSmart is enjoyable.
good,"I clean, feed the animals, and medicate the ones that are sick after they have been seen by the vet. The management and co-workers are great easy to work for and everyone seems to work together."
good,There is always something to keep me busy at work. Whether it be engaging with a Pet Parent or caring for a pet. Management team is fun ! Always keeps our team happy and makes the work day go by smoothly. I enjoy working with all my co-workers.  We all communicate extremely well.  I honestly do not fel there are any hard parts of my job. We all work as a team which makes it go smoothly!  The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have with others.
good,"Really the best Retailer I have ever worked for.  "
good,I loved customers that came in regarly and I just loved teaching the pet parents valuable information of what they can do better for their pets.
good,This is honestly one of my favorite jobs.  The leadership team were great at their job and lead honorably.  Petsmart taught me most of my warehousing skills and I am grateful.
good,you learn a lot and grow a lot. relaxed environment and you get meet great people and learn about all kinds of things about the pet industry.
good,This was a perfect position when I was attending college. I was able to meet such a variety of people.
good,"Petsmart has by far been my favorite job I have ever held as well as the company I stayed with the longest. I was able to start the job as a seasonal employee but based on my attitude and work ethic I was able to retain my position and work up into management. Petsmart was a challenging but rewarding position. My experience was so good due in large part to my store manager at my location being a great leader and being willing to work with me and help me develop. As a rule, Petsmart is a solid company to work for, you have to fight for what you deserve with wages but they will respond to respectful and valid arguments. I would recommend this company to anyone. "
good,On a typical day I get to work and start helping customers along with facing shelves if it is needed. I look around to see what needs to be done. Days that I am on the regisiter I get the area ready for the day. If I am doing Pet care that day then I get the cages cleaned and make sure all the animals have clean areas along with water and food. If I am facing that day then I go over my area and straighten up all products to make the area more attractive and organized for customers.
good,"A typical day would be checking on all of the animals and making sure that they are all healthy and have food. You have to love animals to work here. There are many different types of customers who come in, but if you make a good impression on them they will definitely come back to you and it won't feel like a customer it will also feel like you made a new friend. The work load was not heavy but not light, it was just the right amount of work."
good,"I loved petsmart, I was able to be around dogs all day and make them look pretty and make the pet parents happy."
good,"Working for Petsmart was amazing! Everyday I was able to come to work and do what I love. I got to interact with people and animals all day. The employees and management at Petsmart were amazingly friendly and caring. I truly enjoyed working with the customers, other employees and the animals through out the day!"
good,I enjoy my job very much do to the fact that I love animals. This job has been one of the best I have had so far it keeps me moving and management couldn't be any better. They are some of the best people I've come to know. My co-workers are friendly and helpful for the most part. The hardest part of the job is when it gets really busy and we don't have enough people on hand to help everyone. The most enjoyable part is the the animals.
good,lead signage; very fun and simple while I was in school. I loved my co workers
good,Very fun and exciting. every corner you turn theres always a surpise that awaits you. Working for the Company is so Happy and Charmful even when your haiving a bad day
good,"I have been so impressed by Petsmart...I have delightful Co workers, and management actually cares about us and the customers.."
good,"listening to all the animals noises throughout the store, meeting customers, also enjoying a friendly working atmosphere. the hardest part of the job was finding escaped livestock under warehouse stock and sometimes on the shop floor,""i tell you it was not good for my heart."" advising customers on the best products for their animals needs, being off any kind off assistant to both customers and work colleagues. when i first started at pet smart, i chose to work few weeks without pay. an audit came through and was asked to do the audit for 3 nights, which i jumped at the chance. which this then gave me my full time employment."
good,"I really loved working here. I love being around animals. My co-workers were a great group of people. The management was great too. The hardest part about the job was trying to explain to customers why and how to do things differently for the heath and safety of their pet and having them not understand or not want to change their ways, The best part about the job was being around all the animals and the smile I would see on a child's face when they left the store with their new furry, scaly friend."
good,Great place for people that love pets and the challenge of a fast paced retail environments.
good,"My typical day at Petsmart would be making sure all animals were heathly, had plenty of food, cages and tanks were clean, and customer service. I learned more about the proper ways to handle concerns and questions a customer might have. My management and my co-workers were like my family. To me the hardest part of the job was working with crickets. And the most enjoyable part for me was the atmosphere and having confidence in the advice I was giving."
good,"I worked there for a good 6 months and enjoyed every bit of it. great people to work with, pays reasonable compensation. my only gripe is that they couldnt give me enough hours during the week, going under 20 hours."
good,"Received and stocked pet food, helped new pet owners with proper training of animals, and provided quality customer service. I learned more about the pet industry than I knew was out there. I still use the information to this day. The best part of the job was meeting all of the animals from monkeys to wolves. The hardest part was the clean up of those animals."
good,PetSmart is a great work environment.
good,Everything went great after one manager left who played favorites to the attractive women.
good,I really enjoy working at PetSmart. The management team is very supportive of the people. The associates are friendly to one another and are always willing to help. The job itself is great because I enjoy the challenge that each new customer brings and I need to use my problem solving skills to find the best solutions.
good,"Typical work day would be first printing off sales reports and comparing them with the district. Predict sales for the day and how much buisness we need in order to make plan for the day then the week. Make weekly schedule, write reviews, call customers and weeky sales / business meetings. Peer evaluations and grooming."
good,"PetSmart, out of my 30 years of experience in retail, was the best company that I ever worked for. I would definitely consider going back to them."
good,Love working at PetSmart the only thing that stinks is not getting more days and hours to work. Need more hours but other wish love working there wonderful.
good,"While at PetSmart my duties and responsibilities were to great each customer that came in to the store as well direct them to the correct area depending on what the customer was looking for. I would demonstrate products, answer questions and guide them to pet needs. My responsibilities here were also cashier duties, I handled money and worked a register and ended each transaction by inviting the customer to come again soon."
good,"Very good place to work. Friendly people and very helpful to animals. Manager is very easy to work with.  Always learning something about animals. Customers are very friendly. They work with the adopting the animals out to good people who will take care of them, and give them a good home."
good,A typical day requires a lot of interaction with pet parents assisting them in finding the right solution for their unique problem. I learned a lot about the animals I care for and how to tweak their environment based on a certain animals needs. The hardest part of the job is getting a pet parents who isn't satisfied with your initial suggestion to their problem and coming up with something a little different but with the outcome they're hoping for.
good,I enjoyed my time working in the Saint Joseph Petsmart.  My coworkers were like a second family and the customers were always nice. Definitely miss them.
good,Great job great management just wish u could've worked there for a lot longer. I miss where I worked at. And still want to groom.  But I will do what God calls me to do and I met some life long friends that will be there til the end and petsmart put me through academy and I finished and I know I did great there for as long as I could have.
good,They are patient and understanding. They are willing to help you advance to higher positions pretty quickly but without worry or anxiety. They became my second family and I do not regret working for them.
good,Great place to grow within the business. Plenty of growth at PetSmart. A company who cares about what the employees think. Best retail store I ahve worked at.
good,"To many policies that don't make sense, loved working with the animals and the people, great benefits, would work there any time again, the new store manager is great"
good,Petsmart is a good company. I left due to poor management at the location I was at. I would return to work for Petsmart given the opportunity. Great environment and good benefits.
good,Petsmart was overall an amazing experience! Staff was friendly and management was encouraging and supportive. Career advancement available and they take good care of the animals!
good,I was in Charge of answering phones answering questions of clients checking in and out dogs doing a full body review making sure that they were not matted and explaining on what kind of haircut the dog should take also bathing nail grinding teeth cleaning ear cleaning
good,True leadership role where you are able to hold your team accountable. 65+ employees and a team of 14 managers. The GM for this type of role is acting more as an HR representative.
good,"When yo work alongside people with similar goals, passions, and values, it's hard to go wrong. Petsmart was an excellent place to do what you love with other animal lovers! "
good,"A lot of independence"
good,"Managenent works with you on scheduling.  Spending time in daycamp with up to 17 dogs at once can be very rewarding.  It is also sometimes trying since a particular dog or two may not be playing appropriately.  The team at the desk is there to support you, help you, and take a dog out for timeout as needed.  They also provide wifi speakers so you can play your own music which is really nice."
good,Great place to work. Good pay. Full time benifits are good. Skme days are high pace others arent. Managment is always there to help along with other team members. The team work is out standing. I have had the opportunity to learn a lot frkm the store an to being able to mo vcd e around the store is great for me. My regurlars are amazing. I know them by name an they know me by name. Over all this is my favoreite job an i plan on being with them for a while
good,PetSmart is a fun environment to work in because you get to interact with many animals daily. The culture and vibe at PetSmart is also a huge roll in the fun factors of working here.
good,"Everyone there is very productive its near and organized easy to find items, and when your looking for something someone is always there to help with questions"
good,"Great place to work. As long as you're knowledgeable in pets and willing to learn about the products and services provided you can do extremely well here. It's like any other retail with customers who aren't always pleasant, but management is a great support as everyone who works here cares about the pets."
good,"Petsmart is a very fun and easy going place to work.  There is also a huge reward in educate pet parents and to help them solve problems.  Of course, it is also amazing to get to pet and meet new dogs everyday."
good,"I love working at PetSmart. My management is amazing, but you aren’t always so lucky. I’ve been with the company for almost 3 years and I can truly say that my store is like a family. Great hours, great discount, decent benefits, and many advancement opportunities."
good,My experience working at 3 different PetSmarts has always been good. The people are fun the business is fun and the animals are a blast! My only complaint is the lack of hours given.
good,"Inspiring managers, exciting work, and so many pets to be around! "
good,solving the needs of the customers on a daily basis. ensuring that all customers find what they need and have any problems solved. making sure the store is stoppable and organized.
good,"It requires a person who is focused, cares about what they're doing, and is okay with getting a little dirty sometimes. I personally worked in the hotel, and the management was fun, understand, caring, kind and obviously passionate about what they were doing. The customers are grateful for the help you give, and you get the sense of feeling good for truly doing something beneficial. Wonderful place to work!"
good,Have the opportunity to assist customers with selections for their furry family members. Management is great and willing to work around other schedules.
good,"Job itself was amazing, management was amazing and cash registers were the easiest ones I've ever used. Easy to learn. Enjoyed working there very much..."
good,"I was a pet care specialist so a typical day is coming in and spot cleaning cages, administering medications to animals in the sick room if needed, giving all animals fresh food and water, spot cleaning and depending on the day- a complete cleaning which means replacing liter in all cages on said day (i.e Mondays were bird change outs so i gave everyone new food, water, litter and cleaned all decorations/toys they had in their cage). I learned a lot about animals working there and it was the best thing for me because it encouraged me to have pets of my own. Management was terrific. I loved everyone I worked with. The workplace itself was good. Store traffic was always low-medium, even during the holidays. The hardest part of my job was getting too attached to animals. I hated selling my favorite animals i bonded with. The most enjoyable part was taking care and being with the animals. They always made me feel happy."
good,I’m currently still working at Petsmart! I love my job and the staff I work with. It’s very fun but can also be challenging. It’s a great environment to work in and has lots of  opportunities to grow.
good,"I started as a pet care employee at PetSmart. I learned to take care of the birds, fish, reptiles, and small animals, as well as the customers. I then learned to train dogs. It is a great company with great values, I just had a bad experience at my store with a manager that is no longer with the company."
good,"I was a stylist apprentice in the grooming salon, and a pet care associate. My co workers weren't just co workers, but my family as well. Every day I would learn something new. This was one of the most rewarding jobs yet, it could get stressful at times but as long as you pulled through to the end you could walk away with a smile knowing you accomplished it. the managers are amazing, they will always listen to you and work with you. good job PetSmart!!!!"
good,"I really enjoyed working there.  However, the store leader was really unorganized, and he tried to pawn his job off on everyone else.  He also got mad very easily, and never really wanted to help when needed. But, all other managers were excellent.  They were level-headed, hardworking, and easy-going, and they made sure everything ran smoothly."
good,"I loved that i got to meet soooo many pets! I had customers that were regulars and seeing their pup or kitty made my day. Even had a customer that would bring his Dragon in around his neck. If you're in love with animals, cat and dogs especially, this is the place to be!"
good,It was a great experience working with all the dogs and cats! Loved to go into work and see everybody and it was just a fun environment. Who can be mad at when helping animals.
good,"Great place to work, friendly coworkers, approachable management, good pay, and straight forward job requirements."
good,I really enjoyed working at PetSmart. I love animals and I enjoyed helping people with training their pets. And enjoyed the overall customer service interaction.
good,PetSmart is a productive place to work. PetSmart enables you to see various types of animals come in to the store. Animals and customer service are a great deal at PetSmart.
good,The company...at least when I was there...was a fun place to worm.  Management stood behind their employees and were very helpful.  They gave you plenty of training for  your position and the pay was great.
good,"The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting, 50 lb. bags of dog food, 50 lb. salt blocks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet all kinds of animals.  The tarantula was not so much fun, but at least he was in a sealed container.  The wolf I met is probably the most beautiful animal I've ever seen.  I also got to ""work"" with the dog from Frasier, who was a real joy."
good,"Working at Petsmart is a great job, and you become very good at multitasking and helping more than one person at one time. Petsmart is a friendly place that welcomes all types of customers."
good,"Loved working for petsmart, got alot of experience handling dogs and learning how to hygienically care for them as a bather. However I believe the pay was bad from all the responsibilities required for the job."
good,"PetSmart is a great company to work with. Working directly with customers and their pets is a great experience. Here, my skills have greatly improved overall. As an Associate Lead manager, I was solely responsble for our associates relations and customer service as well. The company will take the time and hear your voice if you want to be heard. PetSmart invests in their associates so that they can be as happy as they can be. Great company!"
good,Loved everything about it. It was the perfect job for a college student. They worked with my school schedule and were always understanding of holidays.
good,On a regular workday the moral of the building was always at its highest which lead to great productivity from the associates. The most enjoyable part of the job was the initiative everyone took to ensure that the culture of the building was being practiced.
good,Friendly everybody work at a team everybody was job was done before we all at home all team workers or nice we all Welcome to our customers in and if any customers needed help we all help them with their questions and what their needs for their pet friendly animals
good,i know that pet smart is the greatest place to work in and also working there is fun and the salary is high and it close to my house and i love pets and
good,"The job is easy enough, the pay is good considering most of the day is spent stocking or fixing the inventory. There are lot of animals to play with, which kind of relieves the stress of deadlines or customers. The job does get quite monotonous as a downside."
good,If you love animals and love interacting with other people who love animals this is the perfect job. It is a very fun place to work at and give people and their pets a wonderful experience.
good,"I loved the team work and positive attitude. Everyone was professional, everyone cared about the customers and would do everything they could to help."
good,I loved working for PetSmart in the PetsHotel. It was like one big family. Your hard work was always noticed and rewarded in some way. The people are super friendly. I definitely felt it was an awarding job with opportunities to move up with the company.
good,"The managers really care about their employees. As long as you show up when scheduled and help out, they will help back in any way they can. Everything is dealt with in a professional manner and the company overall is a great company to work for. Always room for advancement and if you start in one area and think you might like another, it is easy to be trained elsewhere."
good,As a cashier it is pretty laid back. It does get busy form time to time  but still pretty simple and you have other workers there to back you up if need be. They gave me pretty good pay for a part time seasonal cashier.
good,Just a simple job of stocking by bringing the truck from the back ware-room and working the pallets to the shelf while listening to music on the overhead.
good,"I enjoyed working as a store manager. It was challenging every day and my team was great.  You get out what you put in.  During my time there I had a few different bosses and we adapted just fine. As a whole, it's a great place to work if you like working in teams and love pets."
good,"Great environment and all staff members are kind and lend a helping hand when ever needed."
good,"I loved working here "
good,"Loved job,loved the people, love animals & the managers were willing to work/help you.Very appreciative of them hiring & never giving up on me. Thank you for helping me boost my customer service skills."
good,It was a very good job because of the management and people who worked there. They started making it harder to make rate which is where I started to look for another job.
good,"A fast pace environment with a very good team work, so that makes it a little less stressful. A good lead team where you get the help you ask for if available without any issues. A nice and friendly environment with a positive attitude. ""Pet-smart where pets inspire us""..."
good,"Managers really work together with the rest of the employees to get things done. Very hardworking people, and animal care is FIRST priority. All departments work together to get through the day. Fun, safe environment."
good,"Great company, they worked around your schedule and gave advancement opprotunities. great place to work. management seemed to actually care. all employees cared about customer service"
good,"If you love being in an ever changing enviornment while getting to see new animals everyday, this is the job for you. Petsmart is a fun, goal-oriented place to work."
good,A typical day at Pet Smart begins with manager meetings reviewing company goals and sharing employee expectations for the day.  As a pet stylist you do thorough check ins of the dogs and groom them in a top of the line salon environment.  Pet Smart is strict on their safety procedures so if you are conscientious you will do great!  If you are full time benefits are provided as well as vacation.
good,This company trained me very well. I became very knowledgeable in pet care products and customer  service. It was a fun environment to work in; everyday is different.
good,"Petsmart was a very fun place to work, the people and customer were wonderful and the atmosphere was great. A lot of learning opportunities and decent pay ."
good,"PetSmart is a great company to work for. They work hard to provide a warm, caring environment for employees. Salaries are fair for most positions. Leadership is well trained."
good,"PetSmart was a fantastic company to work for. I loved working with dogs and cats on a daily basis. Stress levels at times were harrowing for me, but would definitely re-apply if necessary."
good,"I started out as a groomer, and it was going okay. I've had some bad experiences with dogs growing up so it was a little tough though trying to get passed that fear, but i couldn't. so i went and cashiered and did stocking, but it did get a little boring at times."
good,"Fast paced, great customers, great to see the pets. Fun place to start out in retail. very educational place to work. Growth and advancement is constant."
good,Work life balance and pay were both optimal at Petsmart.  The responsibilities were fair and I rarely felt stressed to get my work done.  The culture was strong.  I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,I love working with animals and they give you the opportunity to work with them and get paid for it! It's a dream come true. Everyone there are super nice too.
good,Great place to work part time and excellent full time benefits. The hours can be long sometimes and tiring but its a rewarding position that I highly recommend.
good,"While employed at Petsmart, I was able to develop my customer service skills along with getting to know the community and their pets on a larger scale. Daily tasks would include:"
good,When i moved to Greenville from New Bern they gave me a small raise... i still was not making as much as people getting hired AFTER me even though i had worked at the Petsmart in New Bern for several months already. You can never predict whats going to happen when you get a job. I was not making enough so i got another job leading to them cutting my hours to barely 10 a week. I miss it though. It was a good job.
good,"PetSmart was my first job it was the most fun job I have ever had, a typical day was BUSY but it was great and I very much enjoyed it."
good,"I work overnight so although I wil like more hours, it’s difficult BUT other than that I enjoy it. It can be stressful at times but thats like any job"
good,"Pretty great place to work, fun and friendly environment, lots of animal interaction. If you are an animal lover than it is just the best. Mornings can be rough. Opening duties are more taxing than closing duties, like deep cleaning habitats on set mornings for each type of habitat."
good,"It was a great place to work.  I enjoyed the work, but I was not give many hours since there were multiple people that needed hours.  Otherwise, a great place to work.."
good,I wouldn't give up this job for anything! I'm looking to add more job experience in the animal field! I do recommend applying! All animal lovers would benefit from this! I adore going into work everyday to see all my regular animals and other animals who come in!
good,Its a great company to work if you love pets. They think pets made us great people. Great benefits and great comission in grooming. Love worked in Petsmart.
good,"great company, i was able to transfer to state to state with this job, as long as you didn't have write ups or anything. if you get a good salon manager then working in the salon is great."
good,This was a high school part time job. Paid what a high schooler should be paid for a part time job. Coworkers and managers were great. Drama free work place.
good,"I Highly recommend you shoot for a job at petsmart. Fun people, fun job. Its never a boring day playing with dogs. The managers where I worked were very cool and fair people."
good,It's a good place to work but i needed something a little more.  convenient to my schedule . And always willing to help you if you had an difficult task.
good,Must love animals. You will learn a great deal working for company about all things animal related. They are committed to their charities and it real 100% of donations go to animals not to paying CEOs a 7 figure salary.
good,"Depending on your managers, this can be a great place to work or a bad one. Overall the company takes care of its employees and cares about the animals in their care."
good,"I worked with a lot of great people, It was fun to see all the animals, handle the reptiles, feed and take care of the pets. help educate pet parents on products for their fur babies."
good,The job was good I was able. To move up in the company into another department. Job had good benefit for me and my kids. They gave us a good opportunity.
good,petsmart is a fantastic company when I left to peruse a career they were happy for me and made it clear to come back if ever needed. then when I decided I missed grooming and wanted to it part time they took me back with no issues
good,Great company to start working for.  Great opportunity for advancement.  Organized training and leadership.    Safe and family oriented working conditions.  Management is cohesive.  Competitive wages.
good,"This is hands down the greatest company I have ever worked for. I wouldn't have left the company if it wasn't for the military relocating us over seas. Since I am back in the US am hoping to work for the company again. I loved the atmosphere, working with pet parents and their pets. Or helping a customer find their perfect pet."
good,Great place to work if you like a quick pace and challenge. Never settle. Always be looking to advance your knowledge and you will go far here. Great compensation. The fact that management above the Store Level is constantly being turned over made me kind of weary to advance in the company.
good,"It was retail, so if you know what you are getting into, you will enjoy your time there. Retail needs detail-oriented people and people who enjoy talking to and guiding customers. It was a fine place to work."
good,"I was a lot younger in those days, but it was a friendly and fun environment. I was able to learn and grow in a really cool environment. It's perfect for first time jobs for teens who enjoy and have a genuine care for pets."
good,"As a sales associate work with the customers and their pets to make there visit a positive one and  try to answer any questions or worries with new pets   I loved the environment and management staff I still am in contact with most of them  Some of the customers still call me"
good,"So far I've enjoyed working for PetSmart, its a fun and easy job where you get to interact with animals, so its great for animal lovers. Its your typical retail job, no curve balls, so if you've worked in retail before than theres nothing new here. Management is nice and everyone who works there is pretty friendly. Flexible hours"
good,"I worked for PetSmart for a little over two years, and I loved every minute of it. I made some great friends with my Co-Workers and with the management. If I could I would definitely go back."

good,"Petsmart was a good place to work, helped a lot of people with their pets need, helped a lot of animals find good homes, co-workers were helpful and kind, and the opportunity to expand knowledge about animals were everywhere."
good,"Greet clients and communicate their pet's grooming needs as well as sending appointment reminders. I learned how to clip and hand scissor different breeds with specific haircuts. The hardest part of my job was the clients who were looking through the glass at their pet, making the pet wiggle and difficult to safely groom. My favorite part was bathing and grooming the dogs."
good,"You MUST love dogs in order to work at the PetsHotel.  We treat them like family, not just someone's pet.  I was lucky to find such a wonderful team to work with.  Everyone is extremely nice and helpful."
good,I have worked for this company for 2 years and so far it is the best place I've worked at since moving to Tucson. The management is amazing and will work with you regarding schedules especially for students. The hardest part of this job and for any customer service job are the rude customers but getting to see all types of pets is what makes it all worthwhile.
good,"Petsmart was a great environment to work in. Other employees were more than willing to help with anything needed. Positive, upbeat people. I would recommend it to anyone looking to work with people/animals."
good,"I was so sad to leave petsmart grooming salon but I only needed more hours that they couldn't provide for me. "
good,"This is an amazing retail job! I haven't had a day where I haven't wanted to go to work. Days go by super fast, and you're always doing something. It's fun to see all the animals people bring in. As a Petcare associate you will have to stock, work with the animals (get birds, hamsters, reptiles etc. out for customers), and last but not least do the register, but guess what?! Everyone has to work the register at one point or another, because the store gets busy FAST. The staff is friendly to one another so no drama."
good,"Quiet environment for the most part. I learned social skills and customer service in the process. To me, the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing one of the cats i was taking care of be adopted."
good,There is a special kind of comradery at Petsmart. You really feel like you are part of a team and have a very good support group to help you learn everything you need to know.
good,"I worked for several months for PetSmart, Lake Elsinore as an Early Morning Stocker. The job was great, and I loved the work and the hours, what I didn't love was that I was expected to do the work of 2 or more people as one man and only had the Stocking manager as my only other help most mornings. The store would get very large shipments almost every morning, and most of the time we could not finish them in time... and on top of stocking sometimes we were expected to essentially reprice an entire store with only 2-4 people."
good,A great place to work if you get to work in the reptile and small animal department. You learn a lot and get to handle a lot of different species. You can also advance in the company.
good,Working at PetSmart I've learned so much that I never knew about dogs such as the proper way to groom and bathe dogs. Working with dogs is away such a great experience.
good,"Great place to work with great employees and managment.Very fun and family oriented place of employment with great discounts hoiday pay,vacation pay and sick pay"
good,"i feel good with my work and the other associate "
good,It was really fun to work there. I loved going to work knowing I would be playing with animals all day. All of the other employees were really nice and helpful with any questions I had.
good,"PetSmart is a great company to work for! They take care of their employees and customers. I am very satisfied with the progress I have made in 6 months starting as a cashier and moving up to different departments and opportunities. They take recognition of employees when recognition is needed and take swift and professional action when an issue rises. I love this company and my team! The hardest part of the job is just like any other retail job, sometimes the customers can be hard to handle but management is always there to help you get out of a situation with customers. The management takes care of their team! The most enjoyable part of the job is the experience and friends that are gained along the way!"
good,It was such a nice environment. The people there were so nice and friendly. Management was very nice and worked with your schedule. They gave you proper amount of hours you wanted to work.
good,"Great place to work if you like animals! My coworkers were amazing and easy to get along with, the hiring manager was kind of rude though :( but thats not to reflect the company, just his personality I guess. Id totally work here again!"
good,"Being an avid animal lover & aspiring Vet I loved working here. "
good,"As a bather you get to spend all of your time with dogs and great people who also love dogs. It was wet, messy, and tiring but the most rewarding and satisfying job I have ever had."
good,Great place if you're just starting out in the workforce and if you're a hard worker plenty of opportunity to advance. You will have fun and plenty of chances to move into leadership roles
good,"good part time job pretty easy to learn everything"
good,"Working at PetSmart is a fun, learning environment. I am usually a cashier, pet care associate, or assisting front-desk in the grooming salon. I've learned how to care for fish, small animals, reptiles, and birds with care. I also learned how to notice certain symptoms or behaviors that require isolation or medical attention. The management is great as well as my coworkers! I love the animals that come through the doors and leaving every customer with a smile on their face."
good,"Greet Customers help assist on the sales floor when needed.  Worked in grooming bathing dogs.. fun job"
good,Excellent training program and benefits.  Had a great time.  I was able to further my career and move up as the process was defined.
good,"PetSmart can really be a fun place to work. I love animals and got to take care of all the pets in the store. I loved seeing peoples pets that they brought in, its defiantly a good conversation starter and a way to connect with people. The culture is professional at PetSmart. The pay is pretty average for the retail market."
good,I loved working at petsmart. The management was organized and the co-workers were very helpful. I loved being around animals and interacting with other.
good,"Love Petsmart. coworkers really look out for one another, just like a family. Hardest part of the job was speaking with already irate customers. I learned how to groom a dog and handle all kinds of situations concerning customers with ease."
good,If you love working with dogs all day this is defiantly the job to start your life with. You are playing and monitoring the dogs in your group for 2.5 hours at a time. Once your day camp is done it's time to clean the kennels of the dogs that have left.
good,i loved working there great people i loved my co workers so caring it was a good job i enjoyed making dogs look there best good hours good benefits
good,"A typical day at work: easy to do, fun to do, able to get experience in all aspects of the store"
good,i would start by greeting costumers and showing interest in there needs and if i could help. Then i would cash costumers out. I learned alot of useful information about animals and there eating habits and chooses of foods.My management was okay at the time we were in limbo with managers so as employees we mostly managed ourselves and carried the store. My coworkers were very awesome people theyt cared about our customers and their pets as much as I did and showed it as well by going above and beyond on a daily basis. There really wasn't a hard part of the job i enjoyed it at all times and my coworkers and i were always in tune.
good,good way for people to get to know small animals and cleaning procedures. also learned how to help customers and learned a lot here.
good,I love working with the dogs and cats in the hotel! IT so fun to see the pets happy and well!  A plus is that all my coworkers seem to really love their job!
good,I honestly loved working in the grooming salon. Every day was a new experience and the dogs made it a lot of fun going to work. Just be sure to separate your work like from your personal life in close work spaces like these :)
good,"PetsMart is a great company to work for. Everyday was a fun and new expirence especially if your passion is working with animals. I learned many things about pet care and safety. Managment there is great, they are all very fair and humble people. My former co-workers were fun to work with and dedicated to their jobs and the safety of themselves and animals there. The hardest part of the job was trimming cat/dog nails. The best part of the job was working with the dogs."
good,This was a great company to work for. The commission rate for groomers is fair. The only complaint I would have is they want quantity over quality but if you can keep up and provide quality work it is a wonderful job.
good,"People are nice, Management is super. Working with dogs is the best that can happen to anyone. Very friendly atmosphere. Love to work here"
good,"Being a cashier and a morning stocker was a good start. The best I loved about this job was, working with pets, pet parents, and learning along the way that I was a good salesman. My teaching of my pet training classes was extremely fun, but I really enjoyed working with my fellow associates. I learned and was able to help teach other employees to not be afraid to sell or suggestively sell."
good,I would love to work with this company again. They take care of their associates and have a great ladder built in to become a manager of a department.
good,"In my time with the PetSmart company I gain an immense amount of knowledge. I not only learned about basic animal needs and requirements I also gained much much more.  I learned all about the business world the objectives as well as volunteer and charity work. I learned how to interact with people; it helped me to understand, to be more companionate, and understanding of everyone's individual needs and issues.  I gained much leadership knowledge, taking in input good or bad from people and making the necessary adjustments to maintain proper function. With my experience working for PetSmart I have truly learned so very much. Thank you."
good,"I loved working here and with the animals. Everyday I would come in and see wagging tails and smiling faces. I got to enrich the pet owners relationship with their dog through pet training.Usually co workers were great, everyone is a team. The hardest part of the job was juggling cashiering and making goals for pet training sales. Management was great until the end of my 5 years working for Petsmart. The hiring manager and general manager at the time of my employment were some of the best managers I have had the joy of working with."
good,I was a picker. this job was very fun. we worked 10 hours a day and was given every tool needed to succeed. fellow employees were very helpful and encouraging.
good,"Petsmart offers many opportunities for advancement within the company and hires very diverse associates. A typical day of work consists of caring for pets, keeping the store neat, assisting pet parents with product knowledge. I learned how to multitask and have exceptional customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was not being able to spend more time with the pets."
good,"Unique. Exciting. Inspiring. Petsmart are packed with compassionate animal lovers."
good,"Great people and great enviroment, Grooming academy was awesome and very well informed with great grooming training where you know you are prepared for the Grooming Technical along with great salon managers to let you fly !"

good,"I absolutely loved every part of this job, exept the hours. To start the day I fed the animals, stocked product, and helped customers, and that lasted most of my shift. The managers were kind, respectfull, and very helpful."
good,"A normal day at work would start off with streatchin and team meetings. I learned a lot from working at petsmart like different diversities and ways to communicate with people. The management team was pretty cool. They always had different activities for us to participate in like talent shows, pot lucks, prize drawings and family and friends day. They even came up with a kick ball team to keep departments competitive. My co-workers turned out to be pretty nice and fun people, majority of my co-workers turned out to be friends from high school and people i grew up with some even knew my parents. The most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say would be to competitors within my department, we would come in and go full force to see who could get the highest production numbers in order filling."
good,"I loved working here.  If you love dogs and I mean LOVE dogs, then this is the place for you!  You get to interact with people and dogs on a daily basis.  You get to provide great customer service while also loving on some of the best animals in the world.  You will also get to interact with cats.  You can get to go in and create bonds with some of the best cats ever."
good,"I have tons of fun a work.I love going to work. Its going to be sad when i leave, but life must go on! Working at Pet Smart as taught me about caring for other living things and how much people really care for their pet- no children."
good,A very good place to work that is understanding with the needs of their employees. Greatest part about the job is that we were able to work hand in hand with the animals.
good,"A typical day I run the register, help customers and assist in other departments as needed. I've learned valuable customer service skills. The management team is very fun and always there for you when you need them. My co-workers are a great team we work to help each other out to make our work experience better. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping pet parents with their pets and making it an enjoyable experience for the family."
good,"get in check you scheduled appointments, prepare your station, i learned how to groom dogs the proper way, bathe and dry each specific breed, how to trim there nails without  quicking them, they where very understanding, and down to earth, always looking to better themselves and the company, all the workers where nice and always willing to help out when in need, and always kept the work place alive, grooming a wild dog, is getting to know your customer needs and being around all different kinds of dogs"
good,"Once the new Creative VP was hired it started to be less fun."
good,"Most of the day is spent monitoring the dogs and cleaning up any mess that they make. "
good,"Very upbeat place of work, and let's face it, not many places you cant work where you are surrounded by animals all day! Petsmart is also involved with many animal charities and pet adoption agencies."
good,"The Petcare team at Petsmart was a family to me. I dedicated my mornings to go in and help the animals, feed, bathe, provide medicine and clean all the animals before anyone else go there. I enjoyed my independence in the mornings and learning about animals in great detail."
good,"Every day is different. Everyone there enjoys working with customers on a daily basis. There is ample opportunities to grow with in the company. Sometimes the days get busy but that can make them fun and it is the best of learning experiences. All the managers at PetSmart are fun, reliable, enthusiastic about the days work and ready to make any customer happy."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at this Petsmart location. a typical workday consisted of working throughout a shift with specified duties that you are required to get done but its completely on your own time. You work fairly solo unless you have one other associate, in which case you would work together to divide up the work and work together to get everything done as well as taking care of customers the entire time."
good,I like how it was fun and outgoing and meeting new people and having an awesome day at work and I like working with my coworkers very  helpful and outgoing
good,"I advanced quickly at my job here. Of course any job working with animals  and people is a win win to me. I found it to be rewarding helping people with their pets needs and help them understand their pets more,"
good,"Not a bad place to work if your willing to work."
good,I really enjoyed working with all the pets and pet parents. The best part of the job was being able to assist customers with their pet questions since they are so passionate about their animals it was nice to see how appreciative they were about the advice I gave them. The other best part of the job is building strong relationships with my pet parents.
good,Great company to work for. great benefits and healthcare. Great atmosphere. Great customers. Great services and live animal care.
good,"A typical day when im working i will focus on work and what needs to be done and accomplished. Managing things can be hard so sittting down and planning that wil be nessacary while working. Helping others as a co-worker is very importantto me, things are much better as a team. I always look on the good side of my job or duty and what i can learn from it."
good,"Depending on whether I was opening, working a mid shift, or closing, my immediate responsibility was to review (either in person or in a written note) what had been accomplished by the former supervisor. "
good,"I worked on two different shifts, 2nd mon thru thur, and 3rd, fri thru Sat. This allowed work and life to balance out great. A typical day would include our pre-work such as projections, interactions due, start up notes for meetings and reviewing anything critical for the day. I would spend rest of day managing over 40 associates such as productivity, observations, safety tasks, engagements and any coachings that were due. The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture with both management and associates. They made it fun to come to work and accomplish our daily goals."
good,"I take care of animals for this job- I clean cages, administer medications, interact with the animals, help customers, help with displays. I LOVE animals so this job is wonderful for me- I am learning a lot and it's a great work environment. The management staff are good, my co-workers are also good. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the interaction with animals, the worst part of this job would be the lack of full-time hours available."
good,My job is awesome! Every day I get to meet wonderful people with amazing dogs. I play with puppies and help save animal lives in a fun productive environment. My immediate coworkers are awesome!
good,"A typical day at PetSmart included constant interpersonal communication with coworkers, customers, and their respective pets.  Each day included constant organization and presentation of the store, handling money, and engaging professionally with customers. Both the management and other staff not only made the customers feel like family, but treated each other as a family as well. The hardest part of working in retail is always properly handling difficult situations with unsatisfied customers; however, the difficult situations were greatly overshadowed by encountering animals every day and having coworkers who look out for each other and sincerely care about each other's success."
good,I learned that I wet nose and a waggy tail is the key to my happiness!
good,"You get to see animals on a daily basis which is always fun, and everyone in the store is always happy and friendly.  Hardest part of the job would be adjusting to the varying hours."
good,PetSmart was the best job I ever had. I wish I hadn't left. Every one was really nice and the animals were the best.
good,"Pet Smart was a great work experience.  I answered phones on an everyday basis and learned something new everyday from customers and fellow workers.  My computer experience excelled, as did my customer service skills.  Management helped increase your knowledge about the products we were selling.  Coworkers were wonderful and I often had interaction with them on the ""Horse Hotline"" in which they called with questions on products.  The hardest part of my job was during the holidays when customer did not receive their orders on time.  The most enjoyable part was being able to help a customer when they had a difficult situation, such as needing a product quickly due to a medical problem."
good,I loved this job and just wish I could have stayed on. I was a cashier but a seasonal hire. The job was full of enjoyment and different things happened every day
good,"Work usually starts at with a 7.5 hour shift. I check the schedule book to see how many dogs are coming in today and then check the computer to see if any have come in already for me to start on. Once I find my dog to start on, I bath them, cut their nails, brush them, clean their ears, ect. Then I make a pawgress report and call their parents and send them home. "
good,Very good people to work with and work for. I had very good advancement in my job but I my self made a mistake and was offten late to work at 4am. Was a very good job and company to work for
good,"There is a real 'teamwork' vibe to the place. Though we are trained to push certain sales we still truly care about the pets and their owners. I appreciate management and the co workers. So far I have worked at two different stores in two different states and I get the same overall vibe. It is a great place to work, at least that has been my experience there!"
good,"A very fun enviornment to work at, fast paced, people are fun and hard working, the pay is good including tips from customers, if you like pets then this is a perfect job to have."
good,"I manage the cash register and help customers with questions they have whether its about merchandise or animals. I also clean the cat cages, help families fill out the adoption forms and fax them and I also bag crickets. I do light stocking and facing. I also do light cleaning."
good,"A typical day at this job was great and loving. I learned so much at this job far as my computer skills and teaching seniors how to operate the computers. The management at this job was on point no flaws. The hardest part of this job was nothing at all. The most enjoyable part of this job was everything, the patrons, the employees, plus, the branch."
good,"A typical day at work start with cleaning and feeding pets. I learned how to care of exotic pets and keeping clean the workplace. The management was good, really nice people."
good,"Petsmart was a really fun job, meeting customers and helping them and their furry friend."
good,Petsmart has been my home for the past 3 years and the company has grown a lot since i have started working there. The people in the salon are the best and the managers are to die for! i have never worked in a more a fun and happy environment. The only reason for me wanting to leave is that I feel I need to advance my skills else where. I need a more challenging environment.
good,"In my time with PetSmart, (I am currently working for the company as I write this review) I have grown immensely as a person both professionally and personally. The management at my store (Store #2038) has always made me feel like a welcome member of the team since day one and that positive attitude has never faltered. I am and always will be amazingly grateful for the opportunities that I've been given while working for this company as well as the relationships I've been able to build with my fellow co-workers. Everyone I work with has become a family away from home. Every early morning I can be rest assured to see a smile on the tired, groggy face of my manager as he/she greets me with a friendly hello. Everyone who works for PetSmart has reason to be happy about their job for both the positive reward in helping animals and animal lovers as well as the comfort gained in solid workplace comaraderie. I've never experienced a stronger professional environment, nor have I ever witnessed such team focus. No one can honestly regret coming to work because we all understand the love and care we are responsible for building in the community."
good,Fun place to work. Great opportunity for advancement if you're willing to transfer stores. I've learned a lot of management skills and am very thankful for the opportunities that I was able to earn through my hard work. 
good,"I love working here, I have learned so much more about animals than i knew before. The work isnt very stressful on the body, and i love meeting customers with their pets!"
good,I loved getting to play with the animals all day that stayed at the hotel. Taking care of both their needs as well as their owners was not only educational but it never seemed like work. I looked forward to going there every day. The only reason I left was the store side received a new manager and she did not have a clue how the hotel ran. 
good,"As a stock lead, it is my responsibility to keep the recieving area clean and organized. Unload the trucks and put the new products onto the sales floor. Any overstock product are then separated onto their correct pallets. An average weight of the products we carry are around 30 to 40 pounds. Anything heavier is done with a team lift. Safety always comes first. I would lead the stock team when the manager is not available. Most days I would work alone in recieving, working on sorting products. Visual checks are required of me or management, whoever drives the forklift first. Simple maintanence of the forklift is also required. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with an incredible team who taught me a lot about retail. Management and co-workers are very helpful and  friendly. The hardest part would be getting used to a new department, but that always happens to new associates or associates who moved into a new department. I am very detail oriented and self-motivated. "
good,"There are technical things to get done as with any job, but throughout the day it is suggested for us to greet and meet pets as they come in to our store.  It is a good way to break up a day, puts it in a perspective that is fun."
good,Wonderful company to work for! Positive and uplifiting management team! They build you up if you make a mistake instead of knocking you down! I would definately recommend this job to anyone!
good,Everyone is so nice and as long as you are willing to learn they will help you move up
good,"Greeted customers. Recorded customer purchases on a point-of-sale computer cash register. Accepted payment by cash, check or charge card ensuring verification of proper identification according to established procedures. Placed merchandise and receipt in bag for customer. Answered telephones. Trained and scheduled new employees."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of putting away trucks ,stocking shelves ,completing inventory and audits, completing the out of stock program and logging all receiving orders. I learned a lot about organizing and maintaining a safe but fun work environment. The managers there are all very hands on which is something I think should be the case in all retail sadly it is not. Most of the co workers were great some it was just a matter of age and maturity. The hardest part of the job would be the overnight shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job was absolutely the pet parents i.e the customers and the satisfaction of helping them provide the best products and service for their pets."
good,Groom guest loved ones. I learned much from this company and working with our guest that no matter what you can make a persons day just by treating them and their loved ones with kindness and respect. See from their point of view and try to work with them on fixing the problem and to make sure it is not re-accuring. The hardest part of the job was getting dogs who could slip out of anything while getting bathed.
good,Unloading the truck and working the pallets to the floor. I learned how to operate a forklift as well as a scissor lift. Management is very helpful and friendly. Work together very well with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was learning where all of the products are located to be able to assist the customers needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my co-workers as well as management and the learning experience I gained.
good,"Great Enviroment, Great People, and lots of opportunity for people to grow. The only disadvantage is being a small retailer the pay is a little low to start."
good,"To be honest, I couldn't ask for a better job. I did what I loved to do, and I worked with people I loved to see. I would have stayed with this company but they were cutting my hours and I couldn't have that happen. I gave my heart and soul into the company and I will never forget the enjoyment that I had with them. Thank you PetSmart."
good,"The good is that you get the benefits like dog food discounts "
good,Awesome place for a part-time or seasonal job. Pay is fair. The work is very rewarding. I really enjoyed getting to work with the animals. Cleaning habitats.
good,I absolutely love creating bonds with pet parents and their pets. Getting to know the dog and their personality is priceless. Dogs are like people's children so I always treat them like one of mine.
good,I would come in and we would do our morning stretches and then we would go on and get our a710s and head to our first locations where we pick our product.
good,"Depending on were you worked you spent more time around customers which wasn't too bad. Coworkers were amazing people, I loved the time I spent there. Management was pretty awesome too. Workdays could be overwhelming but if you worked hard it made it easier."
good,PetSmart has a great enviornment and the 3/4 day schedules allow for life/work balance. Advancement opportunities and a culture of diversity and inclusion make this a great place to work!!
good,"Very great place to learn more about animals and how to take care of them , the managers are amazing and the customer service is amazing the environment all together is amazing and the people working show so mu"
good,"Greet customers, check in dog , sell grooming packages , make appointments, answer telephone, bath dog , dry dog with force dryer , groom dog , clean kennels , clean work station , clean your grooming tools , help out other employees (work as a team)."
good,"Could be very stressful, especially as management. Fast-paced according to business traffic. The hardest part was holding associates accountable for their actions."
good,"Working at petsmart is amazing, with the right team you learn so much knowledge about the food they sell, brands they offer and about the pets!"
good,Working for petsmart is great. Everyone i worked for and with there was so nice and understanding. I would definitively reccomend working at petsmart to anyone who loves working with animals.
good,The past 7 years I have worked for Petsmart has been fun and rewarding. I appreciate everything the company does to help their employees with any needs they may have.
good,"i handle dogs all day long, which is very physically exhausting, but satisfactory if you are the type of person that likes  dogs a lot. it can be a gross job but once again a fun environment"
good,PetSmart store 1032 is a great place to work. It is very flexible with your schedule and has the best management and co workers I have experienced thus far.
good,"Fun, fast-paced job where you receive thorough hands-on training and gain lots of experience working with animals."
good,"If you love pets and are just getting into the work force, this is the ideal place to work. You will get loads of experience in customer service and retail, and you will get to meet people's pets and make new friends!"
good,"A typical day in my position at PetSmart would be coming in at 5a every morning and immediately respond to emails, work and file paperwork, and stocking the shelves. I learned many things from handling cash, working with customers and their needs, to learning all management duties. Its a very fast paced environment. A lot to get done in a short amount of time, which I very much enjoy. so I would have to say that its the hardest but yet the most fun part of the job."
good,"I loved working here! If you're an animal lover, this place is for you. You get to work with animals all day, help customers, and learn a lot about animals and what it takes to keep them happy."
good,"a Typical work day was quick paced and at some times stressful. during my time at petsmart I learned how to groom and manage a grooming salon. the hardest part of the job as a manger was to consolidate paperwork. the most enjoyable part was speaking to clients, and building relationships with their pets."
good,"I loved working here and if given the chance i would love to go back. Great atmosphere, the employees are great and always know what they are talking about and always know the best way to help their customers."
good,"When I worked at the silverdale petsmart I had fantastic co workers, good pay, etc. the pace could be hard to keep up with at times, but overall I had a great experience working there."
good,"Working for petsmart was wonderful, i loved working with the animals and helping out the customers with their questions. My favorite aspect of working there was seeing peoples faces after i helped them with a certain type of animal, especially the fish."
good,really loved working with the people there and management there was amazing even while i was in a custody battle management not only is very helpful with the work side of things but they are also willing to hear your outside of work problem and offer a safe place to talk really did love working there
good,This is  a very fun place to work if you enjoy pets you learn alot about animals and fish and reptiles and learn about different foods they eat very friendly and great customer service
good,Definitely great team work. Very good management. A lot of physical work. You do work holidays but we have potluck so it's like being with your family.
good,"The details of the day vary by the shift time, but generally you can expect to keep the animals safe during group play, clean their rooms, feed them, and help check animals in/out of the Hotel. Management is incredibly helpful and everyone is welcoming; no question is too silly to ask, and asking for help/working as a team is encouraged. The hardest part of the job is making sure the dogs interact nicely with each other and yourself--safety is the number one goal for every living thing at the PetsHotel. There are a few enjoyable aspects of the job, among which are working with a great team, never feeling bored, and (of course) interacting with all the dogs and cats."
good,"Currently in the apprenticeship program with the grooming salon. It's a very fun, fast-paced job that does require you to be proactive and focused at all times. You are handling Pet Parent's fur babies and are absolutely required to handle them with care and safety. "
good,"Pet smart was a great place to work, lots to learn good Management. Great employees  excellent customer service. Always had the best products in stock  grooming salon provided excellent service for the pets. There was great training available to me when I started there is a great management team.

good,"Amabilidad, buen trato en general. Capacitación correcta."
good,"I worked at PetSmart for 3 years. I started off as a cashier then moved to pet care, which is taking care of the animals in store, and now I am the Pet Trainer  which is super fun! PetSmart is a super fun place to work. The managers at my store are awesome and the environment is really enjoyable. Definitely a place I would recommend!!"
good,"Overall Petsmart is an excellent company to start off for a first job, petsmart offers many different types of opportunities to grow and learn with them."
good,"Really cares for employees, customers, and any animals that come in the door. Wonderful company with wonderful people. Would highly recommend working for PetSmart to anyone looking for a beginner job."
good,"Working at PetSmart, it has it's ups and downs. Most of the time, the employees are wonderful, and the management is stressed. If you can work well under pressure, it is a wonderful place to work."
good,I love animals and loved working at Petsmart.  They took care of their employees and the animals.  Loved helping customers with their pet needs and acquiring a new family member
good,Great place to work! I had to relocate but this was my favorite employer. There is room for improvement much like any other place BUT this company treats their employees well and it feels good to be appreciated there!
good,Great place to work I would recommend anyone to apply here. The hours are great the people are friendly. They treat everyone like family. If you love pets than this is the place for you.
good,"Easy work. Customers and co workers are nice. Only mangers can get 40 hours per week. We have animal hospital, grooming salon, but no pet hotel. I like working here."
good,"the whole company is just so positive and obviously being around animals all the time is awesome.  i absolutely loved it there, only left because i was pregnant and couldn't stand for prolonged periods of time and decided to become a stay at home parent."
good,"If you are able to play by the rules (as you would anywhere), then you will love the culture.  It is an amazing company to be employed with.  Management is very compassionate and truly cares about employee well-being (at least at my location).  Employees view and treat Pet Parents as a family which drives them to return; therefore, allowing us to get to know each and every one of them more.  Each day consists of different goals and tasks so it never gets boring."
good,"A typical day at Petsmart includes caring for all animals, educating customers and working with different people everyday. Managment is very good and schedules great hours."
good,"love the people and the environment that is at petsmart. i needed to transfer for school and without a  doubt, my manager was understanding and it was smooth and got into the transfer store the week needed"
good,Petsmart is a great company to work for they take care of you benefits 401K vacation time  holiday pay I recommend if you like animals petsmart is for you
good,Loved working at PetSmart. Even with difficult management it was well worth it. Cross-trained through the hotel and store. Cross-trained for front and back of hotel. Learned a lot of new information.
good,"Like every retail job that I have had, it has its up and downs. The best part is working with the animals and the customers who own them.  People are just in a better mood overall when they are with their dog.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything accomplished in 40 hours since OT is rarely given out, but that is almost every retail company.  With that being said, it has been the company where I have experienced the best store manager and district manager I have ever worked for and they do great things with charity."
good,"I started in the specialty department. With the fish, birds, and reptiles. After a while, customers would ask for me by name and tell me what was going with their pets and I always knew what to recommend so they could be healthy again. I was then trained as a dog trainer and everyone loved my classes and would just come in and want to sign up. Even if I had not tried to sell them a class."
good,"I loved my job and if I hadn't needed more money to make ends meet, I would still be there. Everyone worked together, laughed together, and we knew our customers by name as well as their pets' names."
good,"The job itself wasn't bad at all, I more-so couldn't afford the distance to pay ratio. I had to manage my priorities, while I loved the job I just couldn't afford to work there."
good,"Great environment surrounded by wonderful people and animals. Always enjoyed coming into work, it was such a happy place. Sometimes during busy days, things could get chaotic, but with our hardworking team, and excellent management we always pulled through to get the job done."
good,What i most enjoy of working at Petsmart was being in charge of the animals. The first month as an associate I was named employee of the month and I was very proud of it.
good,"I am a cashier at Pet-Smart. I come in contact with all the customers at the store. Try to help answer any questions they may have regarding cat and dog food, the Pet Hotel, Grooming Salon, Banfield Hospital etc."
good,"I enjoyed working for petsmart, i was working in the grooming salon. Reason i left was because of the hrs. I was working with publix at the time, and with a child i picked full-time job over part-time. I would definitely recommend others to work for the company. The co-workers share something in common, the love for animals. So it makes you closer together and united as a family. I worked in a slow paced store/salon. Nothing was hard, the job duties were easy...Well maybe bathing a cat was hard, but everything else was a great eperience."
good,"You learn new things about you're everyday dog food to giving a new home for sheltered pets, teaching pet owners what you need to take good care of big and small pets alike."
good,"I enjoyed the staff that I worked with. But I started working there at a really bad time in my life, where I couldn't focus on work. So my time there was very brief and I did not give my best. The company is great to work for and I wish they would rehire me."
good,"Starting off with a morning meeting every day to see what we have with numbers and if we'll be getting hit with heavy loads that we need to go through quickly. I learned lots of stuff like how to drive a pallet rider, how to work their headset system and how to stack and down stack pallets very well. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work at my own pace not being too pressured to speed up or slow down and not having to worry about managers breathing down my neck. Hardest part of the job was when you figure out a pallet broke under the weight of the product or when something at the bottom of the pile had ripped or broken open which meant you'd have to down stack and put it all onto a new pallet and go get another product to replace the damaged one."
good,"Well run, well organized retailer truly focused on making moments matter for pets and pet parents .  The company was very focused on training and creating a good work environment. Treated staff well"
good,"Petsmart is a fun environment with caring, knowledgeable and compassionate staff.they provide a competitive environment for advancement. Management makes genuine connections with staff and customers."
good,could be very tedious at times but overall i enjoyed this job more than any other. everyone working there was extremely friendly and there was never any drama between coworkers.
good,"I learned how to bath dogs, clip nails, brush and detangle dogs coats. Keeping workspace clean at all times. Taking care of dogs in a professional manner and being safe."
good,"Great place to work, the environment is awesome, fun place and most important part not stressful, if you love pets, perfect place for you to work, they want you to be very social with the pet parents, so you can conversat with the customer without being rushed, awesome place!!!"
good,I loved working with the animals. Their pet parents were great. The workers had their moments in the workplace but its allbabput being professionally focused.
good,though the general manager at the time  of my employment was not please=ant to work for the company as a whole was fantastic. the hardest part of my job was dealing with people who had no right to own a living creature. the best part of my job was finding loving homes for all of the others.
good,"In a typical day of work I have three or more dogs to bathe and do other services on. I talk to the pet parents and make sure they know exactly what services I will be doing on their dogs. I have learned how to enhance my customer service skills, learn the basic skills for the job, and how to solve problems within any appointments if there are any. This job has been overall very enjoyable, it is hard to understand and learn at first but since I am a quick learner this job as become more and more rewarding and less stressful."
good,Started as a bather 4 years ago. 5 years later and I'm a groomer would not trade my work for anything. Some days it get really stressful a lot of go go go. You must be able to have tons of patience and be able to multitask. 30 minutes for a lunch is not nearly enough. Co-workers are great!
good,My days at pet smart was fun. while riding around on forklifts all day an race people on a time limits make the day go by faster . Its make it seen like you not even at work. the job wasn't hard at all .
good,Its a Great company to grow with and it has great benefits. Friendly environment and being around animal all day is awesome. I like that they promote within the company.
good,"Excellent place to work but not a career. Great and fun co workers and managers. Very respectful and cooperative management teams. Great with balancing school, work, and personal life."
good,"Fun place to start of your day. Filled with greetings from both people and animals. Always a happy and relaxing environment, learned a lot about the animals."
good,"I enjoyed working at this facility.  However the air conditioning wasn't the greatest and it was hot.  Grooming the dogs you got wet with the bath and then the animal hairs would stick to you.  Had to stand the entire shift but did get adequate breaks, two 15's and a 30.  The hardest part of the job was standing the entire shift.  The most enjoyable was making those sweet animals feel better."
good,Amazing place to work for cares about the employee and family of the employees has a good balance between work and family time. Great benefits and pay
good,Everyone in management is excellent and there for you at all times. The best part of the job is working with the pets and the customers.
good,"I truly loved working at PetSmart, especially with my #2188 (Caguas, PR) store members. Since day one the managers and other employees were helpful in every aspect, willing to explain in detail any work related question I had. In just a couple of months I learned so much, going from work system knowledge to answers to question of the pet parents."
good,Absolutely love working at PetSmart. Every day was a whole new experience and always learned something new. My store is filled with friendly staff that care about animals. The best part as a pet care specialist was interacting with animals and customers every day.
good,"Quit my other job after starting here. The staff is so friendly and everyone is really easygoing. They taught me how to stock, cashier, and gave me options to take up grooming or training. They really put what you want into consideration and have many opportunities to move up in the food chain."
good,"- Daily check ups on clients, cleaning kennels/play areas, prepare meals, wash laundry/dishes"
good,"well I came in clocked in set up for all petpernts to come in and check my dogs in and get started on grooming my dog,s  as well helping the bathers if needed nail trims short cut with a nail trim helping on the flower with customers"
good,"Throughout my ten years working for them I became a pet expert and learn how to take better care of my pets. Over the years I learned every position, for example, cashier, merchandising, pricing, schematics, and most importantly customer service. The team was always great, we had a good time and made work fun."
good,"Very Fun Job, I Love My Co-Workers they Always Got A Positive Attutide And Believe In Team Work. The Management  Is Very Reasonable,Fair And Understanding.."
good,Great management. Always excited to learn about the new products. Friendly and close staff. Excited to see familiar customers to assist.
good,"PetSmart is one of the best company I have worked for in terms of environment.  Everyone I have met thus far are helpful, friendly, and energetic.  Everyone is willing to help: whether you are an employee or customer."
good,A typical day at petsmart involves assisting pet parents and interacting with animals. Learned about products in the store and maintain products. My managers are well organized and my coworkers are hard workers.
good,"A very unique work environment, taking care of animals of a wide variety of species. Advancement opportunities are available for those whom seek and strive to achieve them."
good,"PetSmart is great, the workers are nice and the hours are flexible. I really do enjoy working here I get to be around animals which is what I love and want to do with my life. My career goal is to work at a Vet Hospital and working at PetSmarts grooming salon  is preparing me for my career."
good,"They care about their employees, their pets, and their customers.  I had plenty of chances to move up and around in different departments. Managers really seemed to care about their employees."
good,"I loved working there and it was always a positive environment. There were bad days but there were more good than bad. I loved the fact that I worked with dogs all day, it made me happier."
good,"Very diverse work environment. Good hours, great co-workers, great customers. Working with pets and pet lovers. Great opportunities for promotions."
good,Best place i have ever worked for. i loved being with the dogs all day too. I had a great set of co-workers and my management team was pretty awesome too.
good,"I held this job for about 2 months while I studying abroad in Canada. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did, and it was unfortunate that I had to leave as soon as I did due to personal reasons. I loved being able to share my pet knowledge with customers, and often times it made people very happy that I took a little extra time to explain to them the differences between certain products. I really enjoyed the staff, as they made it very easy to learn on the job. A typical day included:"
good,"I had a busy day as soon as I stepped through the door. I was always booked full, mostly with request clients who would only come to me to have their dog groomed. "
good,"Loved Greeting  customers entering establishments."
good,I loved working with animals and everyone on my team was great
good,"I loved working at PetSmart. I was usually on the register, i learned how to care for animals the proper way and was able to pass my knowledge on to others"
good,The Marine Corps was the best decision i have ever made. The benefits of being in the Marine Corps has given me the chance to advance myself in the work field.
good,"They taught me everything I know about pet care, general retail functions, and excellent customer service. My fellow co-workers felt more like a family. Our teamwork was a well lubed machine, smooth and efficient. Everyone shared our sense of family with the customers as well which helped us keep incredibly loyal customers. Everyone did their absolute best to make sure that every customer got what they were looking for or the closest available alternative."
good,"I loved how every day was going to be different in one way or another. Pet Parents would bring in their pets (dogs, cats, birds, small animals, reptiles, etc.) and ask for advice on how to care for them. I loved educating the pet parents on care and maintenance for their pets and helping them to find products that worked best as a solution as well as be within their budget. Management was always looking at ways to get all employees involved and looking for potential upward growth."
good,Great mangers and associates. Perfect place if you love animals. Not so perfect if you don't want to work. It's a constant on the move job which is perfect if you hate standing around all day at other boring jobs but you can't be afraid to clean up after animals....
good,"This job helped me grow as a person and a professional.  It taught me how to prioritize, communicate with employees and customers, how to gain and maintain a good work ethic and be professional.  The hardest part about the job was dealing with customer complaints.  It's very hard to turn around a very upset customer and not get upset yourself.  The good part about dealing with customer complaints is succeeding in making the customer happy regardless of whose to blame.  The best part of the job was seeing customers leave with a smile on their face knowing you were a part of putting that smile on their face.  I also had the opportunity to work with an amazing bunch of employees and managers along the way.  One of the store managers I had the privilege to work with was a big influence on helping me grow as a person and a professional.  He would always help me think outside of the box when I was narrow minded.  He helped me with my critical thinking skills that I now have today.  Everyone there, in one way or another, has helped shape me into who I am today!!"
good,"This was the best job for me because my managers were very understanding and as well I got along with all my co workers. I had a time when I left the job because of school but when I needed a job again, they had offer me my job back which I was really grateful."
good,"Within a day, cleaning, feeding, and care, are provided to the need of the animal. Managers make sure you're are provided with information on how to properly take care of each animal and provide information to keep giving on to clients; they also consider the work you provide with giving a raise. If finding trouble with anything, some co-workers will provide me with help that have been there longer then me. Between helping customers know more about there pets and helping animals have a healthy life, I enjoy my job because I am the cause of a healthy animal and a happy pet parent."
good,"Overall i think Petsmart was a wonderful place to work. They are very professional. The management always worked with everyone. The employees were very helpful. I loved working with the animals, and grooming school/training was sufficient."
good,"A typical day would be, checking in the dogs and/or cats for the day. Running Doggie Day Camp with the daily and boarding dogs signed up that day. Preparing meals, administering medications, checking on all of the pets to make sure they have clean water and bedding. Answering the phones to make reservations or respond to Pet Arent questions. File paperwork after entering it into our system. Preforming other miscellaneous duties; nail grindngs, exit baths, washing belongings, conducting individual playtimes. I've learned to watch for proper dog behavior and how to correctly care for them. Positive ways to influence and benefit parents. the management is very fair, enforcing the policies but not making it miserable. There isn't anything hard about this job as long as you can manage your time and duties in an effective way. The best part of the job is spending all day with the dogs. You meet so many of them and grow to love them all, some very regular and some whom only come every so often. Being around them and taking care of them is very rewarding and just makes you happy."
good,This was a temp assignment But if I was offered another assignment there I would take it Right away the staff are great and the management is to.
good,Great place to work if you are a pet lover.  Great employees. laalalalalalalalala
good,"Fun, working with dogs and cats employees are great, management is nice and honest, i learned alot of skills and customer service tips"
good,"A typical work day involved supervising store and hourly associates while monitoring the care and condition of all the animals in the store. Setting the store according to the corporate planner and stocking merchandise both new as well as backstock.  Placing orders for new merchandise, pricing and removing sale tags from shelving. unloading trucks on a weekly basis and running the load. Balancing the daily accounts and closing the store.  The hardest part of my job was getting employees on the same page and motivated, the most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and the animals."
good,"I stay at the register not only to ring out customers but to see if anyone needs help, if so I call or page a manger to help them out. When finishing ringing out a customer I always ask if they need help with that outside; if yes I call someone. I learn so much working there. I learned a lot about all kinds of animals and the products we sell. I learn to work fast and steady.I learned a lot about returns and exchanges. I've become confident with my position. I showed my mangers that I am a hard work and with 3 months working there I made employee of the month. I really love my job due to all the animals that come in and to the ones we sell. Ive grown to love them all"
good,"Learning the guest's names was personal to me. Once I memorized the names I felt as if we were close friends. I've learned how much our pets miss us when we are away. I love seeing pets fun to their parents when they come pick them up. My co-workers were all loving, caring people. Everyone had their own favorite guest and each reflected some sort of same personality. Hardest part of my job was the low hours. I wish PetSmart had regular full time. Most enjoyable part of the job was camp. I enjoyed playing and keeping company our guest. And I'm sure they enjoyed it as well."
good,"A typical day was long, hard, but fun. As I stated before all the morning task you have to do and how many hours it took just to complete the opening, it was a hard many times but it was what I loved to do. Animals are my passion and I couldn't wait to wake up and go to work and do it all over again the next day. I learned so many interesting and important facts about various animals and plant life. It was like being in school all over but I learned more at work. Everyday was something new and I loved that it wasn't just an ordinary day, it was adventurous everyday. My co-workers were awesome I became good friends with many of them. We were all like a big family The hardest part was the opening and the most enjoyable honestly was everything from being there to help customers find a new family member."

good,A typical day at work would leave you covered and fish water and a couple of feathers. I learned many different things about many different kinds of animals in a fun yet productive way. Management always went up and beyond to help each of their employees no matter the situation. My co-workers were always willing to cover a shift or give one if you weren't given enough hours. The hardest part was learning about all the animals in such a short period of time but it was also the best part of the job.
good,"Some days are crazy busy but, with a helpful team and flexible management, those days can be the most fun. As long as you are willing to learn, they are willing to teach. "
good, 
good,"My days of work were usually consisting of bathing, brushing, drying, etc., customer's pets. I started with a variety of breeds to care for in their basic grooming. Lifting and carrying animals into our washing station was also  required depending on size of animal."
good,"PetSmart is a great place to work at. Great customer service is what they are about, and PetSmart goes beyond great customer service. They do their best to make sure there are no holes on the shelves, customers find what they need and reaches to customers on a personal level."
good,"Working at PetSmart is the best job I have ever had! I have been working at the Roanoke, Virginia store for almost two and a half years now and I would not trade my time there for anything. I work in the pet care department but also help out on over night trucks and back up cashier. If you love animals and working in an upbeat environment this is the place for you. I love all of my fellow associates and management is great! Taking care of the animals and ensuring the ""pet parents"" are properly informed of the care for their pets is very enjoyable. I love that I am provided with all the tools necessary to properly care for all of our pets. The management does everything in their power to help us whenever we need it and they provide great customer service. There is a lot of diversity and we rarely have any type of drama."

good,"I loved working for Petsmart. They truly care about the welfare of pets. Of course their in store adoptions help their sales, however most of the employees their truly care about helping animals. For everyone at my store, adoptions were our favorite thing to do. I also think they have excellent benefits, including benefits for part time employees. They always worked around student schedules for those in school and were accomodating to my family when we needed."
good,"I was a groomer and thats what my day consisted of grooming animals, greeting cutomers, setting up appointments and batheing the animals."
good,Enjoyed teaching the new groomer and overseeing the bathers. Dealing with the customers whether they were happy or had a problem. Getting to know customers and there pets. Benefits were good.
good,"I love my job and the people I work with, but the department I work in is very laborious and you only get paid a small amount. It was nice when I worked here while still in school, but now I hate to have to leave because of how little I get paid because I love my job. The management is great and understanding and my co-workers are like family."

The other workers are amazing, the salon manager is understanding and fair with us all and a responsible one. No doubt one of the most cautious and safe work environments i’ve ever worked in!"
good,Management is super understanding and helped me so much. She pushed me to succeed and reach my goal. Not only was she there for me to reach my goal she helped me when I was struggling with personal things! I really enjoyed seeing all the different types of dogs and making them look beautiful. Yes it got stressful but the other employees were very helpful  when I got behind.
good,"The managers were great. the store was Awesome, it was a really fun place to work, and really busy. They didnt always give the best hours. There care of pets and customer service was outstanding. They were always well restocked and getting in new stuff all the time."
good,Lots to learn and a very fun environment. Being a cashier can get quite boring so its important to either move up to another position or find things to keep busy. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers trying to avoid taking their pets to the vet and assuming you have all the answers to their problems
good,"I've worked at two different PetSmart locations, and both times I absolutely loved the company, customers, and employees. It's an amazing place to work and to start a career."
good,"Great place to work but eventually working weekend shift 12 hours will get old. So far working with the company i have no complaints. Things can get heavy and near future, i believe will be wear and tear on the body, so take care of your body."

good,"Petsmart was the best job I have ever had. My managers and coworkers were amazing. Being a cashier wasn't as exciting as working in the grooming salon because it wasn't as busy but it was still a good time. Most of the customers were regulars and were excellent. If you are nice to them and make their trip there a good time, then they will come back. I learned alot working there. Alot of the patience came from the grooming salon. Very busy paced in the salon but that's how I like it. I felt that being able to help pet parents find the perfect products just made me warm and fuzzy inside."
good,Petsmart is caring not only to staff but customers and their pets. Pets are usually greeted first. All customers are welcomed and asked if they need assistance.

A huge shout out to all the managers and leaders for being so wonderful.

good,"PetsMart is the only place I've ever worked for that made me feel like real family. If possible, I would have stayed there all night because I absolutely loved what I did and loved and adored the pets. If I had the chance I would do it all over again. Thanks and God bless."

good,"My official title was a Pet Product Specialist.  In addition to that, I ran the cash register, answered the phones, stocked the store, and took care of all of the animals."
good,"I submitted an application online and the next day or two i got a call from this guy named David and was asked to come in for an interview.. all that night i was so so so nervous.. The next night about 6 o clock i got a call back asking if i could come in for another interview with the head manager and I was feeling really good about it. I got offered the job and was ecstatic but also nervous at the same time. My first day working there was a little rough but about a week in i felt kinda like we were all one big work ""family"". Everyone was so nice and just made me feel like i belonged there , it was only supposed to be seasonal but here i am 3-4 months later and still there. I love it!"
good,"Co-workers are fun to get to know even when you are new, they attend to make you feel welcomed even if you worl in different parts of the store. Playing and taking care of the dogs ia the best part of the day."
good,"Great work environment, amazing team efforts. There is always someone around the corner who can help you if you need it! Management is awesome and cares about the employees"
good,Working at petsmart is really fun. Other staff members go above and beyond to not overload you with duties. Sometimes it's difficult taking days off because there is only one other overnight worker
good,"I work mainly on the closing shift helping the animals and customers. All working together. I advanced my knowledge on pet care, and loved the constant knowledge. The most hardest time part about my job is due to the fact that I am a part timer I do not get benefits other than discounts at the store which is great. However I really need benifits that come with a full time job. And for a part timer my hours even sometimes get cut down to the bare minimum mainly when we have over worked our hours. However despite everything I love being around all of those animals and helping them find the forever home."
good,"If you ever want a fun part time job apply here. Great team, great pay, great benefits, and working with animal!  People always have a great time working here!"
good,Petsmart is a great place to work with great people. They are very flexible with giving time off and listen to what you need. The only thing i wish was that we got longer lunch breaks
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the pets. I helped mostly at the cash register. I helped occasionally with the overnight trucks that came in and helped stock and relabel the shelves. I helped customers out in the best way I could and would find someone to help us if I was unable to answer their question.
good,"I being born and raised in the USA I love animals. For me this job was fun, never a dull moment. I met hundreds of animals and being a manager had its benefits."
good,"I got to sit there with kitties all day and wrote in my journal between people's visits. It was a relaxing volunteering experience for me, and I'd do it again any time!"
good,"hey"
good,"loved it loved working with the animals but had to relocate to another county and I went back to school... I learned a lot about birds, reptiles, mammals, and fish and exactly what fresh fruit they all eat and need I even learned how to clip bird wings scary at first but a breeze when you learn."
good,Pet Smart was a great company to work for i loved it. I loved being able to work with all of the various types of animals that went into the store each day.
good,"I work with great people under great management. We take care of any animals that walk through our doors and of all of the animals, fish, and accessories that we sell."
good,When i started at Pet smart i knew very little when it came o the overall care for different animals. I was really easy to pick up good per care puts from coworks and even customers taught me a lot. Great place to work while attending school. They always were good about working around my schedule
good,"-weekly pay "
good,"Always happy with the different managers I worked with. Flexible hours and VERY accommodating to work schedules. Excellent benefits. Pay could have been a little bit better, especially for managers."
good,I loved working at petsmart because I got to be around animals. I was a amazing experience to get to work there. I enjoyed working everyday and the work place is such a fun and comfortable place to be at.
good,Overall this was a great place to work and very fun. People were always friendly and seemed to have fun and make the work place less stressful and a place that people would want to work.
good,"Bathed dogs, brushed fur and cut nails. If you want to further your experience you could also register through company to go to academy for ""dog grooming training"", which includes fur shaving and styling."
good,Learned more about pet products. I had a great team where we would be able to help each other with information any of the team members did not know and we would learn as a team to help our costumers choose the best items for their pets.
good,"PetSmart was the best company I had ever worked for.  They were fair in their dealings and always concerned about not only employees, but animals as well."
good,I loved working for petsmart and it was the best job I have ever had. The staff was amazing and I actually looked forward to going to to work every day.
good,volunteered for a few years with the animal adoption events at Petsmart. they were great and we were able to find good homes for many animals. I took care of the animals and assisted staff.
good,"Overall, management is amazing and the group of workers are extremely nice. I didn't get the hours that I was needing, so I had to leave. They are flexible with your school and possibly other work schedules. My fellow coworkers were incredibly nice and taught how to do the job efficiently and took their time teaching me."
good,"Running the cash register"
good,"Love the animals, great staff would recommend working here. Good opportunity for moving up and many options in which field you can get into. Never a dull moment."
good,typical work day goles by fast becasue there is always something to do great management team the hardest part is staying awake until 330 in thee morning the best part of the job is the paid time off
good,Haven't worked for the company in over ten years but when I was there I loved it and regret leaving it if I knew I was re hire-able I'd go back sadly I left on bad terms
good,"Petsmart is a great place for young people looking for a job. I loved working there because I am a big dog person and you got to meet a lot of dogs that came through the register line. It was a relaxing company to work for, the management was great."
good,I truly enjoyed my time interacting with pet parents and their pets. On a regular basis I was in charge of training dogs and absolutely loved every minute of it.

good,petsmart was a great job no complaints i enjoyed grooming pets i enjoyed meeting new people...speaking to the clients about there pets and ordering supplies
good,"Petsmart treats its employees exceptionally well, employee sales that include items that have been discontinued or unsold clearance for very minimal prices, great benefits, and great environment. The supervisors and trainers were very encouraging and let us know that even though we couldn't reach production, we would be a great fit within the company. The problem with that is that most, if not all, of the other departments only hire from within. If you can't make it in shipping, you basically don't get to work for the company these days."
good,You become a family with the employees and you really get to know the customers and their pets. You also get to learn a lot of new stuff dealing with animals
good,I left to pursue a career at a veterinary office and I also care for my elderly disabled parents. I was willing to do both but could not meet the needs of my employer.
good,"I love the company itself, my managers, and my job. The only problem I have is the pay is minimum wage and I agree that for a cashier but, not as a bather. It is very hard work but, I love this job so much that I would keep this on the side for the rest of my life if possible. It is super fun and a way to play with dogs while getting paid. While it isn't always easy it is rewarding."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"love everything about the job, everyone was friendly, professional, work was always fun, never an dull moment. management cared about their employees."
good,I enjoyed working with my companions and working hard is a fun thing for me to do. it was a fast paced environment and i enjoyed every minute of it even though it was temporary
good,I would still be working here if I lived closer. The hours required to work here coincided with my kids school schedule. The fact that I have to get my kids up & ready for school dictates the type of job/schedule I need.
good,"The happiest place to work, other than Disneyland. The entire building is committed to the care of pets, a cherished part of every community and family. The selection and special vendor interaction events offer direct consumer knowledge of products before committing your pet to a product."
good,"I started working here thinking that it would only be a winter job, but ended up finding my niche! It's a wonderful place, honestly.  If you ever want a job, where you can just be you, try Petsmart!"
good,"Very fast pace  productive work place, accomplish 3 promotions and 2 certificates. A typical day for me would check everybody productions on the weekend shift just to see if they was making production if they wasn't i would offer them more training. The hardest part for me is when i offer more training and they received more training and still wasn't able to perform productivity they would have to get terminated due to not making production."
good,As soon as I stepped in there was someone available to help me find the right dog food for my 3month old pup. There was a variety of toys to pick from. The store even have their own Vet
good,"One of the best companies I worked for."
good,The only thing I didn't like about working there is that they try to push you into grooming which fro me created a lot of stress. I prefer to just take care of the animals.
good,"When arrived at work the managers usually have tasks ready to be worked on. Whether its stocking, pet care or cashier. Along with that is always customer service. Managers are always organized and friendly. While working at PetSmart I learned customer service and how to watch for signs of sickness or stress in animals. The most enjoyable part of my job is engaging with pet parents and building relationships with them."
good,Great advancement for employees wonderful atmosphere good benefits. Great training and great organization   Great rescue and pet opportunities to help rescue homeless pets
good,I loved my job at petsmart didn't want to leave but I had to because I had a baby. But if I had the chance to go back I would go back to work for petsmart.

good,Typical day of work started at four in the morning. I would do price changes if need be or stocking also. I learned so much more about taking care of different  types of animals. Reptiles and aquatics. My management was really wonderful. Workplace culture was really nice. We had an almost  family type vibe about it. The hardest part of the job was making the judgement about the next step to do with customers and their returns without a receipt. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers happy and then visiting with all the animals.
good,I loved working for this company. The only reason I left was because the company discontinued my job position. I would definately return and would recommend this company.
good,"Pretty fun seeing animals everywhere. You get to experience so many types of animals, even some that you've never seen before. Socialize with people that are as obsessed with animals as you."
good,"I'd say the hardest part of being a dog bather are the dogs that just don't want to enjoy a spa day. They'll fight, scratch, and cry the entire time. But those are the once-in-a-blue-moon dogs. Holidays are the best time to work the salon. A constant flow of unique customers keeps the day interesting and the shift moving quick. "
good,learned something new everyday I was there. bonding with customers while learning about all kinds of different animals. never a dull moment keeping busy was never a problem finding something to do.
good,"It can tend to be stressful because of customers, but it's not bad salary wise, unless its a wage cut for you. The staff are friendly, and the managers, while scary at first, are nice once you get to know them."
good,Petsmart is great place to work if you're an animal lover.  Management was good. Great place to make extra cash. Best part of this job is that i get to see different types of animals and learn about them.

good,I had a great experience working at Petsmart. I loved the atmosphere and how the customers got to know you. It was my first job and I would recommend working there to anyone.
good,"Staff was easy to get along with. Management was great, very open for communication and easy to talk to regarding concerns. The training was slightly laxed."

good,petsmart is a great company ... they could improve their one on one training. they have very high level safety training. and they are fair in their hours and shifts.

good,loved this place! It was like the best job ever! Got to spend lots of hours working with pets. The staff was great and everyone got along well. The customers were great too!
good,A typical day included working with pets and pet parents. I learned what products were the best and the worst for animals. Management was great. The hardest part of the job was not getting all the hours I needed. The best part was being able to love on animals.
good,Very fast paced and well managed work space. They are very welcoming and do as much as they can to assist and provide for their employees. The benefits are fair and the people I experienced working with were very level headed and educated individuals.
good,great place to work. Management is understanding and team is supportive. Some people  are chatty (gossip) so I don't recommend getting to personal with people.
good,I worked here briefly but the hiring process was very short and manageable. The managers and groomers I worked for were over all very considerate and team players. I would recommend pet smart to anyone looking .
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years and thoroughly enjoyed my job. I have worked in many different positions throughout my years with the company. My most enjoyable time was being in the salon. I am very thankful for PetSmart as it has taught me hard work, dedication, and loyalty."
good,The staff is really nice and easy to get along with. They are very understanding and work around appointments. They call you in if they need shifts covered.

good,"I absolutely loved working for PetSmart, ,my co workers and bosses were amazing energetic and enthusiastic people. My coworkers and i  bonded really well because we all shared the same passion for animals."
good,"PetSmart pays fairly well, but expects a lot of its employees. They encourage a positive work environment, but this will always depend on the particular people at a given store."
good,"I have worked at Petsmart for 7 years and although it has been a great experience, I am ready to move on and learn different things. I want to learn more advanced grooming and learn even more about grooming dogs"
good,I enjoy volunteering and helping with adoptions. I adopted two cats that were a brother and sister when I first started so they would not be separated.
good,"Managers cared for the welfare of all animals in the store, employee and pet safety is a top priority. Customers enjoyed talking about their animals, many friends were made during my time there."

good,"I enjoyed my work here"
good,one thing that kept me at petsmart for so long was the caring and easy to work with staff. I never really had any issues while working at petsmart and the staff there was great.
good,"Overall a good organization to work for.  Promotes within, leadership provides direction with constructive criticism to help you grow.  Work life balance is good as well as work load."
good,Working mornings are the best because you don't find traffic on your way to work. Also fewer people working too so more space to move things around to clean.

good,"-	Discussed grooming requirements and desired styles with pet owners"
good,"Petsmart was a great place to work, during my tenure there. It was fast paced, very busy, with lots of overtime. When I ended my employment, it was to work closer to home, because at the time it was a very long drive. Had I lived closer, I would have gladly continued to work there."
good,I liked working there but the in store drama was to much to deal with on a daily basic there was always stress in the saloon with no management help from anyone
good,I enjoyed my entire time working for petsmart because i was able to do something that i enjoyed as well as meeting great people which offered a outstanding work environment
good,"Pet smart  was a very good place to work. The store management were very good people and always made sure you had what you needed to succeed. Any aspect of any associate level job is fairly easy and straightforward. You do get time crunched from time to time but most the time managers will send extra help your way or help you themselves. Most customers you deal with a nice, and if you do get any nasty people managers are always willing to step in. flexible scheduling for those with school or another job. and best part is there are lots of dogs"
good,"By far, the best place to work if you love animals and want to make a difference in the lives of animals and families. The breaks are great and the patience of the managers is outstanding."
good,"Days varied with busy schedule"
good,You get to handle with pets and train them if possible. There is always something new and fun about the job each and everyday. There are different types of food for your pets there and someone is always willing to help you out and teach you what to give your pets.

good,It is a great place to work either a part time or full time job. The manager was great and understanding of my needs with work and the entire store welcomed me in with open arms.
good,Absolutely love working here! The team I work with is amazing and my co workers are always able to lend a helping hand if needed. The management team at my location is amazing as well and are always there to talk to if a problem occurs. Very laid back job and my favorite part of the job is meeting all the pets that come into the store from your everyday dogs and exotics like the african tortoise that visits once a month!
good,"Loved the customers, and I loved helping them with their animals. I learned so much about animals that I still use til this day. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with death of animals, and having to take them to the vet to get put down. I got along perfect with the management, they were like my 2nd family."
good,Petsmart for me was a fun place to work since i liked the job a lot. A day for me consists of cleaning the animal cages and fish tanks; making sure they have food and fresh water. Giving the sick animals their medicine. Helping customers with helping them find everything they needed for their pet.
good,"As I am currently employed at PetSmart, I can say that it is a wonderful company to work for. All the people I have worked with are extremely caring. I made instant friends when I started working here, and the environment is family, kid, and animal friendly. I come to work with a smile on my face and I leave every day the same way. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a part-time, flexible, easy, and decent paying job."
good,Great staff and associate. Managers/Leads were always really helpful. Training was also given and it was helpful to learn more to assist customers. The staff was all like family.
good,love working here and with all of the animals. I am a bather and find my day filled with excitement and I actually look forward to coming to work! Great place to work
good,Corporate office is fun with a gym and opportunity to bring your dog to work with you!  Excellent work/life balance and definitely a work hard/play hard culture.
good,You are constantly learning something new every day. Management is really good. You meet awesome pet parents who really care for their animals. Plus you get to prepare new pet parents as well for their new animals.
good,this is where I gained most of my dog training experience when I was younger. I have since gained more knowledge and started professionally training dogs and doing service dog training. I also worked the register and sometimes did stocking and early morning loading.
good,"very fast paced environment, learning how to multitask properly and efficiently. "
good,"Very upbeat environment , alway busy. Big on teamwork and cleanliness. the hardest part of this job is to try and not git bit by a dog. The most enjoyable part has to be how friendly our customers are."

good,"Great company to work for.  Easy group of people to work for.  And yet to g to play with animals all day is a plus.  My work day consist of feeding all the small animals, feeding and cleaning fish tanks, making sure the birds are feed and watered.  Helping customers with finding the right kind off food for there fur baby's."
good,I learned a lot working at Petsmart. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I would recommend this job to anyone who loves animals or wants to get to know different types of pets and how to care for them.
good,"A day at work would be head to work on time with a positive attitude clock in and head to the pet care area make sure all habitat lights are on, give medicine to any sick animals, clean the work area and make sure you are ready for any customer questions about any animal. As the day goes by you are ask to clean certain habitats so you have to be willing to handle any type of animal including snakes, Spiders, Hamsters, Birds and Fish. Once the end of the shift is done you have to make sure all animals are accounted for and the work area is clean."
good,The company has mandatory reviews so you get a chance to get raises. The most important part is that you keep trying because you actually have a chance to grow within the company.
good,"Working at Petsmart was an Awesome Experience, but may not be for everyone, while i loved the job very much, i watched a-lot of people struggle with how fast-paced it is, on top of that keeping track and taking care of all your own appointments can be a bit much for people. But all-in-all if you enjoy a challenge Petsmart's Grooming Salon can Deliver! was sad i had to leave because of distance!"
good,"Working at PetSmart was a valuable experience and opportunity that I am more than happy to have had. The job kept you busy if you worked hard, a typical day included assisting customers at check out, pet care, bagging fish and crickets, fitting harnesses on animals, building dog crates, zoning aisles, running returns, and completing any individual tasks given. I learned a lot about proper animal care but I learned the most about how to properly engage with customers through C.A.R.E. They spend time to make sure you have the proper skillsets needed for the tasks ahead. The management at PetSmart was well organized and easy to get along with. I don't recall any instances of butting heads with authority as all in management positions work tirelessly to try to accommodate their employees and give them the best work environment and experience while maintaining authority. The workplace was fun and engaging. It was easy to jump in and start helping my colleagues as well as independently work on my own projects. The hardest part of the job was assisting unhappy customers, but I learned effective ways to handle those situations. The most enjoyable part of the job is almost too hard to pin down, but I would have to say the animals in general. It was great to care for animals and to see people bring in their pets."
good,I handled money for customers and helped customers find solutions in a timely manner.  It was a great place to work and I would recommend it to anyone to work there.
good,i enjoy this job. It is fun and they make you want to come to work. They play music early in the morning and it motivates us to work hard and makes us want to come to work.
good,"The opportunity to work at this store has helped build my leadership and improved my skills in the workplace. Every day offers something new, breaking the monotonous routine of the day, and continues to offer purpose with meaningless tasks that make for a successful store. Management is thoughtful, yet goal oriented, so each worker exceeds his or her expectations."
good,"A fun learning experience every day, management and associates are always in a happy mood and willing to help or serve whether it is a pet parent or employee. Most difficult part is lifting 50 lb bags of pet food and time flies before you know it is time to punch out!"
good,"The management is very nice and understanding. They help you toward your goals and do not leave you behind. If you make a mistake, management shows you how you did wrong and how you can do better the next time. The hardest part of the job is the Email Capture. Email capture is when a customer gives you their email, and sometimes people do not have one or don't want to give you their email. So it's pretty hard to get above 30% (which is what they want everyday) But the key is to stay positive and not to give up. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers about their pets. It fun to hear the stories and meet all types of animals. I've had a lady come in with a bearded dragon on her arm and let me pet him. I think that's pretty cool don't you?"

The hardest part of my job would probably be dealing with a death of one of our sick animals. My coworkers are absolutely amazing, we are one big happy family.

good,"A typical day at PetSmart Hotel is usually starting walks with the dogs in the morning. once walks are done for all dogs, employees are sent to playrooms and filled in with day camp dogs (Dogs scheduled for playtime with each other). Employees are usually in the playroom for 3 hours at a time and will switch out with another employee. PetSmart Hotel camp lasts from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, afterwards there is a lunch break for the dogs from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm. Camp resumes once it is 1:00 pm until 5:00 pm. Co-Workers are very friendly and always willing to help out if in need. The hardest part of the job is probably being in the playroom for hours, being stuck in a room cleaning up after dogs for 3 straight hours is probably not the first thing to get you excited for work. Employees get used to the schedule and doesn't pose any real problem (You have to love dogs to survive in the playroom for that many hours). The most enjoyable part of working in the hotel is the fact that you see all sorts of breeds and get to know the pets and their parents."

good,"A typical day at work for me is fun,effective, substantial, and you get to meet new people everyday. So far I've learned that no matter what the customers satisfaction is most important. You have to make their experience fun but professional in order for them to come back. Management is important as well because a good leader or leaders makes a good work environment and keeps business running smoothly. Co-workers must work together as a team in order to maintain a good workplace. The hardest part of any job is patience, no matter how frustrating situations get you must always keep it professional and remember the CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT !!!! Aside from all the that their is also good times when you get to interact with people or you do something that improves the company."

good,"Best place I have ever worked.   401 k, 3 weeks paid off first year, awesome customers and dogs and cats and fish and dragons! Management is delegated to the staff with trust that they have the knowledge and ability to handle any emergency situation.   Low pressure sales approach.  They Carry all the top industry retail at comparable or unbeatable prices so there really is no need to pressure customers.  This allows you to build real relationships instead of being just one more person digging in their pockets.  Love the new (2016) Pet smart culture.  If you have issues with dealing with animal waste you should not work with or own them,  and you may have potty shame issues."
good,"I love working at this job, so nice from the manager to employees. This job is very awesome, I would recommend everybody give this job a try"

good,"Very exciting environment to work in. If you are not a pet lover, this is not the place for you. There are so many positions that you can have here. I had three different job titles myself and was able to jump from one to the other. Which never made the job boring."
good,"Clock in, overlook my duties for that certain day, do them (cleaning cages) checking on other pets fresh water food etc. Turn my attention to the fish systems (scrub siphon etc.) that all need to be done by 10am.

I quickly learned the ins and outs of pricing and stocking and I absolutely loved doing that as well. I asked to be trained to learn how to handle the fish and small animals we sold at Petsmart and that was one of the most rewarding things I've ever learned. Working with animals in some way is a huge passion of mine."

good,High pace work makes the time goes by. Production everyday is needed. being safe in your work area able to fix locations and problems.

good,"Typical Salon"
good,"I loved this job, but it did get pretty routine and I left because I wanted something that changed up a bit. Everyone was wonderful and we had a really great crew dynamic through out the store. They always worked with my school schedule and didn't over work me and make me completely exhausted if they could help it. Loved the customers and pets that I built relationships with while there. I also loved that hard work was acknowledged regularly."
good,"Each PetCare Specialist is scheduled a specific task on certain days. If you open on a weekday, you are the person in charge of deep cleaning the habitat for that day. There are always tasks that need to be like scrubbing fish tanks, taking care of the animals for opening and closing, catching fish or getting animals for customers, etc. We are also all required to learn about every animal we carry, so there's an educational aspect to this job. Customers will come to you with any concerns or questions about their animals or just any animal in general and it is our responsibility to assist them in any way that we can."
good,"-Managers and supervisors go out of their way to make everyone feel at home"
good,"To some up this job, it's amazing. Being with animals all day every day is probably the greatest thing in the world. I love seeing them all, they all put a smile on my face. I don't mind helping people at all especially since I got to know Petsmart so I actually know a bunch about the products in the store.. I'd say the hardest part about the job is stocking dog food or cat litter. It gets a little heavy but you just have to deal with it. But most of all being with the animals is what makes this job so incredible."
good,"Being a manager at PetSmart  really taught me how to balance Pet parents ,associates and my work load. PetSmart taught me how to couch in a positive way , making my associates  feel they also mattered. Hardest part of day would be dealing with the sick animals very  heartbreaking. Most enjoyable taken and angry Pet Parent and making them very happy in the end."

Hardest part of the job was falling in love with all the pets and having to goodbye after checking out the owners items.  Most enjoyably was getting to interact with many animals."
good,Competitive work environment that can inspire the driven A-types to succeed and grow! Recent privatizing of company has worked out for the best and company has made positive steps and strides towards innovative growth.
good,It was a pretty easy and laid back job. I would suggest it for anyone looking to earn a few extra bucks here and there to support themselves while going through school
good,"Working with animals is my passion next to cooking. I have always enjoyed learning and educating the public and customers on future new pets. I have learned about new animals through customers and the store itself. On a daily basis i would make sure the animals were fed and clean. Making sure all animals were healthy to go to new homes. Helping customers with the loved pets with choosing the right foods, needs and enclosures. "

good,This is the perfect place for someone who has never worked in a call center. The training is a breeze and the work is a piece of cake. If you like pets then this is the place for you. Management well they change so much its hard to rate. Co-workers are your friends forever even after you leave. Hardest part of the job is the constant change.
good,"PetSmart is my favorite place to work, with great staff. The company in general is loving. All of the employees are very friendly."
good,Very diverse environment and learning potential. Constantly teaching Pet Parents the care and background of the animals that are in our care.
good,I enjoyed my time at Petsmart.  I had no problems working every weekend and loved that they could help me with my work schedule if I needed anything. Pay is by commission so the more dogs you groom the more you make. Fun Environment!
good,I would clean animals habitats along with feedings and dish washing. I helped customers on a daily basis with pet care need and questions. Not only were the co-workers great so was management. I think by far this was the best job experience I had. Management worked with you on a whole new level to work around your schedule and your special accommodations. The most enjoyable part of my job was the whole aspect of it I was constantly kept busy and always learning new things.
good,"I loved working for this company, everyone has something in common, their love for animals!  The managers were always there for every situation, whether it was work related or not. They made work fun!"

good,Petsmart has definitely  been an unforgettable work place. I would do it again if I could. The management was great and my co-workers were the best.
good,"Working at the Grooming Salon was such a great experienced for me. I had the opportunity to learn about every dog breed, their correct haircuts, culture and so much more. The best part is getting to interact with Petparents that love and care about pets as much as we do. Its always fast paced in there, specially holidays but its done promptly and with so much safety to the pet and the groomer. I would say that the hardest part would be when you first start because its not what you think. Its a very hard job that needs dedication, time, A LOT of patients, and safety. Overall i LOVED my job there, would definitely go back once my baby gets older."
good,"I would come in every weekend, clean the kittens/cats cages, feed them, let someone from the public hold and pet the animals, adopt them out and file the adoption paper work."
good,Working at PetSmart has given me more customer service skills. The coworkers all act as a family and are wonderful to work with.
good,"Greeting customers with a bright smile and a chipper voice every morning I was always 30 minutes or so early I always did this so I could plan and see what was the new product that we needed to sell mainly on that day/example for the last week I was there we needed to sell a lot of our puppy starter kits. If no customers were at the front and were ready to check out I would check with my manager to see if I could break down boxes and to restock the shelves but only if I kept and eye on the register. Before I started this job I hadn't really ever dealt with a rude disrespectful customer before, my first week or so I got a customer that was not understanding what I was asking her. We have pet perks cards  the customers usually had and that was one of the questions I had to ask unless they had already had it out and ready. When the customer entered her number, the computer said that the customer was not found then the computer will let the cashier try I asked her for her number to try and find her pet perks and she wasn't understanding what I was doing and when I tried to explain she blew up on me and started to yell at me and when I told her to please calm down that there was no reason for that behavior she told me that she didn't have to and she wanted to see a manager so I did what the customer asked. walked away and got the rest of the customers on register 2. "

good,"Working a Petsmart was very laid back. The management are extremely knowledgeable and willing to help others. I've learned so much about different types of animals.

good,"It's a great thing to be around people that care about something so much that they would do anything to have a better life for themselves and the things they care about especially an animal. To some people an animal is just an animal, but when you talk to a customer and realize they need say this dog or cat to be in their life to help make their life more exciting then I'm all for it.

good,"I absolutely LOVED working here. My co-workers were great and so were my managers. Maybe the worst part about the job was cleaning up potty accidents from the animals that came in. During a typical day, I would run the front of the store which included mainly cashiering but also stocking and fronting the store and cleaning the  front."
good,"My day starts by unloading each dog one by one, taking them to use the restroom.about every hour, talking ing to potential owners whom would be interested in by adopting a dog. feeding and supplying the dogs with water.

good,"A typical day starts with setting up our phone system, computers, and opening the salon for business. as we check in clients we gather any missing file information or update current changes. I answer multiple phone calls and multitask throughout the day as I complete my dogs for the day. I have learned intense time management and multitasking. I interact with management hourly when they preform the dog walks to ensure pet safety. My co-workers and I interact fluidly while finishing our tasks at hand. the hardest part of our job is helping he dogs to feel comfortable being groomed and making sure all of the safety policies are being followed by all. the most enjoyable part is getting to work hands on with pets and having a happy client at the end of the groom."
good,unload the truck and stock the shelf's help customers find what they or looking for and getting to meet the customers pets I learned about all the brands of food and supplies we sold the management was helpful and worked with you as needed the co-workers were fun and out going always there to help if you needed them bc we all worked as a team to get the job done and to help out with the customer if you wasn't sure what they were looking for unloading the truck was the hardest part bc the back room wasn't that big so tiring  to move around was hard the enjoyable part was working with the animals
good,Great place to work with tremendous pay and benefits. wish I would have never left there. Co-workers were fun and taking care of the animals was the task most enjoyed.
good,"Working as a dog trainer I interacted with many different people and breeds. I taught different level of course, which include: puppy, beginner, intermediate, advance, and private courses. Although I was training the dogs, I would also teach the pet parents how to train the dogs. I taught lessons which consisted of but not limited to potty training, sit, stay, lay, leave it, and heal. The hardest part of being a pet trainer was dealing with the pet parents who weren't putting time or effort into training their dog. What I loved most about being a trainer was interacting with all the dogs and helping them become well mannered pets."
good,"Feeding, cleaning animals, learning new things everyday about animals, handling and caring for animals."
good,Excellent job if you are looking for a position that deals directly with both people and animals. The managers were flexible and friendly which made it a great place to work!
good,"PetSmart is a fun and educational place to work.  I started off as a part-time cashier and am currently a Presentation Manager.  I work directly under the Store and Operations Managers.  There are so many opportunities to grow with the company.  A typical day for me would be making sure inventory for the previous day was taken out of the system correctly, stocking the entire store with product and making sure there are no empty shelves so the customers are able to purchase what they need.  I am responsible for about 60 employees in my store, so I am always checking the departments to make sure the employees have what they need, that there is a good amount of coverage on the floor and for the customers, and helping in anyway I need to if a problem arises.  My employees and fellow managers are always happy to come into work.  The morale of the store is always high and if any of my employees every have issues that need resolving, they know they can always come to me and I will help no matter what.  Working in a pet store, you get customers with many different questions and problems.  That is probably the most difficult AND enjoyable part of my day.  Figuring out if a customer needs a certain type of medication or food for an animal with allergies or infections is always a challenge.  I want to make sure that I always provide excellent customer service to my customers and get them the product that will benefit them most.  The most rewarding aspect is when a customer that I have helped in the past returns to the store just to let me know how much I have helped them and their pet."

good,"On a typical day at PetSmart I clean the front registers, speak to customers about products and make suggestions, face shelves making sure everything looks good for the following day. I love spending time and getting to know not only pet parents but their pets as well, what tricks they can do, avoiding certain gestures as not to spook them, etc."
good,"Using headsets, we received our labels and were told where our next order filling assignment would be within the warehouse. We picked items and stacked them neatly and in patterns until the order was complete. Then we would drop the finished pallet orders off at their correct dock door destination after wrapping them with plastic wrap. After dropping them off we would pick up new assignments and begin the same routine again. It was very easy to stay busy."
good,"PetSmart was a wonderful company to work for. A typical day, for myself, included assisting customers with various animal and merchandising questions, taking care of the multitude of pets the company carries in store, and working with my team to make sure the store ran smoothly. My management team was the backbone to my store's success and my coworkers not only made the work enjoyable, but were also a great help at accomplishing our various tasks. Each day at PetSmart was enjoyable, but by far the best part of my job was connecting with the few regular customers that came in. I was able to become not only their aid in pet care needs, but also their friend. The hardest part of my job, and I'm sure any retail worker would agree, was handling the struggles of store resets. Thankfully my wonderful coworkers and managers worked extremely well as a team to get the job done."

good,"Working at PetSmart was an awesome experience. I was able to help new pet parents find everything they need to start taking care of the new animal they are bringing into their home. Most customers are frequent shoppers so i was able to watch as pets grow and adapt to the world around them. I loved being able to say I was responsible for helping make a new pet parent comfortable which in turn improves the lifes of the animals too, it was an amazing and very fun environment"

good,"The overal work environment at PetSmart has to be one of the best things about the job. Every one I had the plesure of working with was wonderful. I left the company with so much knowledge and experience. I wish I didnt have to leave but unfortunatly I couldn't transfer due to there not being a store in my current location. You can Guarentee though that when they finally build one, I will be the first one in line applying for a job."
good,"I was very lucky in achieving the Pet trainer position here at this Petsmart. The management is incredible, they are flexible and supportive. The associates are helpful and motivating. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with animals and seeing loyal customers every day."
good,a typical day consisted of my taking photos of several different animals with santa clause. I would then develop the photos and print them the customer would pay for the frame and they were on their way.
good,"A typical day at work consists of straight to work as soon as i clock in. I had phones immediately to answer, questions waiting for response to answers, files that needed to be reviewed, marked, and shredded. After all those duties had to was up to 10 dogs in less than 5 hours."
good,I always had a great time working for this company. I have met a lot pets and people. Making sure my store is full so the wonderful pets always had reasons to visit us made the job easier.
good,"I loved working for Petsmart! Being an animal person, working in a pet environment couldn't be better. I was the lead dog trainer and I loved meeting new pet parents all of the time and watching them learn and grow with their furry friends."
good,"This is a great company to work with. In the PetsHotel its hard work, not for the social butterfly.  Its a quick and dirty job in the back and hard, and fast in the front. They will teach you everything but will not hire full time. Only managers will get full time.  Its fun and kinda relaxing to play in playgroup with the dogs, its great that you are in charge and can remove a dog if you are not comfortable. Management is very nice and willing to help as long as you talk to them about issues you may have. Every store is a little different though."
good,I have really enjoyed my time with Petsmart. I get attached to the regular pet parents that come in every week or so and the pets that come along with them! I will definitely miss it.
good,"When you walked into work each day, you never knew what kind of situation you were going to encounter.  Being able to jump from problem to problem kept the day going by fast and having so many amazing clients allowed me to see progress in them at the end of their training."

good,"Pet Smart is a great company to work for, I was provided with flexible hours to obtain my degree in accounting at Kennesaw State University.

good,"A typical day at Petsmart for me depended on what I was that day.  I was classified as a lead cashier but I also did early morning stocking, pet care, some grooming, and plan-o-grams and resets.  Weather it was coming it at 5am to unload trucks, cleaning and organizing pet habitats, or running a register, it was always enjoyable.  My managers and co-workers became family so that made it a fun place to work.  The hardest part of the job was handling more aggressive customers, but being a lead I quickly learned how to deal with them in a calm, nice, professional matter.  One of the most enjoyable parts of working for Petsmart was also the customers.  I loved when people came in with their pets and all their stories about them, just seeing other people so passionate about the same things as I is truly a way to brighten anyone's day.  Management was awesome for the most part, always very understanding and flexible with availabilities.  They really care about their employees.

good,I loved working at Petsmart. I originally started working in the Pet Care Department. I would take care of all the animals making sure their cages were clean while also helping people with their pet questions. I was cross-trained in the grooming salon as a bather/brusher. This is a position I also enjoyed very much. I loved being able to have a similarity of loving animals like my customers. I am also very knowledgeable of animals. 
good,I had a lot of fun working at petsmart. Working in the grooming dept was great cause I got to play with all the animals that came in to be groomed (except 1) and even out in the store there were some that would come in and if I saw them I would have to go see them one being a lion cub named Thor whom the last time I seen him tackled me for the most part and began to kiss my face.  I guess being around the animals was the best part the hardest part was when one dog died while I was being bathed and another got put down after she bit me and her biting me was not her fault but after that she snapped and a couple kid so they decided it was time. She was very old and blind and deaf so she didn't really know better any more.

good,"Great place to work, always a fun day getting to meet new pet parents and there pets. A very friendly work environment"

I drove an electric pallet jack which I had never done previously to working there but I caught on really fast and I loved what I was doing. I had to build up to eight foot tall pallets of dog food and cat litter, which was really hard at first but when my body got use to it I really enjoyed it.

good,"Even though I have only worked a few shifts with Petsmart, I am learning a lot and working with a great team of people. It is a fun but focused group who have to work together to get products in the store before it opens to customers. I am looking forward to getting more hours and cross training in other areas of the store which may allow me to have more responsibility,"
good,"I loved this job, it was my first job ever, it was a challenge at first but within a year I was being asked to go to dog grooming classes and moved from one side of the country to the other with them.

They were not worth listening to and the manager there way getting high on sharpie and then grooming dogs..."

good,it is very fun because you get to work with animals and things that you can learn from them.
good,"Good experience. Co workers okay. I liked working with people, Helping stock shelves, and Seeing people leave happy. Everyone had good customer service skills"
good,"A typical day day at work could go by really quickly but only because we are having fun. We make sure that we make all customers that walk in petsmart feel welcome and at the end of their trip also make them feel like the want to come back again. What I learned working there was to improve my customer service and I also learned alot more about animals, which that what I was hoping for I first starting working there. The management is pretty good. They make sure we do everything we have to do. The hardest part about working there is seeing an animal die because of some sort of sickness, its not enjoyable and no one would want to see there furry family friend die. The enjoyable part about working there is seeing all the puppies that walk in there, and how happy they are just for someone to play with them for the moment."
good,I loved working for this organization. My leaders were all nice and open to any concerns employees had.

I honestly don't feel like any part of this job was difficult in anyway. Most enjoyable part is playing with the dogs and interacting with their pet-parents. While working here I learned that dogs and cats aren't supposed to breathe in the same air while they are boarded in a closed in facility such as a hotel."
good,"I miss working here. Fast pace and always busy. I learned how to work well with people and animals. The management was great. I got along with all my co-workers.

My co-workers are a great support system to have there for tips, safe and easier ways to load safely and efficiency. The hardest part of my job is loading the trucks at the proper weight. And the most enjoyable part of my job is the appreciation and dedication that we all put towards getting the shipments out safely and accurately to out stores."
good,"A typical day at Petsmart would consist of taking care of the animals, making sure they are well taken care of and cages look appropriate for Pet Parents prior to opening. Greeting every customer right when they walk though the door and making them genuinely feel welcomed. I have learned a lot in my almost 3 years of working there. When I first started I didn't know anything about working a register or how the pet care department worked. I am a very fast learner and my management team were very helpful and patient with answering all of my questions as well as helping me grow with the company and really helping me achive my goals. My co-workers are the best, I can actually depend on them to help me as well as they can depend on me to help them. We are very team oriented so we all got along great. The hardest part of my job would be not having a full time position. The most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing all the different pets come in to the store, and how happy Pet Parents are when they come in and I am able to help them with any questions they have, and also after my classes graduate from pet training how happy my students are with how far their dogs have come since the first day of class."

In this job I learned how to really multitask and meet a deadline. The staff and management are pretty good as well. Everyone is friendly and works together to a common goal. My challenges to overcome where the times when there would be a crowd of customers and I was the only one to work. That is stressful on anyone, but I did it. I loved working with the animals and helping people find their new friends."

good,The most enjoyable part was when we done stock take. I learned how to work as a cashier and dealing with returns and all of the staff where really friendly
good,"I miss this job, I had most of my career development here and had a lot of fun along the way. I worked with great people who shared the same passion for pets as I have. I also participated in a lot of district events that lead to my better development as a manager, and had my ideas heard that helped make changes company wide. The hours are great if you like retail hours, you have plenty of oppurtunity for advancement if you listen to your ""coachings"" and evaluations, and give a lot of effort, but smart working is rewarded here not just grunt hard work, that will only get you so far. The only down side was the pay was not the best, but again if you work your way up the benefits and time spent makes up the difference. Great culture, and good people, great pets."
