rating,review
bad,You do way too much for little pay outdated systems training is rushed supervisors are childish so is the Beachwood manager. They say no micromanaging but that’s all there is don’t be fooled by the starting wage as it should way higher. The supervisors do not know how to do anything that we do you can’t ask them any questions it’s a very stressful job I do not recommend at all
bad,Strong political battles with opposition to change.  I witnessed bullying and injustice.  No new hire lasts more than three years.
bad,"The IT culture is toxic. Many long time employees are getting let go, retiring early, or are resigning for better opportunites. Management does not care because they do nothing about the mass exodus of experienced employees."
bad,"I worked here for almost 2 years and found the best part was learning about Health Insurance, which I used to get a much better job elsewhere.  Thank you, Jesus!  Otherwise, the job is stressful, you are not treated that well, in at least in comparison where I worked before.  When you try and take PTO, usually it is hard to get approved and when I left, I was not paid out for my PTO fully, they only gave me a percentage; this was not disclosed in the Employee Handbook.  Most places, you leave and they pay you for all the PTO you have accrued, here they pay you only a percentage.  DISHONEST.  Also, the pay is low, unless you are coming from a more low-paying job like working at Giant Eagle or some such place."
bad,"Love to have a job that I am not stressed out the whole day.  I work well with others! Would like to have a good attitude with co-workers!"
bad,"An organization is only as good as its leaders!  That being said...Management needs more training and to be evaluated by subordinate. Horrible hiring patterns for managers and leaders.  Management is aloof, passive aggressive and too insecure to develop future leaders of the company.  Processes are redundant and new ideas aren't welcomed.   Advancement is hard unless you have ""family and/or friends"" at the top.   Top level management not very diverse.  HR is not open door.  New managers are allowed to bring with them disgusting and degrading habits (I.e. sexual gestures and lewdness). --"
bad,"micro managing from executive level leads to mass inefficiencies."
bad,I don't have much to add here.  I worked in Medical-ICU.  We took care of a lot of sick people.  I answered phones and placed orders in the computer.
bad,You take a lot of calls and no recognition for that. Quality is way too picky and very stressful work environment.
bad,"I love the work I do, I like the people and there's always something to do. I hear from everybody I meet with the company that they like their job. everyone has it good, except for people in Medicare Advantage. Most of my coworkers dislike the stress and the pressure is so high the expectations are out of this world. Unless you're a medicare guru,this dept will eat you up and spit you out. Benefits are decent but parking sucks. good luck finding a reserved spot anywhere near the HQ without paying $200+ a month. Great opportunity but if you're looking for happiness, you wont find it here."
bad,". new supervisor very critical. no help from upper management or HR. much pressure to outperform. however, loved the people  I worked with and made several longtime friends"
bad,"The pay is a great way to reel you in because if the pay was less no one would stay. There is never a clear answer for questions that you will have. Everything is customer service's responsibility. Other departments drop the ball and it is up to you to figure it out, although you are the one who is being timed, you get a lot of training but its ALOT to remember, the co workers (if on a good team) will help you out but its frowned upon. They line that you call with questions, has some helpful people, but some that make you question if you learned anything. They talk down to you and make you feel so bad. The people who have stayed is not because they love their job, its because of the paycheck. Benefits are below average, deductible is HIGH although they do offer some help with it. Just beware. Its not great as it seems. Most new hires don't last past 2 years."
good,Salary is okay for customer service but advance opportunities are limited
good,"No opportunities for career advancement. It will take an average of 10 years of employment before reaching the mid point on the pay scale, regardless of your dedication and meeting/exceeding expectations. Plan to be pushed out the door at that point to make way for younger, less expensive employees. Educational opportunities for Case Managers have been eliminated. No cost reimbursement for continuing education, conferences, or seminars to maintain your professional license. CEO at Town Hall Meetings reminds employees that if you think it's better somewhere else, feel free to go there. In essence ""there is the door"".  There is a gym on site which if you have time to use, is great! The cafeteria offers nutritious meals. Co-workers are great!  Required to participate in Mutual Appreciation which is a program where you are ""encouraged"" to spend your money with Medical Mutual customers. It is part of your performance evaluation and you are hassled by your supervisor if you are not participating."
good,"Care management/Care Transitions department is a very difficult job. Department always short-staffed. Salaried position with no comp time. Typical training, in classroom, is 6 months."
good,worked there for 26 yrs and because of company out sourcing was cut thats all I have to say about this company no loyality to there older and loyal workers
good,Very busy.The most important thing I have learned is the in and outs of the medical field.More focus on the contracting world. The hardest part  of my job is working with sick people and not being able to give them the help when needed. The most enjoyable part is my coworkers.
good,The benefits are not great.  High Deductibles and premium.  Customers have better coverage than employees.  The pay is not comparable to amount of work.  They do not value employees that have worked in the company for a long time.  Want new employees at lower pay.
good,"Outstanding training program for Customer Service Representatives, but a lot of micro-management of the representatives. there was great camaraderie with co-workers, especially those who were 'seasoned' and willing to provide invaluable mentoring on the company, the policies, and procedures."
good,"Worked there 9 yrs.  In house and worked from home. Mostly my job was to process claims. For the most part management was good. Co-workers were"
good,"I liked my job, the training was good, could have used a better approach to follow up training. I'm glad I had this opportunity. It was hard to learn but paid off after awhile of experience."
good,Strictly managed for maximum efficiency. You can't use the bathroom without worrying if you're going to miss one of your time management goals. Too strict when it comes to work hours and there is no budging on what hours you will work.
good,"The IT department is largely a mainframe shop so don't expect to be dealing with bleeding edge technologies. Also, the management is set in their ways and isn't forward thinking."
good,"It's not a bad place to work and it's not too demanding.  The pay is little low, some good perks like health insurance, a free gym and a nice cafe to eat lunch. The management team is very weak and I'll leave it at that, training has also been cut to nothing so don't expect to learn anything in IT you don't already know or learn on your own."
good,"I do appreciate the hardship workforce Medical Mutual has. However, alot of the day to day production doesn't always make alot of sense. There is never the correct answer for anything."
good,"At Medical Mutual I learned that no matter how hard a position is, I overcame and passed the tests to become an Associate Claims Representative.  I passed and succeeded!"
good,Familiar with call center environment but healthcare was new. Training was intense but worth it and helped me move on in my career to the Broker side working with actual employers on a smaller service team.
good,"Medical Mutual is a great company to work for with emphasis on employees health, wellbeing and involvement in outreach activities . Casual work environment ."
good,"Medical Mutual is a decent place to work, solid employer, good benefits, nice people to work with and corporate office is located downtown close to public transportation and parking."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, but was bored and not challenged enough.  I felt there was no opportunity for advancement, but the staff was great and very helpful."
good,The most rewarding part of my job was helping patients.  A typical day at work would be processing of medical claims.
good,Good place to work.  Areas of solid leadership. Plenty of opportunities to learn new skills and cross train.  Strong focus on community and serving local establishments.
good,Great pay and benefits. Typical corporate hierarchy keeps the place running smooth and efficient. Not the place if an individual wants to feel like you are helping people but if you want to live well then MMOH is you spot.
good,"good company to work for but, wish I had an opportunity to return, lots of fun a lot employee perks, room for advancement as well, Mind your business."
good,This is a good place to intern at. Good people to connect with. The only problem I had during the summer I interned there was that my dept. manager didn't know what to do with her 2 interns. Her department was new to accepting interns.
good,"Excellent community based activities and employee based activities.  Great incentives for employees.  Fast paced, regimented workplace with lots of rules.  Great for those requiring structure."
good,"Good place to work and promotes within, fosters leadership and development of emerging leaders.  Great benefits, wellness incentives, parking is a bit difficult at times"
good,"Great company with great benefits, and cares about their employees. Great work sites , Medical Mutual cares about how their workers feel, which helps employees feel valued."
good,Good company to work for.  i just nned a possible career change
good,"Medical Mutual of Ohio..."
good,"The best perk is time off they provide, structured and micro managed daily, not a team atmosphere, customer service is priority, compensation is competitive"
good,an ok place to work  busy fast paced need to work at a near perfect level  plenty of training for your job.  management is flexible good working hours flex time available
good,"MMO is a decent place to work.  There are a lot of perks like a free gym, on-site cafeteria, etc.  Management is typical of a business this size.  I would recommend it to someone looking"
good,"It all depends on what department you work for. Some are more difficult, some have managers that are not well loved. My area is great and my manager is wonderful."
good,"Obviously it's been 19 years since I left there for another opportunity."
good,offers many in house technical and trade learning opportunities that are relevant to career opportunities that are available at this health insurance company.
good,I only worked here for 3 months (contract position during enrollment period) but the team was really helpful and nice to work with My supervisor was nice and flexible.
good,"Fast paced work environment, which I like.  There is something new that you learn quite often.  Other employees are pleasant to work with and everyone gets along well."
good,"Everything"
good,"I was hired as a contract nurse for the Care Coordination Dept and my time there was a very good experience.The Managers and Director of the dept were very personable and easy to approach with questions or concerns. The productivity expectations were reasonable. The other nurses in the area were very nice and knowledgeable. I got a lot of hugs and well wishes on my last day! The dress code allowing jeans and the large cafeteria menu made it very convenient. I wish I could have stayed on a permanent basis but there were changes in the company for Imaging authorizations (what I was hired to do)  and Medical Mutual does not hire LPN's for permanent positions. I keep checking their website for other possible non-nursing positions because I would love to return, however I can only speak for the Care Coordination Dept when giving my opinion."
good,"Medical Mutual has challenging roles that allow growth and movement within the organization. Headquarters is in a great location in downtown Cleveland (walking distance to restaurants, parking and sport arenas). This location also has a gym and cafeteria."
good,"You will be paid well, but look to work 50-60 hours a week for it.  Staffing is thin, so you are pulled in a lot of directions."
good,Learnt a lot from people who work here and scope of growth in one's career
good,"Answer anywhere between 40-60 calls between healthcare providers and members about benefits, eligibility and claims. Quote benefits for general services or run codes by CPT, HCFA and ICD-10, answer questions on claims and prior approvals. The work culture is more casual and relaxed with separate cubical s for privacy. the most enjoyable part of my job to me is helping the providers or members that I am helping out."
good,"Work was fast paced with short deadlines (in my department). Other departments did not always have an understanding of what co-workers in other areas were or were not responsible for, so a lot of time was wasted in trying to chase down answers to questions or problems. Also the Company did not seem to value a centralized historical record, so there was a lot of repetitive research. "
good,"Quickly respond to customer requests via telephone, which lead to customer loyalty and satisfaction."
good,Enjoyed working at Medical Mutual for the 7 years that I worked there.  This company had many wellness incentives to better health and brought that to not only their insured clients but the employee's as well.
good,Everyone is really friendly ans amazing.They really care about you and you career. Managers really care about your career development and genuinely try to help as much as possible even if it means helping you get a job somewhere else!
good,A typical day begins as most any other but the people I work with and the culture the employees embody make relatively mundane tasks a pleasure to do. Everyone works hard for the common goal of helping and making life better.
good,Very good place to work for.  I have learned a lot coming from a totally different background.  Healthcare industry is in high demand and I appreciate all that I have learned during my 13 years.
good,"Sorting mail"
good,Answer incoming calls from Dr. and members to verify medical benefits and coverage. Help solve claims concerns. I have learned so much about how my medical insurance can work for me. All of management is easy to talk with no matter the concerns. My coworkers and I work together to help each other with concerns about some of the calls.
good,"Responsible for providing outstanding service by phone, identifying and resolving inquiries customers have about their health insurance coverage or claims."
good,A enjoyable work place with diversity and room for advancement.  .
good,"One of the busiest underwriting departments I have ever worked for. Business often come at the expense of employee satisfaction which has eroded employee morale overtime. However, many employees tend to come and stay long enough to retire."
good,"Great place to work! No drama, no stress! Everyone did his or her jobs eith no worries. My supervisor and manager were great, you could always go to them with anything."
good,"I was an intern over the summer, and I recommend it to anyone considering applying. It was a great company that cared about their employees and encouraged their employees to practice healthy habits."
good,"My job entails working with HR representatives that carry health insurance through Medical Mutual. I solve claims issues, explain benefits and work closely with sales and marketing. The hardest part of my job is trying to resolve out of state claims as it involves many phone calls and is time consuming. I prefer to resolve issues immediately."
good,"Performed data entry skills, assisted with computer and equipment issues. "
good,"Love the experience, would love to stay need room for growth , work place typical 9-5"
good,Great place to work. Growth within the company is great. The company provides many learning opportunities and has a focus on healthy living. One of Ohio's top workplaces for many years.

good,I worked as a customer service representative and it was a fun learning culture but it was alot to learn in a short period of time. Very friendly work Atmosphere.
good,Management can be a bit childish and unprofessional when it come to disclosing colleagues personal business at the Beachwood location. Other than that good company.
good,Receive work via email. Work on coding benefits for new groups and old groups. Maybe assigned something as a priority and it must be completed within the time specified. Managers are knowledgeable and are concerned about the growth of their employee within the Benefit Service Department. My co-workers are great people who work well under deadlines and together. The hardest part of the job is waiting on information from another area within the company to complete your job. The benefits and the longevity I have acquired through the company
good,Fast paced environment. Always changes. Opportunity to advance and lot of free classes for personal growth. worked in both Medical and Dental claims. Always room for job advancement.
good,"The hardest part of the job, would be the irate people on the other end of the phone or the ones in your face. But to be able to reason with the people, keep your composure, and always be professional."
good,"The company cares about the fair treatment of it's employees, members, stock-holders and community. The pay is very good and the company has a great reputation in the state."
good,"Great advancement opportunities. Really good supervisors, the only thing to watch for is other workers trying to stab you in the back. Been here for 19 years."
good,Telephonic nursing in a cubicle setting. Multiple dept options with varying hours and schedules. Collaborative environment with cafeteria and gym on site.
good,"Medical Mutual of Ohio is a great place to work, the pay is a little low. Parking is a problem downtown and it is very costly.  But over all a great place to work."
good,"I have a lot of friends here. Very comfortable place to work!!"
good,I have worked for this company for the past 8 years. I have loved my time spent there but upon relocating to Georgia I found that the opportunity for growth was eliminated because our office here is really small. I am currently exploring other opportunities for career advancement.
good,"A typical day for me was gathering batches of work to process int the system, then would scan different types of claims for different systems. Train current and new co-workers on different projects.If one of my co-workers made mistakes on a claim and the manager or supervisor was not around they would come to me to fix the problem."
good,Very high pace and competitive work environment. Excellent benefits for the employees. Open door policy for upper and lower management and that is what I like the most about the company. The typical day could consist of processing claim or working reports or backing up another unit with the work load. The company has very strict policy on confidentiality(HIPPA Law).
good,"I enjoyed my time and people at Medical Mutual."
good,"Medical Mutual is a great place to work. Outside of your daily job functions, they have a work balance program. This includes a Health Awareness Program, a Fitness Center, there are always educational workshops to improve yourself. Topics like self-esteem, working as a team, how art therapy can improve yourself and several other workshops."
good,"With the changing face of healthcare reform, our industry has had its struggles over the last 5 years and will continue into the future.  I have been lucky to have been able to work with the same team for the last 15 years. The hardest part of the job is all the red tape and daily changes which can occur and explaining to clients and their employees the impact this has on their benefits."
good,"Productive and fast paced workplace, it was enjoyable , changes were happening which caused achang to work dynamics but as a company it provided growth for individuals."
good,"My experience is resoundingly positive!  Fair management practices.  The benefits are very competitive with health, dental, vision, etc. 401k.  All the bells and whistles"

good,"For the 17 years that I was there, I loved working with the people and learning new things that helped me grow with company. Being able to help others when they needed the help. They are a family, each department would help other departments if they need the help to keep production up within the company. Management are very helpful in whatever you need the help with. The co-workers are also very helpful, especially if you are new to the company and the department. I never found anything hard about what I did for the company or the department that I worked in. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping other people when they needed my help on anything,"
