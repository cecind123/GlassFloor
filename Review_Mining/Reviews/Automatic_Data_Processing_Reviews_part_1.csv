rating,review
bad,"Difficult work environment resulting from micro management at the Sr Leadership level. Front-line associates are pulled from fire to fire and direct Managers are expected to manage through Director/VP/GM decision making. Sr Leadership does not value feedback from Management staff. An interesting culture that is presented as 'new and unique' which involves free food and drinks frequently, simple employee recognition and quarterly Townhalls, all very common in a Contact-center work environment. Technology utilized by customers and employees is outdated and old, training concepts very outdated. Transparency is not made available outside of Sr. Leadership and accountability of office relationships swept under the rug between front line associates and the most Senior staff member."
bad,"Not on the same page with policy or procedure, high turnover with management which can cause an issue with reps not knowing where to go for the help and training is done virtually which should be done hands on."
bad,"I'm no longer there. There is no work life place. I would not recommend any employees to work here. Treated unfairly, never appreciated. Docked for being less than 7mins late but never appreciated for working 16hr days!"
bad,Terrible management. Totally empty office due to layoffs. Very overworked and unhappy coworkers. Extremely mismanaged. Extremely offensive behavior by coworkers is allowed by management.
bad,"Do Not go there interfering busy body will just dick you off!"
bad,"Avg Company for Employee to work, So much pain from management "
bad,"The quality of people that they let handle people’s medical insurance was scary, How this company is not sued into oblivion is amazing. globalist diversity culture, not merit based. How you can train someone 2 weeks and put them on the phone is careless and wreckless, many mistakes made on information on policies. If were the right persuasion you couldn’t make a 20 dollar cimplicity mistake and be let go and accused of not knowing how to operate a phone, while taking call after call after call. Meanwhile, right next to you, if you were the right persuasion you could get 6 extra days of phone training and still be sitting there doing enrollment and be awful and still be working there."
bad,The definition of a toxic environment. I lost 17 lbs in two months from working with a community of individuals who prefer passive aggressive communication instead of teamwork.
bad,I lost track of people who quit while I was there. Management played favorites and misogyny ran rampant. Everyone who came from the East Coast offices was given high priority regardless of performance. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"They bring new hires in everyday, a big turn over, they work you for a couple of years then tell you to kick rocks. They have their click, guess you have be in it."
bad,I love the job im doing because i love working with kids and i really do care about there safety. I only work with the kids before the kids go to school and after the kids get out of school
bad,"ADP is a tough place to work. Hours are long, and tremendous stress and pressure."
bad,"Started off great, then became a very toxic environment. Ended up leaving for a competitor. The pay was ok. But the leadership and culture was horrible."
bad,"You will spend all your time in internal work meetings, leaving little time to actually do your job. "
bad,"One of the most unorganized and difficult companies to work for.  Almost all the IT is outsourced, so you know what that means..."
bad,"Was hired as a contractor in the Agency Relations department. I made an honest mistake on an excel file which I apologized for & they fired me after just 2 days for being ""argumentative"" after asking for written directions."
bad,ADP used to be a nice place to work. Look out if you are 50 or older. They let go almost all of their older wise staff in favor of youngers who have no idea what they are doing and will take less money.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible company. My own manager encouraged me to quit-goes to show how terrible the company is although they preach a positive work environment."
bad,"ADP unfortunately has not been the same since the Pershing Square group issue. They really undervalue tenured employees. After 2yrs they will keep adding more work and less pay. Employees are stressed out and upper management are not good strategically. Couple that with  piece mill products that don't integrate and you have ADP. "
bad,"My time at ADP was surrounded by legacy leaders, out dated process, polices and sales. 4 years into a rebrand and still failing. It appears to be a great company until the first few weeks end."
bad,"Was working on ADP's HR portal and we were contractors. We were told they could only hire one guy to work with us as a developer in CT but that they were hiring 4 guys over in India since they were cheaper. The guys from India were hired Full Time. They were flown to Connecticut once or twice so we could get them up to speed on what we did so far and how we were coding the site. Then us contractors were laid off while the guys from India took over. Not having been able to find another job quickly enough my car was repossessed and I had to move out of the home I rented for 3 years into the living room of an ex girlfriend. I guess that is how contracts work, but it was frustrating knowing the guys in India were hired Full Time and they let us go thus causing a lot of financial hardships for me and my family."
bad,"The work environment was toxic, unprofessional and not safe. The manager lived in another state. He was physically and most times mentally not present."
bad,The culture that ADP portrayed that it was all about when they hired me was not followed through. The company is unorganized and doesn't have a reputation for longevity. Hiring from within is all about who you know and not necessarily about skill set. It is indeed a popularity contest. The job itself isn't bad but the management needs major improvement.
bad,"they will reduce your territory constantly to maximize their production while raising your quota.  "
bad,Worst job that I ever had. I had the worse managers I have had in my career. The Managers did not manage or provide guidance for any of the work performed.
bad,"Lots of changes from above that were not for the better and it seems all the other departments like mine are either overworked or understaffed, or both."
bad,"Something is not right at ADP. I would never recommend that anyone work for ADP. They claim that they are hiring new people to do away with an unwanted culture, when in fact, they are doing everything they can to keep perpetuating this horrible culture."
bad,"Are you an adventurous person?"
bad,"I don’t recommend this company"
bad,New department starting out with no plan or directions for work everyday. Required to get a license in which very little teaching is given for the testing.
bad,"Let me just say this... those at ADP should be in prison rather than doing their work. This company has no morals. So if that is what you're are all about, ADP can be a good fit."
bad,"I was a Major Accounts DM.  Between constant confusion of what you're selling and what you actually know how to sell and the simple fact that ADP incentivizes their implementation and service teams to work with the client as little as possible, you probably should not work here."
bad,Leadership has little influence on supporting front line sales reps. Leadership has an avg of less than 2 years and sales reps are on about 6 months. They rather hire new reps than to build up existing ones. Turn and burn sales culture with no career longevity.
bad,This used to be a great company and I mean a absolutely great company. But eveything changed.....They don't care about their customers or their employees.  They over work their employees making it impossible to even minimally service their customers.  Promotions are not earned by what you know or high performance but by who you know and how low you go. Don't take the lower starting salary to get your foot in the door on promises of advancement unless you are okay with looking at yourself in the mirror everyday after giving up your integrity.
bad,"There should also have negative stars. Worst place to work."
bad,"This is a company that will use you until you are all used up. No matter how hard that you work, No safe guard for their employees. Still don't know why they are still in business"
bad,"Adp is no hard work, but u will work hard. U should drink plenty of water, because there’s no AC. I think that the workers are not paid enough for the work that they produce."
bad,"You will meet some of the best people ever at ADP; however, there is so little relevant training and organization you will want to die. The training is extremely out dated that you will not be able to properly perform your job duties, whatever they are considered to be because they aren't clearly stated in the job description.  Also you will have little to no support from the new hire coaches. The pay isn't worth the amount of stress that you will encounter. FYI you're basically a computer programmer who won't be getting paid the worth of a computer programmer. They will lead you with false expectations. Do some deep research and investigating."
bad,"Very verbally abusive to their employees. Zero work/life balance. Employees are unappreciated and overall a horrible environment. If you are innovative and would like to standout this isn't the place for you because it's the ""ADP way."" This company won't survive long if they continue to use old technologies and old processes."
bad,ADP likes to silo the employees and drive them into the ground.  Management is very hands off and only like to get involved when the clients escalate issues.  Many issues could be prevented by properly resourcing your teams and listening to the people doing the work.
bad,Poor leadership and culture- cared more about numbers than people.  Did not foster an environment of collaboration rather competition.  Would not recommend.
bad,The place is too big for any contribution that I make to matter.  The call center environment is not conducive to thoughtful payroll processing and support.  It is impossible to find a resource when you need assistance.
bad,"Hired 6 months ago, lay offs just announced while they move the call center out of the country. Zero work/life balance."
bad,Worst place to work management is horrible they do not treat employees fairly nor pay them for the types of jobs they have fairly. They care about making scrape units instead of quaility units for our customers. Overly worked and under paid for the type of production that’s coming off the lines. Not enough raises but management is making their bonus
bad,ADP has lost its way. They no longer value their employees. They can't be trusted. Leadership has no idea what it is doing and the employees pay the price with layoffs and overloaded work plates. They have systematically gotten rid of all the senior people with high salaries and in doing so the people with all the experience and knowledge. Leadership doesn't understated it takes at least 5 years to become proficient and they refuse to listen when they are told. They think they can just hire off the street and have someone up and running in 10 months - they have to know 35 tools and products. There is no time to take vacation. They just laid off and demoted people who didn't deserve it and kept useless screw ups that know how to manage up. But leadership will still get their hefty bonuses. Stay away.
bad,"U literary have to guess how to do the job. Managers are so suspicious of your every move, yet they don't know the job."
bad,"Over worked and understaffed.  Very VERY poor training.  This place is so bad, even the managers quit after a while.  The expectation is that you will stay well after quitting time EVERY DAY if a client has an issue.  No work/life balance."
bad,"the company does not care for their employees, they let people go for no reason, when employees do an amazing job they ever get recognized for their job"
bad,"Very regimented and unduly harsh on absences even when validated by a doctor's writeup."
bad,"I did not like this job at all. It paid 15 dollars an hour, which this the same amount many fast food establishments are paying for workers . I only took it as a stop gap to find a better opportunity."
bad,"ADP provides good training, if you are looking to gain basic sales experience and knowledge in payroll. However, this definitely is not a job for everyone. This a good job, if you are fresh out of school, and desperate for a job. It is a young culture and there is a lot of turn over. Boss will micromanage you, you cannot be 5 mins late but the management will expect that you work after hours. It is all about sales numbers and highest dials that you can make, expect at least 100 per day, that it will make you feel like you are working for a call centre. There is no work life balance. If you have a doctor’s appointment - don’t expect to go during work hours because they will tell you to do it during your personal time which is the weekend (and you are lucky if your doctor is even open on the weekend). Do you enjoy taking vacations? Even though you start with 3-weeks, they prefer that you break them up during the year (good luck trying to take a week off). The interview process is long, ADP will tell you that there is a lot of opportunities for growth but really, it’s because there is a lot of turn over. That should be the first red flag. During my time at ADP, most people left the company in less than a year looking for better opportunities."
bad,Terrible place to work. Good people but the worst management. Incompetent and no communication. No advancement unless they like you . Stay away! Everyone’s miserable
bad,Not a good experience.  Would not recommend working at this company at this time.  Currently changing operations to meet the needs of company and not considering clients.
bad,"Never have I experienced such terrible leadership (or the lack there of).  ADP was not a place conducive to external candidates being successful.  There was no training as well as no patience.  Leadership was inconsistent...making demands on employees and later denying said demands.  Unreasonable expectations...There was no support for frontline management.  If an employee ran with a story there was no meeting with all three parties, but merely a raking over the coals by leadership."
bad,"My manager was very supportive, however upper management was not aware of the cutthroat actions occurring behind the scenes. I was rank number 1 for the past 4 years but yet I was laid off by ADP."
bad,"ADP Senior Management is untrustworthy. No support from local HR regarding escalated associate issues. Corporate HR really needs to do a deep dive in relations to the daily operations. Associates are constantly resigning, No career advancement. Performance management is the ""sole tool"" used to force tenured associates out. ADP is definitely not the ""employer of choice"" anymore. Its really sad how such a dynamic company once upon time has transformed into a sunken place to work. Get it right ADP before it's too late. Manage out the incompetent insecure senior  management who is running the daily ops. The competition is too great in the market. Your brand is not what it was 45 yrs ago. GOOD-LUCK you will need it !"
bad,"Do not recommend, apply at your own risk. You are over worked and you get reprimanded if you work too much; it is hard not to work too much since they give you work of 10 associates."
bad,When trying to get help they never had an answer to any of my questions. You would call and it would take them about 2 hours to call you back without a solution to your problem.
bad,"Poor workplace environment. Very cut-throat, figure it out for yourself. Often times felt like slave labor, and you will never appreciated. Sketchy workplace and untrustworthy coworkers. Many different styles of management- thus influence on your given territory which then correlates to associates success. Some people are handed success on a silver plater while others are forced to fail. Political."
bad,Biased management. Very unprofessional with how minorities are dealt with and treated. Would definitely not recommend anyone else to seek employment there.
bad,This was not the job I expected.  Originally this was a great role and the responsibilities were to maintain uptime and escalate as needed.  The company began moving resources to Atlanta and the role disintegrated to the extent that my job was reduced to insignificance.
bad,"Perhaps ADP has improved since I worked there, but at the Salt Lake City location, several managers in the Health & Welfare department were completely toxic. I spent just about as much time doing busy work and trying to cover my butt as I did working on real issues."
bad,"the associates were great,  great buildings, great cafeteria, alot of parking, my work space was fine, good coffee areas, this is all that I have to say"
bad,I did not have a good experience at ADP.  Perhaps good place for others .  My particular experience was very negative.  My manager was terrible.  It was bad.
bad,"It is a dreadful place to work when managers are set against you, it is uncomfortable. you are just a numbr here to produce so be ready to hit numbers"
bad,Worked for this company for 9 years. Gave 110%. Then they outsourced all jobs to india and layed off 90% of us reps after we had to train them to do our jobs
bad,"The Culture is poor, The employees are miserable and are walking on eggshells, so many just keep to themselves. The political climate is intolerable. The salary offered does not equate the negative work environment one must walk into every day."
bad,"Reported to the Legal Director of this global organisation and market leader, with headquarters in the US providing outsourced payroll and human resources services."
bad,"it probably is a good company overall and I did work with some great people.  My manager was highly political and showed very little interest in training me for my position it became obvious that he knew very little himself, besides the process and politics.  He constantly made excuses not to travel due to the fact that he was so grossly overweight it made travel uncomfortable or too expensive as he would need at least 2 seats if not 3!!!! From the way he spoke he knew a lot but he was just glorified paper pusher.  Too many layers and different depts to work thru to be efficient"
bad,"This was a Temp job very boring and very stressful, temps in different areas were treated different ways. One job very laid back and others very strict."
bad,"It was just a paycheck. the manager of the department had no idea what his people did. If they didn't like you which was the case, the had you doing all the work."
bad,Very cut and dry.  No room for opinions or suggestions on how to improve processes and procedures.  Limited room for professional growth.  Staff not always approachable.
bad,ADP was a great start to whatever sales career you want to achieve.  Many employers look for people with ADP background because of the grind and type of cutthroat sales job it is.  Not to mention the meager pay of their sales people.
bad,"The training is very important when it come to a company's success, their training is horrible and the management is  bad and what an ugly experience."
bad,"I learned nothing at this job. I was a temp in the distribution department. Plenty of backstabbing. No set hours. If you have a life, you wouldn't like it."
bad,I have not worked for this company in over 17 years. The typical day was answering incoming calls and entering the clients daily sales into our database.
bad,"Everything here is bad.  Advancement, pay, workers, everything,  Dont work here.  Find something else.  You are better off if you do.  Believe me, it will save you the headache,"
bad,"this company is not a good place to work . The training is for three months and when you hit the floor it takes you about three years to fully understand the job. Management is not helpful only reps know what they are doing so do not expect any help from management. You are supposed to get a raise after a year but have to take a test to get the raise which is not even a dollar. Its extremely to much work for not enough pay. Oh and soon as you are done with training you get no support while in nesting. They put you in a chat with about 70 other reps who are waiting to get help and they have a help line that will tell you all service reps are busy please call again later all while still having a client on the phone, so you are on hold or in a chat for 30 minutes before getting help and then you have to go back to the client who is upset because of the long wait and apologize because they do not have enough techs for support reps."
bad,"Eight veterans started in a training class and not one was offered a full time job with ADP.  Training seems to be thorough but when you get to the floor it is everyone for themselves, not a team atmosphere. Definitely not for former military use to working together.  The jobs layout as representative but seem to be more project manager level. Very poor pay."
bad,Omg i don't know what to say about ADP. The management was shocking. They spoke and treated you like your nothing. Worse place to work for. People I worked with were great though
bad,The growth is really slow and you do not havd more opportunities. But a good place to work if you are looking for a stable environment with good people and fun.
bad,"Management is horrible. They brush concerns to the side, unless you are a white woman. Sexism and racism is the culture here. "
bad,"Received $1 raise in 3 years."
bad,l'entreprise est fermée depuis plus d'un an  ...............
bad,"This is a big company culture that fancies itself as operating like a small company. Yeah, no. That isn't happening here. Barely disguised used car dealership. Perhaps I just got a bad manager, but I doubt it. Some good people there, but also some ones you should really watch. Bad culture. Poor work/life balance. I was yelled at on my first week to set more meetings. Then yelled at to get on the phones. Then yelled at for being on the phones too much. get out on the road. Then get back on the phones. Ugh.. you get the message. Avoid."
bad,"I worked for Kelly service a temp agency and I really have nothing to say about ADP at this time. Therefore, as a temporary contracted associate, I don't feel its appropriate at this time for me to write any review."
bad,The hardest part of the job is all the math. I learned a lot but didn't enjoy working there. Co workers were fine but the  job just wasn't for me.
bad,Adp has a great training environment to give employees a understanding in working in computer database if you don't have a IT background.
bad,"Fun & Productive place to work, Many amazing coworkers. Heavy phones.High customer work. I have learned to handle many hot issues the client is always right."
bad,I enjoy working in a team environment that is challenging and rewarding.  It is important that each person on the team is committed to the work at hand but can stop to have a little fun as well.
bad,"Just worried about numbers, and not about you as a person. Never felt like there was much opportunity to move jobs. Couldn't handle showing up to work when they didn't care about you."
bad,"Great Benefits & Training."
bad,Worked as an contractor for 6 months. Being a contractor u are treated like a red headed step child. Management was nasty. They barely helped when you ask them questions. And when you do go to them they act like ur bothering them. All of my stats were good and still no type of advancement. I would not recommend to anyone. I'm not sure how the other sites are but in the Augusta building for national accounts is terrible.The job it self was not that bad just the people in management. I never wanted to be there!
bad,"upper management are dictators not leaders. they resort to continued harassment, bulling and emotional abuse."
bad,"ils ne valident pas les contrat signés"
bad,This was a temporary job assignment which was 3 months long.
bad,"ADP-Dealer Services has lost most of it's tenured, and quality workers due to low merits (1%), and lack of promotions. They have lost 4 employees with less than a year of employment and 12 and counting with tenure. There is no work life balance and management does not listen to the needs of the associates. Numbers are adjusted to the needs of management and audits are a nightmare. This is not a career move, but due to the mass exodus your position will be secure."
bad,Management is horrible and very stressful place to work. Pay is okay
bad,Answered varies calls daily. I learned about the tax credit program. Management was fair. My co-workers were very helpful in training. The hardest part was getting to the phones at the end of the day because calls kept coming in. The best part was knowing we helped companies receive tax credits.
bad,Worse job I have ever had... no security. Too much pressure!
bad,The task is to sell Managed Services for Payroll and Statutory Compliance Services.
bad,Was responsiable for all production generated daily. Responsiable for 50+ associates (at times this number exceeded 100+). Reviewed equipment specs for future purchases. Met with various department heads in strategy meetings for on-going projects. Managered all reporting lines and administrated to all HR needs.
bad,"I worked for the company when it was SHPS, Inc., so my review is based on my work history with SHPS, Inc., as a Client Service Manager. Pay & benefits are OK, could be much better, work life balance doesn't exist & management thinks it is great idea to manage by FEAR. Pay increases hadn't taken place for three years, IT is a joke, instead of each department working together for the good of the clients, company, etc., the departments work AGAINST each other, there is no thought process given to the clients needs, if you don't ask, you don't get it & everything falls on the head of the CSM, if finance messed up, it falls on the CSM because we were suppose to be their ""watchers."" They have the most obsurb motto, ""trust but verify."" Management is not educated, they pretty much just worked their way up from a previous position and it is all about who likes you on if you will get promoted, regardless of your work ethic. RUN, save yourself, find something where you're valued, with friendly culture, diversity & inclusion."
bad,Initially you will feel good for about 20 months then you require a job rotation which does not happen in ADP.
bad,The job stressful and you have no benefits. You are on your feet the whole time you are at work for at least 6 to 7 hrs.
bad,This faceless corporation cares nothing for it's employees and takes advantage of them by having them do things outside their job desciption for no additional pay.
bad,"I worked at ADP as a temporary employee for about six months.  They are very hierarchial and do not give the impression that they actually want temps working for them. I was excited at first to get an opportunity to work there, my thoughts were very different when I left the company."
bad,"They have a very stressful work place, so much politics from the HR Department.  They are not friendly, so hard to request from them.  Their department is not accommodating and approachable."
bad,Hopeless company.. Tooo much buttering is required to apply to your seniors. Hardworking & sincere employees don't have any value in the company.. Management will ruin your efforts just to get their spoons up... Idotic & 3rd graded company i have ever worked with...
bad,Management does not understand the products and feel threatened by experienced employees. The decision to push out people with seniority has greatly hurt the company. It is a very cut throat environment where people are more concerned with career success ahead of company success. This company  does have great name recognition but sadly it does not have excellent products to back it up. This is no longer a good place to work.
bad,"Manager frequently out sick. Unqualified BFF fills in and if you don't accept the unprofessional , abusive behavior ; they will circulate, creating animosity toward you throughout the office clique , particularly with said manager. Good luck getting fair and equitable treatment after that, it will then be passive aggressive.  One manager barely speaks to anyone not of their culture. Training is disorganized and inadequate. Pay and benefits could be better. Poor work / life balance. Yeah, they have a cafeteria but good luck getting food & having time to eat with only a 30 minute lunch break. There's also an onsite Dr but again, good luck getting time to see her during limited office hours. Would not recommend. Fortunately there are other jobs out there."
bad,"Don't fall for the lies the recruiter will promise you. This place is horrible and crumbling. Your teammates will turnover and clients will be angry. No one responds to clients, managers make excuses for why their workers don't respond (they have too many clients, they are too busy, etc...) never have I worked somewhere where mediocrity was rewarded and hard work was frowned down upon. It's more important that people like you than your quality of work. If you want to constantly thank people for responding to an email 6 days later this is the place for you. If you like following up repeatedly to get a response from another department, this place is for you. You may constantly be harassed by your manager, bullied, talked down to due to their own insecurities of being unqualified to lead a team. You will be micromanaged and treated like a child. It will be the worst decision of your career. As appealing as the recruiter makes it sound, it is fluff, and they are in sales just remember that. Look elsewhere at a more respectable company."
bad,"it not a good place to work anymore it used to nothing more to say"
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone , a company that big that does layoffs."
bad,"Working at ADP was the worst ever had in my last 20 years of working at the IT related organization, "
bad,"It WAS a good place to work before 2016, not so good now.. California (Pleasanton) offices lots of layoffs.. I'd look somewhere else if I were you.. someplace stable.."
bad,"Worked as a contractor on phones processing benefits and then payroll.  Very stressful as often there was no one to assist with issues.  Often responded ""canned answers"" to questions that I didn't have the training provided to answer the questions.  However I did enjoy most of my co-workers and the relaxed dress code was nice."
bad,"As an HRBP I was consistently put in situations where I had irate customers who were not receiving the services that they were paying for. The position is more Account Management than HR and the HRBP is always dumped upon to ""save the day"" when anyone drops the ball."
bad,"The go forward today will not be same in a couple of days. You never know what is the focus and plan."
bad,"Management is terrible, don’t conduct themselves as such. On boarding is very unorganized, you yourself will be crawling under your desk putting equipment together, on the phone trying to get your log in situated. No supplies given to you, just a terrible unprofessional place to work, with a high level of turnover."
bad,"This job and the training does not prepare you for this position.  Management does not take responsibility and this department only see numbers not the person. When you are interviewed with another department within the company, they make you use your vacation time."
bad,"ADP isn't as advertised. At first, the company appears to be for a great work/life balance and diversity and about the employees. They even say, ""Don't worry about retaining anything right away because it takes two years to be good"". However, once training and the course is complete, they expect you to work longer than normal hours from either the office or home. There wasn't a single manager of colour in the Halifax office. They pressure you not to make a single mistake and when you do, the management abandons you or begins to micromanage you. They claim to start you off at 38000 per year, but by the time you put in the overtime, you will be lucky if you are making 30000. The bonus system seems to be based more on popularity and what you did for your manager. "
bad,"Upon accepting the opportunity, I was not aware of the poor reputation ADP had for lack of work-life balance. While there are great people within the company, I learned many of those people leave due to poor management. There are far too many employees overworked, underpaid, and left feeling like just a number in the company rather than valued associate. ADP also hires management lacking the experience and/or knowledge which makes it more challenging on top of the lack of overall training some divisions provide. "
bad,"Very Bad management, nepotism is rampant in the mgmt and senior mgmt level and the Executive team is disconnected and delusional most of the time. Office environment is highly disruptive as Engineers are made to sit with Customer service Reps and it is very hard to concentrate with all the Constant phone conversations going on."
bad,"Managers encouraged bad practices and unethical decision making in order to make sales numbers. They do not care about your seat in the company and will treat you as disposable the second you question authority. No team environment whatsoever, they encourage cannibalistic nature of sales territories to increase sales numbers. I became tired of fielding calls from clients complaining how bad our company customer service was..."
bad,"Not a typical MNC, there's a lot of bickering and management looks up to only those who are close. Not a fine place to learn, everything is old and technologies are legacy. The primary business is BPO, so those trying a shot at BPO industry is best suited and not for technology enthusiasts"
bad,"My experience at ADP Pleasanton was that it is a corporation on a downwind spiral. Companies are using computer based payroll and not using companies such as ADP. During the course of the year they bring thousands of prospective candidates only to be dismissed. "
bad,There is no support or work life balance. I did not enjoy my time here but did enjoy the people that I worked with. I would not want to go back there unless they paid me alot of money.
bad,I was thankful for some of the professional relationships that I gained.
bad,Company will turn its back on you in a heartbeat....won't think twice
bad,If you want no life and lack of respect from 24 year old managers with no experience handling people work here! You can get paid well though if you sell. You will make great friends with fellow reps because they are all going through the grind as well. But overall you will be unhappy. In my one year working there half the office quit. Roughly 30/60 people.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Frat house. Don’t expect much advancement or support of advancement, especially if you’re a female. Only three good managers/vp out of the entire building that try and help. They lie and are in it for themselves."
bad,"No Remote options, work life balance is non existent, bonus structure is pathetic, and workload is massive. Management is only about the client, caring about employee mental health and personal well-being isn't there. If you take time off, it takes weeks to catch up, often feel bad when submitting pto/sick leave."
bad,Comete assédio moral com regularidade e pune funcionários que denunciam
bad,This company sucks. Mangement is horrible. No one knows what they are doing.  I can't believe company's trust them to process payroll and benefits. There is no training or guidance at all. If you do something wrong you will be at fault regardless if you were told how to do the process. Hr is a joke. Told my boss boss I was not comfortable and she went and told him. Work was weird after that. It's like these 60 year plus people are back in high school.
bad,Very sales driven with very little guidance. You are expected to maintain metrics that are not accurately based on your opportunity. Management will leave you out to dry
bad,"I was let go by biased managers, one of which bullied me. I was fired for that reason but Kelly services said it was due to attendance. However I had never called in unlike coworkers who did not show up and were no call no shows all the time and were still asked if they wanted their job. The team is biased, the supervisors  are bullies and they do not care about employees."
bad,Work/life balance is bad. ADP always comes first. you may think they care but unless you are in a click you don't exist. Benefits are good and mainly the only reason to stay.
bad,"ADP Norfolk has the potential to be an awesome place to work.  "
bad,"The focus is on making money, not on the clients or the employees. Management does not listen to employees at all and actually goes out of their way to make it an uncomfortable work environment. People are told they are not valued or get in trouble for spending too much time trying to help clients, but if you're not available at a moments notice you're in trouble for that. I'm not sure what the end game is, but service or being a good employer are no longer part of the play book."
bad,In the twelve months that I was with ADP I went through 6 managers. They couldn't keep anyone. The major account sales division that I worked in effectively had 260% turnover.
bad,"ADP was much more of a technical job than I anticipated. Having extensive knowledge with it is paramount in having a successful career here. "
bad,"As a PSS its very stressful. You have managers and Team Leads in place who does not know the job or what to do. The training is horrible and everyday there are changes. IT IS A CALL CENTER don't let anyone tell you differently.You will have 10-13 clients who can have 1000 employees per client. You are the clients HR, Payroll, Benefits, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Accountant, Technology Assistant and best practice advisor. The managers have cliques but the new powers of be don't care about the employees just the numbers and you staying on the phones all day while being dedicated to 10-13 clients. Policies and procedures the Norfolk office was never told. Actually people are sitting in positions they did not apply for. It's an absolute hot mess. Looking on the outside ADP looks awesome, cafeteria, gym, Starbucks but the stress they put you under is not worth it. It is your funeral if you choose to work there. It was absolutely the worst place ever."
bad,"Advise not join firm  , as the growth is really a hurdle  . Learning  curve is so weak  and would remain stagnant for long period of time . Management is  not supportive  in order to   reach your desired destination."
bad,"Management did minimal training, less support, and had no sympathy when requests for additional training were given. Additionally, the team culture was cut-throat and riddled with sabotage against anyone the Team Lead felt was a threat to her."
bad,"The management team does not encourage independent thinking unless aligned with the personal view points of upper management.  Employees are not promoted on merit, but on management affiliations."
bad,"Do not fall for the trap you will cold call everyday all day from dead lists.  They tell you that you need to get 15 appointments to become a Associate District Manager, which is not true.  I set 17 within 5 week and was told I have 6 to 8 weeks to complete the task.  Week six they let me go and said they do not need an additional ADM.  They went ahead and handed all my appointments off to the reps and let me go.  Waste of time and extremely unethical.  SIde note I worked with 5 other Sales Apprentices and they did the same thing to them and gave them the same speech 6 weeks into their process and to validate the information we all kept in touch with each other."
bad,"If you love partnering with a team, having diversity in your leadership, having opportunities for fair advancement, growth both personally and professionally, then ADP is NOT for you!  Run VERY FAR AWAY from this company if anything I mentioned is what you are looking for.  This culture may have worked in the 1960's, but it's a horrible place to work now."
bad,"There is a lack of talent in senior leadership. The environment is more led by fear than by engagement.  It is a shame.  Although the company grew quickly, ADP was just not ready for the growth."
bad,"The job itself was cake. It was the lack of support for the employees who are 'contractors' (temporary) which was the difficulty. 'Associates' (regular F/T workers) are afforded MUCH more leniency and are looked at as if they are the only ones with brains/competency. The people with whom I worked, were friendly and helpful. The management staff were only there to tell you when you did something wrong or to tell you that you weren't eligible for something because you weren't an associate."
bad,This company will draw you in with the pay the health insurance is too expensive. Micromaged and there isn't such thing as write up its instant termination
bad,"I was so excited to start working at ADP.  When I started I was very scared as I had never been in this type of environment.  They tried to make people fit in instead of helping you fit in.  I'm not comfortable speaking in front of large groups of people, they didn't care they force you to do it.  I almost passed out a few times because I got so nervous.  I even called in to avoid going to the stupid kumbaya meeting.  You don't learn what your job is or how to perform it due to the lack of training in the correct areas.  Too many meetings that interrupt important training on your actual duties.  It's just a stupid disorganized mess and I regret giving up my perfectly good job to join such an organization!!!!!!"
bad,"By far the worst place I have worked! Management is a joke and unless you are on the ""likeable"" list they will make life unbearable and senior leadership does nothing about it. ADP cares....does not exist...at least not in the Norfolk location. That place needs a serious management makeover. Those people don't have a clue as to what they are doing. Not sure if it's nepotism or what but those managers really need to take a class. People are so quick to throw you under the bus and step on you to get ahead. Management does not care unless it benefits them and have no integrity."
bad,All for the company.  Seasoned employees said it used to be a great place to work.  Culture has changed - company is only interested in what the employee can do for them.  Nothing reciprocated.
bad,"ADP uses people on a temp ( contracted bases ) they guarantee 3 year contracts and at any point and time the contract can change and lay off a ton of people. My manager was nice, just the way they do things are wrong."
bad,Empresa que nao respeita o funcionario... gerencia de conflito e opressao
bad,"Its a job secured place but, nothing is challenging. Management is not ready to accept the change and continue to work with age old solutions."
bad,"La peor empresa en que trabaje."
bad,Horrible place to work for. Bad attitudes. A dread to go to work. Think my boss was bi-polar. She needed meds. And HR was no help whats so ever. I lived in constant fear.
bad,"This company does not care about its employees. Being forced to work around the clock with minimal sleep is unacceptable. If you do not have a family and don't mind working 24/7, then this is the place for you. The management team is clueless when it comes to managing employees especially when they have more than one client."
bad,Manager in my area not available. Extremely boring position looking up persons on the internet for criminal activites. Must look up 500 min. persons daily from nationwide data base. Restrooms far away from your area.
bad,Job Security is ther but  No a grate place to work salary is less benefits or no there pramotion will happen late cheep politics
bad,"Employees have work blinders on most of the time due to deadlines and work overload; non-friendly; stressful nail-biting envrironment.  Every group, division and manager has different rules...no consistency.   Recently spun off from ADP and changed their name from Cobalt to CDK Global, lots of ambiguity!"
bad,"When I started working for ADP, I was so happy and proud to be working for them.  However, the management style under the current CEO has become completely disconnected from the reality of the business.  Product development is completely disjointed, and run by mangers who do not seem to be properly skilled.  The company seems to care more about profits and stock prices then they do about customers or employees.  The expectation is to work 12 - 14 hour days and the lay offs occur twice a year without any notice.  Excessive off shoring makes it really hard to deliver quality product."
bad,"There is no work/life balance. The pay is decent but not when you consider all that is expected of you. They really do expect you to do the job of 3 people and just accept that. "
bad,Very conservative company with a turn and burn mentality. Management is insecure and don't allow employees many freedoms
bad,"Was an ideal job at first as far as hours and days worked, as a mother I needed to work around my childrens' school schedules, management changes brought about too many changes as far as working mothers and college students balancing hours and days, part time employees were forced to work full time"
bad,"A typical day included phone blitzing via lists or referrals from partnered DM's in the payroll dept, gathering information from clients to provide quotes,contacting clients to present the proposals and close the sale. It is expected to do at least 80 calls per day, and a minimum of 4 hours of talk time, plus handling all of your paperwork and making the metrics. Outbound call center, no dialers. The hardest part of the job is that management is under-trained for the job and industry that they were promoted into. Management is always in meeting or away at luncheons and not available for questions."
bad,"If you're desperate for a job, then go ahead, but keep your eye out for a better company. In spite of its rhetoric, ADP cares only about the bottom line. ""Associates"" (as they call their employees) are the least important asset. Comes panic time every February. That's when the layoffs start."
bad,"The boss has favourites. The coworkers are all in a clique and if one doesn't like you then no one likes you. And if you can't handle being condescending, passive aggressive behavior from your coworkers then this isn't the job for you. There were a couple of people that had me stick around but then the boss I liked got fired, the front desk secretary got fired, and the people i came in with got trained for higher positions when I was doing better than them."
bad,"Upon first starting as a MAS CDM, I was quite excited. I was doing pretty well at first. Actually, I was doing great, meeting quotas, etc. I would even say I was a top performer. There were various red flags I should have realized but I was somewhat blind sided with having an overall positive attitude. All of my co-workers were actually in true misery. This is a corrupt and political place to work. Please run while you can. Now I know that other business units may operate differently so I will still give ADP as a whole the benefit of the doubt on that aspect. Upper leadership had a negative and demanding attitude toward the entry level positions. If you basically did not agree with or suck up to our VP, you were shunned. So by being a morale, ethical and normal human, you were shunned. The leadership only knows how to lead with fear and intimidation. Nothing else. People that were favored were always given special opportunities. If you were doing something incorrect you were not pulled aside (like a normal company) with your boss to have a conversation on how to work on the issue. Instead you were publicly embarrassed on why you were wrong. However, you were never truly taught (on said issue) anything to begin with. We were lied to on so many occasions such a on break policies, commission pay and retro pay. Which is a true disgrace. How a company can disrespect a person’s time and salary is beyond me. They should be ashamed. I am unsure how this is even ethical. The leaders here publicly reprimanded and embarrassed you whenever they pleased. We were yelled at and talked down"
bad,Has gotten worst every year. ADP runs a sweat shop. They make all these promises and nothing changes. You will be promoted to an Account manager with no pay increase and your title will not reflect account manager anywhere in the company because it doesn't exist. ADP simply does not want to pay the salary for account managers. Lay off are happening and job security is non-existent.
bad,"I worked at ADP Norfolk for two years. I was one of the first 80 people hired in the building. It is all smoke and mirrors and telling you what you want to hear. Once you get in the position it is nothing that it was described as. It is a true call center, which became more and more focused on metrics as time went on. There is no transparency from"
bad,"San Dimas is neglected and a dark cloud seems to be over it. Constant threat of layoffs especially if you are over 40 with 10+ years experience. Expediency is valued over quality. Employees are thrown into position with little and ineffective training. Oppressive, stressful, mandatory overtime."
bad,Horrible management. Training was ok. Management basically picks out the weakest and does everything in their power to find a reason to fire them. They will fire you for anything with no explanation.
bad,"Basically you sell terrible service here.  The sales training is good, the people are generally good, the product is marginal, the concept is on par, the service and implementation are where it all falls apart."
bad,"Empresa americana, porém no Brasil age com mentalidade de empresa de médio porte. Não investe em produtos e nem nos profissionais."
bad,"Disjointed and dysfunctional leadership team.  All about driving net operating income to the bottom line.  You're just a number and if highly compensated, at risk. Stay away!"
bad,They don't follow their mission! There leadership was terrible. They micromanaged everyone. At the end of the new year we were stuck with the same 18 accounts to sell into. We were not given any new accounts so the second year was horrible.
bad,"ADP does not care about you as an individual, they only care about the sales you generate.  I was not done with a training program and I was getting hammered on sales numbers based on a non-existent quota.  VP's freak out about sales numbers almost weekly, even when the team is doing well.  Very tactical job-if you like to ""smile and dial"" this is the job for you.  Cold calling is part of daily life and you live and die by SalesForce while trying to fend off your accounts from your co-workers.  "
bad,"Toxic company looking to poach recent university graduates and sucker them into a ""secure"" job with several benefits. Not shabby if you enjoy working in an over glorified call center (at least at a real call center you can wear regular clothes). Absolutely immoral and disgusting working conditions where you will be treated as another cog in their corporate machine to squeeze every last ounce of energy out of you because "" We didn't expect this much call volume and we need you to work mandatory overtime.."" No such thing as a ""work-life balance"" in this company."
bad,"I worked for ADP for a year as a contractor and for 4 years as a permanent associate. As a contractor it was very stressful and fast-paced but once hired on as a permanent associate it seemed to slow down and become more like a family than a job. I would definitely recommend working here.  There are tons of opportunities for advancement and as long as you adhere to the attendance policy and keep your numbers up (low hold time, quality scores, average talk time, etc.) they will help you advance your career any way you wish it to go!"
bad,"Like most companies if there are more experienced employees it is a matter of who you know and not what you know.  It seemed that the more education an individual had the less opportunities there were, at least in my office."
bad,I've never encountered a company that was so bad at performing the functions that it sold to other companies. Toxic culture. Very limited upward mobility unless you're on the inside.
bad,"The company hired us promising new roles and promotions. After 6 months, the laid off 80% of us. They did nothing but lie to us and had no idea what was going on at any given moment. It was a circus."
bad,"Someone said it best ""People don't leave good jobs-they leave bad managers"". I believe if the culture of the COS department would change by respecting their employee's more - it would be a great department to work in. Employee's have no voice and its very difficult to transfer to another department."
bad,"It is not a friendly place to work at. My experience was not good.  They only care about numbers and not about their employees, although at the beginning they make you feel otherwise.  There is a lot of pressure, but if you like to please people then you may have an easier time moving up.  It is a dog-eat-dog environment.They also make a lot of mistakes on clients' accounts and they leave it all up to the representative who catches the error to fix it.  Reps take all the abuse from clients due to this and management only asking for more productivity."
bad,"ADP Totalsource is to big of a company not to be run professionally, efficiently and effectively, and it's unbelievable they have people in management positions that don't know what they are doing. They need to change the management in the tax department, and get people that can lead he group and know what they are doing.  It's the blind leading the blind."
bad,"Stressful as heck, no real balance in workload. Always overwhelmed. Management has a vision I do not follow any longer. Many issues with process, procedure and tools are not condusive to a good working environment."
bad,"When I started at ADP, it was a fun job and it seemed promising. Then after a few years, I noticed a few things. Most managers pick a favored employee for whatever reason. They make them the super star by feeding them additional leads creating an unfair advantage to their peers. Then the teams would be compared to the anointed superstar with the secret additional lead pipeline. The favored employee by default would win all the trips, be recognized as the deal, and would by default make the most money. Meanwhile, you have good hard working sales people with families to feed that do the same amount of work and get far less results because of old, exhausted, or all around less pipelines for potential sales. This was brought to the attention of VPs with no regard or care as long as the team as a whole were selling. I mean the VPs are getting paid regardless as they override all the commissions. ADP is a joke."
bad,Very stressful. Folks with experience and insight are laid off to higher cheaper labor. Jobs are off shored to other countries. The work atmosphere is depressing.
bad,"Management makes the workplace hostile. Most of them whisper all day long about their workers, criticize them for mistakes that they have no control over since the company does not take responsibility for their own mistakes. I would not recommend anyone getting a job at this company. They are unorganized,they spend too much time taking surveys of everything instead of spending time training their employees better for the positions they are hired for in the first place. They really need a consultant to come in and revamp their processes."
bad,ADP is not a place to spend your career if you're not 100% into it. they are known for their training program and a great place to learn B2B sales. I would not want to go back to those days on the streets of queens but it wasn't a bad place to work and I appreciate the time I spend there
bad,"It all depends on your team and your immediate manager. Leadership is not a valued attribute for many ADP managers. It can be a great place to work, if your management team values team work, leadership, and honesty. Unfortunately too many managers rose to their level of incompetence and are just about self preservation."
bad,I wanted this job to work out better but the company is forcing all it's clients onto a software that is not ready for production and it puts the consultants in a terrible situation. I want to be good at my job and succeed and help the client. The move is being done regardless and their clients are suffering for it which in turn brings that pain the the employees having to deal with the clients face to face.
bad,"Management is from the US. That being said there is little thought given to Canadian staff. There is little help to move up in the company. Management is not very engaged, especially when they're located in US."
bad,"Normal work day / outside sales. Great sales training. The leadership (locally is extremely poor)"
bad,"The culture is fine, but you should keep your external conversations generic and friendly, even while talking among friends and peers.  There is always someone listening to misinterpret anything you say."
bad,"ADP is really lack behind tehnology and innovation. People there to collect pay check, not to work. It is really a shame how corporate politics dragging ADP down. I really would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Typical workday involves managing a large backlog of at least 50 projects.  Do not complete any surveys, upper management does not want to hear what you have to say.  Going to Human Resources is not a good idea either.  The spinoff has created micro-management which is counter-intuitive to the ""faster forward"" slogan.  The co-workers are the equivalent of ravenous dogs fighting for the same bone.  The hardest part of the job is trying to make sense of the horrible training and PMO segmentation (Minnesota vs. Hoffman Estates).  The most enjoyable part of the job is 4PM!"
bad," Managed and directed billing and invoice activities for over 500 dealerships."
bad,"The Management/Leadership are very biased.  Before a job is posted for open positions, the company has chosen the candidate in advance but chooses to entertain those applying.  They do not make you feel like a professional."
bad,High pay n high turnover. They actually hire people as back up for your job. (On the bench). No values and back stabbing.
bad,This company is always changing in a negative way. They have no loyalty and advancement isn't easy. Management is horrible and over time is constant and expected through Holidays.
bad,"They will employ you but as far as caring about their employees they lack severely in that area. They pitched it being a great place for mother’s bit that is the farthest from the truth!! There is zero flexibility and the department has no room for growth unless you’re life’s goal is to go from a Level 1 to a Level 2. If you’re a robot and willing to have no one in management take accountability anything, this is the job for you!!"
bad,"They will offer you a very attractive salary, then will chew you up and spit you out within 18 months.  Great place for young professional to learn sales skills.  Terrible place to work.  Don't do it."
bad,"Well, this was by far the worst job any educated and tenured sales person can have. You get all the hardware right away! New Laptop, iPad, business cards on your first day.....and that’s it folks. No sales strategy, just go door to door for 30k a year and make pennies on commission. Job is excellent if you live with parents..possibly 20 years old and have never worked a day in your life."
bad,"I was astonished by how poorly ADP is ran.  It's a complete mess.  Clients aren't happy, HR Business Partners socializing a lot (versus working), a lot of temps, the lack of training, poor and immature management, and turn around time to get tasks complete for clients was horrible. "
bad,"I was told during the interview that I would receive 6-8 weeks of training.  The needs of the business led to them pulling me out and assigning me accounts after 2.5 weeks.  Keep in mind I was new to the technology and the industry and was relying on the training to bridge that gap.  I was told I would have seven accounts.  I carried nine for most of my tenure and then was asked to give up an easy one in exchange for a difficult one (20-30 hours per week on its own).  I took on the difficult one but they couldn't get the account reps to agree to pull me off any of my other accounts so I managed ten accounts for four months.  I was told there would be a busy season where I would have to work 60+ hours (Oct - Jan) and the rest of the year I would work 40-ish and be allowed to go home early on Fridays.  I worked 55-80 during my entire tenure and was allowed to go home early once.  I guess the bottom line is that no one in my management hierarchy followed through on many of their commitments while I did.  My reward for consistently cleaning my plate was a 3% raise, a 3 out of 5 on my performance review, and a bigger plate.  I might consider it for an entry level position to get some experience but I cannot recommend ADP to anyone else.  The only pro was the people I worked with were good people and fun, including the managers and VP that couldn't deliver.  They were good people enforcing a broken business model and poor culture.  Oh, and the processes and technology are from the Stone Age.  Don't expect to learn good business practices or cutting-edge technology."
bad,"My coworkers were the only reason I stayed in this place. If anyone is applying for a customer service role keep in mind that this is a call center. The training is not good, what you’re trained for is not what you’re dealing with on the daily bases. Management is not supportive they’re to busy gossiping and lack motivating they’re employees. Also keep in mind that you will be treated as child. Save yourself!"
bad,"Your job is always at risk. And while I understand it is not their responsibility to train you in sales, even some guidance would have helped. They simply told me I was on a pip, either improve or be fired. 0 positive reinforcement or training. May the company go bankrupt and Paychex be #1."
bad,"Great company to work for, especially fi you're good at sales. Pay is good, medical benefits are not as good as they should be for an organization of its size. But, they spent a bit of money on activities and events."
bad,"excellent salary compensation for the roles; management lacks any direction and cannot make informed business decisions to grow business and increase the value for the customer and allow associates to provide better customer services.  in payroll you cannot do more with less; unless the tools exist"
bad,"A empresa oferece flexibilidade para o trabalho e salário compatível com o mercado, mas a gerência é terrível! Gerentes despreparados e desrespeitosos ao lidar com o funcionário (estilo capataz). Não pagam hora extra e esperam que você trabalhe mais de 8 hrs diárias para cumprir tarefas que te passam já no fim do dia. Avaliação de desempenho não realista e ""injusta"", onde o trabalho efetuado não é valorizado, apenas avaliam se foram feitos ""melhorias"" e dado algum treinamento. Na avaliação de desempenho só vale o que o gestor informa. Não importa o que faça, a avaliação de desempenho é sempre ""a desejar"", aparentemente para justificar as não promoções e aumentos de salário."
bad,Churn and burn company. People are just numbers and management is poor. Poor customer service and there is a lack of employee support. Too many department
bad,They only promote their friends.  Management say negative things to you even if you are top performing employees in the region.  The hire inexperienced employees to manage departments.
bad,Mercedes Medical - Growth in the company is not measured by performance.  Its a family run business and the family decides verse performance on if a person grows with the company or not.
bad,Expectations from upper management can exceed employees' maximum capacity to satisfy their needs.  Training is provided however you need to be a sponge and remember every detail as well as be flexible to constant changes with their outdated software programs.  Good luck!
bad,"The job was presented as an accounting position while it was a technical support position, not having anything to do with an accounting background but rather troubleshooting, which would require someone with an I.T. background."
bad,"ADP is a great place to work when you first graduate college. You will quickly find, however, that the turnover rate is high and the company cares very little about employees in the middle. They boast wanting to develop employees but once you get in a position that should warrant growth, there is a one-way up approach."
bad,"Brace yourself for a culture ride that you will find nowhere else. Frat house mentality. Most managers are out for themselves and have a very healthy self esteem. There are clear favorites on the sales teams who read their own press clippings. No fun to clap for them in the weekly sales meetings when they call out their goals and ""achievements"". Salesforce contains erroneous info that was created by sales associates.  Probably 30% of deals dont start because customer service is horrific. Minorities are far from favored in sales. Don't be fooled by the fact that there are 2 minority sales managers. "
bad,"Working at the Dallas office of ADP was a horrible decision. There was no structure, it was so unprofessional, and only about 10 people in the entire office actually succeeded at their job."
bad,"Regrettably, ADP Canada is a highly political, blame oriented organisation. If you are in a management, director role - you are given all the responsibility when it goes wrong, but none of the resources to fix things, and an overwhelming workload - with senior management merely shrugging when you tell them that something has to be moved off your plate. You are told that it is all your responsibility and nothing can be dropped."
bad,"I worked at ADP streamline for 2 months, I was very disappointed in the level of leadership, technology and overall maturity of the this division, obviously ADP is a massive conglomerate and is very well know worldwide, however the streamline division is not for all, especially those with opinions, critical observations of internal processes and with an attitude of the ""client comes first""."
bad,"Sales professional at ADP lie, cheat, and push to get their deals through at the cost of the relationship with the client. Sales will run you over you like a mack truck. No support from management at all. If you like a paper pushing and a non ethical company then have it. I disliked every moment."
bad,"Leadership makes poor decisions and put focus on wrong areas. Employees and Management are not held to quality standards. No collaboration between departments. Clients suffer.  Support, training, and quality measures are put into offshoring, company moving more towards that so efforts for improvement are not focused locally. You'll be stressed and confused and workers on all levels pass the buck"
bad,"very high stress environment, lack of empathy of leadership, underpaid, expectations of employees are unrealistic, overload of work, careless attitude towards employees."
bad,"ADP is a sales driven organization. Sales agents and district managers are commissioned based and are pushed to sell. In turn,  the use high pressure tactics and at times simply deceive clients in order to meet their numbers. This causes for the customer service reps to deal with errors and the aftermath of failing to meet customer expectations. You also have to meet typical call center metrics. Management typically cares more about their next promotion  a d their  own  reputation than their reps."
bad,Management does not know what is going on. Has know idea what the product is that we support. Drops the ball and blames others. No upward mobility unless you know somebody.
bad,Its terrible the heat will kill you there. I seen people fall out there from the heat its very unsafe. The pay isn't worth your health. I fell out there due to the heat.
bad,There is a good job culture at ADP and training for the positions was provided.  There was a lot of acquired knowledge that was required to perform the job at the level that was expected.
bad,Constant changes didnt finish the training.  Thrown onto the floor without completing training. black outs depending on your department and the season.  hit or miss on the department you get selected for.
bad,Your job is never secure here.  If they need to hit a number to impress shareholders you'll be the first to go regardless of your performance.  They'll also promise you the world to get you in the door.  During YE don't expect to have any type of life.  Management is too afraid to speak up because they don't want to get fired either.
bad,The company overall needs to have more effective management. This simply means everyone is not meant to lead groups sometimes these people are more effective in team lead roles and not management.
bad,"ADP is full of racism. Management was terrible and you definitely need to know your own rights when utilizing FMLA if you are a minority. I was forced to file a complaint against the company and won 15,000.00 which they did not pay on time."
bad,"ADP had a great culture for a younger employee base. However, their lack of effective planning cost me and other employees a great deal of wasted time and frustration."
bad,"The company culture is good for millennials and attracts them to the job, but they lack sufficient incentive for selling. The commission structure is pretty bad and base salary is bad compared to competitors."
bad,"There's no accountability to people that make mistakes, and there's a ton of mistakes.  Communcation is non existent between everyone.  There's so much lack of detail to do a good job it's almost comical."
bad,Constantly added on more responsibility. The threat of job moving offshore. Would fire people with little or no reason and not replace them to relieve workload. Too difficult to do a good job with the level of job stress.
bad,Poor Senior Management decisions on following the companies mission and values.  President share his vision which is completely different that how future path is delivered to associates.
bad,"I've worked for ADP for 10 years and the first five years were great but as it became an Employer's Market, they definitely took advantage of their longtime loyal employees. They've been laying off whole business units and sending jobs overseas and also terminating longtime employees without notice. I would not recommend working here unless you are able to get an executive or corporate position."
bad,"Company does not train employees, they are expected to execute the job and learn along the way without adequate time and tools to grow. Do not work here unless you have worked for a similar company before."
bad,"not the good company "
bad,"Client service is the WRONG department to get into!! They hold you back and only advancement rarely happens; i have been trying to move departments for two years. "
bad,"They are very proud of their diversified culture, and anti harassment program which is great, but there is still favouritism and bullying happening behind closed doors."
bad,This Company did not care about my lively hood and family after almost 14 years of Enployment with this company myself and 100 other Employee were laid off with no notice on a 15mins conference call.
bad,"From Day 1, Managers shine the light and give opportunties to those who they know or like. The now use StandOut to ""measure"" associates' performance, which is extremely subjective and biased. Associates no longer have control of their performance reviews, and it is now based on what the managers ""feel"". StandOut is a joke."
bad,The company in the beginning is great but then you get to see the truth. They hire managers that have absolutely no knowledge about the field that thy are working in. The managers feel as if they can speak to you in any manner and some that act like they care but they are snakes.
bad,"When I originally started working for the company 20 years ago they truly focused on their associates which made for a positive productive work environment.  However, a new CEO came on board and decided to send jobs overseas and let go of tenured experienced employees.  These changes created a hostile work environment."
bad,"The job was perm. It was supposed to be stable. Was supposed to have an amazing work culture, what a fail. I left a higher paying position for what should have been a stable position. Not only did they discriminate my gender they used the trainer as a sounding board to report my personal life to managers and justify firing me after 3 weeks of completing training. "
bad,I have strong opinions on this that i will share if speaking one on one with individuals - i barely made 1 year with this company so likelihood of the environment being productive and enjoyable is very low -
bad,Today ADP terminated 75 of their best employees. Zero job security. Rewards stripped in the last 3 years. Not an employer of choice. They are a mess. Move on.
bad,They do not car about employees.  They only care about profits and stock price.  They claim to care about work/life balance for associates but they do not.  It is a bad place to work.
bad,ADP does not care about long term EE's. 
bad,"The amount of work that is required to perform your duties typically outweighs the benefits. You get paid low wages, no medical or dental plans, and no paid vacations."
bad,"I believe the typical day at work is extremely boring and tedious same thing everyday. I have learned how to code in mySQL, but that is the only thing I feel is with any use. Management is pretty good however, they tend to be passive aggressive. The workplace culture seems to have a high school like atmosphere so  if you have been out of high school longer than 5 years and if you are mature this is not a place for you. Dealing with customers in a call center. the most enjoyable part of the job is going home for the day."
bad,"Job started out great with first Management.New Management sucked. Favoritism and racist"
bad,"ADP as a company maybe OK, the security compliance dept is horrible. Very stressful and the manager is rude and a bully. If you're looking for a stress free environment then STAY AWAY from security compliance KYC. The management in that dept is a joke...."
bad,"I've never been so unhappy working for a company . The managers like to micromanage, they don't know what they are doing, and favour employees . No room for advancement , empty promises , and backstabbing . They do not do what's best for clients or even treat their employees with respect . I would not recommend even to my greatest enemy  a job here . Don't be fooled by the pay, your sanity is worth way more than that ."
bad,"I got to know what corporate is & its principles & goals."
bad,Management only seem to get their roles due to favouritism. They don't progress people that actually deserve the role. They are more than happy to back-stab you if you're not in their 'circle'.
bad,"If you're looking for stability, decent benefits and cubicles from the 70s this is the place for you. Don't expect innovation or forward thinking from ADP. Salary-wise, the starting salary is generally competitive, but the longer you stay, the more underpaid you will be. They don't value technology or design, so if those are your fields run away quickly."
bad,"You will get culture here but not job security, no pay, no over time, worst management, politics. People who work for years they don't have choice cause other companies not giving jobs for high experience. So they stuck over in same role,"
bad,"This job is great for fresh grads. After that, find another job. The culture is great and engaging, but soon you won’t care because your pay isn’t enough for your role. Lots of work that doesn’t match pay rate, no advancement within this department, poor management across the board, and workplace bullying. Great benefits is the only thing that was positive about this job."
bad,"Very mentally strenuous work, not enough staffed to handle call volume. Heavy Case workload. Management continues to upgrade policies and programs for our clients thus making them unhappy customers and not allowing enough training time to compensate."
bad,Would not suggest this place for anyone at anytime. The job security is almost nonexistent and the permanent employees treat the temporary/contract workers like something they stepped in.
bad,"Aaptable environment, learning new skills with latest technologies."
bad,"They over hired personnel for the new Maitland, FL location. Kept shuffling people to different teams every other week.  I ended up leaving due to instability.  A few months after, many of my co-workers were laid off due to lack of work.  Definitely glad I left when I did."
bad,Company is changing in the wrong direction. Software is full of bugs that we had to continually attempt to find workarounds for angry customers. Their anger was surely justified.
bad,"Horrible, this place is a disgrace.  I went through an orientation group of 30, and already 25 of them have quit....................................................................."
bad,It was a good company but just was not the right fit for me. I will be moving to Denver in a month and am looking for a sale or marketing opportunity with the opportunity to move up in the company.
bad,"I would not recommend working there. Lack of training, stressful work environment. Management was not trained enough to help staff, and would have to call to get help to help you while on the phones with aggravated client from waiting."
bad,The company is reorganizing on a local level. Many senior leaders have lost  focus on the employees and the culture is shifting rapidly from what was once employee focused to what is now all about self and surveys that are not treated like true feedback. They are treated like numbers.
bad,"Upper management is nothing more than a title here. No 'leadership' exists inside our multiple teams. Management/'leaders' will tell you one thing verbally and deny they ever did when it comes up again (lots of snakes in the grass here and compulsive lying/memory loss, even senior level which is disturbing- makes for a great work environment, way to go 'leaders'). "
bad,It’s was a good work experience it’s jus the job it self that will run people off . The pay was pretty good and it is enough to get me by and help me stay caught up on bills .
bad,"ADP is a great company for a new sales person straight out of college.  As someone who already had outside sales experience and was a few years out of college, it was not the correct fit for my skill level."
bad,"Extremely micro-managed.  The boss was terrible and was very condescending to all of the employees, especially in sales.  I left there after being there about 6 months and ran out of the door."
bad,"Excellent company to work for."
bad,ADP is a very stress company to work for. The resposibility of co workers/ managers/ supervisor is not orginazed at all.
bad,This job was very time consuming and monotonous. A challenge working so closely with tenants and housing authority together to best serve the needs of apartment management and tenants.
bad,"this is a call center, you are required to be tied down to your desk and on calls for almost 7 hours of the day."
bad,"Company was bought out by Audatex and is out of business."
bad,"didnt like it, it wasnt a place i wanted to be especially through a temp service"
bad,"Track packages , make inbound and outbound calls "
bad,The company has changed as a whole these past couple of years. It's no longer a great place to work. The new management that was brought it is truly terrible. I would not recommend working there unless you have a heavy sales background and don't mind micro-managers.
bad,Very slow paced environment. Not very technically challenging in terms of the work. There's also a lot of politics that gets in the way and certain leaders rule the place
bad,"ADP is a global company. My department's analyst and programming positions were systematically transferred to the offshore associates over a period of 10 years. As a onshore associate I supported this work model, training and working with our counterparts and managers in India.  I expected to transition to another area of the company at some point in the process. For my 11 years of service, I was separated unexpectedly and received 6 months severance. Don't think it won't happen to you too."
bad,In 37 years in the work force this is one of the worst companies that I have ever worked for. They are a wealthy billion dollar company who pays marginal wages to their production workers. The work atmosphere in the production department is awful. Most of the associates are more interested in gossiping about their co-workers than they are about doing the work that they were hired to do. Luckily there are a handfull of people including myself that perform the work that we were hired to do. The low hourly wage is not worth the hectic daily commute.
bad,"Unstable. High turnover due to constant/ongoing company restructuring yearly.  The day is never boring due to extremely heavy workload.  Job titles, duties, and processes change regularly."
bad,"24/7 call center for cashcard paycheck payments, enough said. I was unlucky and worked the peak hours on payday weekend. I wasn't prepared for the overly aggressive and hostile nature of the calls I would receive and have to handle."
bad,"Due to a lack of 360 view, leadership does not have a clear understanding of how successful middle managers are in motivating their teams in a positive way.   Benefits are not competitive in the market."
bad,"Just an overload of work. Unprofessional management. Basically a slave shop without the pay. They promise something on the job description, but beware, it is nothing like the actual job."
bad,"Management does not care whatsoever about less tenured reps"
bad,My time at ADP opened my eyes to a typical financial institution that is this in the top down leadership style. Do as I say and not as I do mentality. Everytime I wanted to implement something new in Agile it was always shot down but yet we were told that the Agile transformation was not taking place. Agile transformation has to begin at the leadership level and it is not just a process. Until ADP's leadership pulls their head out from their four points of contact; ADP will never transform and the organization will fall behind in the marketplace; as other paycheck companies continue grow and do much better. I will be surprised to see this dinosaur of a company around in 10 years!
bad,"Dont go with lots of ambition, coz no scope of career."
bad,"ADP CLIENT SERVICE REP:"
bad,Overall it’s a decent workplace. Adp doesn’t pay well but you learn a lot of HCM and payroll. It’s best to learn and leave for more money. Sadly ADP would rather lose employees than pay market value to retain employees.
bad,Typical sales job where if you're 1% under your quota that month you get a threatening letter warning you about how bad that is even if you're at 150% of your yearly quota. They have ridiculous pep rally meetings and then will complain you didn't make enough phone calls that day even though you were forced to endure these useless meetings. My hiring managers left within a month of starting and then the company seemed to forget I exist. No training. Get hired and start selling retirement plans even though you have no idea what the company's product is.
bad,"ADP is only focused on making money. No training, very bad benefits, low pay. I promised the world, using my skills to make the client experience better. It never happened. Overworked and I was basically a person to take complaints and put out fire."
bad,"Most of the IT department is dominated with asians, So much work pressure to survive in the job.  employees itself are competitive to each other and end up working more hours to impress management and causing wrong expectations in the management. "
bad,the division that i work for is not well managed and the workload distribution makes no sense. the culture is shifting from a consultative environment to that of a call center.
bad,"Clean environment"
bad,The micro-managing affects efficiency and overall employee morale. Their processes get in the way of productivity and customer satisfaction. The bigger the brand the more customers become a number.
bad,"Some days at ADP simply drained your life energy, the managers were sometimes unfriendly. the only thing that kept me going back was a need for money and paying bills"
bad,It’s a good company to work for as you gain great skills but it’s a hit and miss with management; senior and mid-level. Networking is an absolute must to get anywhere in the company.
bad,"It is a place to increase speed and proficiency, by obtaining experience daily via work assignments designated.  There wasn't much chance for opportunity."
bad,ADP is a difficult place to work. Training is insufficient and all that matters is productivity. A lot of talk about client satisfaction but no commitment to it. It's hard to advance and pay is low for the degree of skill and knowledge necessary to provide excellent service to the clients.
bad,"Low salary, hard to advance, dysfunctional management and confusing company strategies. You're just a number as an employee, clients are only a dollar sign."
bad,This company changed my manager 6 times in a 2 yr time span and had a way of operating that instilled fear in employees for any minor mistake..This made it extremely difficult to advance as well as to provide proper customer support. The financial compensation was fair but the benefits and paid time off policy we're lacking. I would.not recommend working here.
bad,"At ADP the color of your skin determines how you will be promoted. Managers favor Caucasian employees, the black managers are afraid to help their own. I currently work at ADP and I am told I have great soft skills instead of being told I’m good at what I do. The Tempe, AZ location is not the place for a African American."
bad,"Not only did I place 53,000 miles on my car, I had my manager calling me every hour about my meetings and sales. Even on my sick days. I would not recommend this company to anyone who does not like to be micromanaged. I had a manager that would pry too far into my personal life, guilt me if I took a sick day, and tried way too hard to be your best friend and not a boss. It is apparent that the sale was more important than the clients or the employees."
bad,"A plus is that I had a job for some years. Negatives: old guys’ network, almost no diversity, one Engagement Leader frequently made derogatory (racist, sexist) remarks on client and internal calls acting like they were jokes. And that type of guy got promoted all the time. Very clique-y groups. Night and weekend work was expected, not requested and not rewarded. Remote work, okay but discouraged from even visiting area offices although several in my area, like wanted to keep us isolated. Once I joined company, went 5 months without a project assigned. Poor raises/bonuses, esp recent years. Just became a place that worked against success. Many waves of ‘layoffs’ started, then buyouts, writing on the wall. Never used any employee input to improve things. Frequent l"
bad,"An ok place to work if you like being over worked, under payed, and chastised for trying to assist clients as you'd like to be assisted if you were one."
bad,The company has good benefits and the pay is not so bad. There is no room for advancement unless management likes you and you brown nose. There its not about your knowledge or experience its about who you know. There is a lot of favoritism and unethical behavior that gets overlooked by upper management as long as numbers are met.
bad,"Save yourself the stress and do not apply. They are constantly implementing changes but are not thinking of how it affects the employees, for example making all of the client service rep Account Managers without warning us beforehand that this was happening. When the initial change happened it did not come with a pay increase. After almost a year, they decided to provide a pay increase but it is below the standard for other Account Managers in the tri-state area. We only get a 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks. So many people are quitting because the moral is down and there is no possibility of growth especially because so many people are quitting. I don't recommend it, but if you are in dire need of money, proceed at your own risk."
bad,"Terrible management and very high turnover due to management inconsistency and having the wrong people in key positions. Employees are hired with the expectation of a job that is not true, very unorganized. unfair treatment, and poor decision making. OneADP in Maitland has the HIGHEST turnover."
bad,long hours hard work constantly standing and lifting having to meet a daily standard i learned that you have to always be alert and mantain a clean and safe workspace. the hardest part of the job was the lack of commucation and leadership.
bad,"Loyalty is not rewarded or appreciated. No work/life balance. LONG hours, unreasonable expectations. Upper management is disconnected from the ""real world"" of the day-to-day processes."
bad,"Most of the job descriptions do not apply at what you really do from day to day unfortunately."
bad,"Customers always in a bad mood because system would not do what was promised, constant upgrades where customers did not have the time to learn. Too many programs were used to provide services.Great coworkers though. Management was hired from outside and never knew what they were doing, so no help from them. High management turn around."
bad,"Working at ADP was one of the worst experiences of my life. Management was horrible, rarely in the office, and when she was in the office she would be in her personal space the entire time. No room for growth in my department. Unfair treatment. Always playing favorites."
bad,You build ac units and they will not even put air in the area of the floor workers. They have air in the offices but not on the floor where the people are actually helping them make money.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is being set to high quantity, rather than quality and happier clients to allow for better client retention. The workplace is growing for the employees, but many employees have so much work they are unable to partake."
bad,Do not recommend. No life balance. Management was unstable. Pressure work. Too many meetings. Crowded spaces overlapping like chickens in a cage. No advancement.
bad,Don't plan on staying employed at this company. 
bad,"At both the original Dealer Services and currently at CDK, advancement without a very positive, non-questioning attitude towards the company's goals is not possible.  There is a strong emphasis on profit before people."
bad,"Management reviews territory every year and can cut it even though you performed over 100% the year before.  I performed at 110% last year and my terrtiroy was cut by 50%.  The old management was great but the new management is awful.  Very sexist as well, even admits that girls are more likely to get centric roles than guys."
bad,"high stress, no training support for new hires, lack of management support and communication, lack of trust within workplace culture and high turnover of employees"
bad,"Leadership was very weak.  Leadership did not communicate what the goals were from the top down.  Poor micromanagement, and inability to provide positive feedback in a role that has a lot of negative situations."
bad,"Coming in as a temp, leaving as a temp, was treated as a temp, and was never given any sign of that changing during my time there. Management treated anyone not full time employees poorly, and didn't even bother to tell us that our department would be losing our jobs at the end when the department was to be dumped."
bad,"Company culture is to hire employees in generic positions and add multiple positions to their daily duties, resulting in one person working several jobs that previously were held by others."
bad,Not the best place to work. Not willing to accommodate their employees.  Asked for help with a situation and they made it worse.  Don't work here
bad,"I worked at ADP for several years.The culture has become confusing, belittling and cut throat and that has to do with the lack of actual management. If you're looking to be treated as a professional do not go here because you will be made to feel as if you are a number and that your opinions mean nothing. They hire young people or recent college grads with no experience. If you're older than 35, this is not for you. If you're a woman and looking to be a manager, this is not for you as the management hires mostly  white males in their 20's. There are 2 sets of teams-a client based and a dm facing team. Each time a client based team got ahold of the lead you were working on, it was awarded to them, regardless of how much work you actually put into it. I was a senior employee ad received many accolades and even won the Presidents Club trip. Shortly afterwards, they plotted to get rid of me. Probably because it was an expensive trip. They fired me a few months later. The prior DVP of Sales was quite intimidated by anyone with any thoughts of their own. If you spoke out of turn, you knew she was out to get you. You would get the stink eye all the time, or the managers or the DVP would chat about you in her cube. You could hear everything because no one had an office. It would be her cronies, or Sales Execs who ultimately fire you, not her. I was fired for being under $1000 away from my goal that month, but in reality they activated it an hour after they cut my throat. I found out later that they replaced me with someone else and gave them a much lower goal. It's about politics and"
bad,"Intense"
bad,"I held two positions at ADP. The first was a wonderful experience. I would award 5 stars for management. The second was just not the environment for me. Since this was a contract job the compensation, culture, job security, and work balance questions are inapplicable."
bad,"I was a senior manager in the IT area. There were changes at the top as management as far as creating an overall CIO. This brought in new management from companies where the new leadership had worked previously. They proceeded to remove any trace of the old management, even peopl with stellar review records. Bad technology decisions being made and the overall mood of the staff has changed"
bad,"It’s decent experience and you have ADP on your resume to be able to leave and find something else, something that will actually pay a fair market value for the work you do. Management spends more time focused on politics and games than actually helping employees grow and develop in their career. Favoritism is blatantly obvious and unless you’re a chosen one don’t expect to be promoted. The only good thing is the flexibility. Just get the experience for 12-18 months then leave or switch to another department. Don’t get too comfortable."
bad,"worst company to work with, no  job security no work culture, no training, no management ethics, no hierarchy followed, no proper infrastructure, no proper technology"
bad,My manager was horrible. He hated teaching me stuff. Lazy managers and preferential treatment for certain workers. Lots of driving. However itll give you a good idea of corporate world.
bad,"Could use a real adjustment to the way they lead, compensate, develop, and benefit employees. Barely any advancement and they should stick to payroll."
bad,"I always loved working for ADP.  Took pride in my work and felt I was compensated well for the job."
bad,"Management is based on who you know, not personal knowledge or ability to lead a team."
bad,"I really liked working for ADP was taking calls for employees to set up the FMLA if they were going on a leave of absence and making sure the documents were received and sending and emailing the correct documents. We would have a lot to read to a person who was taking a leave as in the impact on pay, impact on benefits, reporting time and reporting back to work. each company had there own special information you would have to explain to the employee a lot of information you have to know over a 100 company's we were taking calls for. I enjoyed my job would have love to stay longer but it was a contract job."
bad,I would have had a far better experience if I had been paired with a different supervisor. It had gotten to the point where my stomach would turn on Mondays when we would have the scheduled weekly phone meeting. I did not like being alone on the phone with him. He was remote from another state from where I would report to. It was a terrible experience.
bad,"Lack of Job aids, training on new task very stressful. no work life balance. Very stressful. The best part of the day is leaving for the day. Don't make mistakes they will hurt you."
bad,I did not enjoy my time at ADP because most of the time they didn;t seem to know what they were doing while expecting perfection from the employee.  In training the infrastructure wa not in place for us in order to be trained properly.  Training materials were pretty much non-existent
bad,"There are some WONDERFUL people there, just the work load was impossible to handle (and I am a work-a-holic). Wait a year or two before applying here, there are a lot of kinks they have to work through first."
bad,"The company's goal is to cut costs by consolidating as much of the company as possible. This comes in the form of call centers around the world, which are their bread and butter."
bad,"High stress job with unrealistic expectations. The aforementioned is the reason the turn-over rate is high in both management and in employee tenure. The company is currently trying to reinvent itself because it was throwing people at at technology problem for years. Competition combined with customer complaints and losses have placed this company in panic mode with internal restructuring initiatives. Stockholders took note with the removal of the current CEO a near miss last year."
bad,Lots of work with little to no work/life balance. Management talks a good game but really doesn't care and will lay you off in a minute. Everyone is constantly fearful of losing their jobs
bad,"High stress environment with little to no management directions."
bad,"That is essentially the mindset of current management in IT."
bad,Not employee centrick not a great plse to wk pays very less not a sound management system wk culture is no grate chances of grouth is very less layoffs happen
bad,"Unorganized, Poor Management, Poor Communication, Lack of training, Neat environment, poor task management, sometimes very unprofessional, no room for growth"
bad,"Often feels like the movie Office Space ... It is a cubicle farm. Uber micro management in most positions. It's basically a place to just have a ""white collar"" job ..."
bad,"As a contractor, I do the same amount of work as direct hires, but with no benefits, and no sign of being hired directly. I enjoy my colleagues' company and assistance, but the days are draining on the voice (phone interviews) and body. There are no incentives to be healthy, staying seated the majority of 40 hours a week. Immediate managers are kind and accommodating, but upper level management seems to have a high turnover recently. I enjoy the occasionally interesting candidate in phone interviews. This position has helped me understand the inticracies of interviewing, which will I will carry with me for the remainder of my working life."
bad,"O sistema é valido para o currículo, porem nesta empresa tem mais visibilidade quem puxa saco ou quem é indicação."
bad,"One of the worst place to work."
bad,"	Performed Load testing, Performance testing and Stress testing using Load Runner."
bad,"It is a bit juvenile, and the management is usually under qualified.   They also pay well below industry standards for FINRA licensed employees"
bad,My co-workers were very good I was a coordinator in the production area. The Supervisor had no skills with regards to mentoring and motivating employees and upper management never provided employees with the necessary information about the direction in which the company was going.
bad,Job stability isn't the greatest. You hear we are meeting goal but then there are a round of layoffs. Either we are doing well or we aren't. Don't stay to long in one spot.
bad,"ADP is so stressful environment "
bad,Yuk...chop shop...Always has been. toxic sales culture. I ran the major accounts group...ran them from 51% of plan to 136% of plan and then got fired.....they didn't like the way I was doing it.
bad,Not much advancement opportunities. Management doesn't pay attention to feedback and learning options are very limited. Though there is some work life balance.
bad,Great place to start to gain more knowledge. If you expect for management to have your back in anything that is few and far in between. When you are client facing they do not have the best interest for the clients and throw it back on employees to handle things that should go to another department. It’s like being in high school.
bad,"At this point your probably questioning is ADP really for you, well let me help you with your decision making. If you like working overtime and on the weekends this place is for you. If you like having no idea you what you are doing this place is for you. If you like working in an understaffed environment this place is for you. Lastly, if you like being throwing false positives in hopes that it gets better this place is definitely for you. Upper Management sucks and truly does not care about you! You can't run implementation like sales and that is exactly what management ( especially in the west core) is doing. You really are just a number to a corporation of this size. This corporation is making management mistake after mistake by hiring for degrees ( and the good ole boys club)  over  genuine talent. However, the money is great, overtime is never capped, the co workers and low level managers are the reason I'm still there, and if you're lucky you'll get a manager who will fight for you. Good luck on your job search and think before you commit."
bad,Good starting pay however company strategical change orders benefits the company and cut employment/employees benefits.   Workplace culture needs work.
bad,"The company is a good company to work for, but it also depends on your department. Major Accounts - Implementation is BS. They will lie to you to get you to take the job; one you start things begin to unravel."
bad,"Good Work life balance."
bad,They have bad insurance . The business is setup with multiple departments within the departments there are mutiple managers . Some are excellent and some are not good at all . There seems to be a sense of favoritism in the place with certain managers as well . so its a luck of the draw . However they do provide good food and a nice work area.
bad,"The company went through a phase of sending employee home to work virtually to save on costs.  Once a number of employees were virtual, they changed their stance on this.  At the same time, they started closing offices around the U.S. to create a smaller number of large offices that could be referred to as Center of Excellence.  The virtual employees were not let go but could not be promoted or change jobs because virtual was no longer an option."
bad,"I've worked for the company for 12 years.  They preach diversity but do not practice what they preach.  I'm in my 50 and it doesn't bother me that they have a young work force, I welcome that but providing knowledge and promoting knowledge is not their strength.  Looking for another job now."
bad,"Lot of work to be done around : "
bad,"Back to back meetings all day..  Expected to maintain training, expanded backlog, high performance, stretch assignments, escalation at 300% to 400% capacity in a 8 hour work day."
bad,"Typical day at work, busy from start to finish.  In my field, our day does not end when the day ends.  Risk management is not completed until the risk is mitigated.  "
bad,"ADP laid off numerous people, not a good move. The company does not care about how the layoffs affected people. The laid us off and expected us to train new hires."
bad,"ADP can be a great company to work for depending on who your manager is.  However, their training opportunities are amazing.  You can receive certifications as in your FPC, SHRM, and more."
bad,"Very stressful environment. Management including senior can't be trusted and are making unreasonable demands. "
bad,"They low ball you and expect more from you and then give the new people roles instead of senior staff. "
bad,"They are sun-setting the CORE payroll system and firing everyone who worked on it."
bad,"While ADP has a great training program, they were seriously lacking when it came to management. They provided a lot of great learning materials, but I basically had to teach myself how to do everything. The office is super gossipy, and many of the bosses have secret relationships with their employees. I definitely learned a lot, but with hardly any help from management."
bad,"Working at ADP was great at first. Compensation was fair and the work environment was fun. Morale was high and I enjoyed going to work each day, even with a West Coast shift 10:30 -7 PM. At the start of the new fiscal year, quotas increased significantly (unfairly) without any additional opportunity to prospect. Due to unrealistic expectations, morale decreased, the office atmosphere grew dark, compensation went far down. I had personal growth of almost 120% and was making LESS commission than the year prior... How does that make sense? Well.. It doesn't. And it resulted in over 50% turnover that fiscal year alone. Upper management never got involved to ask us how to improve workplace morale. When our quotas were doubled or MORE than doubled, we were told, ""Sell more."" I used to drink the kool-aid at this place. Having won multiple of the awards trips and had great success here, I even referred a few friends and family members. After seeing how the management in this building would face a tough year, I would never refer anyone again and was glad to say I resigned happily to move elsewhere."
bad,"When I first walked in the door at ADP over a decade ago, I will never forget how impressed I was with ADP's management, leadership, and their over-all treatment of employees.  Today, ADP's current company direction seems to be to offshore as many positions as possible, eliminate home-shore work opportunities, and focus on hiring low-salary and inexperienced college graduates.  Yearly employee satisfaction scores are very low with particular criticism surrounding management and current company direction and lack of trust in senior leadership."
bad,"Innovative? Think outside the box? Avoid ADP. It’s gheir way and their way only. They don’t embrace change. They don’t want suggestions to improve. It will get you into the unemployment line real quick, and they will cite “poor job performance” as the reason for eliminating your position. I had a slightly above average performance review weeks before being told my job performance was subpar. Huh??? If you are the type who can go to work and keep your mouth shut on everything about your job go to ADP. Otherwise avoid this company like the plague."
bad,"Bad management company "
bad,"Good Luck to you. its an ok place to work....."
bad,Very poor management of the retirement plans.  Too many left the company and ultimately required to reduce staff.  Very poor at adapting to change.  Too many changes in leadership.
bad,It truly depends on who you report to and if this person likes you. If management likes you personally you can go far. But if you are not in a clique then things will be hard to moce around and do well. I have personally seen where mgmt would block someone from leaving the dept for another role. For some the dream works and you will he really happy. For others you will  either stuck and miserable or leave.
bad,"Salário abaixo do teto de mercado, e os descontos são todos o valor máximo, muita iniciativa interna para a empresa parecer boa, mas é tudo mais do mesmo, pois não existe a opção participar ou não, oque gera um imenso desgaste."
bad,"Very fast paced environment with unreasonably high quotas after your first year. Fighting with and losing deals to other ADP employees because there are multiple people/offices working the same accounts. If you want to advance, you don't have to be smart or hard working. Just flirt with or be related to management."
bad,"Poor training, pay doesn't match requirements of the job. Low possibility for career advancement and pay increases are almost none (2% per year). Management keeps changing their expectations and procedures making performance almost impossible."
bad,"ADP really sells you in the interview stage but working there is a nightmare (unless you want to be a sales person). You are constantly hounded about meeting your metrics everyday which includes calling 100+ already angry customers. When you don't hit your metrics, you are shamed in a company meeting and metrics are put in the screen in front of the entire company. "
bad,Worked in a call center for 11 years.  Its a great company if your manager is on your side to move you along and care about your development.  They say they care but the will nit pick at everything then get rid of you.  I was there 11 years and all of a sudden I wasn't doing my job well.  Somehow I made through 10 year end with no issues and all my clients love me.  They never had to call back and complain I didnt complete their request.  Upper management had the new college grads listen to calls and have the college kids fire all tenure assoicated there.
bad,"I thought I was starting a career with this company; instead I was baited, promised big incentives, but only stressed & overworked... With a lot of micromanaging sprinkled in!"
bad,"ADP's COS division needs an outside, professional vendor to access and conduct management training. Specifically, employees that are promoted to management without prior experience."
bad,"A typical day is meeting with clients, banks, CPAs, and some targeted prospecting for new accounts. Pulling referrals is huge and you are basically on your own. Must be a self started start-up attitude. You'll get training but must be quick, otherwise you will get the AX."
bad,"Very fast paced company. More reactive to clients then proactive. Every job at ADP is hard and that is fine, I can live with that, ADP compensates very well. The lack of training, work life balance is not balanced at all, stress is through the roof and job security forget about it. I seen a whole team that was the number 1 team laid off from one day to the next. Restructuring is what they said. This company will mentally and physically drain you."
bad,"Management is terrible. They set you up to fail. All that matters is the numbers, not the employees. There is absolutely no communication. The quality assurance process is a joke."
bad,"ADP is a good company to get started with, but for me they aren't a ""forever"" deal. I haven't enjoyed the overbearing management and the lack of resources provided to employees."
bad,Recent changes in workplace culture let me to seek a change.  Consistently changing priorities with favoritism displayed on a daily basis resulted in extreme turnover rates.
bad,"If you plan on working in their client services department you might want to consider other options. It's underpaid, over worked, and stressful. It's nothing more than a corporate call center with very limited room for growth and majority of the supervisors are horrid. No compassion or real concern for their employees. You will work with countless clients that have no idea how to run general payroll "
bad,it was ok they had good jobs but the management was not good and thats why I left then I realized that this was not the place for me
bad,no chance for advancement with that company every year I was there it got worse I don't know if all branches of adp but Florence organization was turn over rate would be higher if it was for temp workers
bad,"When I joined ADP as a fresher , It was a good place to work. Situation became worse when Management of third party organisations ( Ex. WNS ) taken over management of ADP ( A captive unit). Management resources with previous experience with third party organisations focus more on cost cutting instead of bringing more business to offshore."
bad,"The type of workplace you wouldn't want your kids to work."
bad, The entering of client information into data systems. Entering of payroll into ADP. from faxes. co-workers were friendly and helpful.
bad,"The benefits are great, if you can get past the micromanagement.  Long hours, disjointed communication among other departments and general lack of humanity in the company.  Grueling work hours."
bad,Does not care if you have health issues. Pay is awful. Managers are not educated and want you to have certifications that they themselves do not have.
bad,"A typical day would include but not limited to:  Handling incoming and outgoing mail, Responsible for generating daily reports that include (TLM Report, Data Pool Report, Welcome Center Report, and Activity Log), Checking Tax Packets for errors and addressing them as such, Creating and Maintaining Welcome Packets, Shipping and Receiving, Responsible for maintaing meeting requests, Answering and directing phone inquiries, Assisting with Scanning and     /Linking documents as needed.  What I learned from this position is that when you have management that believes in your abilities it makes working any assignment, any workday that much more enjoyable.  My co-workers were very helpful if I had any questions and always had a team work ethic.  The hardest part of the job was working with other departments.  The other departments did not work well with each other.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the Req room they had for employees to enjoy if they needed time to think about solving a problem or just to relieve any stress from that day."
bad,"Working in client services is not a fun job. You are tethered to your desk in typical call center fashion, but you have people watching your every move. If you log off to make a trip to the restroom, be prepared to answer why you took so long and where you were. "
bad,I process payroll for National account typical day is fast paced with a lot of stress and not much support from managment. My co workers are all great its like working with friends and family and even though we are all stressed out we are all together helping each other the best we can. Also since this is a payroll company there is no vacations from November thru February and expect to work several hours of OT as well around QTR and YE. 
bad,"High Activity, High Transaction"
bad,"All though I absolutely loved my job, the people were nearly impossible for me to please. I am high energy and very social, they prefer you to be a worker bee. They say its okay to ask questions, but don't do it. I was actually warned of that by an employee before I hit main production, but I disregarded it. I don't want to drag on, so to conclude, I got put on a final written notice right of the bat for a laundry list of things that included, wearing to much cologne, wearing my hat inside, beat boxing at my desk, oh, and the one that really irritated me, they put I was distracting other agents just to see if I could. Give me a break!"
bad,Managers are rewarded for being hardnosed and not for their productivity.
bad,"The company does not live up to it's values. There is a high discrepancy between departments in terms of pay, advancement and recognition. The upside is that there is a gym and excellent physician on site."
bad,A negative and toxic environment. Management held people down who were qualified and instead promoted people based on nepotism and social cliques. Not good.
bad,"Management fails to retain top talents"
bad,"Hardest part of the of the job was dealing with managing the corporate hierarchy. They are trying to adjust the way they operate, but its not there yet."
bad,It is a lot of electronic communication and not enough face to face. I liked the people who worked there but they felt their pay was not enough for the workload they were given.
bad,The supervisor Nd group leads has they pick and choose there other then that it’s a straight job the work is okay nothing really hard sometimes the group lead pick wit ppl for no reason if they not really cool with you like that
bad,I felt they were ok until I really got into it. People will set you up and have you blackballed because they are scared you will take their position. Its enough for everyone to eat
bad,Cube farm churning it out as fast as they churn it in.  Adding enough characters to have this count because there really isnt a lot else to say that would make this a better review.
bad,"Although my time was brief at ADP due to a budgeted contract I did notice the mistreatment of people by some of the managers. I felt people were promoted without the proper training and often lacked soft people skills. I heard people being yelled at, managers treating staff as if they were invisible.  Staff was afraid to speak-up due to possible lash-back or retribution."
bad,"I was not paid fairly, nor given ample opportunity for growth.  The company was diverse, but I don't feel was fair in promoting minorities, or females."
bad,The new General Manager changed a lot if things that affects the incentive and perks of ADP Phils.. We back to a traditional call center I dont feel that we are an inhouse KPO anymore.. And they dont care if good and performing people go they dont value the tenure of associates.. if you got promoted the increase is too low.. I hope it will change soon!!! I dont recommend this company anymore
bad,Working with ADP was not pleasant. I felt like I was walking on eggshells every day. The work environment is not at all welcoming. It's very stressful.
bad,"If you are looking for a 1st job out of college where hard work and dedication should put you in a position to get promoted, this isn't it. You will be lectured every week about how lucky you are to work there and how much opportunity there is to advance your career while there is none. 1 employee has been promoted since ADP Tucson has opened in 3 years. You will be payed a low, hourly salary to work in a glorified call center where people constantly try to steal deals from you due to weak corporate policy. Management actually supports unethical behavior to the point of turning a blind eye to client outbound representatives lying to customers to get them to sign to hit the number. Unethical behavior is not only opposed, but encouraged to increase sales. It's disgusting. "
bad,Different roles make a huge difference in work/life balance. The ability to work remotely has been a huge bonus but I have heard that is going away in the near future.
bad,Bad Management Culture and there is a lack of empathy. Bad behavior from the senior managers was tolerated and lower level employees felt disrespected for their work.
bad,It's good for Freshers. Top Management is very bad. They don't value tenured associates. Lot of politics while giving promotion. Layoffs happens regularly.
bad,"Provided support for Sales Group throughout the US."
bad,Only interested in sales. Use scare tactics to make these sales. More concerned with numbers & money than anything (or anyone) else. High turnover & everybody lies.
bad,"When I was hired, my recruiter had told me and another girl hired at the same time that we would be hired in within 3 months tops, as opposed to being contracted. I asked several times during that first training week typically how soon does the company actually hire? I finally got an honest answer towards the end of the first week, and the answer was 1-2 years maybe. Can't trust a company that lies to you when it hires you. I was working along side others making quite a significant bit more than I was, with full benefits and paid time off. The other poor girl that was hired in with me was making $3 less than I was and she was doing the exact same thing as me, so really no rhyme or reason for pay scale for contractors.  The work is extremely stressful, and an 8 hour day would go by in what seemed like 2 hours. The only thing that I liked was that if I had an appt., I could comp the hours by either coming in early or staying late."
bad,"Everyone at ADP is very nice, but the culture is very much embedded and will not change. Execs look for someone to blame, people who have been there forever will not consider changing to a more customer-focused culture. Lots of words, no action."
bad,Training and education is highly regarded at ADP. ADP tries to keep up to date with the latest in technology to drive HCM. Culture needs to go back to being more family oriented.
bad,ADP was a great place in certain departments. Changes in management can leave a bad taste with what they bring to the table versus what employees really need to succeed in roles. Training was very lacking.
bad,"When I started it was very good.  Over time however, it became dubious as to whether you would keep your job."
bad,Company was great for awhile until I realized that promotions only come to those who talk big and are best friends with management. If you make a mistake it will be held against you months. Training is hard to find.
bad,"The call center worker is exactly as you would imagine.  The 4 month turnover is 90%.  The call center worker is at the bottom of the organization chart.  There i no opportunity for a pay raise as a call center worker.  The only way that workers are rewarded is that the better workers get first choice of overtime or not being forced to take time off when volume is low or doing organizational jobs that do not involve answering the phone.  i was one of the people that almost never forced to take time off and received overtime any time it was available but i always hated the unfairness and I know that many quit because of it.  There was no mechanism to report errors in the documentation that tens of thousands of people worked from.  It was expected that everyone work around errors and remember that they were in fact errors.  The bandwidth that the call center worked thru was small enough that any app that was idle for any length of time was ended, sometimes requiring log in multiple times during a single call.  The call center environment for many in the call center that I worked is was a pleasant environment as they had reasonable amounts of time between calls and an overall reasonable work load.  The group that I worked in answered one call after another all day with no time between for months at a time. The only thing free at the site was the water fountain.  For most there was no way to conduct necessary business during the year and accumulate vacation as there was only 20 hours of personal time per year to do so.  If a worker was not at work after the 20 hours they automatically"
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Overworked, not truly about employees family, very underhanded, constantly changing,  poor upper management."
bad,"ADP is a good place to work, but the pay was low.  Not much room for advancement.  They have an onsite cafeteria with low prices and a workout room, nurse on site, etc."
bad,More than 50 hours per week with no comp off time. Preference given to Brazil. Work from home option depends on Managers.Disturb family life. Managers expect us to work in the weekend.
bad,"ADP is an easy place to work as long as you don't mind giving out incorrect information, and being yelled at 8 hours a day by the employees you are serving. Of course I wouldn't be happy either if I was given incorrect information."
bad,"Everything is done remotely - HR, IT, etc.  Never sure who was in charge.  The bosses were in New Jersey.  The onboarding processes was non existant.  I felt like I had to learn everything on my own.  It's good that I'm highly intelligent.  I was an employee for six months, and never got set up with programs/software/databases and passwords that I needed to function."
bad,"Provide support to sales, team members in Augusta and India. Working on manual compensation tasks that could not be done in the commission Oracle system. Lower management would listen to suggestions to make improvements. Was able to work remote"
bad,"I was there for few moths, I don't have a real opinion  about this company, no contract no benefits independent contractors"
bad,Always fighting other sales people over work you have done.  Management hands were tied of poor sales strategy.  They did not reward the people that did the work but others who had nothing to do with the sales process
bad,"good starting job. not the best place to stay. "
bad,They don't award or try to keep or retain top talent. They basically demand you to work overtime all the while cutting you commission earned to make you work harder and get paid less.
bad,Lack of orgnization and planning. The interview was not clear of what my job title is where I was hired and not knowing what really to expect. The company was going through a lot of changes I felt they were not ready for.
bad,"Tied down to the phone no matter what your role is at ADP. Fast paced work environment that demands multi tasking, problem solving skills and a lot of apologizing for payroll errors."
bad,"Long hours, no management support or HR support.  "
bad,I would not recommend working at ADP for you have other options. If this is one of your only option I would only recommend doing so to get started on your career.
bad,"Great place to receive sales training and experience but it definitely comes at a high cost of stress and tough work-life balance. Commissions are capped at times and ADP is so saturated it is extremely competitive within the company not only between your peers and team members but also with ADP inside sales teams and other offices in nearby cities. Great benefits but the pay is not stellar compared to the hard work and extremely high expectations that are placed on you with daily, weekly and monthly quotas. The ADP experience can be vastly different depending on which geographical location you are working in. The Orange County office is micro managing with a lot of unnecessary sales meetings and time wasted on redundant trainings. The culture is all about partying and drinking. This job is not for everyone."
bad,"empty promises and false incentives - no work life balance - do more, more, more - we would be happy to take the credit for all or anything that you do - unless it is less than 100%"
bad,"IF you are form premium colleges then dont go to this place as it is exactly the big brother of consultancy firms like tcs and infosys. "
bad,Hanover office is in desperate need of facelift. Cafeteria is terrible and small. Mgt doesn't seem to care much and most of the FPA functions are in India. My boss was terrible and said I lacked initiative but she was never around to provide any direction! To make matters worse I was terribly overqualified for this temporary assignment.
bad,"If you want to sell your soul to the devil ADP is the place for you! There is no such thing as work/life balance as you are expected to work or at least be on call 24/7 even if you're on vacation. Literally when you go on vacation your manager tells you to take your laptop! They seem to hire leaders externally rather than promoting from within therefore the poor leaders fail because they don't understand the business. The systems in use are so old and clunky compared to the competition and it is very hard to convince customers they're getting their money's worth. Staff are poorly trained. Lay-offs are frequent. The culture is ""it's not my job"" to avoid ownership or responsibility. If a project should take 10 people you can expect 5 to be available eventually. Clients are leaving in droves. In an effort to save money they are expecting associates to just pick up the slack and work 12 plus hour days instead of 10 hour days. It is abysmal with 70% turnover rates in many areas of the organization. Literally RUN!!!"
bad,Management counts key strokes to be sure you are being productive.  Hourly position with no overtime.  Advancement is not available thus turnover is high.
bad,As i Joined ADP as my a fresher I have learned many things when has helped me to enhanced my skills. I have learned end to end US payrolls . The hardest part of the job is compensation and growth.
bad,"ADP is doing away with remote positions, so do not apply if you are looking for that. They are changing the metrix for service reps to be more quality driven and not so numbers driven, so we will see how that goes. There are a lot of people who complain."
bad,"Sales is a competitive environment, and no one needs that reminder daily.  It seems like this company is less interested in protocols or training, but more interested in pushing fresh names through to enable a churn and burn kind of mentality.  Did not seem like there was much of an opportunity for success without it being predetermined first."
bad,"Leadership says they want change but then do not empower or enable their team members to actually do it and are wholly out of touch with what it takes to change a static and slow moving organization.  Ideas are top down, and you do best if you agree with whatever your leader has to say.  Recent changes in leadership have promoted the most exemplary 'yes men' to executive leadership positions, and their primary focus is making themselves look good in front of the new president.  Big egos, arrogance and scant on new ideas, the leadership in field enablement (and service) are singularly focused on old ideas and get their teams to act on them, piling more and more work on to people that are maxed out.  If you disagree, it doesn't bode well for you.  But, if you have a great idea, they appropriate it as their own and don't share credit.  "
bad,"Decent job.. treated only on your numbers. They say Integrity is everything but it's clearly not at all.. Like I said, numbers numbers numbers. A lot of work required for the pay."
bad,Staff are overly worked and highly allocated. Chances of advancement are minimal and clients are unhappy with the systems. Issues take weeks to be fixed which decreases the client satisfaction and increases staff stress.
bad,"OK company"
bad,12/hour and you may never get hired! It's very political and the pay and commission structure sucks. Everyone who works here is beautiful and well dressed - if you're not then you won't get hired. sorry ugly interns better work your just off or get REAL lucky.
bad,Provides much to learn relating to Taxes and HR management. Trains employees on all payroll and tax aspects. Paid training
bad,"ADP used to be a company that focused on employee satisfaction as much as customer satisfaction.   Now it's all about how much money they can make out of each employee.   If you are hourly you are not allowed to work OT to get items resolved, but are looked down upon my management for not getting them done.  For this reason a lot of hourly employees end up working late off the clock.  ADP of all companies should know that this is illegal.  If you are salaried, you get roped into the job with a high bonus and good pay.  They tell you it's a 40 hour job and sometimes you will end up working up to 50 hours if there are client issues or if it's a heavy time of year.  Once you are in you find out that the pay raises are often a fraction of a percent and the bonus percent goes down along with making it more difficult to earn a bonus at all.  They now expect a 45 hour per week minimum.  Promotions are a thing of the past.  I frequently mentor people who are a level above me.  I do appreciate my job, but I'm starting to look elsewhere."
bad,"its a nice company."
bad,"I dont have much to say since i only worked there 6 mths at the Diamond Bar office, they ended up moving the positions to India"
bad,There is politics in management.no transparency in appraisal.
bad,"There is no ""typical day"", which is what I enjoy. You never know what types of cases you will get to handle on a day-to-day basis. "
bad,"ADP's mantra should be ""save a dollar, lose a client"".  Its all about cost cutting and making sure the shareholders are happy.  While I am not against bringing in college grads to augment the workforce, as young blood is needed to keep the ideas fresh - replacing veteran personnel with years of knowledge and experience with someone with little to no experience is a burden on existing employees.  Additionally, this lack of knowledge and experience doesn't bring much to the table when its crunch time to get things done - and that is expected as soon as you hit the ground here.  Learning curve?  Pfffft.  Why can't a college grad run a project for upgrading internal infrastructure? *rolleyes*"
bad,Overall some areas are good some areas are ok to work. Many managers are very eager to do a good job and to assist your career objectives.
bad,"Poor Management, Do not value work life balance. Too much work for little pay."
bad,"Stressful, no work-life balance.  Intense work days with very long hours."
bad,- Cold Calls all day
bad,"I do enjoy work with this company, ADP, but they laid me off with unexpected."
bad,"what I learned is although they speak of customer service being their focus, this was not necessarily true. in any call center your focus HAS to be meeting their numbers. meaning you arent llowed much time for restroom breaks, you have to make sure you take calls as quickly as possible. its a continual process of keeping up with this numbers game that is impossible to beat. its a very frustrating process and wears down on a person."
bad,"Worked here for 3 months on a 6-month contract. Despite the stellar performance of my training group, they terminated our contracts the week before Christmas without warning. The management could've let us know beforehand instead of beating around the bush. I wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy."
bad,"Muitas mudanças culturais o que traz oportunidade, mas muito desgaste do time."
bad,Il lavoro è bello ma non ben remmunerato . Va bene come secondo lavoro.
bad,Nice fun work environment with little opportunity for growth within my department either in salary or career. Management is very self serving but you can find great mentors if you really look. Great company overall but needs more opportunity to grow.
bad,Turn back. Don't do it! Long hours. The job is nothing but angry HR people yelling at you on the phone. It's a call center but they glorify it in the interview to trap people.
bad,"Adp pays well and offers great benefits but you earn them.  Very stressful and fast paced. ADP has been going through major changes the past couple years which are making it hard for employees and clients to be able to process payrolls correctly and easily.  Too many co-workers from other countries which made it hard to speak with and get help for something outside the box."
bad,"Used to be a great place to work, some place you could retire. Now, they don't care about your well being. NO LOYALTY. Will lay people off who have been there 10,20, 30 years with no recognition of their contribution.  Its all about the money period. Very unstable management - changes constantly. You never know when you will be let go.  They will tell you one thing in your interview, a year later you won't be doing anything like what they told you.  Its sad really that they have turned into this messed up corporation. 5 years ago my opinion would have been more positive, but what after what I have seen and been through I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.  Sorry ADP -value your associates-because without them you are nothing."
bad,"Oh I could go on and on about ADP. First of all, they won't negotiate your salary with you; even though both you and they provide a range during the interview process. Secondly, the training takes FOREVER. They literally train you for 8-10 weeks before you do any actual work and that just puts a damper on you wanting to provide any kind of value in a job. Then, they will not promote you unless you stay in your position for AT LEAST 18 months. Sorry, I have higher ambitions than to hang around in a job for new graduates for a year and a half before any lateral or promotional movement. Lastly, the benefits are terrible. $150 BIWEEKLY for a single person for a PPO...and that doesn't include dental or vision. Insane. 2 weeks PTO, 1 week float (which expires at the end of the year) and 1 week of sick. Oh and by the way, there are blackout periods for time off; so say goodbye to spending time with your family on the holidays. The ONLY good thing about this job are the people you work with."
bad,I was an associate district manager for the small business payroll division. Lots of cold calling. Driving around knocking on doors. If you want a career in sales than I totally recommend it but if sales is not your ultimate aspiration then don't work here.
bad,So many chiefs but no real vision or leadership. You'll get on a call with multiple team leaders but no one actually takes the lead. Upper management is invisible.
bad,"Once it is discovered that an employee is competent, the shovel comes out. The employees are so swamped, they can't help their clients. I'm not surprised that my external experience as a client is even worse than when I was an employee."
bad,"When I started working at ADP it was fun.  By the time I was let go because my job was move to another city the hours were long especially at month, quarter and year end.  There was lots of stress to get the job done."
bad,You have to work there over 2 years to get an actual job if you do not have a degree. YOU may have mastered the job but they take all the life out of you by making you jump hoops. I had to get away from that place.
bad,Management does not know how to properly communicate or lead their teams. Some the of the managers are rude and talk down to the associate.  Some managers rate the associates based on if they like them personally or not and instead of on their professionalism/skills as they should.
bad,"I worked for ADP for 13 years. The position was interesting and challenging for the first 5-7 years, after that it was the same thing day after day.  Management of that team changed and went down hill."
bad,"The overall organization focused on providing great benefits to its employees and supported charitable missions.  However, the Pasadena Innovation center was managed separately from the company, hence the environment functioned as a start-up organization with minimal resources, processes, and tools."
bad,"Fun atmosphere, productive environment,  stressful at times.  Try to make fun atmosphere, worked well.   Enjoyed working there for the most part.  Excellent benefits."
bad,I have to many complaints to list.. Im just not happy with this department.hard work goes un noticed. management lies which cause an un trust about the department
bad,"II appreciate this company for all of the opportunities that it has afforded me, however, I would not return. Like many things in life, all things have the good and bad. I value my quality of life above all else."
bad,"in-fighting and bullying at the most senior levels pretty much says it all. Execs are so busy trying to look good they really don't care what it takes. No promotions, no real feedback."
bad,"Great place to work with excellent training. ADP fosters a great culture and there are opportunities to advance your career within sales if you are successful and if you have a strong ""brand""."
bad,It's a real boys club there where Upper Management is hired based on WHO you KNOW and not WHAT you KNOW - management doesn't work with the employees to better enhance the workplace.
bad,"Decent first job out of university, steep learning curve. Once you gain the necessary skills get out."
bad,A great company. I love what we do. I feel like the VP at the St. Louis location is a bit hard to work with. My co-workers are amazing! the SE's are amazing. You do have to train on your own at least in the situation I am in.
bad,"ADP is mismanaged from the top down, their systems and people that run them are behind the times. They should change their name from ADP to MDP because hardly anything is automated."
bad,"Client Service Representative (French and English speaking) : "
bad,"I'm not pleased with ADP, since I was a loyal to that company when I was there and then they took all our jobs over seas.... I planned to retire there."
bad,ADP is a very unpredictable environment.  You need to agree with your leadership and/or management.  No clear vision of where the company is headed for the layman within the company.
bad,"Roles/ Responsibilities: Technical PM, Iterations Manager, Release manager"
bad,"Poor work environment with lack of leadership. ""Boy's club"" mentality."
bad,Bad management. not much room for advancement. Wrong mentality.
bad,"En effet, tout dépend du poste, du management et de l'équipe que l'on intégre!"
bad,ho sempre trovato posti dove non sono mai stati rispettati i pagamenti.
bad,Co-workers are more then willing to assist you with daily to daily activities and new procedures.
bad,"The company itself is a great business to work for. One of their biggest perks is their sponsorship in the improvement of employee morale by offering resources and tools for career advancement. That said, I’ve never worked anywhere where employees are as unflattering to the values ADP displays as with the location in Augusta, GA. At the Augusta, GA location there is no formal training offered to current /new employees. This creates HIGH errors which could be prevented with knowledgeable leadership. There are many associates in positions who do not have the ability to even use a desktop computer effectively to perform important job duties. At this location I’ve experienced many hostile environments, non of which I’ve been involved, but have viewed with much disgust. Favoritism and bullying is often demonstrated in place of respect and teamwork. Job security is demonstrated as not helping others or helping to throw others ""under the bus"". This particular location comes with a call center atmosphere-flaws and more. There are many other distasteful acts by management and supervisor as well as other leadership associates that come with this territory as well. IN A NUT SHELL: THIS LOCATION IS ALL BELLS AND WHISTLES…TIME OUT FOR SOME OF THE FOLKS THERE."
bad,"All about the bottom line. Employees are overworked and underpaid. Company tries to live off name and reputation. Benefits have doubled in out of pocket expenses. Recognition is minimal. Exceptional work is rewarded by benefitting other departments such as Sales and Management. Typical day includes being assigned 10 hours worth of work, to be finished in 8 hours, with OT not being ""in the budget"". Most co-workers start excitied to have a job and to be working for a stable company like ADP. Within 4-5 months, attitude drastically changes."
bad,Love the benefits & the people.  The structure is sales driven the product isn't as advanced as advertised which makes it really hard to satisfy a customer which in turn makes it hard to meet quota and causes way too much stress.
bad,Enjoyed working with colleagues within the department and outside of the departments. Management is transparent on company's future but layoffs were difficult to swallow.
bad,"Tough entry level sales job, door to door outside sales with a lot of cold calling involved. Teaches you how to get through tough times and excel but there are better options today to get started."
bad,I worked at ADP for almost 12 years. I'm thankful for the job and met great people.  Upper Management and HR are horrible. I was reporting to a director who only helped employees who praised her.
bad,ADP does a horrible job of training their new associates. Very often client assignments are based on unrealistic ratios from finance resulting in inexperienced consultants responsible for way too many very demanding clients. The result is a horrible client / employee experience. Never have I worked at a place where a negative NPS score is accepted as normal. My thinking has always been if you take care of the client all else will fall into place. ADP consistently focus on the investors at the expense of a consistent quality experience. Hopefully they wake up before the good people there are all out of work.
bad,"good first start. Be prepared to work hard. Ok benefits and culture. "
bad,"ADP will burn you out. There is a long running joke that the only way you get paid what you're worth at ADP is if you go to another company and then come back. There is opportunity to move up within the company but as I said, you'll never be paid what you're worth, will never shed your previous job responsibilities, and will end up miserable. The culture is entirely based around meeting numbers so executives get their bonuses instead of making intelligent decisions for the future of the business and taking care of the people that actually do the work. If you plan to work at ADP have an exit strategy so you can move on to another company that won't suck out your soul."
bad,"Good to learn some basics if you have no previous experience with SAP and administrative, but that is it. In recent years company does not value reliable employees and their hard work, yet relies on reliable employees and their hard work (which is necessary), management not interested in people or having bad people strategy. Lots of good people leaving after some efforts having realised this, with departing seniors ever-rise of demands and workload on the remaining less and less senior employees."
bad,I didn't really like being here because I had no work to do and no one was there to help me. I would spend my time talking to the co-workers who been there for years and see what they had to do. I would also look around the computer trying to learn the job on my own since I didn't have anyone to train me.
bad,"Werken op een afdeling bij ADP kan als zeer intens en productief worden ervaren. Het is een no nonsense bedrijf waar klagen niet wordt beloond. Je moet doen zoals je wordt verteld en overwerken wordt vooral gewaardeerd, kan je niet op kantoor blijven om over te werken dan neem je uiteraard je laptop mee naar huis en dan ga je thuis verder. Niemand durft er wat van te zeggen en iedereen gaat maar door. Managers en supervisors zijn niet te vertrouwen en de HR al helemaal niet. Een tip voor nieuwe werknemers doe wat je wordt verteld, klaag niet bij collega's, neem werk over van anderen en bewijs jezelf."
bad,"There's no defined work for a BI developer. People have to find their own work somehow. So, mostly it'll end up in snatching works from others and blaming for the smallest mistakes. Leadership is equally confused of the roadmap."
bad,"Culture more attractive to young professionals as their first job after college. Not the most mature and professional environment, poor compensation structure."
bad,"everything is Disney happy and if you're in a call center expect to stay there until you quit"
bad,It was a job that I enjoyed until outsourcing was the order of the day. Gave me a good chance to learn and advance while I was there. Very bad ending for most finance associates.
bad,"Not much of a family oriented company in the department ( SBS ) I work in. There are multiple occasions where you have to choose between family and work and more than likely ADP always wins. "
bad,"Received excellent job experience and able to become a subject matter expert in the business processes. Learned many different technologies. Management was very hardcore and unfriendly at times, but that goes with the new territory of wanting to be like a high tech startup. Culture was casual."
bad,"If you choose to work for ADP, you can earn a decent salary with great insurance benefits. You will not get rich working at ADP.  Pay raises of 3 percent per year or less are standard. Plan on working long hours and expect no job security. There are great learning opportunities, so take advantage of them and try to learn as much about the business as possible. Those who succeed with the company remain flexible and move into multiple positions throughout their career."
bad,"They start off sheltering you. Quick to tell tenured associates not to say anything to new hires that might scare them. They like to keep them in this protected bublle until released to the hounds(the phones) Then starts the unrealistic expectations. Somehow you are supposed to take call after call, work your cases, keep yourself in ""Go Ready"" and not aux to finish work, not let your Resolution time of cases exceed 3 days, answer client emails, and know how to do the clients job as well as your own all at the same time. We used to be able to work Overtime to finish our work which offset the workload. Now with new management, that isn't even possible. They get free extra labor from you by assigning you to a ""resolution"" team or ""stretch"" assignment that is really more work but the same pay. They constantly judge you based on perception but never actually have a conversation on your issues. They hire managers that are out for themselves and push work on you and then blame you when it cannot be done. Not to mention the numerous tenured employees who are opting to either go to their competitors or take early retirement. ADP Norfolk is dragging ADP under and they are losing money. Anyone there over a year is leaving and they are doing nothing to retain employees. Please. If you value your sanity, dignity, and health, RUN!!"
bad,A typical day of work for a implementation is too busy. The volume of the accounts to attend is too high and this affect the efficiency of the attention to the client need during the process
bad,"No one is able to catch up on their work because more is constantly being added, and new hires are no where on the horizon. The training is so bad, even account managers who have been at the company for years are confused."
bad,"Lots of politics amongst the sales leaders and who they choose as their favorites. More attention needs to be paid to everyone's success  - better more experienced managers are necessary to do this. Also, time off is an earned privilege-  don't make it seem like it's a burden for your staff to take the time off they need. We are human beings not robots. The benefits are fantastic and they pay is decent for Small business but more time can be spent developing and retaining talent. More attention needs to be paid towards your staff mental health - there are people suffering from severe anxiety and are looked down upon as weak. Try and understand your sales staff better"
bad,Typical large company that doesn't really care about individual employees. Also a poorly documented environment such that every time an application failed it took way too long to resolve and added to the stress level.
bad,I believe that there are certain areas of ADP that function great and there are areas that need a great deal of improvement. A typical day at ADP can be very busy. At the end of the day the work needs to be done. I believe that management need to listen to the Payroll representative more since they are the one that have day to day contact with the clients.The hardest part of my job is not having all the tools that I need to make my job function better. The most enjoyable part of my job is that my team work together as a family. We can really depend on each other.
bad,I will not give any good or bad reviews for this company. I am no longer employed due to  cut backs....I do not like to talk about a former place of employment
bad,"typical wok day at ADP was answering a high volume of calls support the needs of major accounts offer technical payroll support run and itemize GL reports, set up 401k calculations, benefit accruals, state ans federal garnishments and all other payroll deductions."
bad,"Right place for you if you are settled in Hyderabad or near Pune and need a job to get by."
bad,"This is not a very dynamic workplace, and learning can be very slow for an eager learner. Salaries are comparable to industry. Culture is pretty laid back, and the work-life balance is good. Management is just ok, but don't expect a lot of mentoring etc. Employee engagement is limited to two mega events held every year. "
bad,"lots of cold calling at first, minimal training after corp training, not the most friendly place to work in south florida.. lots of office politics. business to business sales"
bad,"Good place to work, but there is no potential for growth here. Available for entry and exit only. Candid management. Not easy to co-exist because of the apparent hierarchical environment."
bad,"Lots of areas for a person to work. Need to be a self teacher, with discipline as most people work from home. There are wrinkles that need to be irone"
bad,"Overall the sales department was a fun, motivated, fast paced environment. Great initial training. Your typical day as an ADM was prospecting new business and meeting with clients."
bad,over worked and not paid enough. seen as a number not a person. no job security
bad,"My experiences at ADP were disappointing, considering this was a company that I had always wanted to work for. They provide a great company name, with no solid backing in terms of management, support, training, or upward mobility.  The management was not concerned about their employees or how to make the department or processes better, as they were extremely hands off, until something happened which required them to place blame. Additionally, they provided no solid training on systems, and lacked structure of procedures for completing job duties. This leads to failure from the beginning, and nobody helps to pick up the pieces. For as big of a name as ADP is, I would have thought that the departments would hold the same standards."
bad,I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. Poor teamwork and training. Work/Life balance does not exist.
bad,"whatever you do, make sure you reach goals. there is a ""do whatever it takes culture"". immense pressure to make sales. if not your lack of making goals is broadcasted to the entire region. so do what you have to do to either be a shining star or fly under the radar."
bad,People are great. Changes in mid-management makes thing inconsistent.  Case load and expectations create a lot of stress. Many tenured associates left leaving inexperienced (and lower paid) replacements.
bad,"Workplace Culture and management has miles to go to achieve perfection. The company env doesnt give you a feel of multi national, its more of a local due to lack of diversity in human resource."
bad,"The team leads and managers are hired with no real HR experience. Thier experience consists of call center management only. They cannot relate to their Hr professionals they manage. They can coach which is ""getting them organized and help prioritize "" which insults the Specialists because they were hired as professionals"
bad,"The job is 90% phone bashing, you sit in a cubicle farm and call people from a Salesforce list. They said it was 10% of the time but it wasn’t it was huge blocks of time hours and hours per day"
bad,"ADP seems to be stuck in a revolving door of changes. By the time it takes to implement a company wide change, another is on the horizon. Recently, many tenured associates have been laid off. Decent benefits in that they have options but they are not cheap."
bad,"Stressful environment"
bad,"A couple of people from my training group left before hitting their 6 month mark.. several others dropped off just after 6 months. I can boil it down to these reasons:"
bad,"no thing to say about this company really.  "
bad,Management uses fear and guilt to run their teams. Employees constantly stressed and fear that the end of the world will happen if dont hit quota. Often talked down to and micro managed.
bad,"I got let go, because one of the managers in the Payroll department on the 4th floor did not like that I complained about two team members using foul, harassing language. They also would describe their payroll clients poorly in front of their manager and he would let them."
bad,"It's a great place to work if you brown nose & are the managers' favorite.  Kind of hard to advance in the workplace when they prefer to promote their favorite person versus someone best qualified for the position.  Management doesn't know much & isn't much help.  So the consultants pretty much depend on each other to resolve client issues & concerns. It's sad how much ADP has changed over the years.  They used to really care about their employees & promoting the best & most qualified.  Now it seems like they don't care who they place in these different positions.  A lot of restructuring has been going on for the past few years, which is not a good look.  They used to hire people from outside with payroll experience.  Now they hire whoever at a lower pay rate & train them on payroll expecting them to be able to answer a client's payroll question.  It's not fair to clients that expect to be speaking to an experienced payroll specialist, etc & end up getting someone that doesn't even know what a W2C is.  It's not fair to clients.  They're expecting to get good quality service.  It seems like ADP is more focused on quantity rather than quality.  As a result, the turnover rate is horrible & clients are terming service left & right."
bad,"Depends on the individual , what are their requirements."
bad,"I believe this company has the potential to be a great company to work for, with that being said they need to revamp their management staff to be more forward thinking and not so old school. They were unwilling to think outside of the box when it came to closing deals or obtaining appointments with potential clients. They also show extreme favoritism to particular sales associates and they were not willing to split up territories fairly. Had company expense credit cards but were not able to use them to assist in closing deals; taking clients out to lunch, dinner, etc..."
bad,"Resources changed daily, leadership/management not forth coming with information, I enjoyed working and educating clients as well as having the access to research agency notices"
bad,"My time at ADP was not all bad. The benefits were decent and continued on the job training was great. After sometime management shifted, offshore employees replaced US employees and it wasn't a place I wanted to be."
bad,"ADP used to be a great place to work, however as time went on ADP felt the need to hire new management with a new direction that focused less on supporting internal associates."
bad,Great beginning job for Sales. Need to move on to advance career. Poor commission plan and need to differentiate in a field that has too many competitors.
bad,"metrics driven, they often hire contractors"
bad,ADP is more in interested in the bottom line and not job security for their employees that have been with the company for years.  Many employees located in NJ and other higher cost of living locations are losing their jobs that are being relocated to cities with lower cost of living.
bad,"This is for you if you have no expectations, no aspirations and are happy with the status quo. Cutting edge? No. Industry leader? No. Opportunities for advancement and additional pay are an illusion."
bad,"Moved job overseas, "
bad,"Although I feel the company is a good place to work, I feel that the job I am being asked to do is not in line with what I agreed to do when I signed on for the position."
bad,"the management at adp is wonderful, but as far as the training it needs to be more in depth. going through kelly services to have to job."
bad,"Great organization but there is no work life balance."
bad,"ADP had little if any connection with the holding that I was working for prior to the purchase.  They had no ability to or interest in speaking with us or working with us (my department) on any issues or activities, simply handed down instructions and left us alone."
bad,enjoyed the people I worked with but wouldn't work there again
bad,"Good pay but very biased work atmosphere.  Only helped who they""liked""and treated the rest like garbage.  Quotas based on tenure so they push you out via unachievable sales number unless your well liked or know someone in management. Very Cliquey culture too.  Commission was really good though but expectations were often unrealistic.  Micromanagement was also a problem"
bad,This job has the flexibility needed for working moms but if you're looking for somewhere to retire think twice. If you're looking to advance-think twice... very few ppl advance anywhere in this company. There is maybe 1 job that doesnt require you to be on the phone all day
bad,This company is very hot and aggravating. I feel this job is not so much of a loyal company. The work benefits are pretty good and reasonable. I don't care for the pay and feel that their pay is unfair.
bad,"I was hired on with the understanding, that I would be provided with training, however, that was not the case. I was there for an entire year and no training provided. I know a few people, who left ADP, because, they didn't have any training, nor anyone to teach them the job. I understand on the job training, learning on the fly, and just jumping in, which I'm completely comfortable with, but there are times where structured training is needed. The compensation is great, but most don't know their jobs and just have to wing it. People want to feel knowledgeable, about the job they perform on a day to day basis. The culture here is really backwards and dysfunctional."
bad,"The people you work with can be great, but management is a bit lacking.  I could tell I was just a number while working here instead of an actual person.  My manager was so bad he didn't even realize I wasn't there one day when I totaled my car on the way into work, even though I called and left him a message telling him what happened.    It's a big company and you can tell that with all the decisions that are made from higher up that apply company wide instead of based on the team or products you work on.  Wasn't upset when I left."
bad,"the people that would help were great, just not very many. the employees are left to figure it out for themselves. i did 7 years and I i can not do any more. the dept I am the people could care less about you."
bad,"Everyone in the office treated it like a dorm.  There are constantly balls flying around, golf balls being smacked across the office and dart guns being fired.  The culture was based on age and not on professionalism.  If you did not have some sort of social relationship with management after hours, the odds of advancing in the company were very slim."
bad,"Culture is very fast paced, and product knowledge is unreal.  No development, and best sales reps become managers. Loose with the rules, ""Bend the rules"" is in their hiring descriptions for what they look for"
bad,It was an ok environment to work in.  There is a lot of politics and they are way to concerned about how they are perceived as it relates to diversity being a priority.
bad,It took very long to get my environment set up due to the red tape there. Developers weren't admins on their own machines. Everything was behind in technology. They had bloat ware on their machines.
bad,"Worked there as a temp on contract. Was told they would be extending contracts at the end to try getting you in as an ADP employee, but they didn't. It's just a carrot they use to keep you around. I overheard one of the Sups tell somebody 'you need to know somebody to get a job here.' That seems to be the norm at this location. I did see several positions get filled by friends & relatives of people who worked in the dept I was in."
bad,Call center job not enough training long hours the job is not for everyone.  Long shift hours too far and it’s just data entry work for at least 10 hours a day
bad,"very good environment, All the staff managers are very close and friendly. Good managemnet. All staff are provided with good training."
bad,"I learned a lot while with ADP.  Money was good, benefits were good, but being lucky enough to land on a good team is the gamble."
bad,"co-workers were an exceptional part of our team, making the working day a pleasant environment supporting each other and providing assistance when required."
bad,"•	Demonstrated confidence, integrity, and commitment to customer service excellence."
bad,I worked for ADP for almost eight years and it started off as a great career however the company took a turn for the worse. They are money driven and do not care for the employees or even the clients. Retention is big for this company but they do this in the most reactive way.
bad,"In the office by 9, hit the phones for a few hours, set a couple appointments, & cross your fingers.  This is not the place for anyone who's afraid to cold-call.  The compensation isn't bad at all, but the products are tough to sell with their concept-based, ROI driven presentation methods."
bad,Long cycles and calling on companies with 1k employees and above.
bad,"They say it's not a call center until you start working there. It definitely is, you are at your cube most of the day. 30 minute lunch that is hard to manage due to everything being so spread apart (bathroom, cafe, etc). If you are promoted it is to another phone position since that is all that exists there. "
bad,"overall the management and coworkers are great! However, over the years the work / life balance has gotten worse and we are expected to put in 12 + hours and weekends during their busy season. which happens to be during the holiday season. Very sales driven and put in sticky situations to get the client on boarded so they can get their bonuses."
bad,Limited opportunities to grow within the company with false expectations set from Day 1. Revolving door with very high attrition and little attention on how to retain or promote talent within
bad,"They give you an opportunity to grow, but making it out of the apprentice role is sometimes not in your control fully. Fun work environment but mainly younger people and it doesn't allow you to be able to grow always."
bad,"Good company just need to manage associate utilization more effectively-min some process they bleed while others don't have work at all."
bad,Pay is not very competitive in the industry. bad work environment. just so so benefits. Work environment may or may not be flexible depending on the team you work in.
bad,"Great culture, great work, life, benefits- can't beat those two anywhere. "
bad,"I highly respected my manager but their internal HR support system is poor. Not enough training and the amount of pay for the level of expectation doesn't add up. It's a great company but again, has a lot of potential to be better."
bad,La supérieure hiérarchique était très bureaucratique.
bad,Asked several times during the interview/hiring process if I could work a set schedule 7:30-4:00 and was told absolutely by several people and then by my manager.   Then when it came time to get a client they issued one in a different part of the country and required me to work a not agreed upon schedule.
bad,"Moving up within your position, for example, from associate consultant to consultant, is based on merit. But moving up to a managerial position is based on favoritism."
bad,"Wanted to like it, however, management is not supportive. I  was always working alone as the staff was always gone for months at a time so taking time off myself was rare."
bad,"Pretty standard B2B position, except for the fact that you get to partner with banks and CPAs. You get the experience of completing a full cycle of a sale (finding the lead, pursuing it, negotiating price, and closing it)."
bad,Loved working there until they started laying people off and closing buildings.  Saving money is obviously the main focus of the company. They went to outsourcing to different countries for costumer service.
bad,"Learned a lot in my time there. Need to advance to a job with more opportunity. Set up many appointments for sales representatives on a daily basis, Clients, new prospects."
bad,"Require all ranges of experience to start at the bottom and ""work your way up"" must be a top performer and team player, must work overtime, slave to the clock and the phone, very little room for growth and lots of competition for the few spots that are available. Very common to have people be in the same position with no advancement for 5 or more years"
bad,The employees were great but the management was poor. My manager micro managed so it was a very stressful environment. We made outgoing phone calls all day to company owners in other states. Cold calls and current ADP clients were called in order to sell them additional ADP products. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great employees and the on-site parties
bad,"Not a bad place to work, but definitely needs improvement.  There is no management support.  They invest on manager training but do not allow the managers the empowerment to follow through on performance and evaluations properly."
bad,ADP was a great company to work for in the 80s and 90s. The corporate culture changed dramatically in the last 10 years. They no longer focus on client and employee satisfaction and only concerned about bottom line and cost cutting. American jobs are being rapidly eliminated and new hires are mostly offshore.
bad,If you enjoy working in a call center environment and being treated like a child who has to ask permission to go to the bathroom (very serious) and clocking in and out with strict breaks then ADP is for you.  Otherwise go into sales and you will get treated much differently.
bad,"Not very active to initiate anything, lack of communication and clarity of roles, too many changes without communication prioritized, not at all good at engaging or leveragig skills with zero trainings"
bad,This is a small company. The owner is amazing and I loved interning for her. The atmosphere was great and I enjoyed day working along side her.
bad,"Work Culture is good. Working in US Shift was the toughest part of this Job. There were days when I had to work in my normal shift an then extend working late nights to support US projects."
bad,"Bad managers are allowed to fester here; some great people too but many bad seeds spoil the pot. Bulletproof business model means nothing can change, ever. Great if you work in finance or law, risk-adverse fields; terrible if your job involves change, innovation or evolution. YOU WILL NOT WIN!"
bad,"This was my first experience with processing outsourced payroll.  Involved a lot of learning, cross training and communication."
bad,I would only recommend this company to people who are sales focused and don't care much about providing the best service.
bad,"Good benefits, great experience. Friendly coworkers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with customizations. Enjoyable part is satisfying the client."
bad,"This was a temp job for me. There was no challenge at this job at all. I had to much experience for this job, but it was the only job I could get at the time."
bad,"not challenging, no new ideas shared. it's a good solid business, but they don't seem to have done anything new in the last 30 years in the training department."
bad,"ADP has a great concept, but a hard sell to small business owners in this economy. Payroll is something they can do themselves instead of outsourcing. I felt like I was going in circles with these people and barking up the same tree. Was not in an enjoyable work environment."
bad,Good old boys club. Not feeling it at all.. You could make a lot of money or nothing.
bad,"Ik ben daar in een project binnengekomen. Project is van de grond gekomen, werkinstructie gemaakt, daarna ontslagen. Medewerkers zijn niet eerlijk, en liegen in je gezicht, wat ik een heel vervelende sfeer vind. Daarnaast begonnen ze met het salaris op 11 euro per uur, wat echt te laag is. Na gesprekken heb ik dit naar 14 euro kunnen verhogen."
bad,ADP is a wonderful company to work for. This job isn't easy but if you are willing to work you will see results in your success and eventually your pay.
bad,"work was pretty good, wasn't to much people was nice taught how to be fixable and do new things and the staff was nice. liked the job a lot"
bad,"This company rewards its employees, but you should only work here if you truly love sales. The stress of the job can get to you and they definitely push you."
bad,Answer calls concerning clients who are unable to use their funds in their account.  I learned that not all companies are honest places to work.  The co-workers were nice.  The hardest part of the job was to not walk out because everyones money is tied up for they cannot use their spending account cards and so the fsa employees answering the phones have to listen to all these terrible stories of the clients not being able to use the money they have set aside to use.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to work on the computers.
bad,Payroll is a very difficult to thing to sell. Most people are happy with their service and don't feel like switching. Quota requirements do not match the demand in Washington State. Hi turn over but great training.
bad,"A typical day includes working on back to back cases , tickets and helping clients with their issues."
bad,"I can't speak for the company as a whole, only the call center I was working in.  I did not like being tied to the timeclock with my every move being monitored.  How long you spent doing after call work, how many calls compared to your other coworkers, etc. Limited time to use the restroom and if you spent too much time on an activity someone would check to see ""if you needed help"".  Somewhat demeaning as we all worked very hard! Outdated and conflicting systems added to the stress."
bad,Its ok. Just not for me anymore. Use to be a nice environment and great workers to work with. Recently it has change over to another company and the culture has changed a lot.
bad,Poor Leadership CEO is not in touch with employees and they will outsource to India to save money even though the customer service suffers. Bonus first for the CEO
bad,Good company.No problem with work.Can get more knowldge from this company
bad,working for this company is a drag at times. The more you produce each year the smae amount you will make. they need to up the salary to keep people around.
bad,"No warnings, direct fire. Corporate does not care about mistakes, you lose your job without warning. Terrible feeling for employees. Do not recommend for long term careers unless in sales. Sales can be as erroneous as they wish without any punishment. There is absolutely no help for any other position in this company."
bad,"Its just a typical day at work, sometimes not to good or sometimes great, have good assocites who can make you smile and are goof with team work and have some who find any reason for you to leave."
good,"-Typical day is busy from 9am - 5pm"
good,"ADP, is an overall great company, however they have a high turnover rate poor support for aging employee's, a millennial environment. Fast pace culture with 18 month department transition expected. The hardest part of the job was working under management that may have a professional background in management but no direct knowledge of day to day processes. The most enjoyable part of the job was work with a manager who supported career growth and excellent to provide client services. In addition, to meeting company standards receiving two awards while employed in the 1st year, as well as working on implementation support projects."
good,"Overall bad workplace environment, sales get micromanaged and are dealt unrealistic quotas. Leadership does not care about their employees , only focused on the bottom line."
good,"I have no complaints about working here that I would like to advise anyone of on a social media board. "
good,"Préparer le matériel, les produits nettoyants, baliser les zones glissantes"
good,It has been a pleasure working for ADP I have been working for them about 3.5 years. The company offer great benefits alone with great vacation and PTO
good,"While ADP has  great benefits, they don’t pay nearly enough for the amount of stress the managers and clients put on you. If you don’t look happy all the time, or kiss up to all the managers, you will not advance. You will be told to look happier, or to talk more to colleagues about personal things, to seek more “human”. I loved my co-workers, but the managers were all in a very obvious clique, and if you didn’t tell them you liked their shoes you weren’t going anywhere."
good,"ADP is a great place to start your career and gain some experience. Their pay is really not competitive with industry standards, so get your experience and head somewhere else. Also, upper management does not respect the front line managers input. Training is ok but is moving to mostly a virtual training environment. "
good,"Enjoyed working with team mates, everyone was very helpful and cooperative especially since we all worked remotely and never met each other in person.  Good team spirit."
good,"Overall good, solid company.  Sales positions do not compensate very well.  Ironically, ADP does not really retain their employees - lots of churn. I say ironically because the solutions sold by ADP to their customers are designed to grow and retain their employees."
good,"ADP offers several benefits to new and tenured employees.  The health insurance is very expensive and the 401K match is average.  This is a good company to work for right out of college for a year or two but after that, there is no true advancement possibilities.  The culture is one of a ""place setter"" environment and the training  is nonexistent.  ADP likes to promote diversity however this company is not diverse in any way.  ADP hires the least experienced employees in order to pay the least amount of salary.  The company is driven by the bottom line and has unrealistic metric expectations for the employees. The call center environment is very stressful and the requirements placed upon you are unrealistic and not commensurate with the pay.  The company has managers with no payroll experience and those same managers micro manage all of the employees.  The PTO sounds nice but due to black out periods you are not allowed to take vacation during the normal times that most people want to take vacation.  If you are not a protected group, you will go nowhere in this company.  I would not recommend this company to work for unless you want to work long hours, receive little pay, have unrealistic metrics placed on you, be micro managed and have no work life balance what so ever."
good,This company provides stressful jobs with lack of support in management. It definitely makes it hard to have a family life or be active during the week.
good,"Not a nice company to work for they have no regard for you or your personal life."
good,"Very fast paced, high energy, dynamic workplace environment. High stress levels with numerous daily job functions/ duties."
good,"Empresa com excelente software de Folha de Pagamento, alto nível de aprendizado em relação ao programa."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of  logging  into our systems, check any previous cases that require Follow up, check emails, login to the phones start taking calls.  I learned a lot of information about Health insurances how they operate, also Payroll and how to calculate payroll. Mangement did not micromange and are curtios and helpful. Handeling calls  with very upset irate employees was difficult at times.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you helped people make the best desicions for themselfes and thier families reguarding best health options to choose."
good,"Adp is good place to work helped in all aspects ( work  and life balance, learnings, pay wise).very stable company .Some of the company policies are really very good like GMC ,REtention policy are really good."
good,"Management is not good, even HR also..salay as per market very less..there is absolutely no work life balance.. no opertunity for new learning.. there is no job security as well"
good,The training was the worst ever.  You learned on the job.  The work balance wasn't there.  The lack of support in order to service your clients isn't there.
good,It depends on what department you're hired in. Some departments are awesome the others are horrible. I was hired in a horrible department that wouldn't let me out.
good,"You need to be a part of the boys club to succeed, otherwise you aren't going to succeed there. Challenging yet rewarding job. Very transactional and number driven"
good,"ADP is known to offer a competitive salary and benefits but I was very unfortunate to wind up in an ""experimental"" LOB. The compensation was way too low compared to other LOBs. Even our on-shore counterparts and mentors were in shock to know what we were receiving."
good,"I don't really have a lot of positive things about this company so i would rather not say. "
good,"My typical day at ADP includes calling clients and offering definitive answers, renegotiating price, and retraining associates."
good,"Na minha avaliação, a empresa ADP do Brasil, é uma empresa estável, tem flexibilidade de horário, conseguimos desempenhar nosso trabalho com calma, os gestores são calmos e seguem uma cultura moderna. Tem muito treinamento. As pessoas se ajudam."
good,"Management is reluctant to push forward with change.  Difficult to advance.  Ability to move around, but management will keep you if they do not want you to move to a different position."
good,Co-workers are very nice and facility is nice. Work load was extremely stressful and not enough employees per clients.
good,"The business units has some great people, but the IT is full of rouge uneducated, inexperienced executives, who got into the company through reservations and made the IT department a nightmare for any new comers."
good,"You leanr alot but there is no growth in this company. The people are great but again, this company is only a stepping stone to real career opportunties."
good,"A typical day at work is ""putting out fires"". Culture at ADP is very reactive and not proactive. This is due to challenges with staffing as well as poor strategic managment. I have learned a lot due to these challenges and definately know what type of work environment is healthy and what type is not."
good,"ambiente molto silenzioso, si esige."
good,ADP is awesome to have on your resume but you will have an awful work life balance for minimum pay. Move as much as you can as.many times as you can..
good,"Training is rough, you spend a good amount of time figuring things out on your own. It's frustrating. Work-Life balance is constant struggle. You spend a lot of time stressing about your work load."
good,"Be ready to manage multiple clients with minimal training. Your immediate trainers and team leaders will be knowledgeable and helpful initially. However once training and the ""honeymoon"" periods are over, the managers then become impolite and unavailable due to their extreme workloads. Assistance and additional training for those that need it is next to none. Moreover, production and moving at the speed of business becomes more important than the staff's livelihood and work/life balance. I lost a parent during the time of my employment there. As an only child I had to take multiple days off work to handle my morbid business. Upon my return to work, I received no condolence or pardon. Contrastingly, the team's manager (initials GS) stated, ""If you were my employee, I'd a let you go a long time ago."" Implying that I was an employee of the staffing agency, K-Force, and not his direct hire. Moreover that my time away to plan my Mother's funeral was insignificant to the time/money he lost investing in me. I was too numb with grief at the time to care, fight, or show any emotion even at. Now that I think about it, I should've reported him to HR. Needless to say when my contract ended with K-Force, ADP nor K-Force reached out to me showing any concern and the had the nerve to try and fight my unemployment. Just a bad time for me..."
good,This place is okay. Training is terrible. Benefits are bad. I’ve had to go to Mexico to get meds and surgery to save money. Location is pretty but traffic is terrible near ASU.
good,Company cares more about cutting employees to meet profit margins than retaining good employees. Company retains contracted employees for most projects to avoid paying benefits.
good,When asking for assistance and clarification on instructions Management was unavailable and rude.  The task was difficult without the stress of an uncooperative manager.
good,"Answering phones, emails, and working on cases.  Constant phone calls and monitoring to ensure you are logged in and available to take calls and questioned if you are taking extra time to help clients."
good,"A ADP é uma empresa que não valoriza os funcionários, não há qualidade de vida e a demanda de trabalho é muito pesado na qual os gestores forçam os colaboradores a qualquer custo a cumprir os prazos nem que para isso custe a saúde do empregado, "
good,Much nepotism and lots of turnover. Not a lot of acknowledgement of tenured employees. Often outside associates are hired over promoting internal staff. Lately Six Sigma has become a priority and it is proven to hold little value
good,"A typical day at work is a bit overwhelming.  ADPIA renewal department layed off 5 associates that worked remotely and have not replaced them.  Then one of the associates resigned and they did not replace her.  They just keep giving us more not too concerned about the quality that is effected due to the triple workload."
good,"ADP is now very focused on streamlining and hiring millennials.No longer a viable company for long term employment. Because they do more with less, work life balance is non existent."
good,Company has forgotten about the employees. They only care about the profits. Management is not knowledgeable about the positions they oversee. Associates are not properly trained and expected to fix everything
good,"No Career Advancement, too many lay offs, too much politics."
good,"They are not set up under the same system for certified payroll so yes you have to now learn two different web pages and download more programs. There is a catch to this and you have to learn a completely different system. MY payroll use to take me an hour and now it is taking me 4 hours because of all the steps I now have to take, to input all the data. I would strongly discourage any small business to use these services."
good,"Good learning in any kind of role. Not so great at employee development or salary scales.              "
good,"As my first job out of college, ADP really challenged me to grow personally and professionally very quickly. It was very much a sink or swim position. You are there to manage a territory with many accounts. It was vital that you were personable,organized  and quick to plan. Everyday was different which I really enjoyed. It was a challenging environment with management and how ""corporate"" wanted things to happen."
good,"great benefits - medical, dental, vision, pension & 401K but the hours are long -not a good work/life balance. Corporate constantly changing initiatives and layoffs"
good,"Work life balance is zero first 6 months you will find it good then you will come to know its disaster, salary package offered is includes variable bonus due to that inhand salary is less that market trend"
good,"Very busy, many moving parts but well compensated. Learned to manage multiple and competing priorities. Great hard working people work there, enjoyed working with them."
good,"Company need to improve his compensation technics and transperancy in between business and employee, where employee can decide where to go ahead and improve his carrier."
good,"ADP is a great corporation to work for. The company has great benefits. The life balance is not so good. The management is not good at all, and need a lot of improvement."
good,"When I first started with this company, I was very pleased that it was a very client focused place to work.  We did whatever was needed to make sure the client was always well taken care of. "
good,"Point of contact for an assigned book of business for National clients in line with their business expectations.  Responsible for resolving issues, retention, annual enrollment, file integration with vendors and providing excellent customer service.  Worked within a team environment so it was essential to work as a team while servicing your own clients.  I learned it was paramount to gain your client's confidence with timely responses and resolving any issues that arise quickly."
good,Looking for new job to further my career.  Have experience managing in retail with union employees and working with ADP payroll products.
good,"Enjoy the people I work with. Good salary, but not awesome. Amenities on site are adequate. Must fall in line with corporate subculture in order to advance...but there are opportunities for lateral moves across the organization."
good,it's a good place to work on the phones but job security sucks because you could be working one day and then that night they call you and tell you you are fired and than you no longer have a job from that day on. Surprise!
good,"Great management, okay compensation, good benefits... recently going through restructuring, so you don't know if your job will be there or not tomorrow. High quotas result in terrible work/life balance."
good,You will make phone calls all day long. The base pay is low. Managers are rude and there is no room for advancement unless you kiss major butt.
good,On phone the entire time.  Like to do other things like projects and paperwork.
good,"A typical day of work involves taking inbound calls for 8 hours a day, with two 15 min breaks and a 30min lunch. We handle calls for the midwest so it stays pretty busy throughout the day."
good,"Favoritism throughout the company with team lead and managers, co workers, hours are not ideal at all, open 24 hours and no room for growth. have to work weekends and all holidays except for Christmas Day. The pay is good if your bi-lingual you can potentially make 10.50 an hour in starting maybe 11.00 depending on work experience.  "
good,have to go thru temp service and you don't get hired on. everyone has worked there on and off for over 2 years and still no one gets hired on so no insurance or don't get the perks a full time hired on worker would get.
good,"No support for sales. If you live in a state with only 20% of the marketplace believes in outsourcing its very difficult to convince someone to make the switch from keeping their ""back office"" in-house to outsourcing it to ADP"
good,"Troca muito os gestores, quando algo começar evoluir, o trabalho é interrompido  com novas ideias de novos gestores querendo mostrar serviço com algo que já foi entregue no passado. Criam vários programas internos para incentivar e engajar a equipe que está sempre cansado de andar em círculo!"
good,"Got a culture shock as compared to previous organization with 10+ yrs in  all aspects be it management, operations or support functions. Need a strong in house HR team to look into employee  connect as there is no system in place to measure employee goals and accomplishments"
good,"A typical day at work included managing projects, managing client relationships, analyzing day to day procedures, and improving processes. I loved the work place culture there was many event to create an ""ADP family."" I was unhappy with management because there was not room for growth."
good,"Set up new dept successfully for company and in 9 months the management positions were all eliminated and the market was dissolved.  Was never formally reviewed, but was given excellent feedback on performance.  Paid 1/2 month of severance.  Managed permanent and temp employees.  ADP uses lots of temps and lets many of them go.  70+ hours weeks in Dec and Jan."
good,"I have no comments about my tenure with ADP."
good,"Because of the huge disparity in salaries between exempt and non-exempt, it's almost impossible to be promoted, as it would cause more than a $10k increase in pay."
good,Someone should look into age discrimination.  They are focused on getting tenured higher salaried people out.  Not a place that cares about its people.  Definitely a change over the last 8-9 years.
good,"Had to meet Clients needs and deadlines, we were understaffed and overworked in payroll. Beginning our days as early as 6am and not leaving until 6pm or later somedays."
good,"The pay is horrible, work is beyond demanding. Outsiders hired on for the same position with less experience and or lacking a dregree will make more than you."
good,They have  good workers but leadership pretends to be open to listening to new ideas and new ways of doing things but they don’t actually implement these changes.  It helps if you have relatives working there… It’s really who you know not what you know.
good,"The job was challenging every day. Learned something new just about every day.  It was fun assisting clients with their payroll needs and concerns."
good,"Very stressful job.  Training for new employees will take between 3-5 years.  Back end systems are antiquated.  "
good,Fun People to work with. Good work environment. Not much room for advancement. Seems like every two years there are lay offs which is stressful. Salary is not competitive.
good,"This is a great launching point for sales people, it is cut throat and face paced.  I loved working there but the culture that was talked about and the culture that was truly there...were not the same."
good,"Constant changes, too many too fast... clients are tired of it and so are employees.  Then, they decide to get rid of tenured employees and keep the ones that do not know the ins and out of  payroll....things that you learn by doing your job for many years."
good,"The strategy is confusing and they try to do too much change at once without communicating the vision. Lots of pressure on front line management but they aren't empowered to do anything. "
good,Long time employee who has seen a lot of change.  Unfortunately last years have been nothing of layoffs of experienced people who's shoes can't be filled with lower paying new hires and offshore associates
good,"The culture was very cuthroat, and management promoted that level of competition. There was little to no support, and a lot of emphasis placed on deceptive sales tactics. Not a positive environent."
good,This is a place to start your career.  It has opportunities but stay on top of your career and career needs. Always keep an outside view and get training or continue schooling.
good,I worked here for 6 years and was no questioned a all by HR or Senior management in regards to why I chose to leave the company. When i started my career at ADP it was very employee based. After about 2 years and several changes in upper management it became a numbers focus. it became a rush to have more clients on boarded before they were ready and before the life specialists were ready to assist them. Management are literally just a person there to approve your time card as they cannot and do not know the systems or how to resolve an issue.
good,"ADP has a sales environment built for someone out of college. The top brass would contently change the commission structure in ways that would benefit the company. As soon as they saw sales people making great pay, there would be a complicated mathematical roll-out that would result in less pay. Additionally, the company consistently maintains a 80% turnover rate. When I hit the 3 year mark with the company, I was considered a veteran. At that point there were about 4of us remaining from the time I signed on."
good,I've learned that sometimes no matter how long or hard you work you might never get hired.  The management have their picks of who they are going to hire as full time associate.
good,The people are very friendly and nice.  The pay scale is low and the raises are very low.  The company does not listen to the employees who have great ideas for moving the company forward. If you are looking to work with a nice group of people this might be the company for you.  If you are looking to make a great salary this  might not be the company for you.
good,"The company is very flexible with working remotely, the parking at the Miami location is a little overcrowded. The training is efficient, technology is up to date."
good,great entry job but pay is not competitive. i worked in a role for 3 years now and i found that a fresh out of college employee in a similar role at an insurance company not 10 miles away makes 25% more than i do now.
good,"If you are willing to become complacent and have on ideas this is the place for you.  If you want to conform and only work for a paycheck, this is the place for you."
good,ADP had big unexpected laid offs company wide.  All management is not very people oriented. Lots of time management treats associates as thou they are beneath them. Not a very fair company to their hardest working employees.
good,"If you are a college grad still living at home or have very low expenses then this is the job for you. You get a decent salary plus commission. "
good,Majority of work now completed overseas or automated. Renamed to Accelya
good,It was an ok company to work for. It lack communication within departments making it difficult to complete work.
good,"Typical day at work was attending to the most urgent requests from CSRs."
good,This was a very challenging job we were labeled as customer service but we were really more of technical asistants
good,A fast paced work environment with highly competitive metrics.
good,The job itself is great The team and manager not so much. They Make it know nthat you are just a temp and once the  project is over they don’t need us
good,"I was really excited when I began working here. Shortly after, changes in Leadership were made & the morale of the department has suffered. There is a lot of attrition and employees going out on leave for stress, leaving their work to be piled on top of your already crazy workload. When you accept a position you are locked in for 18 months. There is a blackout period for year end where you cannot take vacation or make a job change (even if you've satisfied the 18 month lock). The work itself is fine, though you will experience a lot of stress due to the amount of work you are constantly assigned."
good,There is a major lack of training and support. The stress isn't worth the money.  Great company with some divisions that treat people horribly.  OTI and Billing had a high turnover with good reason. It's a paycheck but the working conditions leave much to be desired.
good,Higher Management need to concentrate also on employees from the G1 grade. They only need the end product and they neither give credit nor appreciate the efforts of the employees.
good,"Due to the high volume of turnover there is no work life balance. Frontline  management is just as overworked as the associates. If you have family/are in a relationship this position may not be for you."
good,"it was a fun work place, also demanding but by working hard and putting max effort the job was fun. sometimes management could make things difficult do to the high turnover of upper executives."
good,Started my career here. It was very exciting and had a friendly colleagues. Work environment is competitive and Knowledge gaining. It was a Pleasant place.
good,"Not enough autonomy in this environment. Although a good company to work for, key associates are not compensated based upon the correct structure. Great ideas-poor execution."
good,The hiring process takes entirely too long. The pay rate does not compete with any company to draw in good employees. Management is constantly changing so there's really no support .
good,It was a great part time job but I need to focus more on school so I left ADP to focus more on school.I learn better communication skills with customers and co workers
good,"I worked with ADP directly out of college, and it was a great way to gain experience and build a resume. "
good,this is a review thse are words. this is a sentence. these words are real words. i hate minimum requirements. this is not efficient. these are more words.
good,"Lots of changes, both good and bad. Some great managers and some really bad ones. "
good,changes in senior management and transformation has changed the work culture - not for the good.  no growth opportunities even if you extend yourself to your maximum
good,"large vertical corp. Many layers. Burn thru contractors quarterly to even monthly. Many Dir. level mgmt., obtained their titles and rank from being there long enough, attrition, and last man standing principle, they hold ground as if it were prison territory. Coming in above the Dir level you will be fine. Coming in as a low level analyst you'll be fine as well. Come in as a Project manager to Dir. level, be ready to engage with people who have only known ADP and will refuse to think outside the box or support."
good,Working with special projects was nice. going permanent status was more that I bargained for. Poor direct management in the HR department.  Ti di it all over again I would remain a consultant or temporary status the atmosphere is more conducive to that.
good,"Usually includes phone coverage and is more of a call center than a consultant role. States the premise of being a consultant heavy role where you focus on client base, but instead you are taking multiple calls for multiple clients and still having to focus on a client base.  No real work/life balance. Not transparent. Management sometimes plays favorites...overlooks hard work for those that play the corporate game..."
good,"Overworked and asked to participate in special projects with the idea of advancement into management, yet always seem to hire management from outside sources.  Employee complaints in regards to compensation and increase work load are rarely looked at and always dismissed.  Good middle management, yet higher management seems to have a huge disconnect."
good,This was a cost center environment and I didn't like it. We were held to a queue of calls that were non-stop and we really didn't have time to address the concerns of the customers.
good,"Taking call after call, micro managed, very low moral due to office closing and people losing their jobs.  In the old days is was a very good place to work we were all like family."
good,"Usinage de la paie, uniquement production des bulletins de paie, avoir beaucoup d'autonomie dès le début"
good,"This is a position for someone who loves math like air!"
good,Management is hired almost exclusively from outside the organization. The software is outdated and the different business units do not work well together.
good,"immediately take calls one after another without delay"
good,"ADP will lay off workers in a heartbeat when they are experiencing economic/financial issues.  It doesn't matter if you've been with them 1 year or 20+ years, they have no loyalty to their employees, only to the bottom line."
good,In my experience as an ADP associate i found the company to be a very high stress work place. Due to the large work load (millions of payroll daily) and tiny room for error ( 3 errors a year allowed).
good,I have had multiple people I know personally who have left due to haw bad management  and culture is. I am not sure how the Alpharetta location is but it wouldn't surprise me if they have the same issues.
good,Several levels of management that is unnecessary and the clients are still unhappy.  The employees are also unhappy as their jobs are continuously replaced due to outsourcing.
good,"ADP is not a bad company. It depends on your manager. One flaw of ADP is that there is no formal training. You are thrown in from day 1 to sink or swim. Everyone has different information on the same topic so it's difficult to learn your job in a timely manner. Work from home is basically non existent. If you need flexibility because you have a family, this isn't the company for you. and honestly, 100% of your work can be done virtually."
good,"I think ADP is a great company. It was the perfect company for my career. I have a Masters in Human Resources and my job was to develop human resources training. My manager was very bad and disrespectful to her employees. She had gotten several complaints about her management style, which was reported to levels above her. She eventually turned in her resignation. However there was not a contingency plan for who would manage the department after her. The team ended up getting a manager that did not understand nor respect instructional design/training. Her management style was autocratic and very directive. She didn't try to get to know any of the employees, she ruled with and iron fist.Her placement in that role was temporary and she approached it with a temporary attitude."
good,they just care about their company and to have profit they never invest for the training and welfare of the employee. but they good to promised some thing. Not good management.
good,"Poor management"
good,"No work life balance, long hours, and stressful because they have reduced staff so much that ones left behind have to work harder and longer hours.  US jobs sent overseas."
good,ADP has an extensive training program that is not tailored by position and it is completely virtual. Definitely a CON for me. Was hired 5 weeks before training began so I basically went to work and sat there surfing the web.
good,Heavy work load. Expectations to go permanent. No room room for advancement training was short...management played favoritism with staff as well as family members
good,"There is very little oversight on employees and"
good,"Every day my day began with doing corporate reporting for example Unit Tracker report. I also had to gather sales from the day before and sent it out regionally. Throughout the day my duties changed. If a new hire was starting I had to order all of their supplies such as laptop, IPad, business cards, as well as having their cubicle phone reset."
good,Great company to start your career with but eventually the turn and burn mentality gets old.  Management has changed over the past few years in various departments some for the good...some for the bad.
good,Tienen muy mala organización con el cliente como con el trabajador
good,The term only lasted 2 months but it was a very productive 2 months. Many challenges. The commute was difficult and long. I enjoyed interfacing with QA.
good,"customer service role required constant verification of what employees are doing all day. Phones must be logged into category of work, with little to no down time for breaks."
good,"I am an advocate of the motto ""Change is good"" but I also believe that you should have a goal in mind when you want to change; a direction that you want to take. I felt that during my time at ADP, there was constant change, even at the beginning when I was just in training, that didn't make all too much sense and it appeared that the upper leadership didn't exactly know what they wanted."
good,This is an interesting place to work at. The people are pleasant and the work environment itself is okay. It's not bad but remember to pray and watch or watch and pray!
good,"ADP is employee centric company but if you look at the salaries, the in hand amount is very less although overall package looks big. The politics is very worst, the employee who deserve the promotion,  he will not get it. But the person who is close to management got promoted."
good,ADP was an okay place to work at the beginning I was going to make this a career not just a job...but it turned  out to be a job.  If you had the opportunity to work in an office you had a better chance to advance.
good,Can be stressful at times and laid back.  It all depends on the time of year it is.  The Leads Committee finds fun activities for us to do. Like Zumba
good,"Mediclaim policy, facilities like cab, food celebrations (Family & Annual Day). Team outings."
good,"ADP does a great job at training new hires and going through extensive processes. The problem is the blind-sided aspect of daily cold-calling sales. While the job works for some, many become frustrated with the lack of leadership and transparency in the job. When you're doing a great job, you are highly rewarded. If you need help from upper management, there is lack of communication and effort from a manager."
good,"I have learned a great deal of information in regards to payroll, taxes and companies daily task.  Clients are very nice and want to assist."
good,"Client focus is the number one Job"
good,This is a very busy place to work lots of phone work. Depending on when hired there is little training. Lots of nice employees to work with.
good,At ADP i really learned data entry. My coworkers were very helpful I honestly had no hard parts to this job. And again the most enjoyable part was ensuring customer satisfaction and problem solving.
good,"Good place to work and grow with the Company."
good,Not much to say. Its an entry level position. Management either is great or it stinks. Don't get comfortable in this position.
good,They don't believe in a work/life balance at all and management sucks. As well as they take micro management to another level.
good,I take phone calls and help payroll professionals with ADP software.
good,"IT is a laid back fast paced environment, the people are easy going and easy to get along with."
good,a fun workplace love my co-workers we have a cafe to eat at i enjoy the work place everyone does there jobs my job is not hard.
good,My experience was great in the beginning. My last two years got grouped with a manager that did not know my job. We bumped heads and I was fired two years later. Not good. ADP is not very diversed. It's not what you know but who you know. Blacks are flowned upon. Not very many blacks within ADP especially in upper management. You are granted an eight hour day weather with your duties or your personal leave. Did not like having to use my personal leave to make an eight hour day.
good,"I was only there for a short time, company was employee friendly, however, there was little pay and lack of job security"
good,This was a turn and burn type of environment. The only thing that you were graded against was bringing on clients. The customer service was not to be handled by the sales rep. This mentality was not aligned with my values and created many ripples. I believe once you bring a client on it is your duty as a representative of the company you work for to make sure they are satisfied and get the service they need when they need it.
good,Contract - Technical Writer
good,My days consisted of phone prospecting in the morning and client visits and canvasing in the afternoon.  I worked with other divisions within the company to help close accounts and add additional services that they were unable to offer if needed by the client.
good,"-we conduct weekly team meetings along with one on ones with our managers once a week."
good,"The client interaction with the job is great.  You can really help people out everyday make good decisions about payroll and benefits. Management can have ideas and not clearly state what they are, so it makes for a lot of running in circles."
good,"It is a company, great to start your careers. You work hard, the people are great, difficult to make changes.  They are trying to change the culture, but it is slow progress."
good,"Client facing roles are stressful, but if you manage to get to another internal team - not client facing, it could be winner position. Management people are quite unqualified."
good,"Surcharge de travail car erp en fin de vie"
good,"My work in Change Management was dull and did not involve agile development like the rest of the interns on teams with software developers. Miscommunication was prevalent due to many members of my team being in different offices. Management is decent, but new hires were treated poorly from what I experienced. Limited introduction into projects and little to no documentation made many of them feel lost in their assignments. Some interns are not treated as employees and are given menial tasks. Many had nothing to work on for several weeks."
good,This is a very stressful workplace. Somedays you would not leave the office until 10pm. A lot of jobs were moved out of the country to India. So there were constant layoffs.
good,"Good benefits, but to them you are just a number. They do lay offs every year in some departments. "
good,"Typical day of work was that of a call center environment for me. Learned a lot as it was the most IT based environment I had been in to that point. Management really trended down in my tenure. 1 of my 2 original managers left department. Good manager, didn't work out there or something. The other, who stayed, is what you want in an environment like that. Resourceful, pleasant to be around, fair, unbiased & knowledgeable. Reads his associates like a great manager should. I know first hand. The others from my dept. including above them, disgusting. Destroyed morale of my floor, smiled all the way through. Preaching associate engagement but handling business otherwise & lying to your face about it. Overlapping & unclear policies that are kept secret but in turn, this same ill-advised from management can very much abruptly lead to your termination(as in my scenario). Simply in it for the check & to flaunt around comfortably with no regards for the employees career goals they're responsible for supervising. I wouldn't even bother going any further. Can't judge the entire building as every dept. is different. Many seemed very happy there but many saw the same experience I did."
good,"Past years culture changed lots of lay offs and early retirements caused many to be fearful of being let go causing dog eat dog environment. I was extremely dedicated with lots of knowledge, top client base praised my ability and support, but took early retirement rather than alternative and so glad I did. Barely got a thank you or goodbye after a lifelong career but was fortunate to get a great package. Thankful for great career and glad to realize there is life after ADP."
good,"It was a great first job for college graduates.  Good compensation but there is favoritism so you have to be apart of the ""in"" crowd. Qualified candidates get left behind unless you have a good manager who fights for you."
good,ADP has a culture of not bringing young people into their company. They haven't changed or progressed that much and they don't try to inspire or make the younger people passionate about their work. Lot of politics in the work environment.
good,At the end of the day ADP is a business and they are out to make the most money for said business and to expect anything expect anything else is wrong. They offer little growth in certain departments and what appears to boundless opportunities in others. So be prepared for constant movement for something better.
good,"Working for ADP taught me a lot in terms of job skills and on corporate life in general. However, work life balance was not great and the office can at times be toxic."
good,"Entre para realizar un tipo de trabajo y luego solo realizaba este en un 5% de mi tiempo, realizando trabajos de los cuales no tenía formación en el resto del tiempo."
good,"ADP delivers on its commitment to shareholders and produces results. There was a focus on revamping their products when I was leaving which was desperately needed IMO. It is a great company, but it has a very distinct culture, is great at partnering with other businesses."
good,Good starter job. But if you do not work at a One ADP location there is no opportunity for career growth unless you're looking to move. If payroll and Customer service is your passion have at it. If not keep looking. It is a call center environment.
good,"I googled what the average pay for Implementation is at ADP and they fall 20% below the national average, making myself fall at least 30% the avg. The amount of work my department does to just be stepped on in the end in a little crazy. Luckily, I can handle it, but I do not like to see it done to my team members."
good,"As a successful female, I was never encouraged for management or a role that was predominantly male.  Even though I expressed much interest in both.  Training and benefits are great, but depending on the location of your office, your gender or ethnicity can greatly affect you being promoted."
good,Working at ADP is a great experience. I appreciate the knowledge of co-workers and the overall experiences I have obtained while working there. It's very different from the financial services industry.
good,good pay but stressful job. management can be uninvolved and this always can mean poor morale there is no real benefit in having paid time off if there are responsibilities that are still due to be done while on vacationing.
good,it could use better communication with employees and have a better relationship with them.the management should be more in tune with the employees its like they don't care.
good,Had good experience with ADP in my life. Specially management they are list bothered about associates who really work hard. They are much in bhasa. If serious about your career pls not go for this work place.
good,ADP offers work life balance and flexibility. However the mission continues to change on a quartet basis.  I get at least 2 surveys a month about change.
good,"The company is going through another reorganization. They offered early retirement to some employees and other employees were laid off."
good,"Company was great when I first started then the bean counters took over and now it is management by spreadsheet without regard to it's employees.  They have outsourced TONS of jobs overseas and the remaining state-side employees have been undulated with additional work.  Every year they kept wanting more and more projects to be worked simultaneously.  At the Alpharetta, GA location they reduced the desk work areas to literally a postage stamp size and you are working on top of each other."
good,"IMPLEMENTATION DEPARTMENT SUCKS but everyone I met from other departments loved their jobs...so...don't get an implementation position..."
good,"corporate structure is weak."
good,"Worked there for fifteen years. The benefits package kept me there and paid for my education, not to mention retirement and stock options. The salary was about average for the industry, but very difficult to get wage increases or promotions, and I was an exceptional employee. Bottom line corporate focus. Employees are a just a number, when it comes down to it."
good,"The work balance is lacking and basically does not exist.  The leadership team expects a great deal with not enough incentive. The trips are great.  However, there needs to be more"
good,"I worked in a fast moving, time sensitive environment. My peers were collaborative and generous. The people I reported to were interested in themselves and promoting themselves, to the detriment of their staff"
good,"Working time schedule was flexible, the survey performed there every year does not reflect the truth, 80% of the answer are not true,  most enjoyable part of the job was the people worked with were very friendly."
good,"Managers were not supportive. VP at the time was very shady. Need new fresh management. VP played favorites with managers and certain reps. She was not supportive of some of her managers, sided with reps and not her manager."
good,"Awesome work atmosphere if we were in the 90's.  Expect your day to consist of sitting down for 4 hours and deflecting emails.  If you do plan to advance, don't expect to stop doing your initial position.  ADP strives on giving people more work and riding their employees as much as possible."
good,I manage and monitor project daily tasks to ensure goals are met within desired time frame. I enjoy being able to bring client satisfaction when I meet the Project deliverables.
good,"The company as a brand sounds good but there is something annoying about the culture. Depending on your role, there may be long hours and unnecessary stress."
good,"I love my job and helping associates and clients. There is great diversity with activities that are available. However if you move up beyond the associate level, it is less and less diverse, less about what you know and how you perform and more about who you know."
good,"I worked in a very senior team.  I adored my teammates and had a lot of fun.  Was very well liked and did good work for the group.  I had the misfortune of having to report to a first and second line manager that seemed largely disorganized and additonally biased against me for some reason or another that was not immediately clear to me.  I hate to say it, but If I can sum it up, it think it helps to be Indian if you are working at ADP in the Roseland NJ location.   Not sure of the other locations.   After some time I felt it best to move on."
good,"journée drastique : beaucoup de travail"
good,Could be great if they had management that had a clue.  Poor leadership creates toxic environment.  Communication is dismal and trust is non-existent.
good,good but face challenges for inappropriate training. very poor . infrastructure. no goo dcab facility. ffllexible shifts timings. cab facility only for nighshifts. fun at work is always there. lack of motivation from leasders .
good,"Okay place to work ... great job security, but very slow pace, and growth based  on tenure."
good,"Certainly, ADP is a good, but not great place as they would boast of, place to work with."
good,"Has its up and downs like most places but overall ok to get your feet wet. "
good,"My experience had ADP has been fair.  It is a place where they say they have an open door policy, but the truth is approaching the higher management with concerns will usually not result in any positive solution to the problems that an associate is facing."
good,The company has difficulty making employees happy. There are a lot of disconnects between policies on the handbook and what is being practiced in the office.
good,"i was employed at ADP for many years.  I was a very good employee, and my performance proved that, but i was laid off when a co worker who  was a poor employee with poor performance, was promoted to a new position because she had a relative in management.  I feel like you either have to be in good with someone in management to move up, or be a brown noser.  This company pays well and offers good benefits for the most part, but do not really care about their employees; only about getting the job done."
good,"Friendly environment, Engagement activities, Location near mall, great food in pantry, good salary and benefits, management is not aligned with the global process."
good,"there are a lot of great people at ADP.  "
good,"Excellent company for learning as the pressure is a lot."
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"ADP's business model is fluid, meaning that it's subject to a lot of change which for a company the size of ADP is a good thing.  I have learned that some things that were supposed to be kept confidential have not been and have resulted in a low morale and higher than expected attrition at our locations.  A recent change in support model for Health & Welfare will continue to drive attrition and will have an impact on client satisfaction."
good,"As a Major Account Sales Consultant your job is to get new accounts for ADP.  You get a new account after another, for me the difficult part was not having the opportunity to keep your accounts for account management.  Many clients will call me and I had to send them to Customer Service."
good,"Multi-tasking is a must. Co-workers worked towards the same goal and help each other. Time management is key."
good,you need to keep your numbers up. If not it is held against you. your vacation and time off is tied to this. once you meet the max. no more raises.
good,Working at ADP can be enjoyable at times but very busy all of the time.  Direct managers are eager to learn about their reports.  Coworkers are always willing to assist.
good,Learn to implement systems and deal with clients. Good training ground. Salary can be improved. If they have the time co-workers can be helpful. Do not let difficult clients annoy you.
good,ADP is full of great people but since the people have been there so long there's a lack of trying new ideas.  They work hard but not smart.  The environment is dull and lacks life. The office does not seem to have an open door policy (the doors are literally close most of the time).
good,Great company to work for but a bit behind on the homeshore train.  Also lots of off shore help they need more US employees.
good,"I enjoyed the work I did and my co-workers. It seems like a great company, but there appears to be a lot of turnover. Take from that what you will."
good,"This used to be a great place to work. It has devolved into strictly a numbers game, and they don't care that they are grinding people into the ground. There are still some great people and managers there, but they keep reducing staff, and forcing those left to work overtime. The morale is deplorable, and almost everyone I know that's left is looking for another place to work."
good,"A typical work day was assisting the Relocation department Director with the client policies, redlining using ms word and excel, and also assisting the relo team with daily request for new transferees."
good,"7-6 kind a job"
good,"I work for a temp agency, so I really didnt work at the job for long"
good,un poste intéressant pour les grandes compagnies clientes comme les hôpitaux
good,"A typical day would be to log into a phone queue, wait for a call. Once you get the call, you have to do the work. If after the call, work still needs to be done, you have 20 seconds to complete it. If additional time is needed, management approval is needed. Procedures change constantly and management does not do a good job in communicating them."
good,"Get your 7 Net News, 75 Activities, 2 units a week and your in the Black"
good,"Fast paced work environment "
good,I am currently working as a dental receptionist and would like to to move on in my carrer and gain more experience by working for a differnt company. I would also like more responsibilty and be able to make a difference to a company.
good,Very good work culture.
good,"My role in this company was to hunt business using our partnerships, RBC & BMO which was a great resource."
good,You will meet some of the coolest people at this company. The company consistently changes and your job is not secure.
good,"Houston region suffers from high turnover, favortism and all out substandard management. Training of new hires is left to reps as opposed to managers. If you don't work by fear, you will be harrassed until you are either fired or you quit. Whichever comes first. The only good thing is the work life balance."
good,"My day consisted of attending meetings with customers, new prospects, banks, and CPAs. I would attend these meetings and would prospect the businesses in the adjacent area before and after my meetings to take full advantage of my time."
good,Alot of staff does not attain their sales targets.
good,"Enjoyed working with a big company, lots of young motivated people, allowed to build relationships with vendors and clients. Great opportunity to network."
good,"A typical work day consist of order entry(keying of new sales orders). Working daily and monthly reports. Performed closing of the books on a month end basis. Some management. Loved the co-workers, co-workers madeit fun."
good,The Company was an over all good company to work for. I enjoyed it very much so. I liked the people that I had to work with.
good,Managers expected more and more without training. Quotas weren't based on accurate information.
good,i enjoyed working with others most of all the hard part was trying to apply for another position either the managers didn't want to help out or they just didn't want you to apply and rehire someone else
good,"Company was great but management was horrible. Too much politics for job promotions. Compensation is not fair... compare to the amount of work. Looking for something better, where i can grow and be compensated fairly"
good,"Great place to work, very flexible. However the pay is below standard and trying to negotiate / move up is extremely difficult. High turnover due to low pay."
good,"Pay scale is behind the times, very little flexibility but you do have lots of back up due to the size of the company.  It is a great place to get started in the implementation industry."
good,"The work place is boring and no tracking ways to make the place lively"
good,"A highly stressful, ever-changing work environment. Senior management was not always clear on direction or providing reasons for work projects. A lot of behind the scenes decision making that affected outcomes of work."
good,"Enjoyed working with the team I was on, but did not enjoy the role and responsibilities and there was very limited advancement opportunities. Feel there should be a greater emphasis on employee engagement and happiness."
good,Great experience but you are just another number. Manager was an insane micro manager. Made it near impossible to do your job without intense stress on your back. We recently had a tornado come through that took out a business owner I was supposed to meet with and my manager asked why we weren't meeting even after I explained they did not have a physical building anymore. Very unrealistic and insane team expectations.
good,"The work pace at ADP is no different from any call center. If you show up on time & do what you need to do you should be alright. Now if you're expecting to promote good luck! If you're not in with the right people it's never going to happen. Stick to yourself, avoid getting close to anyone, simply do you're job. If you notice discrepancies among colleagues of any type just hope management catches it. Trust me theres favoritism"
good,"Your territory, assigned partnerships and manager will heavily dictate your success and your happiness here.  Make sure to do your research on where you will be placed and who will be managing you."
good,"Great company with opportunities for advancement, at the time that I worked there still were a lot of manual / antiquated processes. Nice bonuses and company sponsored events. Training department was great until they did away with it, much of your training for ongoing product support was learn as you go by asking lots of questions. WFH was also an added benefit, overall a very good experience."
good,"A good opportunity to earn money, but the culture is geared around screwing each other out of commissions. You can close a deal only to find out that another team, sometimes in another country, has a claim of some or all of the deal. It's possible to hit your number just by sticking your nose into other people's work."
good,"My specific role is very difficult. we are expected to meet deadlines while having to balance resolving issues with the account, assisting clients, sales and other team members."
good,"I worked for ADP for 8 years plus and regardless to the position I was in, it was the camaraderie that made each day a success. Building rapport with leadership and colleagues allowed me to maneuver through my work day with a sense of purpose and poise. Being able to relate with teammates in regards to the day-to-day issues that arose and having a strong relationship with management provoked meaningful dialogue to aide in completing numerous daily task."
good,I appreciated the job experience! I didn't appreciate the lack of knowledge our management was expected to know which didn't help the rep's when needing assistance with a client issue. If you struggled to understand certain parts of the system there were alot of people who look down on you and would come off as wanting to say why are you working here!
good,"It's quite a fun workplace. Everything is brand new. There are ping-pong tables, Playstations, foosball tables, standing desks, Starbucks, a decent kitchen, full gym, and top of the line security."
good,Worked for ADP for 18 months and it was great at the beginning. Then there was a sudden shift in the atmosphere and people were leaving left and right. As an account manager they require to much of you and give more clients then is realistic.
good,ADP is a great company for some but there is legacy baggage that affects the companies ability to move ahead with significant change for the future.  Not enough of the senior leadership team is embodying ADPs Mission Vision and Values.
good,"As a starting position, ADP has terrific benefits and will teach you alot about corporate culture.  The culture used to be like family, you enjoyed going to work and being with your extended family.  Once that hedge fund individual attempted a hostile takeover , the higher ups (ceo , board etc) had an eye opening. The realized that they  needed to implement their long term strategy at a more accelerated rate.  ADP even offered its older workers an early retirement package to shed itself of not only its senior workers, but also reduce its payroll costs as well as the pension package these workers have as part of its benefits (new employees do not get a pension package)."
good,Typical environment...fast pace...required to meet deadlines...learned over 100 apps...managed time to meet deadlines...people friendly...management requires absolute 110% effort
good,"Client load is ridiculous. You must be very organized and be able to pivot on a dime. Nothing is in sequence or goes smoothly in core Implementation, people constantly walking up to your desk or popping up in lync for something. There are too many hands in the pot and no one does anything the same, so trying to use the internal knowledge base to get help is cumbersome, dated material and dead links to nowhere, is all a part of the exhausting training daily looking (and it must be searched using the right words or it'll retrieve 100s if documents). They're trying to innovate, but they should've been at this technology point over 15 years ago. "
good,The job itself was good. Not a bad day over all. Management was good. Job wasnt hard. job was enjoyable over all but nothing amazing. hard to work up the ladder
good,"ADP is a great place to work or maybe even make it a career, the only downfall to the company is the lack of mangers wit solid leadership skills. They lack the knowledge or the willingness to harvest an individuals strengths and set them on a path to success. It seems as they are more focused on the negatives more than the positives of individuals."
good,The giving of assignments needs improvement. Support during the process is lacking company standards. Client interaction contact information needs to be improved.
good,"Work pressure -Targets "
good,"Great place to be the people are wonderful, but most people are stressed out by mid day because your bombarded with angry calls for a few hours straight and they only give you a short 30 min lunch then its right back at it."
good,"Constant management turnover. "
good,"Managers are terrible and very unprofessional"
good,"Developed an understanding for payroll processing. "
good,High volume of work and very large number of clients with complex and varied business requirements. Work life balance depends on the team and process you are involved with.
good,"Productive & sometimes fun workplace that occasionally offered a work-life balance, but often overloaded their employees with too many clients which then prevented employees from providing world-class service to their clients."
good,"-Typical day at work - Freedom to do what is needed to get the job done. If needed previous management would assist. The hardest part of the job was to help clients in the ""Franchise"" space that did not have the ability to utilize product or service due to the lack of matching technology. "
good,very poor management.. you will not learn enough here. Almost no exposure to new technologies. No fun activities at all ! Salary is very very less compare to other bigger organization..
good,"Very Stressful and long hours.  Not many places to advance once you were level 4 if you didnt want to go into management.   Benefits were very good, however not good management. Catered to the young."
good,"Overall, good place to gain experience.  Very high turnover in certain departments and an overall level of disorganization in terms of communication, knowledge-share, training."
good,"Company is going through a massive restructuring (what they call a transformation) which amounts to eliminating older, veteran loyal employees in addition to slashing costs across the board to make wall street happier."
good,Ok place to work. You learn a lot in a short amount of time. Holidays and weekends off. Year end is a bit crazy but offers additional ways to earn money.
good,"Aside from the pay and benefits, there is a lot of micromanaging and it is hard to advance with the company. Hires outside offered a better salary than those already employed with the company."
good,"Benefits could be MUCH improved for such a large employer."
good,"A typical Day of work consisted of multiple meetings which resulted in no actionable items, additional insight or help. The different groups do not work together at all"
good,"Love  the people I work with great coworkers. Also outside of comission there are a lot of contests for extra motivation. Overall leaderdhip is great especially my team lead. A lot of pressure at month end because comission is not just based on selling the payroll. We have to connect them with account representatives and ensure payroll actually gets processed. This can be difficult because clients may agree on a first pay date but arent actually ready the day of first payroll process."
good,"It's a nice place to work but there at alot of short comings that I have noticed about the company. When it comes to getting a promotion, its about WHO you know, not WHAT you know. You can be fully qualified and still get looked over for someone they favor more."
good,"Let me just start with it's HOT. Hot to the point that people pass out on a daily basis in the summer time. Brazing is an ideal position because it promises higher pay. Although, they use public shaming as a motivator to improve your skills. As a new brazer I made mistakes as expected and I quickly learned that in brazing meetings (held once weekly) your mistakes were posted on a projector for all of the other brazers to see. I felt that was a poor motivation tool and could possibly be considered bullying. Overall I consider many of this companies methods to be in poor taste."
good,nothing to say it's overall a good company to work for. Most people enjoy the option of working from home or coming into office. make sure you keep records of all you do!
good,"Answered employee’s calls about their payroll and health benefits"
good,"While ADP has made a name for itself, it has a long way to go.  The culture is great, coworkers are fun to work with; however,they lack an effective training program to truly make you successful at your job.   Many people who work here aren’t fully trained or knowledgeable about their roles (with the exception of tenured people who have been there 5+ years), so you find yourself spending more time looking for resources to answer your questions than you should.  A lot of people aren’t aware of what they should and shouldn’t know to do their job. Compensation is very low compared to their expectations and workload.  They have a blackout period between November- February where limited time off is granted for year end.   No matter what they tell you, overtime is not granted as often unless you are in payroll.  While you can easily work from home for this job, it is discouraged in most departments.  Benefits are expensive and the deductible is high.  Do be prepared for many out of pocket costs.  Some people are hired into positions that they aren’t qualified for, but I guess that’s anywhere you go.  Keep in mind, many people are stressed out so when they hit their year mark, they go out on the 6 week paid emotional leave.  The incentive plan is humourous and doesn’t really encourage you to go above and beyond.  They stress survey scores as well.  Because ADP is a well known company, having experience here in certain roles can open the doors for bigger and better jobs.  Learn what you can and move on.  They have let go many homeshored positions and have given the option of early retirement"
good,"Extremely Agile and  developers are taken for granted to deliver at an impossibly tight deadline. Several long working hours and improper work allocation without considering one's ambition or interest. Team politics due to the insecure nature of the leaders was childish and apparent to all. It is a good company, but unfortunately, the project in was a mess."
good,"Good Company to work for, great benefits and opportunity for advancement."
good,I have enjoyed working with ADP over the past 22 years as a remote  home based employee.  A typical day would be accurately resolving clients billing issues as they are submitted.
good,"I LOVED the amount (TONS) of gained experience and knowledge I received. "
good,"ADP was great for me, a young new mother I joined at age 20. Worked my way up with the help of a great manager from a entry level client service rep, up to a level IV service rep, Moved from Service into Implementation, again lucky with another great manager who helped guide and direct me to another promotion to Project Lead for Payroll. He left the department to pursue other opportunities. At this point the culture has changed and I started feeling unappreciated, over worked and very very stressed with no relief. I was implementing too many clients, unable to provide them with the attention and quality they deserved. I began looking for other opportunities internally. I found one thinking I would have some relief from the work load and not as much stress and be able to get back into school. I was very wrong, the last department I worked fro at ADP was poorly trained, poorly organized and the management was lacking on many levels. I was bounced around between 4 different managers in less than 2 years. All my attempts to get training or boosters went unheard. I had one manager there for a short time, who was the only one I could say had our best interest in mind. This had a huge impact on my work/life balance. I was diagnosed with depression and other chronic illnesses. I was dismissed with no coaching/no written warning."
good,"Some of the things that make ADP very challenging are the fact that it has so many silos that do not work well together.  As an organization, I give them credit for wanting to create career paths for their employees, but they get very poor marks for helping them navigate those pathways.  My manager observed at one juncture ""ADP eat their own young.""  Some other considerations are the fact that they absolutely do not embrace technology, as evidenced by them still using that same tired old mainframe that was working like a dog back in 2006 when I arrived.  From a compensation vantage point, I was a salaried exempt employee who had been told by my previous manager that ""everything that does or doesn't happen"" is my responsibility, yet I was not included in the Bonus structure.  Also there is word out there that anyone who leaves ADP is black-balled, and is not likely to ever be rehired.  I will say that I had a very challenging client when I worked for ADP COS, but I have also been their customer since leaving on two separate occasions, and I feel like the caliber of managerial/supervisory employees they are assigning to their client accounts has fallen off substantially since 2008."
good,ADP is a good starting point for your career. It allows early exposure to a career in Human Resources. You learn about the many clients that ADP has. I have learned to become better organized in my work as well as becoming a bigger part of my team.
good,"There are a ton of good people to work with at ADP.  I learned a lot at the company and moved into many different fields of interest."
good,"8-5 job, making a base salary of $55,000. I learned a lot about sales and the sales process, but not much more. The management is secretive and not fully communicative with employees."
good,ADP is a large company that truly understands work life balance with great benefits and facilities. The training that is given is where the company lacks but overall if you are determined and a self learner and resourceful you will be fine.
good,"ADP is good place to work for the most part. However, there are challenges with culture diversity, flexible schedules, and managements' involvement in employee succeess"
good,"As a telecommute employee, the work-life balance was incredible.  Worked regular hours Monday through Friday 7:30 am to 4:00 pm. Endless opportunities for training and advancement.  Wonderful benefits and overall great place to work."
good,"I realized working at ADP that you are only successful as your Manager wants you to be.  I had the unfortunate opportunity to be force to switch Mangers when one would either quit or get promoted. At one point I am on the fast track to promotions, then my manager gets promoted and I have not been about to progress any further."
good,"ADP has changed from a company with a reputation for job security and internal stability to a confused mess of corporate politics pursuing a transformation initiative. Paying lip service to Agile methodology without recognizing that it is not suited to the company's culture or client base. Cutting staff before stabilizing the workload. ADP has bowed to Wall Street pressure and failed to remain innovative in the face of smarter, cloud-based competition, yet they've chosen to embrace development methods that do not solve their problems in the changing industry."
good,"Clock in, do your job, clock out. I learned that I didn't want to be looked at as just a number. Management plays favorites. Culture is very much, the company doesn't show loyalty to you, but expects loyalty in return for a stable job. No growth is promoted, they would prefer to bring in talent rather than promote within. They promotion scale is indicative of this. They use job classes and only provide 3-4% increase per class you increase. The hardest part about the job is surviving the culture. The most enjoyable part were the employees the people you are around are fantastic."
good,ADP is a stable company that offers competitive salary and benefits. With growth and expansion across smart locations opportunities for advancement are limited or require relocation. Overall most employees tend to stay with the Company.
good,"I learned a lot at ADP, they kept up on the latest trends, training was ongoing.  Work-site culture was very stressful, toxic at times.  Work-live balance was very difficult which resulted in job burnout.  Management was not consistent, unfair for job promotions.  The hardest part of the job was the constant change.  Client base was overwhelming at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers!"
good,6 month assignment ended too soon. 2 days had no phone calls. Training needed more emphasis on navigating through screens.  Not so much on games and explaining the benefits.
good,This was a good company to get some good training in outside sales. I enjoyed most of the people but it was not the environment I was looking for. Decided to move on to next opportunity.
good,"ADP is a respected company in the HCM industry. My role in National Account Services Implementation brought opportunities to learn on a day to day basis. Challenging work with very long hours at times. Significant travel involved. With a number of reorganizations, the advancement opportunities became less and less."
good,"Empresa comum, normal de mercado, com pouco chance de crescimento e muitas das vezes você será jogado dentro de outra empresa, como mão de obra terceirizada, não recomendo."
good,I enjoyed the willingness of the team to explain and train in the areas of the job.  I learned the ins and outs of the issues with members payroll and benefits
good,unwilling to look at employees as people and changed to numbers only. NO longer cared about the customer only the amount of calls you take not the quality of service provided.
good,"Shoot fund status reports at scheduled interval to various stakeholders, that's what kept me busy in the morning till afternoon"
good,Training was hard but it was mostly signing and resigning people for insurance. So very repetitive but is super easy once you know what you are doing.
good,Good place to work- Good work life balance . Made many life long relationships here and lasting relationships. Received paid time off and family work balance is important to the organization.
good,"Due to the company's finances, I was let go and placed on a layoff along with 6 other employees.  This was a great place to work and offered advancement opportunities."
good,ADP is a great place to work and has provided a lot of opportunities to grow professionally. Great work/life balance. ADP also does a great job with working diversity with many associate resource groups available.
good,"ADP once was a company you could work your entire career and retire.  Not so much any longer.  Tenured associates are being forced out to reduce payroll.  While this seems like a great business decision, that decision comes with a high cost of losing your knowledge base.  Payroll is not an easy concept and takes many years to develop the necessary skills.  ADP has decided to have 4-6 central offices to bring in a new generation of workforce that is not knowledgeable.  The training takes many months, to years, for associates to have a firm grip on all topics."
good,"I started as a payroll Specialist who would support assigned clients and my job description and title changed. They gave us training for the new position, but expected us to also support clients at the same time. The training did not teach us much as we were busy supporting clients."
good,"Temp employees have very little job security. Customer Service is understandable, however demands by company is almost impossible. Not enough training."
good,"Extremely fast paced working environment with the end result of resolving and satisfying all of the employee's computer needs. "
good,ADP has a lot of positions throughout the different departments to apply for. Work life balance can be challenging during certain periods of the year. Offers PTO/SICK/Vacation time. Management cares about it's people and trying to make changes to show that.
good,More challenging and always overloaded with work which was fun to accept new challenges and helped me to manage work life smoothly. Dealing with new clients was great exprience. It was short but good journey as it was more related to finance than IT.
good,"ADP is, by definition, a large corporation. The hours are long and the pace can feel stale at times. the company does everything by the book so it is a great place to get your bearings. the Large client base makes working for ADP the perfect place to grow as a business leader. there is a ton of exposure to different types of businesses. Come in ready to take your orders and execute them."
good,"the great pay is about the only thing i have a positive opinion on.  the work atmosphere is dull, the personalities of the people hired are dull and there is a mico-mangement culture."
good,I had work in ADP Company for short period due to my family problem.I had work in ADP as a medical officer.ADP(automatic data processing)behind IBM.Experience was good.Duty hours 10am to 6pm. Saturday sunday off.
good,"Tough tough gig, but given the workload is manageable and you are willing to go through the grind, these organization can really benefit an individual. "
good,"Very Long hours and no time to enjoy the amenities ADP offers."
good,"Laid back atmosphere.   "
good,You can be the best or the worst employee and it doesn't really matter. If you are a high performer you do it for pride not pay. No room to grow. Too many culture changes.
good,"ADP was a great company to work for. However, they did not want to make my position permanent after 3 years of service to provide me with healthcare benefits when I needed it the most (18 years ago)."
good,"Dopo quasi 27 non posso che parlare bene di ADP."
good,Développement de logiciels pas adapté au secteur d'activité
good,"Great company to work for with great opportunity to learn and progress."
good,"Solid brand name, leadership position in the market."
good,This organization has potential to engage and direct their current talent to grow and develop within the organization.
good,Investimento em capacitação profissional excelente. Empresa que investe no capital humano.
good,"I was an ee with a start up - ProBusiness- who were acquired by ADP. I loved my job and working with my clients, however i was restricted in my position the last few years when ADP took away the ability to work overtime - which was needed to do the job properly, as well as travel to meet with our clients on an annual basis - I never met any of my clients over the past two years - very difficult to build relationships without face time.  Management spent more time trying to push EE's to provide excellent survey responses than managing their teams.  I spoke to my Manager rarely and he was never on the right or same page as I with  my client base."
good,"As we are in charged of payroll for french company, the level of stress could be at some point really hight,"
good,I supported existing customers and ADP invested billions of dollars in new technology and no migration path for existing customers. I was expected to sell new technology without a timeline to implement the new solutions. Sales management is spotty as well. I had the best sales manager I have ever had and the worst back to back.
good,the engineers and management are extert inthe diamond recovery field and are reappointed on follow up projects in thier client base
good,Good stable company. Co-workers were great. The company does not do a great job recognized people. Management is quite hierarchical and in general not very collaborative.
good,"If you are looking to make money, the company offers a lot of potentions to make very high income for sales people.  However, the culture is not the best."
good,Great work experience and training provided at ADP. Customer service experience.I  took about 35-40 calls per day. Managers closely monitor.I learned everything I need to know about payroll and tax services and handling frustrated clients. Co workers are equally knowledgeable and helpful. The hardest part of the job  is dealing with difficult clients . Most enjoyable is the experince I gained from the company and the perks when they were provided.
good,"nice place to work "
good,"Sendo contratado para trabalhar com terceirização de Folha de Pagamento e atendimento aos clientes em divisão global na ADP, tive oportunidade de montar a equipe e a infraestrutura do contact center que atende os funcionários destes clientes globais. Depois assumi equipe de execução da folha. "
good,"ADP is a company that does a great job of encouraging work life balance, in terms of flexibility in hours and work schedule, in areas where this is conducive to the business."
good,A typical day in this position have employees with too many clients to managed properly.  Clients become unhappy and dissatisfied with the level of service provided.  Great co-workers.
good,"Die pilsener ADP hat viele fluktuelle Artbeitnehmer wegen viele Überzeitiger Arbeit, schwachem Management unde nicht entsprechenede Gehalten"
good,Loved the people but organization lacked in multiple areas to keep the flow as smoothly as possible. Felt as if the company should prepare a little sooner and training would go smoother as well as the transition for open enrollment with each client. The work is unsteady and also unfairly put in to ques
good,very hard work.  not very rewarding.  they dont let you advance no matter how hard you work or how many awards you get.  its very superficial. they only really appreciate jocks and arrogant people
good,"A ADP é ma ótima empresa para se aprender, pois há pessoas que ensinam e não retem o conhecimento apenas para si."
good,This job was very cookie-cutter. I would sit in my cube assisting associates with their benefit needs. Assure my service metrics were on point and at the end of the day I'd go home. Management was by the book with next to no interpersonal skills. The job as a whole was a bore. The thing I learned the most at this job was patience.
good,"Worked alone for the most part. Was not aware of the health issues of the owners until the end, so it was a bit frustrating managing the office and payroll on my own and not really hearing from the owners but once every two to three weeks. Once it was all explained to me, I understood.  It was never really bad or overwhelming, just wasn't made aware of the situation."
good,"Overall a good experince at ADP, learnt good things and had some good and bad experiences from management."
good,"~ HR Business Partner (Account Manager) for over 100 clients."
good,"The Inside Sales division is still in it's infancy stage. The training is ongoing and given across multiple channels (virtual, face-to-face and self-paced archives) and is very informative. You end up building great relationships with our co-workers but the hardest part is dealing with the constant changes in programs and the constant manipulation of the salaries/compensations. The Presidents Club trip is always spectacular but you are lucky if you see the same people or even make it multiple years because of how much they change your job from year to year."
good,"I enjoyed my position at ADP for many reasons.  I was given the freedom to make my own schedule, communicate with others and create my own business in a sense.  The hardest part of the job was to balance the many strategies thrown your way and to make sales goals.  You are trying to build a business anne create relationships but at the same time are expected to have results."
good,"ADP is a great company and ranks very highly.  The Charlotte office however could use better management skills.  The work environment is very toxic due to unprofessional ways of select, not all, managers.  ADP has great potential, but if all of the employees are unhappy because of the stress level and bad communication then the company can not reach full potential."
good,"its been great working here , learned many new things , co workers has been so good to be with"
good,"This organization thrives on litigious existence with payroll and HR laws in order to stay in business. Culture is tremendous, however, and a great work environment."
good,supporting the VP of our deparment as well as the team of 25ee with their daily needs.
good,"I learned how to utilize Java and Sequel, developed processes and procedures to ensure my daily job functions were completed.  Worked on individual projects.  Troubleshoot about 10 to 15 cases delivered to me daily by a lead programmer."
good,Hours are long and stressful or boring.  National accounts department is the worst to be stuck in.  Very difficult to move up or out of that department.  Pay is not enough and benefits are too expensive.  Many jobs have been outsourced to India.  No job security for a temp or a contract worker.  Temps/contract workers are only hired during open enrollment through an agency for very small hourly fee with many misrepresentations.  All other departments have permanent employees.  Too competitive and interviewing process is hellish.  Good for entry level young workers.
good,"Great place to work, great staff to working with but seems no room for advancement"
good,Great company before they decided to outsource many departments.
good,You get what you put in.  Kick-offs are great.  President's Club is amazing.
good,"Fast paced, hospitality environment. Guest service oriented."
good,Good environment but not enough pay for the work you do.  Management is unorganized
good,great place to train if you are just starting out. sales managers will feed deals to their favorite reps
good,its a nice place for the experienced joiners with all benefits.
good,You only do one thing all day. It's a good company to learn your basic payroll.
good,"Overall ADP as a company places far too much emphasis on the extremely long tenure of a high percentage of employees. Tenure of 25 - 35 years is not uncommon so it is apparent ADP was at one time a great place to have a lifetime carrier. Most of these long time employees have never worked anywhere else. This is a pro and a con because tenure is viewed very positively and most anyone with less than 10 years at the company is viewed as too new to understand the ADP approach. The typical self introduction around ADP starts with your name, followed by your title and then the number of years you've been with the company."
good,Good training and benefits - very high turnover in sales. Customer service is spotty. ADP hires good people so co workers are great.
good,"Small Business division is not a work friendly environment. The security is almost non existant......Now I started with National Accounts division in Des Moines, and it was the exact opposite. Great place to work, and everyone pitched in to make it the best possible work environment."
good,This company helped me in both personal and professional growth. The most enjoyable part of my job are the challenging assignments.
good,"Good opportunity always knocks and we should be ready to accept challenges. The world is full of opportunity and we are chasing on that."
good,"If you can handle being pulled in 50 directions and your best not being good enough, then you will be very happy here. Don't get me wrong. I love my job. But knowing what I know now, I was definitely naive when I first came here. Leave the rose-colored glasses at home."
good,A typical day is multitude of clients' calls and setup and no structure or work life balance. The company has multitude of people and they have many products. Company is ok it's what you make it.Lack of resources once you come out of training.
good,"I had a good experience with the work culture, improved technical and management skills. You might face hard time during the peak time. please be careful with the management."
good,"During my in person interview the manager didn't mention to me about black out period, this is where employees aren't allowed to take time off mid-November through February because of year end. If I knew about this I wouldn't have accepted the job offer. Work-life balance is important to me."
good,The team members are amazing people. They are family away from home. I couldn't imagine a better group of individuals to spend 40 hours a week with. They build a good foundation for an entry level career start.
good,"ca aurait été parfait , sauf qu'en Tunisie , la monnaie locale se devalue de plus en plus et le niveau de vie se degrade, alors nous, informaticiens , nous partons en europe , c'est aussi simple que cela"
good,"I unfortunately came to ADP too late in life.  If you're just out of college, this is a great place to start a career.  It takes patience and luck to succeed here; but you'll need both."
good,"Good Place to work, interact and learn and grow. You get to learn and if possible with proper contacts move up the ladder. People are friendly and supportive."
good,A great place to work. Some managers are biased on who they want to help. If you are a friend of a friend then you will get far. They are laying off all their older employees.
good,"Long hours, but great OT opportunities. Disorganized but gives you the foot in the door to prove yourself and move up. Management could use some more training."
good,18 years at a job I loved and would have loved to stay forever. Unfortunately that was not possible due to a company vision change. I’m thankful for my time and the experience. Now time to move forward with something new.
good,"I have known some of the people I worked with ADP for more than 20+ years.   The quality of the people working at ADP is wonderful.   Hard working, fun-loving, and caring."
good,There are plenty opportunities for any role when are new to it. I learnt a lot as an engineering manager at ADP  . Lot of opportunities for growth . The management gives you full freedom to go on with your own way .
good,"I took a job as a Customer service representative for Payroll with ADPs larger accounts. In the interview I made it clear that I loved ADP for being a large established company that I heard promoted from within. "
good,"Mainly a job from a temp agency. worked there through Aerotek and Kelly Services . That is how i got the job, so i didnt have benefits. It was also a job dealing with Insurances"
good,"Good Company, friendly not flexible for work life balance. Didn't give me what i needed to grow within my HR Career, the reason I had to leave from ADP"
good,Jobs outsourced to India and Philippines. Extremely stressful work and lack of teamwork between departments. Not secure job due to offices being closed and moved back east.
good,Its was nice place to work but growth and pay is not so much. You can spend good time working with people around. No managerial support you will get..
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me sorting out my own reports and reaching out to clients who had pending documents needed for tax credits. The job wasn't as hard as most of my coworkers made it seem, you just had to know how to prioritize. The workplace culture was OK for the most part, they would have ice cream socials, thanksgiving dinners, shoney's for breakfast, and Halloween parties, but how much fun you had on a daily basis or how well you got along with coworkers depended on the department you was in. Some people you had to watch out for (as with all jobs) and the managers were ""hit or miss"" as well. Most didn't know what they were doing and I was advised that a lot of the ""great"" managers left before I got there. The hardest part of the job were the ridiculous metrics that were used to determine how well we took calls. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to accrue vacation time in addition to a set 40 hours of sick, float (personal), and 8 hours of volunteer time. You could only carry over 40 hours of vacation time each year of less so you could end up having 3 weeks off if you manage your time right."
good,ADP was a great company to jumpstart career and put a big name on your resume. Great working experience you learn a lot but not the best for career advancement unless you are pursing something in the Human Resource world!
good,"I decline to submit a review"
good,"Archaic log-in system for work hours.  Sometimes they lost some of my working records.  Management is very checked-out, and do not learn much.  Management treats employees like they are disposable."
good,"If you are only in a position for a highly paid salary, ADP is for you! Work-life balance is overwhelming, little advancement.  There is constant restructuring going on and very little training for associates."
good,ADP is a client focused company.  They have many sponsored events for employees.  Your workday will keep you busy and must be able to juggle several tasks at once and be very organized to succeed at this position.
good,"The organization once felt like family. Aggressive goals set by the management team, hard work by all, cooperation between co-workers, celebration for successes, and fair compensation/benefits.  Unfortunately, cost cutting became so excessive and job responsibilities became so overloaded the work environment was no longer enjoyable."
good,"Focused very heavily on sales, and particularly on the North American side of the business. "
good,the culture and vibe is not good.  the training is extremely long and when you are finished with the training you still have no clue how to do your job.
good,"ADP is a fantastic company and I would never discourage anyone to applying to a job in IT there."
good,"Based on company location changes, if you don't live in a preferred location, there is basically no room to grow or try other positions.  It leaves you very pigeon-holed in the role you have with limited options."
good,ADP values their clients and really pushes to deliver stellar service. They have options for their employees to make it a competitive place to work and motivate them to be even more productive and knowledgeable for the client base.
good,i dont have any other comment except that this is a call center industry and the salary is too low. Goals are met but they do not give bonuses. The work is repetitive- that is pick up the phone and walk through the new users of the software.
good,If you choose to rely solely on your merits and your talents you will never get anywhere in ADP.  You need to make connections and work them.  Most jobs listed are already filled before hand.
good,"Flexible work schedule, ability to work from home"
good,"ADP offers great benefits and pays well. The environment is great. They have a restaurant inside the building and a cafe. "
good,"I created well structured project plans with many time sensitive deadlines in order to drive business and technology projects to completion.  They provided decent technology, such as powerful up to date laptops, and security measures.  I enjoyed that it was a fairly structured company."
good,"Lots of politics, you have to belong to a group to be ""in"". Otherwise you will be on the outside and you could lose your job quickly; without  regards to how well you do your job."
good,"The trainer was clueless and much too sassy. The cubicles had low walls, so you could hear people talking 3 rows away, and so could the person you were on the phone with. There was a small cafeteria that had really good food, and the courtyard was absolutely wonderful. The people on my team were friendly but the supervisors were new and very standoffish, they kept going back to their old team to hang out instead of forming new bonds with their new team. Once I worked 13 hours because the call queue was so backed up and our team so few. People kept quitting because of the workload and the hours got longer and longer. Was told I could trade a weekday for a weekend as I was trying to schedule multiple doctor's appointments at the time, but kept getting called in for mandatory overtime, which ultimately led to my resignation."
good,"Great company reputation and overall wonderful people.  Needs improvement in training,  mentoring and not overwhelming new hires with less than adequate training to do job. Specific departments really struggle and instead of making an employee want to grow, they burn out and leave unfortunately."
good,It's a hit or miss environment. It's very corporate America in some departments. Some times you don't feel valued. People easily steal sales from you.
good,"doing payroll for different canadian large companies weekly and bi weekly and monthly .  different remittances, year end T4 and Rl1   customer service by phone and emails to different clients .  working with  implementation team for setting up the new customer's demands regarding their payroll needs."
good,"Coworkers are fantastic. It's difficult to communicate with management and there is little to no training. "
good,"Best part of job is helping clients.and team building days."
good,"Overall, the company is trying to go in the right direction as far as investing in new technology. "
good,"ADP as a company is great. I have no complaints on ADP LLC. However the environments that are available in El Paso TX varies depending who the manager team is. I was at ADP for approximately 7 years. And I got to experience some of my funnest working moments and some of my worst. Not because of the work but because of upper management. "
good,"ADP is an ok company but not what I expected. I may have overrated the company coming in. Lots of changes in the SR. Leadership Team, which invariably impacts the strategic direction of our teams. It's with great disappointment, that I would have to say I would not recommend ADP as an employer."
good,"Importance is given to employee engagement Hikes and bonuses will be good, Latest technologies to work. Flexible work hours. Work culture is good. Less onsite oppurtunities"
good,"Non-management employees that work for ADP are easily replaced.  Many layoffs take place more than once a year.  Unless you plan on devoting yourself completely to their company culture, don't expect too long of a stay at this company."
good,"I felt there was a lack of support towards the representatives carrying the burden of customer support.  Managers aren't trained on the payroll products being supported.  The time management wasn't available to allow for case work completion from the many calls taken.  And despite many round tables to discuss what representatives needed to help perform better, changes were slow, if they were made at all.  I did enjoy the team work environment and made some good friends there, but ultimately the constant stress of the job led me to find something else."
good,The seniority people are mean and don’t want anyone new. It’s very cut throat and if you don’t do the job as fast as the people that have been there for many years they get aggressive about it.
good,"Good people, decent culture, not the best place to become a great product owner.  Lots of fiefdoms and inconsistency across BU's - this is changing but could be moving a bit quicker."
good,Don't plan to make it a career. the manager will play favorite and a lot of the time the favorite is the strongest. management seems to not know what they are doing and had the hardest time even getting me started in new positions. atmosphere is friendly with representatives for employees but managers can be a bit bullying and come of as confrontational.
good,ADP EzPay was a good starting point to learn the nuances of Payroll processing. They taught me alot of the taxing regulations and filing requires of the payroll system.
good,If you looking to slowly climb the later of a corporate environment ADP is for you. If your into wanting to explorer more than just the product team your assigned ADP won't be for you. Unless that is if you land a actual corporate none client facing position.
good,"Most financial decisions are made based on impact to shareholders.  Front-line people work hard, compensation is very fair for the area.  Healthcare costs could be lower based on company size and demographics.  Overall package (pay, benefits, retirement) is good."
good,I worked as a contractor. Felt unsupported by the management and engaged. It could be a great fit for many people but was not for me. Relaxed work place and good work life balance.
good,"Change is constant here.  Good, knowledgeable employees are let go to bring in cheaper workforce.  Reps are begging for help and not being able to get relief due to not enough staff."
good,Liderança é um ponto a melhorar. Ambiente de trabalho também não é bom.
good,"Overall, I believe the environment was pleasant to work in, however I did feel over worked and under paid.  High turn over rate, typical call center lifestyle."
good,"ADP is a great company.  I worked with inside sales outbound.  It is a very demanding job that requires constant performance. They give you what you need to hit your quota.  You will be given a nice base salary and great benefits.  There is job security but management will not make you feel that way.  If you are underperforming, you do begin to be treated differently."
good,Not easy to advance within the company.  A lot of Cliques and you must be a part of that to be given opportunities. people are given opportunity according to who they are friends with.
good,"ADP is a decent place to work with good pay, too bad they changed the business structure and lost good workers due to moving the jobs to the Southern states"
good,"High Stress. Management did not listen to employee voice. "
good,Overall ADP gets a mediocre rating from me. The one way they shine is with the wealth of resources for education and informational purposes. Compensation and bonuses are excellent though and that is a plus. Management is very spotty and it really depends on what department you work in and who you work under.
good,"Working for the RPO division of ADP's career advancement and is typically biased on candidates chosen for management positions. "
good,The job was quite typical of an IT shop's culture.   Good performance was recognized both financially and through promotion process.  The work was sometimes difficult but there was a strong sense of teamwork.
good,"ADP as an organization is very good to work but their management & HR department needs improvement."
good,"ADP used to be a great place to work.  Over the last several years it has become extremely ""political"".  Constant reorganizations across the company have created a nightmare (I went through three in my last seventeen months).  Nobody knows who to call or who reports to who. Senior leaders have become obsessed with protecting their turf or ""growing their empires"" rather than doing the things that make the most sense.  Duplication of efforts and terrible communication are rampant across all business units.  "
good,"On the technical side of the business, it was a good company to work for when I started 10+ years ago."
good,"there are great benefits, but no work life balance in implementation. there does not seem to be any senior experience persons left and you are left to do research on your own to get resolutions that you need."
good,great company to work for.  over the last 10 years I have learned a lot about security in the workforce.  I would recommend ADP to others as a Great company to work for.
good,"I appreciated the people I worked with and for, enjoyed my time with the organization.  Management was great, and worked well with all levels of employees."
good,"Fast-paced, aggressive timelines, but able to work from home. Honed my Captivate skills while working there."
good,"I really do love the job the I do. I love working with clients. Giving them great customer services. Unfortunately the company is going in a direction that they are closing smaller offices and opening up ""super centers"". I have been there 17 years and for the majority of my time I have really enjoyed working for the company."
good,"hard working fast paced but quiet environment.  Excellent top notch facilities with major amenities for employees, if you are in the field you should definitely check them out"
good,"The typical work day(remote) starts with reviewing emails, meetings and following up on outstanding items related to deals is progress.  ADP is the leading HCM company worldwide with tons of tools and resources that contribute to learning and development."
good,"Very busy work environment."
good,The job is great if you are a competitive young person who doesn't mind their entire life being about one company. The atmosphere is fun and all about blowing off steam when not working but there is no life balance. It becomes very difficult to have goals focused on your health and very little time to workout or spend time with family. If you fall in love with the company and culture you will love it. If you miss the other things you value in life you might grow to resent it.
good,"I've been with the company for many years.  I've enjoyed my time working for ADP however my commute is over 2 hours one way, so I'm looking to find a new position closer to home."
good,Management allows you to take lead and drive the projects. Worklife balance becomes tricky at times because of the number of releases we deliver over the year.
good,"Good work environment."
good,fast paced and stressfull job with insufficient training. the company has a very high employee turnover rate. I've learned a lot and met some great people.
good,"Nice people but no growth in phone positions as many"
good,"ADP offers a range of discounts on many different products such as computers, laptops, etc.  They also provide travel services which include wonderful discounts as well."
good,"ADP is a highly competitive yet fun environment. I thoroughly enjoy working there. My role, however, is uniquely dependent on the performance of others, which makes it challenging to control your success. Not all roles are like this-I encourage anyone to apply."
good,Worked here as my 2nd sales job. Good training and onboarding. They try to set you up for success. Had issues with leaders micro-managing and couldn't take it anymore. Watching lunch hours and clocking us in and out. Wasn't very professional
good,"Half of my group's jobs were moved to a different state.  1st of many"
good,"expected to do a lot of work with very little training "
good,Fulfillment type work in a fast-paced environment depending on title. The workplace culture was nice and the management made you feel special on your birthday or for any other special occasions.
good,Good Company unfortunately they are going with super center methodology and I am not located where super centers are located.  So I am looking for another opportunity.
good,ADP has been on a rollercoaster of change in the past couple of years.   They have been changing so many things trying to find the right formula and in the process of doing so has lost its way with the clientele.  I have heard from the clients for years that ADP is not listening to their clients and therefore they are leaving.  This caused ADP to make drastic changes which included mass layoffs
good,"I went into this job thinking that it would be any other sales job. Once you get trained and licensed you are thrown in to the fire with little to no direction. You get suggestions on how to do things, no defined ""do this for this process"" or ""do that for that process."" I don't function well in that environment. The pay is not great. The base is low for the amount of work you end up doing for this job. Managers say you can do this job when you're solely in the office (8:30-5). If you only want to achieve maybe 100% of your quota, sure. But if you want to overachieve and be one of the top people, you'll have to work from home, which is tough when you have to take care of a young child at home."
good,"Typical day would be doing cases that were sat in the team's queue"
good,"It was a good learning experience with ADP."
good,"ADP é uma empresa Multinacional de processamento de folha de pagamento, benefícios e RH."
good,"ADP's culture is supportive, and yet many are just a cgo in the larger machine. Those who are motivated can excel at ADP, provided you are at one of the super center locations. If not, opportunities for growth and movement can dry up. "
good,"Corporate feel, work life balance is the best here"
good,Great employee engagement and workplace culture.  However the workload was unrealistic and quality was sacrificed for quantity or productivity.
good,"Learned a lot about Customer Service and dealing with Clients."
good,"I've worked here twice in my career. The first time, I had great managers that recognized hard work and rewarded their associates accordingly. The second time, I worked under a manager that had a different opinion than me as to what a proper work/life balance would be. She wanted me to work 10-12 hours per day, when I was unable to. She fired me with very little notice."
good,ADP claims to have work/life balance but they require more work to be done than you could possibly get done in 50+ hours per week.  They are inconsistent in their employee policies.
good,Good pay and benefits.  A great entry level sales position.  A lot of cold calling.  Dealing with paperwork and businesses can be problematic at times.  Feel like your chasing people at times.
good,"Individual work teams fun, with good co-workers.  Poor work / life balance.  Poor job security.  Compensation within industry standards.  Health and dental benefits sub standard.  401k within industry standard"
good,"Working within the AVS organization as a Project Lead is a very busy, and productive.  However, the processes for implementation for clients can leave very little work/life balance.  Co-workers are willing to help and there is a general consensus for the team to work together. Overall, the company has been around for over 50 years and is a good company to work for.  However, like any company, you have to make sure its a right fight for you."
good,No traditional hours. Management will work you like a slave. Working here is like having a full time and part-time job at the same time.
good,The job is very easy however they are not willing to work with individuals who actually need schedules that benefit their kids and school arrangements.
good,The typical work day at ADP comprised of many fire drills and expedited requests for projects.  Additionally we were challenged with major resource constraints and needed to be dynamic in our approach and ready to adjust at a moments notice.
good,"- As a part of my job, I maintain a proactive client relationship to ensure overall product satisfaction and World Class Service."
good,Worked with great people. Call center environment stressful at times.  Overtime at year end a challenge. Great benefits and time off.
good,It was a good job in terms of working 9-5 and having holidays and weekends off. High pressure and small small reward. No level playing field for all. They would have set standards but would not hold everyone accountable for those standards. The training was very good. It's a good start for first sales job or if you want a challenge to see if you're ready for the next level of inside telesales or outside B2B sales. My whole problem with sales jobs now and with ADP...low salary and incentives. You sweat your butt off trying to hit quota and then you don't get much reward in the end financially. Some people benefit but not everyone is making the same amount of money. When I left only about 25 people were still there in same position out of about 65. Very high turnover because just about everyone felt the unfairness and could see it also.
good,"Working in the COS department was extremely busy with unlimited workload.  The most efficient employees are saddled with the most volume of work."
good,Great environment to work in staff believe in teamwork and working together. Recommend working there to anyone.Must be able to be a self starter and motivator.
good,"To work for ADP, you must be technically savvy and willing to work long hours. I currently am responsible for auditing paychecks for +15,000 employees. My coworkers are a joy and the environment is welcoming. Hardest part of the job - working very long hours occasionally. Most enjoyable part of the job - troubleshooting and resolving issues that continually arise."
good,"not enough base pay, micromanaging to the umpteenth level. In the interview process you're told one thing but in reality another.  good company but disengaging tactics by next level leadership"
good,"ADP is a good place to work. "
good,"disappointment is paying very less packages"
good,"Prettig bedrijf, fijne collega's. Verwerking van een aantal salarisadministraties"
good,"Started work for GIS, then changed to ADP, and then finally changed to IMEDX. Good place to work for until IMEDX bought the company."
good,"Nice work place with participatory management system, excellent cordial and communicative or supportive linkage with employees, sound employer-employee relationship, dynamic learning opportunity, independent intervention system, career growth and best package for assigned work, annual leave tour packages, emerging leadership for aspirants, good monitoring and better evaluation system are the key expectations."
good,"Belles expériences en classes de découverte, public varié et attachant, professionnels de qualité."
good,"A very busy company, you are always on your toes, if you get lucky enough to land a good department you are pretty much set for life."
good,"Depending on the role you are in work/life balance is hard and often times I was expected to work 7 days a week-whatever it took to get the job done."
good,ADP is not everything that everyone think it is. The pay is great and it can increase if you are willing to pay for courses and test. They will pay you back if you pass. The life to home balance is not there.
good,No real extensive training. On the first day you'll be assigned a District Manager to assist by prospecting through a list they will provide. High outbound calls to generate appointments and interest in ADP service.
good,"Great co-workers made my nine years fun.  A job that helped me to accomplish getting my feet wet in the HR industry. Hardest part of the job was working long hours during open enrollment to meet client goals.  Layoffs, unfortunately, have become a regular occurrence the last few years."
good,"took client payrolls over the phone, including doing fax payrolls. did tax break downs calculations for handwritten checks. figured 401(k) deposit amounts for clients. often answered client questions on taxes, bonuses. Learned about the different state tax structures. Enjoyed working with the clients. Enjoyed my co-workers and the team we had built.  Hardest part of the job was working with clients who were not prepared when they called in their payroll."
good,"there is a lot to be desired when it comes to the management structure and style in certain BU""s."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is training which helped in my performing my role effectively, also this helped to create one imaginary replica before appying our learning to job or in production floor."
good,"learned, payroll for multiple client process. learned more about PF, ESI, Income tax benifts, Exemptions for income tax, reimbursement component allocation, providing benefits like Medical , LTA,"
good,"The day will be started with so many client interaction. due to that it built the confident for the client relationship for smooth process. Management will support us for the periodical training for our development. Co-Workers are very very friendly and support us for any critical situation. Only at the month end and year end , because of Month end deliverables, validation of proofs and TDS Returns filing late night work will little difficult to handle.periodical outing and team lunch will be unforgettable moment."
good,"Comfortable work environment with excellent work from home capabilities.  Good work-life balance."
good,"Good to work in support project"
good,"If you work here plan on having more work than can be done in a 8 hour day. Management does this on purpose because they cannot see the flaws in their analysis of the market. If there are clients leaving in 9 months then they will not include them in the metrics for staffing,  This causes you to have way too much work to do sucessfully and therefore feel bad about your job. There is alot of talk about making changes and big improvements, but it is nothing more than talk."
good,"Working remotely is a major benefit, but even that is changing.  Direct management is usually very good, but they have little power to affect change.  Senior management is disconnected, so the decisions that pertain directly to the job at hand do not always make sense.  There are a lot of very smart people to work around, and most times everyone is willing to help and share knowledge.  The hardest part of the job is achieving deadlines and yearly numbers with some many internal road blocks put in place.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom to perform tasks and help others with little micromanagement."
good,"A typical day at work will have payroll operations run by the team members and I sign-off on all the payroll reports by validating the mandatory checks done by them. There would be meetings with the team members, Manager on the day to day activities."
good,"Very multi-cultural function where you learn every day new things."
good,"The company is great and I was very happy in my previous role within the company but transitioned over to grow in my career.  In this department, the employees aren't sufficiently valued.  The job is extremely stressful and there isn't enough support provided by the management team which is very frustrating to the employees within this department.  We are constantly asked to go above and beyond but its difficult when we are over loaded with accounts and bombarded with work.  It's not possible to properly service the clients in that manner."
good,"ADP is cautious but stable as an organization. It is compliant and up to date with current employee engagement trends, although many feel it is too corporate and impersonal. Benefit packages are mediocre in the context of the industry it so broadly services. However, many employees make careers there as the company attempts to re-assign any associates impacted by occasional downsizes or RIFs, which are uncommon."
good,"Spent more time in meetings than in the field. Typical sales job, when sales were good you were left alone to do your job but when sales were slow it turned into meeting after meeting."
good,very global team loved working offsite in cool locations around the globe. This was originally a ADP insurance estimating software company but then my bosses from Solera Inc down in San Diego
good,"I loved my previous job, however the focus seemed to change as time went on the company changed it's directive to more of a call center environment the past few years was not employee friendly as it was in the past. The quality of work didn't seem to matter either.  It was all about the metrics instead of truly caring about the clients needs."
good,I have learned many thinsg from ADP and that helps me to build my skill and knowledge.
good,"Start day by arriving at work, logging into computer, looking at emails. checking voice-mail and monitoring the ticket Queue. Working with associate for a Data migration or computer related issue. Data migrations consist of transferring all data and configurations from old laptop onto new computer and configuring for associate. Computer related issue varied from Email issue using Outlook, to lost data, viruses and VPN issues."
good,"- Cube w computer and cell phone/ipad"
good,"ADP has a lot to offer but it was a stepping stone place for me. It has a very high turnover. Sales reps average stay is about 1 1/2 to 2 years. I learned a lot about selling, cold calling and presenting effectively to customers. "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the people and assisting where I could to be a team player.
good,"Pound the pavement everyday"
good,"New division so no management hired as of yet and due to new software systems, a lot of bugs needed to be worked out. Worst part of job was the micro management and the programs not working once sold and installed at customers business."
good,Based out of the Elk Grove Village office which again was a fun atmosphere. Challenging Industry. High Turnover.
good,Any given day in this role would include meeting with cross functional teams eg IT to design the service instance of Salesforce for internal use. Or discussing functional specs with offshore dev teams. My co workers play a big part as we are very close. We all know when to have a laugh and when work needs to be done. The most enjoyable part of this role is the diversity of the job and seeing something from concept through to design and implementation.
good,"Plenty of bureaucracy and politics; Top down approach to management; Strong move towards outsourcing of development at the expense of quality; Wants to be an innovator in their industry, but unwilling to invest in R&D, and tiers of outmoded dinosaurs stand in the way should the investment ever be made."
good,"Go out in terrority to prospect new and current businesses. Took traning courses to learn payroll material to be knowledgeable on product we were selling. Cold-called and trying to get appointments with businesses that were already compliant with their payroll was the toughest part. The most enjoyable part was that we receiced commission and also were able to have ""buddy"" days to help drive sales."
good,Analysis and review data prior to staging and loading data to system. Back end reporting to ensure that the data loaded properly.
good,"This is a very good company to work for. On the other hand it's full of politics and hard to move up the corporate ladder, They offer a lot of programs to help out their employees with Tution, 401k and ok benefits."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is my clients that I work with daily.
good,"Very aggressive type of sale, always looking for the next sale and not concerened with previous numbers."
good,I am not one to talk about another company and how it is ran. I appreciate all the opportunities I was afforded working there. I prefer not to bring negativity to any future employees.
good,"It's a good job to start a career with but it quickly comes to a dead end. The management has very little knowledge of procedures or the industry, they are very client-oriented. Help and resources are limited."
good,"ADP is open and inclusive to all employees, highly pay fast pace environment . Only issue that I'm aware of is layoff is highly possible with target margin not meeting boardroom expectations."
good,"A great way to learn the back portion of Payroll Processing and Human Resourcing. The people who work there are the best. They, colleague and clients,  make the job amazing"
good,"I mean it's what you would expect in a call center, I will say they're very energetic."
good,New Jersey based company that buys out competition.  They reorganized job structure and cut down west coast staff as needed.  Sales will always be wanted.
good,I have been at ADP for almost 22 years and feel I need a change.  The most fulfilled position was as a BRM where I worked directly with our business units to help develop their strategies then work with IT to define how to ensure the appropriate outcomes.
good,Sales Training is of the upmost elite sales training. I have been able to apply what I learned at ADP to be successful at other sales positions in my career.
good,"It was an incredible experience.   It taught me a lot, I have always worked with clients and ADP gave me a lot of experience.   I worked my way up from client services to implementation specialist.   This gave me the skills to not only deal with clients but with our sales associates."
good,They make it very difficult for someone who works home shored to find another position within the company. They start you off with great pay. If you are working in the office it is easier to move within the company.
good,Bom lugar para se trabalhar. Bom ambiente profissional.
good,Good company to work for and grow with. lots of opportunities for growth and development. there is always something new and challenging on the horizon
good,I enjoyed it. I learned a lot but it wasn't a place for me. I needed it to make sure I learned a new experience to help me grow and be able to succeed in life.
good,"The reason why I rated this company low in some areas is because of job security,management and the culture.  I worked for the company going on ten years and was let go without notice, but was told I was employable meaning I could re-apply to work at ADP"
good,"Very stressful place. The more you know and do the more work they will give you. The job itself it is not hard but because of the turnover  they have they will always give you more and more work. I saw people cry because of stress. Also, a lot of people go on leave for the same reason."
good,"This place is a decent start for a recent college grad. But the work as a Payroll Implementation Specialist is STRESSFUL. I have seen 3 ppl pass while work do to stress. I seen numerous panic attacks also. The job itself is not hard, the hard part is trying to manage payroll issues and concerns for 30+ clients at a time. At one point I was managing 60+ clients, the is literally not enough time in the day. I would have to leave work and sign in and do work 4 to 5 hours outside of work to keep up with my work.  Overall good company but the stress is not worth the money. Great ppl and vibes just not worth your health"
good,"Multiple reorganizations, many changes in management, differing directions of strategy, rather interesting place of employment, it is best to know someone"
good,"Flexible timing."
good,"This company mostly hires through agencies whether hiring directly; there's nothing wrong hiring through agencies, but with ADP it's not a guarantee a temp position can be a full time."
good,Employees who are hourly are worked very hard with little training and micro managed. Unplanned illness is considered an occurence and too many can lead to warnings.
good,"You are just another number to ADP. No matter how well you are at your job, you are overlooked by folks who have poor statistic, who are unprofessional and who are never available. Plenty of politics, so stay shy of what you say around certain directors and managers. Complaining about a hostile coworker gets you let go. The pay starts at $19.88 and hour. You have to be a contractor for 6 months before they consider hiring you on full-time."
good,"internship was unorganized, manager did not pay attention to the interns. coworkers were nice but did not learn much during my time there. needs more structure"
good,"A product based company which has a service oriented culture with artificial work pressure for the employees."
good,"Working at ADP in the beginning is great. Training is vague as you’ll be exposed to year end unprepared & feeling thrown to the wolves of payroll. If you survive year end. You can make it! Come to work, do what’s expected of you & be quiet. If you are Looking to move up , don’t hold your breath unless you go to a diff department. If you stay in small business, so long as you’re in with the clique. You’ll move up. Be positive, perky & dress nice that’s what gets you noticed."
good,"Desenvolvi competências na área comercial e aprendi mais sobre a rotina de trabalho de uma empresa multinacional. Muitos cursos em inglês para desenvolvimento, clima intenso e reuniões constantes de Forecast. Certa flexibilidade de horários por ter atuado na área comercial e metas agressivas."
good,I worked here as a contract employee for open enrollment and it was a nice place to work. The trainers and team leads were knowledgeable and willing to help you. during open enrollment you definitely can get some overtime
good,Productive Workplace with flexible hours and plenty of problem solving opportunities. Enjoy out of work activities available. Learned project lead skills and problem solving skills learned.
good,"ADP is a pretty good company as a whole however, my personal experience was not the greatest due to management on the sales side. Lack of support, office politics ect..... ADP as a company however is actually pretty good."
good,.At the beginning peaches and cream but after five months all it's expected is anything better than  excellent no errors accepted. unable to develop what is learned.
good,"Depending on management, you could work in a very strict environment with no talking, or it may be very laid back. There aren't a lot of managers on site. Expectations are very high."
good,"ADP was a great place to start in payroll, they have good health benefits and training is provided to you for acquire your PCP designation. The team environment is fun."
good,"Travel within the designated area, meet with partners and clients. Training is good but the best fit for someone with a hunter mentality. Door to door and cold calling are part of day to day life"
good,"Volunteer 8 hrs/year, plus plenty of sick & vacation time! Company pays most of single-person health premiums. Depending on your manager, can work remote sometimes."
good,Nice place to work.  Workers are very supportive of each other.  A Knowledge base is in place to help search for solutions.  The database is well maintained.
good,"good pay and benefits...very competitive and quite stressful  work. "
good,"This job is good if you enjoy troubleshooting and constant pressure by managers to have perfect metrics, along with demanding clients who are always upset. Also software that is very complex. Taking time off will make your work pile up while your gone. However they do pay very well, above area wages for the Jacksonville FL area that typically has low paying work."
good,"At ADP work begins with a team huddle, work allocation, schedule project calls."
good,"Don't be fooled or misled: This is a high volume call center job and you will be ""chained to your desk"" in a revolving phone queue. Though the training is thorough and the best in the industry, it isn't for everyone and can turn out to be a baptism by fire for the unprepared or those who don't feel that attention to detail is all that important. The level of expectation for client service is exceedingly high with regular QC assessment being the norm rather than the exception. Evaluations are all metrics based and adherence/conformance, average handle time, time available, and other typical call center means of statistics tracking are strictly enforced. Expect little in terms of wiggle room if your stats aren't up to snuff. You either maintain and manage to fall within their expectations or you won't meet what they feel is required."
good,"Working at ADP definitely had its ups and downs. When i first started I felt as if I was thrown to the wolves to fend for myself, which was extremely stressful and overwhelming. The management is typically very young and inexperienced with managing employees and offering help. Many of them had too many people to manage so most were on their own each week. This job requires a LOT of driving and most of the time you will not be fully compensated for the amount of money you spend on gas and the toll it takes on your car."
good,Environnement agreable et cadre de travail serein.
good,"This job gave me many opportunities to speak with small business owners. I am now filling up the characters so let me just ramble on. I mean, it's a great first office job"
good,"Ok place to work.  I am being made to write this review and I really don't want to.  So, away I go.  Company is fine.  Big company.  Lots of employees."
good,The job didnt pay right the hours was changing and managment was crazy pay check was of a few times no benefits worked on days that was not suppose to
good,"- Job was very KPI focused making the job very routine based"
good,This was a fun job hot to travAL. wish it wasn't only temporary managers can seem distant and  lack of communication when it came to presentations and meetings
good,"ADP used to be a great company that valued it's workers. They have slowly pushed out the older employees to  replace them with recent college graduates and pay them substantially less in pay and benefits. It's all about the shareholders!! If you are not in sales, your opportunities for growth are not too good unless you want to move to one of their new ONE ADP centers in Norfolk, Orlando. or Tempe"
good,Generous benefits; salary could be more competitive.  Great products/services and opportunity to learn about emerging technologies.  Good emphasis on innovation.
good,"Benefits are great, majority managers are inexperienced. More time spent on paperwork than going out and selling. Great resume builder. The only thing that stays the same is change."
good,"Fair place to work.  Not much work life balance opportunities  available in implementation.  Company is mission driven.  Lots of training available, but workload prevents from taking training."
good,The culture here is very relaxed. Pingpong tables and other amenities are available to associates to decompress. There is associate engagement activities to make things easier for the associates while they are here at work. There is a gym for associates to work out during or after hours. Cafeteria is onsite and a cleaners as well.
good,"stressful, but loved my co-workers.  It is who you know, now what you know for promotions.  A call center atmosphere, great if you want 8-5 basic job, not good if you want to move up."
good,"Very good company to work for. You cannot make a mistake though, or you're gone. Lots of classes to develop your professional career. Very good work environment."
good,"I spend 12 years with ADP working my way up from a Procurement specialist to a Senior Buyer, I worked with alot of great people over the years, the IT team was the best"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, cultura empresarial positiva y enfocada al trabajador. Salarios muy bajos de la media en Praga."
good,"Nice team, good culture.   Great location,  Decent projects though they were small and mundane.   Easy to be successful there if you like to coast.  I enjoy bigger challenges."
good,"Awesome learning experience! Working in the field can really make you stronger when creating your own calendar. Each day is different, but you can never learn too much!"
good,A typical day in the office was pretty easy going. I was able to come in and get my work done in a calm environment. I learned proper office etiquette.
good,You are only a number with this organization You are only a number to this employer.  There is no human connection with anyone everything is electronic and by telephone
good,Overall good experience working for ADP. The culture of the organization is very employee friendly. The only challenge is balancing the client's needs with the capabilities of the company.
good,"Employee and client focused.  Investing in technology to enhance both the employee and client experience.  Good training available, many opportunities for growth."
good,"I did not work for ADP, they were a separate company that we worked with for payroll and benefits. they are a great company to utilize for these. Would love to keep working with them."
good,"I had a very productive career with adp, you learn alot from the tech leads however management was not knowledeable with the daily job of there employees"
good,"only hires younger people, age discrimination. qualified people are only interviewed for due diligence. Got an email saying this is not goodbye then another saying you are not qualified."
good,Was in the benefits Section and there was never help when you needed it. Didn't have all the tools that you needed. Felt a little underpaid. Was alright.
good,"The pay at ADP was appropriate for the role. Time off, insurance and benefits are comparable with other large companies."
good,The company has its ups and down and it just depends on what you are looking for in a company. ADP has sort breaks and 30 minutes for lunch so its best you eat at your desk. There is no work life balance during the end and beginning of the year. However they will fee you if you give them your lunch time. Overtime is available and there will be a variety of opportunities to make money. The benefits aren't the best either.
good,"A empresa tem uma cultura agressiva, com um ambiente de trabalho muito rígido e sem apoio."
good,They were switching from one software to another at the time and it was a big big change and alot of info was getting lost and all I can say is it was a train wreck.
good,ADP LLC is a global company that strives on celebrating culture.  The culture allows all employees such as myself to experience new opportunity.  The global locations support regional activities to provide a local perspective.
good,"Great work culture but limited access to resources and many departments are understaffed. High turnover due to stress and poor training but if you're resourceful and willing to put in long hours and hard work, you'll do well."
good,"Fun place to work when you’re looking for an entry level sales job. The management and other sales reps are like-minded and competitive. Average person stays for about 1-2 years, because upper management constantly seeks more from sales reps. Can get old fast"
good,"You start out with the worst referral sources for business, but if you stick around long enough you'll work your way up to the good accounting firms and banks.  A lot of foot prospecting/selling door to door is expected at the beginning."
good,Able to work from home due to inclement weather. Small and friendly office. Pay is not great and no bonuses. No opportunity for growth. Benefits are okay.
good,I was a contract employee working temporarily.  I did not received any benefits from the company.  I did like the location of the job and the culture was pleasant.  I love the work and the client account I was working with. Supervisory was micro-managed.
good,"Big corporate security with very talented staff. Lots of deiversity in personnel, including director-level and Vice President positions. A little slow to change."
good,Overall ADP is a great company to work for. They pay is good and their benefits are great.  The downside is that their was lack of training and management was not the best.
good,"ok place to work"
good,Excellent Company.  worked with this company 27 years and enjoyed working there.  was able to learn and improve my career over the time that I was there.
good,"Great management team.  Awesome co-workers.  Very challenging, learned lots.  The only things that I did not like was the travel and not paid for the extra hours worked."
good,"ADP was excellent in the beginning. Learnt a lot about working with team and manager, handling customers, solving issues etc."
good,Not enough hours in the day to keep your head above water . Laid off a large number of tenured associates.  Very challenging place to work the 5 years
good,"Their reviews are done while you're still in training. They have big pushes for the best location to have the most reviews for pizza or ice cream parties while you're still in training. You haven't actually learned the ropes yet and everything is promoted as being the best ever. It is a good company but micromanaging is level 1000. You literally have managers all over the place checking every second you spent, but they promote otherwise. other than that its a decent pay with a manageable job function. I think it's a good company to work for if you don't mind having to perform a lot of functions, perform duties between calls within certain timeframes, having a manager checking all you do every second of every day. But there's A lot of time off, benefits, and fun activities as well as a great location in a great part of Tempe on the lake."
good,productive work environment. great opportunity and great company. Gives an opportunity to work flexible and opportunity to learn for career opportunity.
good,Typical work day consisted working with field sales and accounts to secure sales for account payable software.  I learned how very important it is to build a great relation ship with existing clients and new customers.  To gain more and more knowledge on what would work best for the client with consultative sales.  The workplace had a good culture and full of helpful peers.  The hardest part of the job was promoting the new software ADP purchased and getting out their to clients and informing what it was and how it would be a great cost savings for their business.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer happy in their experience with ADP and closing the sale of course!
good,Typical day at work is hectic in our project with back to back meetings and deliverables. This may vary from project to project. We work in BPM implementation and try to onboard as many BUs as possible to use BPM
good,Main concern is no recognitions for d work we do. No proper justification on ratings..which leads to increment/bonus/promotions. But coming to work culture great place with team support...
good,"ADP is a good company for Entry Level Sales. ADP provides ongoing training.The technology could be more efficient and more consistent. Compliance Departments lack corporate communication and consistent processes which can be very counter productive and frustrating. Overall, ADP is not a bad company to work for as it does provide a spring board for success whether the employee chooses to seek career growth with the company or utilize the experience for another sales opportunity."
good,"Been with ADP for about 13 years.  Started great. But now just like any other mega corp.  Meh."
good,The job was to transfer the payrolls of clients from there current payroll software to ADP. Ensuring the payroll was setup on ADP so the client could process their payrolls without problems. The down side of the job was the transfer from the old software to ADP was to mirror the old software. This did not use any new or different functionality which was available on ADP
good,"I set up medical leaves for multiple companies throughout the united states , my manger worked in iowa, I worked in a team of 15, worked great together"
good,Good Co-workers. Management OK.  Culture was obsessed with too much socialization. Training was good.  Benefits OK.  Work environment OK.  Easy place to work.
good,I received inbound calls regarding benefits enrollment or life changes that affected benefits.  It was very important to explain how enrollments work and the terminology.
good,"Processing payroll and statutory compliance"
good,"Decent company to be employed at. Some recent downsizing has increased the workload for the remaining employees and the work/life balance can be difficult to maintain at some times."
good,Not worth the pay....Commissions were not fair. Partners that have been there for many years did not want to interact with new people so they were left out of deals.
good,"ADP est à l'écoute de ses salariés."
good,"-typical day at work was 8 hours per day, constantly occupied myself with more work."
good,A typical day in the organization involved a lot of customer service making sure to resolve various customer issues with the particular ADP product they purchased.
good,"This job is stressful, but it pays well and the benefits are incredible. "
good,ADP has a tendency to micro manager their employees. This can be overwhelming as most hires are experienced reps who do not need such oversight. This is very disruptive to the sales process.
good,"Good company to learn work, flexible work environment, good mentors, teach various tools, have offices around the world, no job security, professional."
good,"Good place to work for those just entering workforce. Really good training program. Well known name for certain business units.  Other business units, not so much."
good,"I feel lots of changes are happening and I'm not sure of direction the company is going.  I was able to learn a lot in my many years of service with ADP in various positions and departments."
good,ADP  is a decent place to work with a productive work enviroment. The management is always engaging and helpful. They offer room to grow and great benefits.
good,"Worked in the call center for totalsource, very busy, especially during open enrollment. Coworkers were great, direct manager was great, but felt like we were not heard by corporate about issues we face with systems and processes."
good,ADP is a good place to work if you want high turnover in an office. They have a great work environment but sometimes the training that is needed is not always given.
good,ADP is a good company with a long history of success and some great people.  The culture is results oriented.  Be prepared to set goals and make plans to achieve them.
good,This is a very high demanding position in payroll.  You have no face to face contact but are on the phone with payroll personnel.  You are constantly figuring out payroll issues
good,Good company to work at. Looking to progress in my career. Have over 10 years of HR experience and a Masters in HRD. Excellent work ethic. Bilingual: English/Spanish
good,I have learnt every day in this Company because the big international companies I dealt with and I had assigned to. The workplace culture was very creative and multicultural staff.
good,"Nice alot with ADP, nice place to work, work can sometimes be overwhelming, can take over life balance.  Benefits were great at the beginning they are now ok."
good,Great company to start your career. Provided a foundation of knowledge for the premier payroll provider. Solid benefits. Lack of career advancement with regular turnover.
good,ADP offers a flexible work schedule and the opportunity to work from from which is a valuable benefit in today's culture.  Remote opportunities still permit teams to collaborate via messaging or video and audio conferences.
good,"ADP is a good place to work at, associates and managers are helpful. Learned ADP applications and how to support the clients on ADP applications, good environment also."
good,contract position and It was a little dysfunctional however it was something new they were trying and I think the next go around it will work and they will be better prepared
good,"I am giving my review based on where it seems like ADP is going. My time at ADP has been great. However I have noticed over the past few years that ADP is one of those companies that seems like it used to be a great place to work however they started slowly taking away some of the more positive aspects from employees  in the guise of ""helping"" the employee. So using my experience at ADP may not be a good indicator of the future experience. The leaders, and the people I had the pleasure of working with were great. But depending on where senior management takes the company it may not be like that in the future."
good,"I held various positions, worked typical schedule, Monday through Friday, with paid national holidays. There is a cafeteria on the premises so made it easy to get meals."
good,ADP has excellent healthcare benefits. The associates at ADP were great to work with. ADP put great focus on servicing their clients. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to solve a clients problem to their satisfactory.
good,"Day to day activities are relatively monotonous, but you have the ability to make a ton of money without doing much strenuous work. Monthly sales quotas can be stressful but you are given a territory that's supposed to match that."
good,"My husband has lung cancer and ADP management allows me to take time off to be with him during his doctor appointments and cancer treatment also allows working from home if needed.  We can work from home on Monday's and Friday's every week, plus any time there might be an appointment that would required you to take time off."
good,"The potential for things to be great is there.  The management tend to derail good things and processes.  Time is needed to see what will and will not work within a department. Management changes were so often it can make your head spin. The name ADP if so well known, but they are not what they are made out to be. They are a payroll company that isn't great at doing payroll."
good,"I don't know what to say about my time at ADP. "
good,Solid organization making the right moves for shareholders. The move of putting like teams together will benefit the organization in the long term.  Investment in the tool set will improve associate and client experience.
good,"It was a job. I came in got my work done. "
good,A place with a lot of job opportunity. If you are looking for a competitive place that has opportunities to group and isa Saas company please choose ADP.
good,Typical day at work was tiresome. I learned how to assemble an air-condition coil. The management was poor. The hardest part of the job was trying to adapt to the changes.
good,"ADP caters to young business professionals. Seasoned workers are not valued the same way. Management covers the gambit from some top-notch executives, to others who cater to their own."
good,improved the accuracy of the timesheets and benefit for payroll.  program easy to understand and work with for processing deductions and timesheets for pay run.
good,Altijd met plezier gewerkt op verschillende afdelingen
good,Growing Company with many changes. Payroll company that focuses on Human Capital Management.  Various locations.  Responsible for reporting the job report to POTUS.
good,"good company, diverse.  Was able to work remotely and then travel to clients.  Good team that helped out often.  Directors worked well with their staff."
good,Business closed so termination of use of ADP otherwise processed payroll biweekly and did some reports. a very simple payroll for a small business of 10 employees
good,It was a awesome experience I learned alot about insurance enrollment. Password reset and communication with others. Helping people do enrollment over the phone
good,"got the work done lots of team work. open enrollment was the toughest due to a high volume of calls, but the team work there is amazing. I would recommend any one there."
good,Friendly hardworking people for the most part.  Company perks included free lunch about once a quarter.  Discounts to certain business around the area.  $20 take home dinner for 4 on Wednesdays if reserved with the menu changing weekly.  Occasionally able to work from home if needed.  They can be accommodating if needed for appointments.
good,This position was a typical call center position. You are on the phone from the point you start until your shift ended. You assisted the needs of your payroll clients in a high volume environment.
good,Don't go here if you have sales experience. This is a constant grind that will not pay you. There are easier ways to get paid. Would not recommend. Four more words till limit.
good,ADP has excellent training and hands on management. It is a great step into sales and working business to business. The position allows a lot of flexibility and you have to be highly self motivated in order to have success. The hardest part of the job is the ongoing monthly quotas and working with such a huge company.
good,"ADP is undergoing an aggressive transformation from a blockbuster legacy waterfall driven organization into a more modern technology driven Agile beast. Investment focus is towards R&D with cost cutting focused on the I&O, support and service divisions. Financial windfalls are focused on rewarding shareholders over employees."
good,it was fast paced.  Last job had a very heavy load and difficult to manage.  Previous job was more balanced but it was out sourced to India.  over all it was a good company.
good,"I do not work for ADP directly. My opinion is based on the relationship ADP has with my current entity. I cannot speak to working with the company itself. My title is based on the system access granted to me to take care of benefit inquiries for internal employees. As far as ADP specifically, the team is helpful once you are able to reach someone. I think communication and transparency when issues surface that potentially affect a large group can be better."
good,"Too many top level layoffs prevented the team from working efficiently."
good,I t ws a very fun and competitive job to have. I loved it beside the manager I had at the end.  Great way to learn sales and networking.  Commission based door to door sales.
good,"I was a Contract PM implementing Service Engine. Never a dull moment at ADP. Room for career advancement. "
good,Manager was very new and when i asked for help i was left in the dark. Constantly having to ask questions and was provided a decent amount of resources. It's very cut throat
good,ADP is a nice place to work. Not much growth within the company. Very hard to move up. Still would recommend to a friend as many are very happy there. Looking to transition.
good,The company is at a pivotable point where it needs to become more tranformative than it has been if it wants to retain market leadership in its space.
good,"Opportunity to be involved in the development and enhancement of HR software from customer requests to software deployment.  Great opportunity to see a vision of a solution, and work within the software development framework to see the implementation of that solution to deployment, to have the opportunity to demo that solution to clients and at conferences, and to respond to customer questions and future enhancement needs."
good,"it is a good company, "
good,n/a i dont have any thing to say about the company at this time if you like certain cultures that is the place for you. Hopefully you get the full experience.
good,"Not a bad place at all but disappointed with product, implementation, and service post sale.  ADP needs to do better or will continue to lose market share."
good,ADP is a good company to work for but the job security is worrisome. The benefits are great and the atmosphere also seems great. ADP management might be out of town but available.
good,"the payroll department is now a call center, which is demeaning for the level of professionalism and education that the reps have. If you take away call flow and just allow a direct line, employees would be happy and so would clients."
good,"Division I worked in was extremely stressful with constant changes.  However, employees are encouraged to seek out ways to improve internal processes, work on special project teams and it's a collaborative environment.  The work can be fulfilling and you will be challenged to provide the best client experience.  Company tried in a variety of ways to ensure employee morale was high,i.e. snacks, paid lunches, etc."
good,"Depending on your business unit, the workload varies on the time of year. During the year-end months, the workload can be very strenuous. "
good,"Solid place to work with both management and staff. Everyone cares about delivering excellent work and services to clients. Professional, dynamic environment."
good,Ok to work in this company and learnt new process and people around are good. Need more corporate environment in the company. Fun is there and overall ok.
good,"Follow HIPAA related procedures to ensure the maintenance of patient PHI"
good,"Overall ok place to work. Ok work/life balance. Benefits are great. Good advancement, if you are serious about your career. Management has its challenges but the culture makes up for what it lacks."
good,"Working here gave me the opportunity to find full time employment at Cablevision Systems LLC which I am grateful to because they open the door for me to not only meet a great group of people, but work along side them for 7 years."
good,Growth within the organisation depends on the product/project you work for. Very limited scope to move internally due to narrow minded managers. Win as One Culture is talked about but never followed
good,"Try to get a direct hire if you can. You can train your own boss. Someone needs to vouch for you. You need to know the right people. Once your in though, your in."
good,Productive and Fun working place. Will suggest my friends to start/continue their career here. Can learn  lot of new things related to the Indian Payroll process.
good,"Strategic, results driven solutions, growing revenue, advancing market position, strengthening product portfolio, and expanding customer base within diverse competitive markets"
good,"Lack of new clients, most clients were buying because they were getting too old to drive and were also part time Illinois residents splitting time in warm weather states."
good,"When I started with the company, they had just been bought by ADP, so it was in the middle of a transition period.  However, I did have a positive experience there.  I was on good quality projects that expanded my experience greatly.  The issue was that once they moved to ADP, the plan was to move to Roseland NJ, which I was not aware of when I first joined the team."
good,"50+ cold calls/day to up-sell current clients. All call/email, no outside exposure to clients. Ask recruiter if it is all inside - you will get bored."
good,"In today's world of software sales, I could be a great avenue to get experience if you are new to the industry.  It's a great stepping stone to the next company in your career."
good,Great place to work and learn..meet smart people but most of the time is spent  in grunt work and with a small percentage accounting for value added work.......
good,"Management will make or break you. If you have a good manager, you will be in a good position. If your manager is not great, you will not enjoy your time here. Quota is intense and continually increasing. You are only valued if you meet/exceed your quota."
good,"There are a lot of work opportunities depending on your skill set. This company is good as well as the benefits. However when it comes to salary, I think its too low compare to other companies."
good,Good place to start. If you are fresh out of school this is definitely a great place to start. Brings people out of their shell if they are an introvert.
good,"Started of driving doubles from Lafayette, La to Houston, Tx  Monday- Friday. Then I moved to making deliveries going to Houston to pick up Ford auto parts and bringing them back to Orange, Tx to give the other driver his parts for his route. Once separated I started my route which included 12 stops."
good,Workplace culture varies from excellent to poor depending on the type of group you are in and the type of manager you have. ADP does believe in a balance of family and work and provides great options to support that such as options to work remote or in-office.
good,"Flexibility, good people wanting to do their best, helping people globally,I really enjoyed my coworkers. They made the stress of the job manageable. Great insurance plan and generous salary. Really interested in work life balance"
good,It's an extremely fast paced environment. Can be very stressful at times. Must be able to multi task x 100. You can move up quickly if you are a fast learner. To be a manager requires a college degree even if you have experience.
good,It has been many years ago that I worked there.  I honestly do not remember very much.  I do remember a change in management when we bought out another company.
good,"I do not have a review for this place. If you are seeking a job, find one anywhere that you can. Take every advantage available to you. Network and connect."
good,"I only did the apprenticeship, I liked it. It was good experience and showed me what it would be like to be an account manager there. I am glad I got this experience"
good,"It is a workplace, a typical day is working, the culture is diversed"
good,"Sales is cut throat. Small territory, large quota. Even though there is defined territories it doesnt really seem to matter to anyone. Ive done sales all my life this is the most demanding."
good,great training program and great first job out of college. Introduces you to small business and the sales cycle. Can be a high pressure environment with a lackluster support system.
good,"I worked in their Louisville, KY office. It is like a typical office culture. you sit and work in your cubicle and answer your supervisor/manager. Don't give free lunch."
good,"Company used to be a great place to work. Now people are getting sick, passing out, going out on medical leave and are just overall, stressed. I don't want to go back."
good,"The company has an excellent culture as far as networking with one another. The training needs improvement and there needs to be more support for the front line specialists. The resources are scattered and difficult to search for. ADP offers an excellent product however, the developers have not put together a training module that supports the product properly. ADP is about quantity more so than quality. I worked there for over a year and never had a quality calibration with management. The training sessions were during lunch so there was only so much information that would be retained. ADP has a beautiful facility with lots of perks. The flexibility to work from home is awesome. You never work weekend or holidays and your schedule is around 8-5. Not too bad."
good,"Its been wonderful to be a part of the company . I can list the pros as"
good,IT is still trying to recover from a disastrous reorganization from a few years ago. A lot of things are moving in the right direction but a major brain drain and poor cross department communications can be quite frustrating.

good,"Ambiente agradável e silencioso com funcionários bem-humorados e alguns, particularmente, muito engraçados. Refeitório com diversas opções vegetarianas/veganas e fretado disponível para funcionários."

good,My current team members are  amazing. The employees of ADP are very kind and knowledgeable as well as loyal and dedicated. Everyone works together to collectively utilize all given information. The employees of ADP are what makes it great.
good,"Working from home allows you to balance your own work life. Working for ADP you have to work to find the answers to any question you have through the many informational avenues they provide."
good,"The company is undergoing massive change related to increased market competition and a failed off shoring strategy aimed at reducing overhead costs.  "
good,"- Work/life balance was good"

good,Its a very good company to start your carrier and a good company for Payroll experts.You can explore start to end process knowledge for payroll and its related services.
good,"The day I got the offer letter at ADP is unforgettable. We are in payroll processing department where we extend our working hours for business requirements. Associates are so dedicated at ADP that they do not need anyone to tell this and they extend their support to company, client and business."

good,"A typical work day would include client meetings, management of a team, co-ordination of several opportunities both internal and external.  The day would be extremely busy.  The people are wonderful to work with and the day would be hectic and challenging all at the same time.

good,"ADP is a stable company with plans to stay longer term in India. Typically, there is a mix of management from the local India tenured folks, externally hired ones, and some from the US. The US unit is waking up to the current trends in the market to serve it's clients, and now it's focusing on BPI, Innovation, Agility, and etc. ADP is more of a laggard in terms of the trends adoption, since it has no debt and is a cash rich company. Under the current US leadership there are shifts in the overall focus of the company and it seems to be opening itself up for adapting the trends in the market and that will help it survive and compete better in the markets it does business."
good,"This was a satellite office of the main district office in Tampa, FL.  I was the only support for approximately 25 employees.  Handled a switchboard, reception area, all contracts and correspondence and the only support for 2 sales managers (and teams) as well as the account executives who set up all of the products sold."
good,Good Place to Work. I learnt lot of new things and have great experiences in ADP.
good,Handled calls from clients regarding all aspects of Human Resources.
good,"Desenvolvi foco em resultado e no cliente, competências essências para o desenvolvimento do trabalho e entregas diárias"
good,"This is a forms building position. Meaning we program forms for all car dealerships across the United States. A normal day includes 20-30 incoming phone calls from clients, 20-30 follow up calls out to clients, updating cases and programming forms. There is also e-mail and incoming mail on a daily basis. "
good,Worked on exciting projects that were global and across several functional groups
good,"Not a bad place to work. Work hours were 12 hrs a day, 3 days a week."
good,Cold called companies all day long. Also called current clients but there are only so many clients.
good,I meet many extraordinary people during my time on the job.  Learned many values and tools to use on the job and also in my day to day life.
good,Typical sales job for a large company.  Self generate all leads and takes a lot of kicking the can up hill. Need to be self sufficient.  Company does need to work more on caring for its people.  The turn over is very high.
good,"Entry level sales job, great exposure, great training program"
good,"I enjoiyed my job very much but felt the training I received was insuffiecient to perform the job I was hired for, I kept asking management for more training and I never received it."
good,Came to work at 7am left at 8 or 9 pm  I eat at my desk most days loved my co-workers. hardest part of the job there is no balances for work and home. Most enjoyable is beinging around my co=workers.
good,"Decent company to work for out of school. Hiring standards and high turnover do not get reported on statistics most people are ""asked"" to leave. Management uses scare tactics to ""motivate"" employees. Turnover is very high, there is several new faces in the office per month at least. "
good,"The company provides a stable work environment and it rewards talents. However, work load is very heavy and working hours are very long. Base pay is not competitive."
good,Mistakes are highly frowned upon and some jobs have a very heavy workload. Year end is very very challenging for all jobs in implementation.
good,"I enjoy working at ADP. The sales reps are a great group of people, and other departments are awesome, and most of the executives I work with are smart and worthy of management. There are, as with every company, notable exceptions. But ADP is definitely above average at identifying people with the abilities that lend well to supervision."
good,"ADP in Manhattan is a good place to work, provided you get a good territory. If you get a bad territory you will struggle."
good,"Ductwork installation,dampers, diffusers, forced air systems, sheet metal installation of Air purification systems"
good,"This job was a good job. I liked the staff that I worked with in my department, but mgmnt played with 401k deductions and got in trouble with them. This hurt them financially and had to give layoffs"
good,What was enjoyable about the job was learning new function each month and interacting with the Sales teams.
good,"As a long-term temp I worked at ADP, the company that gave me the assignment was Randstad Temp Agency."
good,High volume business to business sales via telephone. Training program was excellent. Sales environment and culture was very competitive. Team leads were charasmatic and very helpful.
good,I worked thru a temporary agency but I was not treated any different. I had access to all of the perks standard employees had. Loved that company.
good,A typical work day was a 24 hour operation and receiving knowledge in a field I was unfamiliar with. Programming of jobs was interesting to learn although the career outcome in today's market does not amount to stability.
good,soy mu productivo en mi trabajo y con pañero y me gusta hacer todo lo posible como para mi y para la enpresa hacer una buena publicidad en cada lugar que yo balla y haga
good,OK place to work. I think the branch I worked at needed improvments in the management.
good,"Excellent training, co-workers and clientele. Would like to see improvements in leadership, implementation and service."
good,Receive top notch sales training. Great benefits package and opportunity for career growth and development.
good,ADP purchased TD Waterhouse which was a pleasure working for and where i gained most of my financial experience.
good,"each day would start with doing finacial reports- entering finace data , membership update, bank deposit, there is a conflict in management which is a concern to me.. there really wasn't any part of the job that was hard. I did enjoy meeting the many new people that came in. being a person tha love people and communicating I had a great time just feel my season there has come to a close."
good,Advanced my selling techniques and molded the process to fit a longer sales cycle.
good,"Deixei a empresa por opção, pois busco novas oportunidades. Aprendi muitas coisas na empresa, o clima de trabalho é ótimo, a supervisão e gerência são pessoas capacitadas e os colegas de trabalho atenciosos e participativos."
good,Great work environment with fun ways to bring in business. A fantastic place for an entry level or straight out of college experience. Not a ton of room to grow or move in an on going career path.
good,"The people were great, the management was average. They had high turn over"
good,I like working here we handle member premium and benefit to make sure they have active coverage. I like the people I work with. It a good job to work for. I work with good people. Team lead work with me a lot
good,"A typical large company where the pace can vary from slow to fast with sometimes realistic deadlines and at other times tight deadlines."
good,A typical day at work involves traveling to the client's site to train on company's software.  You learn something new in the HCM consultative role because each client setup is different and requires multiple skills sets to train.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the client discover aspects of the system that they were not aware of.
good,"It’s not awesome to work at adp but they pay well and provide you with a laptop so it’s not all bad "
good,"ADP is a descent place to work, However, compensation is below average compared to most other payroll companies in atlanta.  company no longer participates in work from home in certain departments."
good,"Very difficult to get promoted, some of the leadership there right now does not have the best skill set. Sales marks are some times very in realistic in certain roles."
good,Lots of fresh out of college kids. Lots of pressure to put up numbers and if you don’t then you are also called out with your bad numbers. Good training however and a great job for someone that wants to learn sales .
good,ADP has been working to evolve and adapt to the changing business world. An associate's experience is very much determined by their manager and team they work with.
good,"Challenging data environment with wealth of HR, Payroll and time data across the enterprise. Technology stack is now impressive, with clustering, analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning normal fair for solving customer problems."
good,"Great Management, challenging work/life balance and required to collaborate with offshore team daily.   Great Management, challenging work/life balance and required to work with offshore teams daily."
good,I worked at the call center taking about 40 calls a day. I wanted to work on the HR field not the customer service field. It is a great company to work at I was just the wrong department.
good,"- offer good package"
good,"Typical day at work includes meeting with team, discussing work with ux designers, sharing screens in Blue Jeans, or Web Ex, or Lync/Skype. Hardest part of job is trying to focus on work with many meetings. Most enjoyable is lunch in awesome cafeteria."
good,"Not a lot of stability within management."
good,"if you are over 25 and have had years of sales experience, this is an easy job for you and you can make good money. if you are looking to further your career, it gives you good resume experience. your experience is largely dictated by your direct supervisor. you must spend a week in NJ in all day training. you will be with a large group of 22-24 year olds. whether or not you have freedom depends again on your SE, so ask them in the interview how often reps are required to be in the office. cell phone is paid for. gas is paid for monthly. company ipad and laptop provided. can be a lot of fun sometimes, can be a drag sometimes. just like any other job. again, if you have had experience in high-level sales (working with larger clients on more complex sales), you will find your work to be mostly mundane. there are opportunities for raises but of course, then your quota is raised and your chance of hitting the next tier in commission is lowered so no one wants the high level promotions. they should really fix that. incentive trips are marketed as free but actually, they take the taxes out of your paycheck later."
good,It was a good job I went to work and took care of my job so I could bring home a decent check. It wasn’t bad at all you meet a lot of different new people
good,It’s been a few years since I was employed by ADP. At that time they were going through a lot of changes. The pay rate and benefits were one of the best parts of working for ADP. There were a few great leaders sprinkled in with the not so great managers. Advancement opportunity depended upon who you were and what department you worked in. Company is like many others running the numbers game caring less about client retention than meeting sales quotas.
good,"The people I work with are great. The job is relatively easy and you get paid more than the amount of work you put in, but if you're a hard grind kind of employee you'll get bored quickly. I had the highest metrics on my team by a very high margin and was told I needed to bring my numbers down to balance the team. Essentially shooting for mediocracy made me leave."
good,"You will work hard. It is very fast-paced so be prepared to learn a lot of different technologies and know that you must on-point and focused every day to do your best. There is mentorship available, although you will need to be autonomous in your role and do well to be kept!"
good,"I absolutely loved my role at the company. Working with my co-workers (and most clients) was very pleasant and productive. The main challenges involved a change in infrastructure and issues with a new system, which required some re-learning and adjustments to the product culture."
good,"During my time at ADP, I had a great experience. I had the coolest boss ever, I loved my job, and was often able to work from home. PTO was generous, too. They have pretty good benefits."
good,"I believe in what ADP has to offer clients and potential clients.  I have seen what the tech can do in improving businesses productivity and growth as well as being able to maintain and keep their clients employees engaged."
good,"great career patting - training is top notch. Some managers lack development in employees, micro management is draining, and your constantly competing against everyone that works for ADP - partners, coworkers, inside sales etc"
good,"ADP provided a different perspective with it's campus environment. It provided a lot of benefits that proved to be beneficial and convenient in helping to give Work/Life Balance. However, financial compensation has room for improvement. If given the opportunity, I would definitely work for ADP in the correct capacity."
good,"It's hard to feel like you matter when you are apart of such a giant company. "
good,The hardest part of the job is keeping the clients pleased. Workplace culture is ok as well. Great peers/ coworkers. Also willing to help out when needed.
good,"Very stressful environment! Limited help by upper management. Manager spent a lot pf time ""in meetings"". Many managers did not even understand the job. ."
good,A old company that is just now updating their software and business systems after many years of using old software. Company needs to promote great employees faster instead of keeping them in the same role year after year.
good,"ADP is a payroll company that extended itself to many companies in the tristate area. It was a fast paced, deadline driven business that addressed the need of the clients rather than it's employees"
good,"Like anywhere else, if you are in a group headed by a supportive and well-regarded manager, your experience or impression is mostly positive. There is nothing else to say."
good,"ADP is a wonderful company to work for if you have a great leader in place to support the team.  "
good,"To succeed at this organization the mentality should be ""there is NO work/life balance"" One of the pros as a result of the dedication is the salary structure is rewarded handsomely as well as recognition."
good,Adp is a nice place to work..I worked with many different tools and object.. Standing on my feet for twelve hours a day was the hardest park about it other than that it was nothing to it. My supervisor was very nice and patience.. I start building air conditioners and brazin and I love every minute of it..
good,ADP as a whole is a great department to work for. The reason for me leaving was my Business Unit did not promote from within and did not pay competitively.
good,"My experience at ADP was always a semi-feel with being a certified Brazer , it was quite stressful but I loved doing my job and working the lengthy hours ."
good,Of course you have to work hard to get somewhere in any company. ADP is a great company to be employed by as you are a fit for the position that you're in. There's always opportunities to advance in your position or to move to a different one or another department.
good,"Work day started by having to review if any outstanding production issues were addressed."
good,I throughly enjoyed working at this company learnt a lot about how to speak an acknowledge people. I would go back their again but after my father passing away I don’t think I could
good,"Stress and overbearing management was extreme. Favorites were definitely chosen. Looked at as a number rather than a person. People are not very welcoming. Turn over is insane. "
good,"I was employed through a temporary agency which mean I do not know much about the company it self. "
good,The company does not train properly. The management team knows nothing to assist you in doing your job. Every man for himself. I went out on leave for my kids. I ended up sick myself. I was terminated without good cause. My manager cut off communication. I had never had any discipline issues. They just threw me away.
good,"Fast-past job. Most staff feel over worked. Training needs improvement. Employees are friendly. Onsite cafeteria, gym, and free parking are great perks."
good,"The first few years at ADP, my skills were well utilized and I was able to take yearly training courses and attend relevant conferences and seminars. The past few years, I have been pigeon-holed into one somewhat related area, and been refused any training money whatsoever. The teams are getting smaller, as people leave, but they still have to handle the same amount of work. After losing three seasoned engineers, they finally hired a new intern to replace them all."
good,"The days were long and the work was very repetitive.  However, they did offer lots of overtime hours to help supplement the base pay. I found the management hard to communicate with."
good,"ADP changes key factors of your job at a whim.  This position is partially a call center job. Initially when I was hire the expectation was set that I would get 8 calls. We are now rounding towards 20 calls a day. With the volume and the details involved in resolving 1 call, this equals out to be a call ever 2 mins for 6.5 hrs a day."
good,"Not great atmosphere in the office, but good grounding to get you started in selling. Company was in decline when I left (2015), but I hear that things might be picking up a bit."
good,"Being such a large company and handling of so many clients, it's such a great place to build your skills.  I learned more there in 5 years than many would learn in a payroll lifetime."
good,Nice place to work. Diverse and good culture. Good Work life balance. Decent pay. Lot of opportunities to learn various technology. Like working for ADP.
good,Well known for their training and if you can achieve a president's club that gives you an edge once you would like to look outside of ADP. Easy way to make good money at a young age and give yourself a good base on selling skills.
good,Working at this company is good if you don’t stay so far. Get yo work on time and do as they tell you then you won’t have any problems. Because they are the one that your job is base off.
good,"Overall ADP is a very good company to work for however, it's very difficult to have Job Work/LIfe Balance due to lots of OT, and work during holidays."
good,"Good company for experienced"
good,"I was hired there on a Bench Position which meant there were no open territories,  I went through training and was told at the end of the year there would be territories that would open up.  Only they did not and 2 company transfers to my location were moved ahead of a few of us and I was let go."
good,Senior leadership has lost its understanding of manager and below to associates stress level and expectations. The company is a fortune 500 company but has lost it employer of choice mantra based on the reduction of benefit quality such as healthcare.
good,As a District Manager you have the opportunity to develop your outside sales skills.  This opportunity was a good stepping stone for future sales opportunities.
good,never a dull day - different job everyday. A typical day was asbestos removal from houses-shops ect walls.the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the finished project. the hardest part of the job was wearing the asbestos suits on hot days
good,recently ADP made changes to their service model which severely impacted associates. There is much more stress and lack of growth. This has caused many good associates to leave.
good,"for most departments the day to day calls are never really the same... every day is a new challenge which was fun and exciting and when you love helping others, it is a please doing customer service... the workplace culture can be different at times, if you are a full time employee then you have a close relationship with your team but you also see so many temps come and go but you ultimately make a relationship with them as well and it becomes hard to see them go..."
good,"Very good flexibility and Work life balance.I could learn many thing in terms of technology.The culture is good.There is no hard part of job."
good,"Collaborated with the Implementation team on various ad-hoc projects as well as internship-long projects such as quality assurance. Good overall workplace culture- good people, always willing to help and teach new things."
good,"Company is undergoing significant changes in the HCM industry, but still unwilling to change fundamentally enough to become truly global. Innovation and new technologies are being announced prior to any real progress. Clients are often extremely unhappy."
good,"When I came to the company I had read many reviews about the tenure at ADP and the popularity of the company. It seemed if you were able to work for ADP you were set for life. After working for the company for 2 years it's become apparent that this was ADP it is no longer what ADP is like. The focus is moving to be on quality of the work not the quantity which sounds like a great thing. However the approach being taken is not going to satisfy the client base. There is supposed growth within the company, which they do quickly promote some individuals however those individuals are able to be moved quickly into other roles without much choice. The new strategies for ADP's approach are great in theory, but are difficult for associates to be supported through and the associates are who support the clients. There is too much uncertainty that I would not recommend this job to others nor the business."
good,ADP takes the time to listen to their employees.  There are several initiatives that promote the sharing of best practices and process improvements. Training could be better organized.
good,It's good place to work but growth is very slow and salary hike is not much as expected not much of learning and management interaction is very less but good industry exposure
good,"Eu amava trabalhar na ADP, porem o reconhecimento profissional só passou a existir quando eu estava completando 11 anos de carreira, Tínhamos estabilidade profissional, mas trabalhavamos sob muita pressão. Eu até gostava e comemorava quando concluia uma tarefa com êxito, Era estressante,mas havia uma parceria, todos estavam engajados em fazer o melhor e atender o cliente de forma eficaz, esse era o nosso objetivo."
good,"ADP is a process oriented database administration organization. In my case , in Health an Welfare Outsourcing, project management was the life blood of managers with a clear deliverable schudule with a constant aim at client satisfaction."
good,Great Company Culture but Terrible Compensation for Sales; absolute boiler room hiring culture for entry level sales positions but if you can hang in there for at least a year it will pay off.
good,Training in any department is inadequate.  Needs corporate training on how to train.  Too many people stuck in doing things their way. Could definitely take some improvements.
good,"Researched and secured new accounts in the South East and the South-Central Territory."
good,ADP is a good company to work for in view of it's global branding. The employees have good benefits and the company provides a stress free environment.
good,"Adp es una empresa muy productiva gracias al apoyo que da a sus trabajadores, permitiendo una conciliación de vida laboral y familiar plena, donde se aprende muchísimo durante el día a día..."
good,A good company to work for but very limited opportunity for advancement in certain client roles making it hard to establish a career path with the company.
good,managers and workers are amazing.  the only thing is that your job is not secured here. also you will remain clueless until  you ask the right questions
good,at adp reps with no sales experience are expected to run a successful sales-cycle. this is a very transactional sales so aggressive youngsters can find success at adp. depending on the personality type - it can be a great place to work - just not for me.
good,Work hard play hard. Dog eat dog. Kill or be killed. Turn up. Always be closing. This job is for young people who can deal with extreme pressure. It can be rewarding and taxing.
good,"Best thing about ADP is the people that work there. Collaborative environment, management encourages associate input/development. One must like change because it happens a lot. While you work hard, ADP does tend to pay better than average wages. Over last year ADP had to lay-off several hundred managers/professionals to off-set client losses mainly due to increased competition and lack of product usability/functionality which they are actively working on."
good,Good place for starters.  Not a great place for advancement.  Lot of opportunities for learning technical skills.  Good compensation.  Not easy to move between different groups.
good,Awesome benefits plan. Great company to work for. Great team building activities and huge community and volunteer opportunities. This company provided tuition reimbursement and the ability to develop as a HR professional.
good,"Working with the wonderful associates was great. However, Senior (Corp) leadership is indifferent to the local office as evident by the restructuring into Mega Centers and elimination of local personnel."
good,"Overall company is good, its completely employee centric company. pays are average and growth also very slow in the organization. If you want to just relax at one position and do nothing then you can join this company, especially woman employee should try for it."
good,"-Learned a lot."
good,"Overall a good place to work, but lack of movement internally. Benefits and compensation were average. Management worked with employees well."
good,Good place for experience and growth... Good benefits plan and they offer the CPA... However they offer Low Salary and its not easy to deal with all payroll coordinators as some are very rude and they lack knowledge of payroll tasks
good,"A typical day is very busy, the phones are busy and there is no time to actually work on our clients issues unless it's overtime which is hard for people with children."
good,"it was for 6 months and i worked hard everyday even on weekends.I was in the Fishery and Animal Husbandry department and considering i live closer to the Ministry than all my colleague,i had be there more often than them."
good,Challenging workplace with many products to implement and support. Large company that is trying to change with the times and client landscape. I enjoy the people that I work with and their dedication to the client experience.
good,"Extremely good financial reporting systems; long hours of work; dynamic leadership, evolving product stratedy, good global coverage"
good,Great coworkers and facility. Recently completed training for role specific training. Very exhaustive training that covered a vast array of topics.
good,"Don't bother working your tail off here, it'll go unnoticed. You could be given challenge after challenge and exceed at them, but you'll never be your boss's favorite. Just like any corporation, as long as you're willing to suck up to the management, you'll do just fine. If you try and step up, do more work and try to make productive changes, you will be told that you are ""over zealous"" and frowned upon because you're out doing your counter parts, and you will be asked to stop doing so much work. I work for the production end of things, you would think they would want someone who works hard, get a lot of work completed with minimal errors. Nope, they want you to suck up to them and in turn they allow you to slack off with no repercussions. It's not an equal workplace and it's blatantly shown. I also can't handle the hours they make us work, it doesn't allow for any life with your family at all. They aren't willing to help you change it either so you can see your family more often. I can't work for a company that is more concerned with their image about taking care of their associates then actually taking care of their associates."
good,"Associates are a great group of employees.  Good work ethic, team environment."
good,Nice working culture. Employee oriented. Regular Skip level meetings. Family day & Annual Day celebration. Quite busy day at work. Learned a lot of new things such as Crystal reports and Oracle. Management is quite co-operative. Co-workers are really helpful.
good,"Good work pace leading.Creative professional team."
good,ADP provides a work environment that will give you room to grow.
good,"Good, employee friendly, has a great work atmosphere."
good,"ADP Dealer Services provides integrated computing solutions to nearly 25,500 auto, truck, motorcycle, marine, and recreational vehicle dealers throughout the United States. this is a fast pace as well as technical environment."
good,"ADP its self is a great company, however the management could use a bit of training. They do offer education assistance and encourage their associates to continue their education."
good,Great benefits/culture.. the compensation TOTAL  package is good.
good,It's a fast paced work environment that uses a group sell approach in many cases which is both good and bad.  The good is that there are more opportunities to penetrate accounts.  The bad is that companies often get inundated with calls from every rep.
good,"Typical day was at work when I worked whole night for non stop 14 hours on the eve of Diwali."
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, porém com asdministração e gerenciamento deixando a desejar."
good,"ADP (for me) did not think enough of the employees, and too low a priority was given to employee overtime.  The workload was such that I was unable to get everything done that management wanted, as well as customer demands.  I also applied multiple times for advancement, and remained a CSR the entire time I was there.  I'm very flexible, and not a complainer, and I fully believe I was qualified for the positions I applied for, but was beating my head against a brick wall."
good,Work Culture is amazing with good talented people around. Great Management
good,"My typical day begins by checking my calendar for scheduled appointments and activities going on that day. Read and reply to emails from District Managers, clients and co-workers. Process changes requested by clients to accounts. Answer incoming calls from clients and DM's. Set up new payroll accounts from proper documentation provided by the sales team and clients. Perform outbound welcome calls, training calls and follow-up calls to clients. I also assist other members of my team as needed with data entry. If needed I assist Resource Coordinators with new orders and verifying information."
good,Antiquated practices! Dated perspective!!! I would work there again hoping that things progressed.
good,"Great co-workers with an opportunity for various training courses. Company purged many of its older experienced and knowledgeable managers in 2009 and promoted a younger, very enthusiastic cadre of juniors into the management ranks. The result has been chaos with very poorly run departments with low efficiency and poor utilization of existing staff. The existing staff tend to keep up with the work load by working excessive hours."
good,Generated new accounts by prospecting and cold calling on a daily bases.
good,"At ADP a typical day at work, you input sales order, you learn how payroll for the vaious payroll works"
good,ADP/TLM productive company but limited minimal growth for minorities
good,Its very good and multicultural environment. Each and every associate are helpful..
good,Competent and likable management. Fun coworkers. Decent work life balance.
good,Se realizaba todos los miercoles evaluaciones de quien era la empresa y todo lo relacionado conn nuestras actividades diarias cual era nuestras debilidades
good,Worked with experienced co-workers with a team spirit. Stressful job that sometimes demanded high productivity. Hardest part of my job was my conflict with quality of work over quanity. I preferred to get it right with the first entry than to have the claim come back with a denial. I recieved great joy in reading reports and analyzing diagnosis.
good,"The day starts at the end of the previous day to prepare how the Today will be. I learned a lot about working smarter vs just simply harder. Management is ok, but I had some amazing co-workers. The hardest part of the job is calling or trying to contact business owners that have been hammered by other ADP sales reps, whether it be inside sales or other departments."
good,Unlimited potential to grow. ADP has a genuine care for employees who work hard and act in the best faith of the company.
good,"This job is a good one on a scale of 1-10. Probably about a 7. If you can get over all the BS. It's a different crowd and they stick together as most have been there for many years and feel entitled and don't like change. I would love it if they sent a message to the entrenched management there that you are arrogant, lazy, overweight, and over paid and we like change. At least in the EGV office. Best thing if your new is to be positive, nice, helpful, and don't concern yourself with all nonsense. Keep your head to the grindstone."
good,"ADP has some amazing opportunities as it's a huge company. Like most jobs, a lot is dependent on your manager. They are surprisingly unorganized for such a large organization and you have to be good with high stress but you will always have something to learn. "
good,Good place to work and nice people.  The compensation is about average across the board.  Many locations across the nation. The best part about working there was the location as I live about 10 mins away.
good,The culture is great but you are worked to the bone. Not paid enough for the work you are required to do. Management is based on how well you are liked and not based on the quality of work you do.
good,"The best learning experience I ever had.  Training is supported and encouraged.  ADP supports employee development and growth.  They offer very good benefits, and their growth is slow and steady."
good,A typical day was busy from start to finish.  You learn something new everyday.  I am sure the culture is different now.  I was there a few years ago.
good,"Don't expect too much, for innovators , this is not the place.  This is manager's company. Actually all are very senior employees like 23-30 years in the company, so we will not be in a decision."
good,It was ok use to be lots of over time. But it doesn't matter what you have going on at home they don't care you still get a point no matter what. Good luck
good,"I think that ADP is a good place to work, but upward mobility can be difficult. You'd need to be willing to move to different locations and/or work in different areas to be considered for a promotion."
good,"Very little to no training provided by company"
good,"Benefits and pay are fair. However, the job is highly stressful, there are blackout periods where you cannot take vacation. Implementation Specialists are given unrealistic expectations and are constantly setup for failure. If you’re looking to work with ADP, I suggest a role that doesn’t deal with clients. Otherwise, save yourself thousands of headaches and panic attacks."
good,This is a good entry level sales job. They are a good company with a ton of resources but it is becoming a saturated market and if you are remote and do not have an office to report to you are kind of left to learn the job on your own.
good,Coworkers are great sometimes. Management no so great. It’s stressful. If you don’t kiss butts to the right ones you get no where. If you are the one to be noticed for your work don’t expect to get anywhere. The work you give and are great at you don’t get acknowledged but more work thrown at you.
good,Good place to start a career in HR. Opportunities for growth and advancement. Huge company with remote working opportunities. If you're looking for someplace to start and Hr career it's a good place.
good,"Pay and benefits are good, management is good and supportive, coworkers are awful, not aware of how to do their job, people are not held to the same standards"
good,"good work life balance, and benefits. people work hard and have fun too. while some teams are good in keeping up with trends, some teams lag behind in technology adoption."
good,ADP was my company's payroll processor.  I worked with the ADP's team daily.  There seem to be a high turnover and my team was very competent and hard working.
good,"Overall, the place is great to work out. There are many challenges I am facing in my department due to it being new in our location, but the overall company is great"
good,"My 2nd role at ADP was not what I expected at all. While the management and coworkers were nothing but helpful and understanding, the job was way too tedious and stressful. There was very little room for error and while I understand being precise and doing the job correctly, I feel like I was expected too much."
good,It was a good job.  The location has a lot of traffic.  The pay was a lot less than my coworkers with the same position.  The company has room for growth.
good,"Good for some time , then feels stagnant.  If you want a steady work life balance then this company is for you.  The leave policy of company is very good."
good,"Para quem quer estabilidade é uma ótima empresa , fácil acesso com clima legal."
good,"It’s low stress but low profit. If you like cubicles and daily meetings, emails, etc then it’ll be fine. The base salary was awful and even if you hit 100% bonus it was still poor pay."
good,"On the phones all day"
good,"Challenging and it keeps you going"
good,"I enjoyed the work challenge,people,and staff comfortable place to work. I would recommend this company to everyone. They give you opportunity and chances"
good,"Great work environment, culturally diverse company. Great work/life balance. Layoffs are serious and out of nowhere. Additional benefits are excellent."
good,"Good experience at ADP, they were a machine in terms of how they operated. The management is very focused on growing the business and they reward long tenured people for promotions."
good,"ADP is in top 250 of fortune500 list."
good,"good company, excellent benefits, recently many changes"
good,"When I was with ADP my mornings began with meeting with my clients to discuss what I needed from them to meet the daily deadline.  I also provided them an update on what I was working on for them and gave them and ETA on when I would have the task complete.  I was required to multi-task everyday.  it was nothing for me to work 12 hour shifts because my workload was so heavy.  We did not have enough manpower to handle the new business they were bringing into ADP.  I worked from home, so that enabled me to work longer hours during the day."
good,It's a large safe company which makes financial and technologies decisions based on the needs and satisfaction of the clients.    Additionally they treat employees very fairly.
good,"Employees were helpful when needed"
good,I worked part-time then full time at ADP and learned a lot of software and time management skills.  Being able to learn programs like Concur and Oracle have helped me in the long run.
good,"Great pay, working from home, I enjoyed the work.  My teammates were great.  I had the opportunity to run meetings and work with external clients.  Overall great."
good,"great atmosphere and great quality people. not a lot of opportunity for some and others have great opportunity, so it all depends on what you are set up with from the beginning."
good,"Various tasks from supporting users, servers and applications to deployments of releases into test environments."
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, con un ambiente grato."
good,"Pros:"
good,"this job was suppose to be a entry level, call volume too high not enough employees and a very stressful environment.  expectations too high, employees have to take on too many clients at one time"
good,Being an account manager allowed for flexibility and much time working at out own pace and on our own assignments.  Co-workers at ADP are very willing to be helpful to others.  A typical day at ADP consists of me receiving emails and calls from clients where they have issues that they need me to troubleshoot.  Often I have to try to research the issue or work though the issue.  It was enjoyable being able to develop relationships with the clients that I am an account manager for.
good,"Work hard play hard kind of culture, you have to be able to multi task and deal with stress and deadlines very well to make it in the company, projects are different one from the other and no day will be the same to the next."
good,"Moderate"
good,"If you are not at the corporate office or at one of the One ADP centers, job progression can be challenging. However, work/life balance is generally good."
good,Fantastic company with passionate people in all the right places. Hard work and a lot of hours but totally worth it to see clients happy. This platform gives businesses the ability to focus on their company and not benefits/payroll/HR admin.
good,"Log into phone, answering calls take priority over employers or their employees who submit e-mails.  Set up LOA cases, review for state leave laws. Speaking to employers and their employees regarding new leave laws and we have not been informed ourselves on how to process the leaves"
good,"Although the management can vary, ADP was a good place to work with a decent beer pay, the clash between school and work schedules is what kept me from staying."
good,I liked working there it was fast paced and kept me busy. Management was awesome always trying to keep the team happy like having a ice cream social..
good,Great opportunity to break into the human capital management industry especially out of college. You can develop your skills and work from the bottom up.
good,"Typical day consists of being on the phone all day assisting clients with processing their payroll."
good,"This is an awesome culture where your superiors want you to succeed.  Like any other large company, you have to do grunt work at times first to get where you want to go.  This company and its managers recognize hard work and employees are often rewarded for their hard work."
good,"ADP is a good company overall. ADP US is a greater place where all important decisions are made and technical people are valued."
good,Must to WORK place atleast once in life. Learning has no bounds. As with every organisation one must not have too much expectation and live in reality.
good,"ADP is a great company to work for teaches you a lot and helps you grow. I wish they showed more care for their employees, especially with all the stress we take on daily. overall I recommend ADP for good pay and a good company to have on your resume."
good,"very nice coworkers, very team oriented can learn a lot if you are receptive and everyone is pretty much very helpful if you are in need of assistance."
good,Handling different kind of Clients with different set of rules in payroll. Learned lot in payroll and IT. Excellent team leader and team members. A huge support from members in workplace
good,ADP is a good place to work for fresher's (women) and only concern is the pay. The pay scale and performance hike are very low and cant even imagine how much low it is for fresher's.
good,"Personally working under my supervisor made this job difficult. She was very bad at communicating. However, the rest of the staff was amazing. And the benefits were great."
good,ADP paid well and for many years their management ensured a continual increase in their stock value which provided great financial incentives.   Bad decisions in the 90's however ended that pattern.
good,Great Company but very low in pay.  Hard to make the money they promise you. Management is fair and the job provides balance to your social life.  The only negative thing is the Salary and Commission plan.
good,"A good place to work if you're looking for a stable, well structured, not too challenging, secure job."
good,ADP has one of the top outside sales training programs in the nation. Their approach is very standard. Cold calling on Monday to set up appointments. 5 new appointments should net you one new deal every week.
good,"ADP is one one best company and good employee friendly company."
good,"Enjoyed working with HR managers and helping with their Benefit Administration."
good,I cannot speak for ADP as a whole. In my experience at ADP SaSS the benefits and people were great. The constant reorganization within the company was stressful and the fact that we were understaffed and not funded to hire for the staff needed lead to constant overtime and poor job satisfaction.
good,"ADP served as a great foundation to hone my challenger and consultative skills. Being one of the original in the industry, the old-guard mentality still exists heavily. My suggestion to management is to give people more opportunity to grow within the organization. Identify key players and move them through the ranks. We also need to shift focus to put clients first. Since ADP is a service provider, that should be key in what we deliver to clients day in and day out."
good,vooruitstrevend bedrijf op gebied van salarisverwerking. Bezig met nieuwe systemen en ontwikkelingen. Door de HR verwerking te doen voor verschillende grote bedrijven veel geleerd over HR verwerking en interne processen van die bedrijven
good,"Meet & Greet advisors/managers on the floor"
good,"We can learn taxation. So it helps our career growth."
good,"Onboarding clients with building client relationships."
good,"Challenging, fast paced, ever changing work environment; multi faceted.  Opportunities for growth; lots of change management with a goal towards better balance between associate and client ratios"
good,"mes missions au sein d'ADP sont passionnantes et l'environnement de travail est propice au développement et à l'épanouissement."
good,"Competence to manage multiple priorities. "
good,"Great benefit, good salary, and tuition reimbursement. A lot of overtime work is required. Also, management will depend on what department you're in."
good,"Extensive interaction with CLevel decision makers. Multi-Team sales environment with SME positioned offerings. Multi-Layered management environment, co-workers not readily accessible. Quality product and service team.  Incredible benefits and opportunity for high earnings."
good,"Good company. Few new managers are coming from Amazon, Microsoft and spoiling the ADP culture. All talented employees are leaving this company."
good,A typical day is intense. Lots of research and follow up. Communication is key and essential for client loyalty. The most enjoyable summer fun events
good,In ADP I have got so much knowledge about different type of tasks and also I got to know how to manage my work life and personal life. Management in ADP are very co operative. As ADP is my only company that I have worked I got good co workers who are very supportive and encouraging. The hardest part of my job is we cannot predict the work flow at any time however it will give me pleasure working in such environment with healthy competition.
good,"With respect to the company, I will happily offer any detailed insight, regarding my work experience and the culture at ADP upon request."
good,"Its a team effort, we all work really well together. I have learned to keep in compliance with the payroll tax laws. I was able to complete FPC & CPP in which ADP encourages higher education"
good,"Great Place to Start Career & plan for retirement."
good,Good office environment when I first started.  Completely numbers/stat based promotion.  But immediate management very supportive and helpful but needs get lost in translation going up the ladder.
good,"Relaxed culture with very less pressure."
good,Overall it's a nice place to work. But career growth / advancement opportunities are very limited. Good Management at the top.
good,"The work culture at ADP is very good."
good,"Intense office atmosphere within COS Interface Management.  The  management team is involved in too many meetings to realistically understand and comprehend much less respond to the needs of their employees or issues that arise with the applications that are utilized.  For a major worldwide company, their training is substandard, which caused concern with adequate processing techniques and audit support. Manager turnover also introduces stress to the employees with different personalities and different agenda's always being faced."
good,"It was overall a decent experience working in ADP, with nice team members and a good lead who helped me grow indivually and made me learn new things like personality development etc."
good,"Great place to work. I worked there for a lot of years.  The IT department is being relocated to a new office in Pasadena, CA."
good,"ADP is driven by engaging its employee's unique talents and perspectives, welcoming ideas on how to do things differently and better. ADP powers organizations with insightful solutions that drive business success. ADP is big on the ""Team Environment' atmosphere which has always motivated me because as a people person I enjoy working alongside experts who are open to share information and ideas, eager to participate in discussions, all  attributes I believe, make for a cohesive team environment."
good,"Route driver bringing material to people who were always glad to see me. Driving many miles everyday was fun for me, I enjoyed being there."
good,"Great place to work and to learn, people here work as team, co-operative supervisors and BU's"
good,Developed professionally and personally. Helped to manage multiple things. Understood Business from Clients Perspective.
good,Supported various SLT members as well as more that 30 sales reps in multiple capacities. Responsible for several critical sales related reports. Managed hired temps as needed.
good,"ADP is a solid sales company with a track record of producing good sales people.  Unfotunately, there is a revolving door of employees.  If you take the job, plan on working very hard and making decent pay.  The benefits are only so-so.  If you can survive, which is largely dependent on your territory, then ADP is a company where you can grow and establish a career.  It is, however, unforgiving if you don't hit quota for any particular reason."
good,I was work in this sector for past one&half years its good place to work and its very secured place for employee to work and we can easily learn vast things in microsoft  excel and we can easily develop our knowledge
good,Great Experinence but limited advancement. I learned a great deal of information of the HR industry and client relations.
good,Company is client focus and bottom dollars focus. Not so much work /live balance anymore.
good,"Long hours were expected. Little support for employees in any management/employee issue."
good,"Was a good place to work and I enjoyed the people I worked with.  They are the top of the payroll industry and continue to improve their products.  Poor management in my division however, and they were more interested in protecting their own jobs and did not take responsibility for their mistakes."
good,"Decent company, simple and sufficent starter/ part time jobs for someone in college."
good,"A very fast paced sales environment, that rewards its employees with high compensation."
good,"I have worked at ADP for 15 years and have seen a dramatic change in the company. It went from a company who highly valued its employees to a company who seems to view employees as chattle. It was once a company built on good relationships - managment to associate, peer to peer, most importantly employee to client - however, it functions as a beauracracy. Relationships no longer seem to have any value."
good,"A typical day at work is working with my associates and internal partners on client request, escalations, maangement planning, strategizing, client and internal meetings.  The hardest part of my job is not having enough hours in a day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people and learning new things."
good,ADP is good place to work however looking for best options to explore.
good,"Learnt some managerial skills. Currently working on QA."
good,A typical day at work was sitting at a desk for 8 hours completing assigned duties.
good,"A good day at work and you will earn alot of money. you often learn something new every day and the managment staff are great. Also the co workers are great fun and get on with everyone. The hardest part of the job is staying motavated but with great team managers its not a problem. The most enjoyable part is actualy walking the streets, On a daily basis you see some strange things happening and also talk to some lovely people wich can also motivate you."
good,"It is a good, strong company that allows its employees to learn many areas of the BPO industry. The hours are set and the technology is very strong. The biggest drawback is the amount of people in middle management who are in constant power struggles, which causes a reactive environment instead of a proactive one. Also, the archaic salary and advancement rules make it tough for the true hard and smart employees to get promoted and advance their careers within the company."
good,"Great company to start off a sales career. Aggressive outside B2B sales, great management, and good compensation if you are on quota."
good,I liked working with clients on the phone. I learned alot at ADP. Fellow employees were great to work with
good,"Great place to work and grow as a sales person if you are self-motivated. Training could be better and there are not enough opportunities for advancement. Overall, provided some great experience for me."
good,"It's a good company to work for under the right leadership.  Work life balance, advancement, etc will be dependent upon who is in leadership.  Definitely am not opposed to the company, but understanding how they operate I would be a lot more selective on the Business Unit I would work in."
good,"This is a great job. But it is not meant for everyone. They are looking for very specific people to do a job.  You are on the phones from the moment your shift starts until the very minute it ends. You have expectations that need to be met, they tell you that the customer experience is more important but at the end of the day you need to reach the call quota. Team leads tend to leave at the same time in the evening so there are about two hours of operation time that do not have support if needed."
good,"Not really an opportunity to grow position-ally, the managers were not the best and didn't inspire me to excel. The advancement was available in the position currently, not a different title."
good,"ADP started out as a really good company to work for, but they are the most fiscally dominating company I have ever worked for.  There is NO loyalty to their leadership or staff.  Simply put, they will pay you fairly and the work is reasonable.  However, as soon as Q4 starts, you can expect layoffs and re-organizations to decrease staff at all levels.  The executive management team will do whatever is necessary for them to get their bonuses."
good,"ADP had good work/life balance.  Many positions were virtual.  During the end of my tenure they were requiring people to work in the office.  I was a long term employee and watched the culture change from being employee centric to corporate centric.  "
good,"They have a great training program to cut your teeth with, but they aren't set up successfully to keep and maintain their employee's. Small business sales is a high pressure environment with low base salary and lots of pressure to make quota sometimes at the cost of your business clients."
good,ADP provides a lot of autonomy and the ability to work from anywhere in the world.  The flexibility and lower management are great.  Upper management has some room for improvement and the benefits are not up to par.
good,"Implementations specialist are overly tasked with all aspects of building out the payroll. There is no sense of verticalization, specialization or interdeparmental acountability."
good,It wasn't challenging enough for me as every day work was structured. I was used to challenging enviroment and this was not motivating me. Management was nice.
good,"Great company, hard working environment. Great employee moral, employees work to complete assignments and work to keep company in the green. Supervisors will push employees do their best."
good,"A typical day was to manage your client base inquiries relative to their business needs regarding their time and labor management requirements and needs.  "
good,"It was not without its challenges, but overall a good company to work for. They offer opportunity for advancement and relocation if necessary. Great health and retirement benefits."
good,Not applicable..rather not tell anything about my company other than good place to work. Work life balance is good and so are the benefits. I would say apply.
good,ADP offers great benefits to their employees and opportunities for career mobility.  The leadership team is very accessible and jobs are posted internally for employee advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working at ADP India very much. The employees were very receptive to training and did their best to work as efficiently as possible. "
good,"There are some good things about this company, however the constant staff reductions over the past few years, along with some of the upper management's decisions of the company direction have many people fearful of their jobs.  Voices were expressed to direct managers and were heard.  Those get advanced to a certain level where they become dropped and nothing comes of it.  The teams that I have worked with have been with some amazing, tenured, helpful people.  The applications have so much potential, but certain upgrades do not happen in a timely fashion, whether for the sake of the client or the consultant, resulting in sometimes awkward conversations, or more work for the consultant.  Good pay.  Good benefits.  The option to work from home was great.  Teams worked well together in order to make tough deadlines."
good,"ADP is numbers driven, hit your number(s) - number of client calls, meetings, and quota and you will succeed. You are responsible for running your own business, but in a team setting. Management is in place to help you succeed. The ADM role is a grind, but can be rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed my many years at ADP. Unfortunately, most of the support roles have gone elsewhere and jobs that were plentiful in the 90's and 2000's are no longer."
good,Once you think you know.  It is time for a shake up but your team is what makes the job great.  Everyone wants you to win and be great.  If your unsure just ask people make time to educate you on different subject matters.
good,"ADP is a great place to work.  It is a call center so the calls come fast and frequently.  Several re-alignments have taken place and nothing really changes.  The people are wonderful, but the work load continues to increase-so do their guidelines for talking to the clients.  We are expected to know a lot of information and then expected to support all phases of what the client needs, including GL, Time and Attendance and HR."
good,"I did not work for ADP.  I only used the program to do the payroll for our company.  The representatives where very friendly, and for the most part knowledgeable."
good,"ADP does not provide adequate preparation to deal directly with external clients.  Unfortunately, upper management does not have your back when it comes to issues."
good,I would recommend ADP as a good place to work. They have a good path for advancement for agents. If you are an individual contributor it is a little more difficult. It may be better to start as and agent and advance to a higher role because you will have all of the coveted certifications. Overall great people.
good,Very Diverse Company. You are able to experience real work life balance while working in the company. A good company to start and grow your career. ADP offers many tools to assist with career development.
good,It's all of what you make of any job. I went here because this was a company for years that I was trying to get into because they train you on every aspect of your job. Again this is my experience everyone else will be different .
good,"Good co workers but boring office environment ."
good,"Responsible for the development of a territory in the Dallas area increasing business and revenue by  prospecting for new business, while developing key relationships with CPA’s, banks, clients, and  networking groups. Solicited, met, and sold ADP payroll and HR solutions to companies having 1-49  employees. "
good,Overall this is a pretty great company to work for in the beginning. They provide an excellent salary starting out. Seems like the new CEO is out to cut costs instead of putting the employee's interests first.
good,"Fun work"
good,I have learned lot of things about payroll which is helpful to my professional life.I have enjoy working with my colleagues as we support each other and helpful.
good,It is great working in ADP and the kind of environment is nice and very enjoyable.It is always a great learning experiance here and co -workers are very helpful.
good,"ADP is good company with opportunities"
good,"Work on Client Dashboards KPI reporting managed Payroll "
good,Good work experience working at ADP. Lot of culture value for Human and a great place to work. Co-workers are good and enjoy every minute of my day to day work. Good work environment.
good,Great position for those who are starting their career and/or looking to grow within a company with alot of growth opportunity currently in the Dartmouth office.
good,A workplace where you can improve your skills on project presentation and fun place to work.
good,"Working with ADP was a good experience in daily routine everytime coming up with new task and objectives ....enjoyable part was while taking the interview when i got to know all new people as i love communicating with new people with different aspect and aims, there was no as such thing called as hard in the job because all good things comes with little effort and hard work is my believe."
good,"Excellent training, training pay, and benefits. My colleagues were terrific, but many managers seem to be selected on tenure not ability to manage people, so roll of the dice whether the team you're placed on has a strong manager or not. The sales style, at least in Major Accounts, is a very hard sale, get the client's signature and get out with no ability to follow through with them as a client because reps have to send the account to client services division once the software has been implemented. Another huge drawback is prospects have been called by sooo many ADP divisions that they are so sick of hearing from us, or they've met with ADP in the past, etc, so actually getting new and positive prospects is a challenge, esp w/all the payroll/hr competitors in the market."
good,I received calls from companies to decide weather or not employees qualify their company for a tax accreditation.I've learned how to key in 8850 form for employees. My managers were great and understandable about any situation. My coworkers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part about working their is getting people to understand why we need personal information about them. The enjoyable part is the teamwork atmosphere.
good,Nice and very competitive. Every work should have require proper procedure and you logged all thing and report right away. Have friendly employees and management.
good,"Lots of benefits, room for growth, great pay.  Job was very time consuming and provided poor work life balance.  Would recommend other departments though."
good,"You learn tons of transferable skills at ADP. The benefits and co-workers are great! However, there is no healthy work life balance.Be prepared for long days, but some work from home days depending on the dept you work in"
good,"They invest a lot of time and money into training new employees. Must be a self starter to do well in this role, and expect a lot of cold calling. Great starting point for a sales career. Looks good on a resume."
good,"Great people to work with - decent for salary and benefits - amazing sales training!"
good,"ADP was once an exceptional place to work and I had no intention on ever leaving.  However, the company started cutting corners with their employees.  Where I once felt valued as an employee, I quickly became disillusioned and felt that the company no longer valued my input and efforts.  I went from loving the company to hating it.  "
good,"not much work and also there are not much scope of learning. no on-sites as well.also there is not much interaction at employee level."
good,Successful company. Strong culture. Great benefits. Large workloads. Salaries should be higher. Hands-on Management. Great training. Many resources available.
good,Typical days at work are usually busy and fast paced. I learned many of the payroll specialist responsibilities and the concepts of the payroll process. The hardest part of the job to me was the navigation of the system in order to process the payrolls in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was working together with my team.
good,Continuously evolving HRIS platform that  is limited to the clients needs.  Opportunities to move to another role after 18 months of employment.  Management is there to support. You are the sole owner of your book of business.
good,"Great place to work if you like dealing with multiple customers."
good,ADP offers many opportunities to learn and grow with the company and allowed me many different opportunities to advance and learn.  I mostly enjoyed the people that I worked with at ADP.
good,ADP was great to work for until the started to outsource and send work over seas. The pay was good up to a point. the best thing about ADP  benefits 401k and fun environment
good,"Hours where great 6:30 am - 3pm. Worked with tax department with SUI program, FSDD Tracer process bank changes. Change SUI rate for Multi states for all clients. Purge and unpurge employees for all ADP Staff. process stop pay and reversal, etc."
good,"Amazing work culture. People are really helpful here and they give us the knowledge which we are unaware of. "
good,"cold calls/foot prospecting/in person targeted drops/meetings with  bankers, accountants, clients, and prospects/orchestrating initial setups with new clients"
good,"Overall solid company with over 80 years in the HR industry; promotes from within & always job opportunities open with ADP.  No matter where one lives worldwide, can always find a place with ADP.  Management is hit/miss---some ADP locations have better mgmt culture than others.  Always a turning door with ADP, employee turn over is >100% which is why ADP always hunts for new employees. Many divisions----Very competitive b/c of all the HR/Benefit/Payroll companies in the marketplace.  With sales positions, you're only as good as your most recent sales-month.  Can be very stressful., but can be very rewarding."
good,ADP is one of the best companies in the market today.  Excellent work life balance. The company has has good work culture. Having fun at the end of your day is the real fun.
good,"ADP has a lot of ways to branch out and advance within the company, but the fact that they relocate and downsize so often is not a great testament to their job security. If you are located in one of their main HQ's then this is probably a great job, if not, I'd look elsewhere."
good,"Training does not leave you prepared and there is a good amount of red tape and internal communications in order to get anything done. "
good,"Company is segmented. Every business unit is like its own little island and the left hand doesn't talk to the right most times. Takes a long time to get access to systems necessary to complete your job function. Employees aren't trained on all necessary systems and hand offs are frequent causing client problems to escalate and take long to be resolved. Benefits are great, work life balance is awesome especially when given opportunities to work from home. Advancement opportunities are there but it requires lots of networking outside your normal work group."
good,"They were a good company to work for 20 years. Work was relocated to India, so there were few jobs here in the US. The people were nice to with with & made you feel welcomed."
good,This company does not have good job security at all. The paid and benefits are decent its just that the management is terrible. They do not inform associates about lay offs in an ample amount of time. You can have worked there for 30 years and get a 2 weeks notice.
good,"work on latest technologies."
good,"My work consists around supporting clients with payroll issues and concerns. Assisting clients with everyday payroll processing, scheduling and necessary updates and changes. "
good,"Bij ADP Nederland werken leuke collega's, echt een team verband en staan open voor verandering en ontwikkeling."
good,"Good Place to work."
good,"Some of the greatest coworkers with extensive knowledge."
good,"friendly "
good,"I agee with all from Augusta, Ga. I think the company itself is great but, some people they put in management positions need to be looked at further. I was a temp 3x times and I felt like you are treated different. I really enjoyed my job and the other employees, but the Supervisor could have used a few classes on etiquette and continuing  education classes on how to be a Supervisor. I would go back to Adp but never again as a temp."
good,Its a nice place to work and the hours are very flexible but the security of a contractor is very low on keeping a contract or obtaining a permanent position
good,It's great place to work with everyday new challenges.
good,"ADP Pvt. Ltd. , pune , india is a growing company , the work culture is great and work life balance is also very good."
good,ADP is a good company to work for. There is a lot of room to grow here.
good,"Very high activity. Average week consisted of 75 face to face prospect visits, min 3 appts/week, clsoing min 2 deals month. Also a min of 100-300 cold calls/week. The hardest part was setting solid appts with the decision maker. The most enjoyable was the freedom to make my own schedule and closing the sale!"
good,"It is a good place to work if you do not mind the vast variation between individuals and teams."
good,"My manager was not the best, but I liked working for the company. I really wished my location had a fitness center, but there was always fun times along with work."
good,Take control of your career here to make the proper advances. Network get your face out there. The people are friendly. There is room to grow you just have to make it happen.
good,"They are constantly hiring.They do however, have some high turnover. The culture is a great experience. They do feed us a lot and take time to train thoroughly."
good,I am a very hard worker and devotes a lot of time and hours there. I have to adapt to changes periodically through the company.
good,A typical day is fast paced and energizing. Co-workers are great and willing to help
good,"•        Closed 8 payroll deals and received an average sales total of $1,500"
good,"The job layoff was very unexpected, however, ADP is a great company and I would recommend it as a great work place and would love to rejoin the company someday."
good,ADP overall is a good company to work although the work load is heavy there is certainly career growth   ADP do hire referrals first regardless of your qualifications
good,"ADP is an excellent company overall, too many chiefs, the managers are very demanding, stressful job environment.  It has diversity, I learned a lot program which I grateful for."
good,"A great place to work but the salary is not competitive."
good,"* the task's to complete with a time scale added to act as motivation ,with appropriate rest periods built in to help stimulate you for other task's,should an emergency arrive."
good,"This was a TOUGH job. It required that the only person I could deal with was the owner of a company and then I needed to show enough value in our product that the owner would then need to severe their relationship with all areas of HR outside of the company. They would need to end their insurance relationship, payroll relationship, compliance relationship, etc."
good,"Great program! Many changes over the years. I did not work there however. Last used in 2019, and I can say that it has become easier to use. Also, customer service is exceptional."
good,"I feel that ADP gave me a great opportunity to learn about how to assist small business owners with running their business.  I learned how to run my own team (per my manager's instructions), process payroll, learn about payroll taxes, etc."
good,A typical workday would be taking about 50 calls from clients to process their payroll.  The hardest part of the job is making sure every payroll is very accurate with no mistakes. I enjoy helping clients complete their payrolls and building relationships with those clients.
good,"ADP in Fort Washington, PA had no room for career advancement, then opened a new location in Norfolk, VA to be their main headquarters on the East coast, therefore, our location was laid off."
good,Typical day is calling or going door to door to prospect with small business owners to switch over to ADP payroll.
good,Everything is amazing. But nothing to learn new. No work. And if there is work everything is iterative. So future career growth is in risk. But the facilities and money and job security is win win
good,Great company to work for.  The best part is that you work from home and you have the flexibility.  The managers are really amazing.  they are there when you need them.
good,"ADP shows a great place to work."
good,"Working for ADP payroll can be very stressful and although the company is generous with time off (vacation, float time, etc.) it is hard to disconnect and manage a work life balance. Many people cannot handle the job"
good,"Era um trabalho muito dinâmico, onde tínhamos que entregar muita produtividade com qualidade num prazo curto para os fechamentos decendiais. Não tínhamos proximidade com a gerência e em virtude disso os colegas de trabalho ajudavam muito uns aos outros na resolução dos problemas quando ocorriam. A parte mais difícil era a jornada excessiva de trabalho onde por diversas vezes tínhamos que dobrar nosso turno de trabalho e a parte mais agradável é que diante as dificuldades os colegas se tornavam mais próximos uns dos outros."
good,At the beginning I loved the culture and who my manager/Vp was. The reason I left is that new management took over and made the work experience miserable.
good,Being my first job got to learn a lot professionally. Amazing Team Support and great work life balance. I worked in shifts as my JOB was that of an administrator role
good,This company is about who you know and how much junk you can talk about each other. Management is completely unprofessional and talk about other employees to employee. They would rather higher outside people than look out for their own. They love given you the run around and have no intention of higher ingredients temps.
good,"loved working here but i knew i wasn't able to actually move up in the company and i finally hit that wall and couldn't go up from there. a typical day would be you coming in sitting on the phone and dealing with the client all day which i loved doing. the main part i did not like about the job besides not being able to move up is the management, they were very rude and unprofessional and i hate that i am eve saying this but quite ghetto."
good,"I learnt a lot from working here and started my sales career here. If you are in with the right people, you will get extra deals and be treated differently."
good,Overall a good place to work :). Good people. great team environment
good,ADP is a great company to work for. There are many ways to advance from within. They truly appreciate and value there employees.
good,"While working at ADP I was averaging about 10-12 hours a day.  Upper management has no idea what their associates do on a daily basis.  This leads to them having unrealistic expectations about what they want you to do.  If you work here, good luck."
good,Good leadership when it comes to needing help or getting a specific job done. Questions about a job HR is there to help with anything. Need better air conditioning. Need longer breaks if needed.
good,"I Know what I know now from ADP and thankful for the experience. However, due to the long payroll deadlines, it was hard me to leave on time to care for my child."
good,"A place that you can steer can mean you can develop your career."
good,"Uma organização de alta performance, com solução de HCM, que inclui mais de 20 processos de RH, foca na produtividade e excelência."
good,Was cool but as time progresses and people change so has the culture and atmosphere of ADP. Can be stressful. Commute and traffic to the alpharetta office is the worst. Communication can be poor at times.
good,"Led client teams, vendors and associates at all levels to ensure successful multi-product and multi-vendor implementations.  Assessed needs and provided innovative solutions to enhance client experience. Promoted repeat business and solicited valuable referrals.  Scheduled and delegated ADP, client team appointments and meetings."
good,"Great company to work for, great opportunity for growth and advancement. The environment is very friendly and your superiors will motivate you to strive to do better"
good,"ADP is evolving in many ways, and it is hard to say what the new culture will be.  For many years, ADP has been preaching balance while the expectation to participate beyond your core job required night and weekend work consistently.  The performance model will eventually catch up with that expectation."
good,it's a 9-5 sit in a cubicle calling businesses on the phones all day everyday. the people you work with are awesome but the management and leadership are lacking. you're pretty much left on your own to fend for yourself for the most part.
good,"Worked with current client & referrals"
good,"very methodical management"
good,"Good place to learn about US payroll and to enhance your career in it. Finance is also a good domain to work in ADP. It also has lot of extra activities to be done like, participation in company day, family day, other games etc.."
good,"I go in about a quarter to 4 day shift pretty much have us set up so we wont be behind my co workers are very helpful you dont even have to ask for help they just volenteer  and the best part my job isnt really hard we just only have one break and im finally lose weight , ADP two thumbs up!"
good,It was a good job but was a temp and woring customer service for ope enrollment enrolling employee in their benifits
good,ADP is ok but no job security - ADP is seeking off shore employees and not doing a lot to promote from within
good,I enjoy doing my job. I enjoyed the people I work with. I was kind of hard to balance work and my personnel life due to all the over time required.
good,Offers many great career opportunities.  It has numerous locations both in NJ and worldwide.  There are many talented people from whom you can learn and grow by working with them.
good,"Working for ADP is both rewarding and frustrating. While there is an overall corporate culture, each office tends to have its own culture that is centered on the VP who runs the office."
good,"Challenges depend on the team you work on. Management is little slow in making changes for good. Focused more on the short term deliverables and not focusing heavily on long term benefits and processes to improve things."
good,ADP is a solid company to work for and provides employees with competitive pay and strong benefits. At the same time it is extremely corporate and bases everything off of metrics. Tough sales environment considering there are dozens of divisions w/in ADP (both inside sales and outside) calling on the same exact clients
good,"ADP was a great company and I would definitely recommend it for other that may be interested in working there. It is a stable company and as long as you do what you are supposed to and beyond that, you can move up in the company."
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar devido sua flexibilidade de horário de entrada e saída, e alguns eventos internos que acontecem, mas em questão de salário não é uma das melhores."
good,"Not a bad place to work. New opportunities available in the offices recently opened in Texas, Florida, Virginia. Mentor based training helps new associates learn."
good,"new leader expected more and care about cutting cost only and forgot it is a traditional industry and need to have a slow change."
good,"Typical day at work: Prospecting in the field, Cold Calling, Scheduling appointments, Presenting, Creating new business relationships"
good,The turnover rate is over 60%. The company caters to whoever has the highest quota. You constantly have to deal with other managers and sales reps that try to steal deals from under your nose.
good,Great co-workers.
good,This position keeps you very busy. If you love working with clients this  is a great position. You can learn a lot about payroll.  Management is very supportive.
good,"Great place to work out of college"
good,"As usual in IT, work days are 10+ hours or more per day, as usual. I have learned a lot from my co-workers and have grown, and evolved with the company over the years. I always worked hard, but also enjoyed my job and work environment until a few years ago. But, the technology used by the company has not kept up with the current trends, and because of that, the company is now looking to quickly catch up by hiring inexperienced, and young millennials instead of looking for potentials in current employees with domain knowledge. Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess, so some employees are now labelled as ""not fit for new directions"", and are being laid off. The company also established a new initiative to eliminate satellite offices, and bring people into centralized, newly created ""Innovation Centers"", which are often not reachable by, or at a very long commute for current employees. This is done to enable employees to ""better collaborate"", but it contradicts the fact that the company has locations in three time zones in the US, (plus a very heavy, growing presence in India), and much of the development work for a single product is spread across all locations - which makes close collaboration nearly impossible to start with. Workplace culture - in application development at least - has changed over the years to match the now majority Indian culture's mantra - ""you can't say NO"", be available 24 hours, 7 days a week, put your family aside, and be quiet about excessive, overtime work hours, and - never, ever raise concerns about your rights as an employee."
good,"I have been multiple country legislation to work on Payrolls."
good,"The massive quantity of work does not match with all the benefits and the salary, managers do not receive the correct training for leading people and work on succession plan, but in my point of view this is a particularity from brazilian branch."
good,"I worked here through a temp agency and it was a nice, laid back job. I don't have much to go on to really complete this review."
good,ADP tax credits offers great and very detail training to prepare you for a job and career with the company. ADP has a hard working environment and expect a lot from their associates.
good,"Provided HR services to various clients.  Training, Employee relations, Benefits etc."
good,Answering calls .  I learned how to work with difficult clients and had to know my job well to assist those calling.  Co-workers shared difficult calls which helped when getting the same knids of calls.
good,Overall a great company.  There are somethings that have changed throughout the years there that maybe could have been handled different but people will always have favorites in a business setting. Thats what ruins things though because those people dont necessarily deserve anything.
good,"A typical captive company."
good,Very high volume sales role with many products.  Essentially an independent contractor with the ability to advance.  Rapid change of roles and adaptation required.
good,"typical day at work, you are interrupted a 100 times, that is Skype, your desk, your coworkers, India, SWARM and Management.  It is a steady stressful day and I have worked until midnight.  ADP treated me fairly and I am proud to say I worked there, it is just the hours are a lot."
good,I enjoyed working for ADP and they had great benefits. Their work life balance could improve and training updated. I enjoyed the people I worked with the most and being able to work from home. The culture in the office was always on edge because there is so many lay offs.
good,"There I learnt a lot of things, from pond management in addition to the previous knowledge. There also I learnt how to breed cat fish. "
good,"There are some great people here.  They want to make this place work more than most, but the way the company is currently set, they cannot.  The front line employee, the one on the phone, is the one to catch blame from the client but have to continue to work in such a way to keep their jobs.  It is not the best situation."
good,"People are great to work with, however, management is a bit confusing.  Culture is typical corporate culture; my department was a bit different than typical ADP.  I had many opportunities to do my own thing, travel, etc."
good,You are able to work with some great people but on the down side their is not job security. They have had lots of layoffs over the last few years and a lot of great talent has left.
good,Keeps You Busy.. I Would Come Every Morning Get My Torch. I Would Then Get Gloves And I Would Have A Special Pair Of Glass Made Just For The Fire. I Would Then Take Brazier To Torch Copper.
good,"My recommendation is to believe the negative reviews, because unfortunately I did not. If you aren't ambitious, this is perfect position to get ""stuck"" in if you don't realize it soon."
good,"I was hired here through Kelly Services, there were no direct hires with ADP when I entered.  It was a good learning experience overall. Learned how the other departments worked."
good,Lugar onde pode se trabalhar com liberdade e respaldo.
good,"Great environment to work in, although large stress with payroll account manager model. Lack of transparency and direction from upper management. Great place to get knowledge of payroll and hr workings. Hardest part of the job is whenever you get an angry client due to system malfunction, most enjoyable part is the satisfaction due to solving an issue for a client."
good,"The training ADP provides its associates is worth its weight in gold. Very good, smart people. A career at ADP will give you the foundation to either stay and grow with ADP, or add tremendous value to your next employer. Recommend."
good,"ADP values an engaged and dedicated workforce.  It has an unmatched history of success as the result of intense pressure to squeeze every bit of productivity from its associates.  The culture lends itself to a family atmosphere - you truly enjoy the company of your co-workers; but over time, increases get smaller and the demands grow larger."
good,See Summary as it is self explanatory; Please see Review Summary as it is self explanatory as to what working at ADP is from a global perspective. Thank you.
good,Fun atmosphere but very hard charging sales environment.  Had several changes in management during my short time there.  Little support from management.
good,Alot of the other employees did not like it. I likes they pay. I worked there 2 years in a row for their peak season. I would come back next year. But they did not hire any of the temps on full time from the previous year.
good,In this role you are in an environment that is changing to meet client deadlines and being able to prioritize you work is key. Leading weekly status calls with clients and following up on project development to ensure all departments are on schedule.
good,"clock in at 8 and leave at 5"
good,"Like a govt job. Less work and less salary expectations."
good,Gross lack of recognition for the remote employees in the company. Remote employees do not get promoted or recognized as management biased towards those in office even with numbers stating otherwise.
good,"good place to work, employee's make the most of work and envirement, great benefits and friendly enviroment.  employee's are willing to assist eaceh other and help  out, however manegement leave's alot to desire as you have to be self reliant a lot"
good,"A payroll processing company with products for client companies and their employees to access through the employee service portal.The portal allows employees to declare their investments for tax declaration, claims and flexi benefit plans from their company."
good,"ADP is a good company to work for although not much opportunity for advancement, able to have a good work/life balance salary is lower than many other similar companies"
good,"Good company, not very much room for advancement. A lot of micro managing within the company. Good benefits ............."
good,as my first experience it is very good to work in this famous and good  service provider company make employer ready to work in any circumstances and teach you customer satisfaction.
good,"A typical day at ADP consisted in monitoring the Client Service   representatives adherence and making adjustments in accordance with incoming call volume in order to maintain our Service Level requirements. Also, working with the rest of the Workforce Management Team, we produced reports for management and responded to e-Mails from the Client Service representatives and Team managers."
good,"ADP is like many fortune 500 companies, there is lots of red tape and they do a great job of getting in their own way. "
good,I enjoyed working here. It was just a drive for me. Everything else was great.
good,"•	Order Entry with commission"
good,"- A day will all work"
good,I started working at ADP not long after graduating from college. I have worked here for 6 years now. ADP has taught me a great deal about the possitives and negatives of working for a big business in a small town. I have grown alot professionally from all the special projects and the face pace structure my job thrives in.
good,ADP proved to be a great first job out of college although difficult to advance in the company.
good,ADP smothers you with work and checklists that demand everything be completed each and every day. The stress level in payroll impacts your health and personal life because you are asked to perform a lot of overtime and work on weekends.
good,Its always great to work with an multinational company which makes you mature for professional life.
good,"This was my first internship, it was ok people are friendly and nice."
good,This company was a fun and friendly place to work. I was very happy to go to work. I learn very fast. My associates were very friendly and happy to help me.
good,"Productive work environment"
good,Work environment is very diverse. get the chance to gain a lot of knowledge and network with different functions of the job... It is a great place to be
good,"It was a relatively new position so I was able to help create some of the structure. I worked closely with the HR Business Partners to meet existing clients and provide insight on how they were performing as an organization based on defined HCM internal metrics along with real time, locally relevant benchmark data."
good,Everyone’s experience is different as it pertains to the payroll department  but ADP as a company is amazing. There’s a lot of room for growth and opportunity but the payroll department is VERY challenging.
good,Great company to work for. Very young and  diverse. Pay is  decent for the area.  Excellent  benefits. Initial  training is  great. Achieving  goals is up to you.
good,"Good org."
good,Social and financially ideal place to work. Community and social development specializing in family and workers welfare. Was able to put in use my creativity in implementation of policies and procedures within the accounting and financing department.
good,The people (culture) and type of work for the past 7 months has been a great experience. Although it is not one of the best places I've ever worked (there is a lot of room for improvement regarding the on boarding process and you are on your own in finding resources) I think it is one of the best places to work if you have entrepreneurial qualities.
good,ADP Philippines Inc. is a good place to work. The company provides good benefits to their employees. ADP Philippines lets its employees get involved in some of the decision making in the company.
good,"1. ADP was a fun place to work."
good,Significant opportunity to learn and grow.  Very dynamic set of products to learn.  Flexible working arrangement is helpful.  People at ADP are dedicated to doing a good job.
good,"They do a lot for the community,  They even allow  their employees 8 hours of paid time off  to participate in community service of their preference.."
good,"Ton of great people here, but the management here needs to be reassessed. Management having intimate relationships with employees probably isn't the best idea. smh"
good,The people were nice to work with.  I feel that the training they gave me did not keep up with added responsibilities.  They were always moving work offshore.
good,"ADP was a company in transition: from one VP/Department lead that was totally founded in real estate to someone who thought he knew everything, but knew very little; to a VP who had a background in accounting with very little real estate experience.  Interesting and ever changing environment in which to work."
good,They are good employers they just have they own picks and most of them are friends and relatives and the only break they have only last for 20 mins and we have to be in the building less than 20 minutes.
good,Company is always changing which can be challenging at times.  Plenty of training offered.  I earned my project management certificate at ADP.  The work life balance is good
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits, lots of job opportunities and career progression , nice colleagues, good rates of pay, lots of training available"
good,It’s a good job for anyone start out of high school you trying find them job that will hire ASAP with no problem ADP is a good job and help u in life with job skills
good,I enjoyed my assignment with this company and felt that it provided me a great opportunity in utilizing my skills to the best of my abilities. I also enjoyed the team that made the day to day tasks easier with having such a helpful team to work with as well as the management staff.
good,"My experience with ADP was amazing. Their atmosphere was one of ""work hard and play hard!"" The expectation of your peers and leadership is excellence."
good,Had great work culture. Good work life balance. Work culture is slowly changing but good opportunities for the ones who deserve. But difficult to compete with market changes.
good,"It wasn't  the job for me but it is a great company to work for. M-F some weekends depending on where you work. Pay is pretty good, my manager was OK, only the pay increases are not very big, but you get them often."
good,ADP is a great place to work if you are dedicated and have no problem working overtime. The opportunities and career advancement that they provide is great but you have to work hard for it.
good,"ótimo ambiente de trabalho, empresa flexivel e inovadora."
good,I really enjoy working at ADP as all member of the COS Payroll Teams are open and willing to help other's excel.  ADP offers many training sessions to employees to improve or obtain new skills.
good,"I was very much happy working with ADP Pvt Ltd. "
good,"A very good organization to work ,however a little flexibility in the transition of role or technology would be really helpful for the employee growth"
good,"Work it self and the tasks we do is complex. You need to be very open for learning in order to get around your role. Few of the things that we need to be familiar with is statutory and voluntary deductions, tax compilance by state, bank impound and transactions, accounting, general ledger, and many more. Its great that leaders and managers are very accomodating and understanding."
good,Work life balance is good. Managers and leaders are understanding and easy to work with. Company policy gives employee work from home access after 6 months with the company.
good,"Good place to work . So much internal politics ."
good,"The downside of ADP is, they don't hire externally, most people are promoted from within. Most people usually have to start as a contractor then go as a full time employee."
good,"This is a really fast paced call center.  They did not tolerate being late or sick call outs.  They did not like you being off the phone, even bathroom breaks."
good,I worked at ADP for 1.5 years. They offered a great training program and great support. I would say that pay could increase and hours should be more flexible.
good,Worked with some top notch people and did innovative interesting work. Company culture leaves room for improvement. You never have to worry about your paycheck clearing since that is their business.
good,ADP provides state of the art technology and resources for success. If you are interested in making a great career in sales then ADP is the place to go.
good,"Overall my experience was beneficial at this company. The day was spent closing cases, consistent communication with medical carriers, employees, and administrators. There was also consistent internal communication between different departments. The business culture and the way the company takes care of its employees is what attracted me the most. The team I was a part of supported each other heavily and was like a family. The most enjoyable part was the support that I got from my coworkers on my team, it was a consistent team effort and they taught me a lot that I could apply in and outside of the workplace."
good,"Working for ADP requires outstanding Customer Service. Management & co-workers all work as one to complete all tasks assigned."
good,This is a great place to work if you dont have a social life or family. You work from sun up til sun down. There is no down time nor no work life balance.
good,"Fantastic training program and a great place to start your sales career, however Not much room for growth. Strict schedule, limited PTO, no flex schedule."
good,"As a safety consultant, I was responsible for 300+ clients, covering Kansas, Missouri, and part of Illinois.  I travel 3 days a week and sometimes 4-5 days over night stays.  I deal with a vast number of industries-construction, general industries, medical and clerical.  Each client receives a safety assessment walk thru, a safety manual and training per OSHA applicable hazard exposure."
good,"Good work culture and free cab facility best in class HR services"
good,Good place to learn how to sell learn the basics of working for  a corporation. Need to be self sufficient because not a lot of help is provided for new hires.
good,This was a great opportunity to work on a contract basis to assist in onboarding benefits for some of their national accounts.  They offered comprehensive training prior to rollout.
good,Steady company to work for.  Pretty consistent.  There were plenty of meetings but your typical corp atmosphere existed.  They did give oppuntities for advancement but was laid off.
good,I was working as a Contractor for Ascent/other employment agency and was assigned to ADP for 7 years (few months break now and then).  It is a great company to work for.  Primary functions are general accounting and financial analysis related.
good,"You get what you expect."
good,"great,"
good,The company is moving in a positive direction and have several internal initiatives that will bolster the company for the future and make it a contender for years to come.
good,"Working at ADP is frustrating with a lack of resources and management direction. The pay is good, but work life balance is difficult to achieve. The benefits could also be better."
good,Very difficult to advance at ADP RPO. Entry level employees are two levels down from management. Management is overworked and cannot efficiently manage the overly large teams they oversee.
good,"Good starting job in sales, once you make it clear you want something more complex, they take away opportunity and give it to those that drink the kool aid"
good,"This large organization has offices in all major areas and allows remote opportunities which was a huge plus.  You have to really develop your own career path, but it is a good long term company."
good,"A sales company with high sales expectations, but with low salaries.Very low sales training at all which is a flaw considering the specific service that is sold in this company (payroll)."
good,"It was a good company to work for for many years.  "
good,"Great place to work nice people, what I liked most was they worked with me on my schedule. The system is very easy to learn, I can say that I learned a lot."
good,"Company offers opportunities to learn how to recruit with enough structure to keep you progressing and enough flexibility to help you build your own brand, focus, and career path.  Well laid out progression plans, encouraging/experienced managers, and diverse coworkers with regular opportunities to collaborate."
good,"Learned a lot when at ADP, developed some solids relationships. Make sure you make a move before being there too long, your income will not grow as fast unless you make the leap"
good,"The benefits are great.ADP offers stock at 5% lower through pay  deductions, ADP will match up to 6% toward 401k. Gives 3 weeks vacation after 3 years + 5 float days + 5 sick days. Very few companies give so much time off."
good,I worked as a temp starting the the benefits department where I worked long hours for the annual open enrollment. When that ended they moved me to 8-5 for payroll until my assignment ended.
good,"Boa empresa para Trabalhar, porém o Salário está a baixo do Mercado"
good,ADP is a huge organization with lots of opportunities if you are willing to work for them. The entity encourages individuals to drive their own careers.
good,Adp was a good work place I guess because I’m a lift driver. Having to deal with others that don’t wanna work made the job hard. The break is 15 mins for a 12 hour shift I didn’t like that at all. The money is slim and they sell us employees dreams of raising the wages but never happen
good,A typical 8 hour shift does not feel like 8 hours because we are always doing something for our clients. There is not a day that goes wasted our client want everything to be done asap.
good,"I enjoyed my time at ADP very much. Our team worked closely with each other and could at times feel like a family. We often shared information freely. "
good,Great comradery and management always willing to listen to you and take advantage of your existing skills. There were several venues for advancement provided you'd show interest.
good,This is a great stepping stone for you to break in medical sales. Medical device companies love Recruting reps from ADP because of the skills that you learned in the work ethic with B 2 B cells
good,"The Management at ADP was as good as it gets, however, the overall job security is extremely low. ADP basically will work Temps as Full time Employees with no plan of actually hiring them. This keeps that company from having to  provide benefits and job security. Warning, ADP hires full time permanent employees little to none at all. FYI"
good,its to hot n there I learn how to do everthing about adp the management was ok but thwe work culture its just to hot but the nothing is hrd about the job the most fun part about the job is break
good,ADP is a very fact-paced workplace.  There are opportunities for success in a rapidly changing environment taking advantage of the latest advancements in technology and business trends.
good,My day at ADP included coming to work and talking on the phone all day with hardly no interaction with the people around me. I enjoy the training that I received on the job. It was very helpful o do my job.
good,"Improved my Skills, Its good place to work and ADP gives importance to employee and provide many benefits to employees."
good,"ADP is a large corporation.  They have many tools and resources available to employees.  The issue, however, is that they are inconsistent at times.  "
good,"I worked there many years ago for a short time, so I don't want to give them a review. I do remember that the ADP has lots of stock options and benefits."
good,"They should have provided more home shore opportunities for all the small offices you closed down. You lost a lot of tenured, good people who loved their jobs."
good,ADP was a strange place to work. There is a mixture of old hat and new hat management that seems to at times be at odds with one another. The older management doesn't really seem to get how the world works now and how to actually do business in the modern world. Expect it to impair your work in some way.
good,"The salary and product are good... if you consider yourself a sales person, it's a good place to be. "
good,Pros
good,Buckle up. ADP is a great work culture environment but the culture constantly changes. From leadership to positions moving to other parts of the world which lead to large layoffs and turnover constantly.
good,"Sales by phone, metric driven, cold impersonal interactions masquerading as modern, progressive, and structured chaos.  Wide range of success, definition and achievement based on perception.  A lot of guesswork on a daily basis."
good,"was very good place to work,"
good,"It has a gym and a clinic so that it is easier to access for regular exercise and health care."
good,"management team was not motivating and affected the culture."
good,I got to learn a lot and see a lot of what goes on behind the scenes.  it was quite interesting.  I would have loved to stay and learned and done more. it was nice to have the variety of things included in the position.
good,Great culture. Manage own time and schedule. Work closely with businesses in the area as well as CPA/ accounting firms and banks. Great entry level position
good,"Not the worst place to work. Extremely boring, from the people to the job itself. Work there if you are unable to do better. Not much room to grow, you would have to literally work there for 10+ years to see a managerial position."
good,My days at ADP are new and exciting.  I am able to work with a great team that is always there to help when needed.  The positions that are available for advancement are not where I want to go.
good,Great co-workers. 
good,Ran payrolls for clients. Researched client's payroll to ensure that there are no errors. Instructed payroll accountants on how to use ADP products PC for Payroll.
good,adp was a good place to work.  I loved the people I worked with.  There was a lot of young and career oriented people who I got a long with.  They had a lot of standards in process and clearly defined objectives to follow and decent training
good,Environnement dynamique et stimulant grande societe et personnel interessant
good,"You will never get bored, constantly learning about Payroll, new laws and regulations, and troubleshooting issues for clients."
good,I had a pretty good job at ADP. I wish I would have stayed there. I left for the opportunity to make more money. The hours were great. My main negative was that the building moved to a location that was far away from my house.
good,"If corporate America is your thing, ADP will work for you. Huge company that pays well but expects a LOT in return. Career advancement opportunities exist if you're willing to jump through the hoops but when the pendulum swings the other direction they won't hesitate to lay anyone off regardless of their commitment to the company."

good,"Management changed a lot recently and personally made me resent my job a little. Very ""American"" now in type of culture, only focussed on results and forecasting. It has lost its humain touch lately. Otherwise its a good first job (inside sales) make you learn the ropes and how the sales world works. Its great when you have good numbers, you get treated very well then. Opportunity for growth is not given to all, a little unfair but personally I had a good experience with it.  Wether you like working there or not will depend on your team and on your manager."
good,Great company but very poor support and customer service. I Learned a tremendous amount in regards to selling and closing new business. A lot of  turnover in the management team.
good,It was fine working there. I worked temporarily under a contract so the money could have been better but I chose to work through a contract because I needed a job. I enjoyed working with the people and the atmosphere was good.

We were on a rolling call basis; as soon as disconnected from one call another rolled into your que. If additional time was needed to make notes, we had to be sure to hit ""work"" to get it accomplished.  Our calls were timed to an expected 7 minutes.

good,The staff at ADP genuinely cares about their clients. The management is there to help you in anyway they can.
good,Being well organized every day makes the days go better. A willingness to adapt to change is a must. The workload is heavy at all times but specifically during annual enrollment from Sept to March. Management varies by manager and by location. Decisions have a generally financial basis so competition is fierce. The most enjoyable part of the job are the associates on the front lines. They are great to work with.

Must have the ability to multi-task. Field sales plus in office days. I work from a home based office so self-managment and discipline is key. I also  have a team based out of Charlotte. "
good,"Through my years with ADP I've gained experience through the Payroll/Client Service positions. Some include Attention to detail, Accuracy and Organization, Reliability, over all being a team player."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to wear my regular dress up attire.

good,"Each day is different when working with clients. You enter the building with your mind prepared to support your tax specialists with client issues and work on projects with your co-workers. I learned a lot about Federal, State and Local payroll taxes increasing my knowledge and skill level working with all Tax Agencies. Management has downsized staffing in the USA and moved the positions to India to the point where the client is highly impacted. Plus adding to the unemployment numbers in the USA. Co-workers are very supportive of each other as everyone in management is working through the same issues; short staffing and long hours to ensure client issues and projects are completed timely and by their deadlines. Hardest part of the job is calling it a day due to the numerous projects handled by each manager, delegating was not an option due to keeping staff on the phones and calls holding to a minimum. Co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the day. Even with multiple meetings per day it was nice to see and lunch with them to maintain a tight networking relationship."

good,"Succesful company, great location, good people, new building, many friends."

good,A good place to work. Very encouraging and productive at this workplace. It was a great working experience. The management and work culture is very comfortable.
good,ADP was a wonderful company to start with after graduating and it gave plenty of opportunity for upward mobility. My first position was in the Service Center where you answer calls based on specific clients and there benefits plans.  My next job was training and supervising in the Service Center. That was difficult because you are now responsible for critiquing the same people you used to work with. The office culture was very loose and we have a lot of parities and employee activities especially during the busy season.  Moving to implementation was the next phase of my career.  Sitting and meeting with the client and capturing requirements was interesting based on the how the client was set up. Some clients were strict and others were very lenient with how they handled there co workers
good,"Busy and allot to do and the work was challenging."
good,"Good work life balance and great technologies"
good,Able to make a good living if you are willing to put up with the system. Career development is non existent. Management is inadequate and do not take bottom up input.
good,I worked there on and off for about four years.  It is a good company to work for. The pay isn't good enough and they work environment is harsh. It's hot in the plant. If you can take the heat then you will be okay.
good,I originally started for a six month assignment through a staffing agency and when I started the representative from ADP told me it was a two week assignment. I then was transferred back and forth to different departments where there was work available and it lead to me working at ADP for 14 months.
good,"ADP overall is a fantastic company to work for. However, the work/life balance needs to be improved and honestly, while you're in the office it feels like a majority of your work could be done from home. The company gives a ton of time off and a ton of incentives for their employees. If you don't love sales them I wouldn't apply. Great company, but if your not a salesperson then don't apply."
good,Great First Job Out of College but if you have experience might not be the way to go due to low compensation. My manager was great but due to changes it was harder for advancement.
good,"ADP is a fiscally responsibly solid company to work for. One of the few in the industry that provides a pension. It could be a little easier to move positions than they make it, but overall the company is supportive of employees, and try to promote a work/life balance."
good,overall good place to work. has changed over the years though. Management was better a few years ago. I wish the old management was not pushed out years ago

good,Leadership will make or break your success. Too much independence and lack of guidance for recent college grads. Not very interesting or intellectually stimulating work. Good earning potential.
good,the insurance sales division of ADP has a good work culture and atmosphere.  The sales executives are more than willing to aid an account executive when needed.  This culture and assistance from management helps to increase an Account Executives sales year after year.
good,"If you're fortunate enough to be a part of ADP you will receive many benefits, but be prepared for it to be a part of your very being. Training takes place across Europe (and in rare cases the US) to bring you up to speed on what the company does. This can be seen as a benefit as well as a hindrance, as it can encroach on your personal life and force you to adjust to make things work. Additionally, due to a majority of ADPs clients being based in the US and time being imperative, you may find yourself dealing with clients outside of work hours due to the time zone difference. Again, this can be frustrating when you have things going on in your personal life that you want to be getting on with."
good,ADP is a good company to work for. It is fast pace and you can learn a lot. . You can learn a lot to help elevate your career. ADP has many platforms that employees are able to learn from. Most enjoyable part of the day is learning new things and helping our clients.

They are combining this transformation with significant cost cutting across the board, which includes moving work to lower-cost locations and exiting higher paid associates from the workforce."
good,"Make no mistake, this is a sales driven company that happens to be in the HR business. Regardless of your assigned position, you will be expected to sell products and/or services."
good,ADP offers great benefits and training if you have the time to afford to take the training.  Our department also provided a system to for employers to file their 1095/1094c tax forms. This is extremely time consuming.

good,In security it was a full day of work dealing with security issues for our clients.  This factor was very important because in these cases we were dealing with fraudsters who were invading clients livelihoods - money.
good,"IT department is changing and not necessarily for the better.  People with experience (read as older and more expensive) are being pushed aside for others with less experience (read as younger and cheaper),"
good,"The past few years have seen lots of changes. People stayed at this company for years. ADP is now in the process of thinning the herd and bringing in newer people with fresher ideas and to relocate them  into other parts of the country (also, to pay them less). "
good,"ADP did not provide much room for advancement. I learned a great number of customer service skills that I plan on taking to future careers. However, overall it was a good experience."
good,"This is a large company with much legacy.  Management style and the technology are outdated. The company is indeed trying to catch up but perhaps it'snot enough. Some managers have been there too long and do very little work or innovate."
good,"Good place to work, and many opportunities for advancement. There is alot of work and sometimes you feel overwhelmed. Management is good at shifting priorities to make it a little bearable. Training needs some improvement."
good,"ADP is a very interesting, but pressuring place of employment. There's not much room for career advancement. ADP will give you the basic skills to help you future pursue a desired career."
good,"The best part of my job is interacting with all levels of the organization and using my skills, education, and creativity to solve business challenges. The workplace culture is very intense with significant workload. My direct manager was one of the best leaders I've ever worked with. He is very supportive and encouraging. I also work on multiple client and associate events and conferences. I love being part of the process from brainstorming themes, to designing the look and feel, being involved in crafting communications, creating materials and decor, and seeing the entire thing come together."
good,"Fast paced environment, opportunity to build your skill-set. Diverse cultures brings well-rounded working environment. Must have the ability to adapt to change and approach with a positive outlook. There are some long hours, but the people you work aside are great and support each other professionally and personally."
good,I'd rather not say - I was laid off one year after being employed.  First lay off and no job or career assistance.  I'd plan to retire with ADP so was very disappointed to get laid off.
good,"Working at ADP is good experience and learned lot of new technologies here. very good cooperation between developers, architect, manager and product owners."
good,"Great to learn from as a start in one's career, but be prepared to give everything you've got to be seen as a successful member of the team during busy seasons. The startup culture is awesome and we had a very collaborative team, which was well worth the experience. Still, it was challenging when the only days off were the mandatory holidays but nothing more."
good,"ADP started sourcing jobs out to Texas and the Philippains."
good,it was a temporary job so I don't remember much. made a lot of friends and the work while physically demanding was very good and steady. i enjoyed my time there wish i could of stayed longer
good,Good group of people to work with.  Diverse skill set and a chance to learn new things.  People are helpful and want to do the best for the clients. Overall good place to work.
good,ADP was an outstanding place to work right out of college. Highly recommend any college grad to take a look at ADP. After about a year and a half most people will be gone. Management favors some reps and gives them all of the opportunity.
good,Au poste de Technicien Paie beaucoup de contact en interne et en externe.
good,my job is relaxed and tough at the same time. i have a great manager and the culture is really comforting. team collaboration is a plus and the incentives for working here are top notch
good,"ADP  is a great company to work for, they balance quality of life with work. The culture is great and allows for growth and learning. As with any company there are great managers and so so managers.  Hardest part of the job was the learning curve for the position."
good,"Good, solid company. Work hard and play hard.  You will be rewarded with good consistent hard work and working hard to achieve career growth.  Seek out a good mentor"
good,Good salary and benefits.  Can be very stressful.  At times management is lacking.  A lot of office time required for an outside sales position.  At times seemed more of an inside sales culture.
good,"ADP is a good place to start your career, it's fast paced and you will learn a lot from others. People are willing to help you and show you how work is done."
good,"Great company to work for, challenging environment. Lots of competition, opportunity for advancement, lackluster training. You must be self-motivated otherwise you will fall behind rather quickly"
good,ADP is changing there structure and is letting experienced employee's go. It was good to work for them and they tried to do different events to keep morale due to volume of work for reps.
good,"It was fun"
good,I learned a lot about taxes for the US government. The challenging part is during quarter end and year end as I have to meet the deadlines so that our clients won’t get penalty and interest.
good,"A good place to work with Network Monitoring, Administration, Incident and Chnage management. I got a chance to improve my knowledge on Network ing and the protocols we use day by day for work."
good,"ADP has a focus on being employee centered but it isn't always like that. They do a lot of training in you first 60 days to make sure they start you off right but not a lot is done after to keep you on. During times of the year it is hard to sell deals because people aren't buying, deadlines, etc. If you go a month without a unit closed even though your pipeline may be full you are called out on emails, calls, and in meetings."
good,"ADP is a great first job out of college because the training is very beneficial to someone learning the ins and outs of sales. It is outside sales and they don't hold your hand they let you get out there and learn for yourself and figure out your best sales techniques. However they do help you with many different kinds of trainings, which I found to be very beneficial for me as a person and my career."
good,"The payroll and technology aspects of the job were always challenging because they changed almost every day.  Provided second level technical and payroll support to internal ADP associates.  Managed cross training with new hires and existing associates.  Subject matter expert on all projects concerning process improvement and database enhancements.  Led small Kaizen groups to gather information to scope projects."
good,ADP is  a great company to work for. Advancement opportunity is available with an unlimited potential. Multiple divisions to move around that gives you great posibilities
good,"It was much more fun when I started than when I left. By the time was laid off, the non-stop re-orgs and downsizes took a toll on the employees that were left. You never knew when it would be your turn to be laid off next."
good,"At ADP I have had the opportunity to work with great people and managers. The work is interesting and challenging. Can range from Analytical modeling, machine learning and infrastructure management operations. Recently I've worked on Docker, container and other opensource project."
good,ADP OneNorfolk is one of its kind. The first time the company has had all of their services under 1 building. It is a fun and exciting workplace that makes sure your innovative ideas are heard.
good,"Job is easy"
good,It is a good place to wok with a lot of tenured people.  The location I moved into was brand new and mostly new people.  It was stressful at times when you had a question finding an answer for it.
good,"Left IBM to work at ADP.  Was young in my career and job was stable for many years but then corporate decisions were made to downsize and eliminate division.  Financial Services Division was sold and we went through many layoffs before entire division was sold off.  Overall, I was a Technical Account Manager and enjoyed my position."
good,"There is no typical day at work for ADP,  you can learn many different technologies, if you are not too busy putting our fires.  Management is unfair to the QA organizations and do not consider them on the path for advancement. ADP does have a family atmosphere of workers in the trenches."
good,"This is a large, large company that swallowed up my small dot-com startup and like every other acquisition they've made, they chewed us up and spit us out, even though our customer satisfaction ratings were the highest they've ever achieved in this industry space."
good,"On a typical day you will work more than 8 hours, i learned that time management is crucial, networking is with management is necessary."
good,Good place to work.  Lots of employees stay for over thirty years.  Good benefits and there is opportunity for career change and/or advancement.  Team environment.
good,I was working for a client in USA . we were doing back hand operations. interacting with clients and working on E-mails from customers for effective service
good,"It is one of the best places to work however there are lack of opportunities for women associates to move to morning or afternoon due to family requirements. "
good,"ADP was a very busy, fast paced company. Speed and efficiency were expected. Co workers were friendly and encouraging. The days went fast because of the work and energy of the employees."
good,"High Stress but Great Above Average Pay."
good,What a welcoming company.  So full of energy.  The moment you arrive at your desk you were busy learning something new with either technology or payroll legislation.  Given the highest standard of training and tools to accomplish high quality survey scores.  I enjoyed working and learning with this company.  You need to dedicate much of your personal time to excel.  Management had an open door concept and was very approachable.
good,"Growing but hard to get promoted unless you are part of their cliques, etc. Also hard to get promoted when you are doing well, they like to keep people back to make numbers."
good,"The work life balance is good - over the past 4 years there's been less and less support from corporate but higher and higher expectations. The opportunity for career advancement is only given to those who hit the corporate requirements in their amount of time. Turnover is high, management sometimes treats you like you are replaceable because of that."
good,"This is a great company to work for. It is the industry leader in human capital management. It provides competitive benefit packages, career growth opportunities, and a positive work environment."
good,"The IT department was an excellent work environment with a fast-paced yet relaxed and productive environment."
good,"ADP has great work life balance, Internal training, but lacks the tools to do your job .things break to often, change to often or just fall off the radar.  Benefits great, pay is great."
good,Good place to work if you like startup like Environment.  Work like balance is okay.  Very demanding environment. Must be able to code irrespective of title.
good,I did enjoy working here but I felt there wasn't room for advancement for me and that after 5 years it was time for me to explore my options so i did.
good,"Uma empresa sempre vendo a modernização, porém isso traz uma pressão maior aos colaboradores, o dia de trabalho é intenso, tive um aprendizado muito bom em relação a sistema ADP, todavia, você acaba se afastando um pouco do conhecimento diário na área de departamento pessoal, pois tudo é efetuado pelo sistema, a gerência é relativa, devido as diversas alterações você acaba tendo uma certa gerência desqualificada, seus colegas, digo que muitos não tem comprometimento, embora no percentual esta mediano, tudo isso devido a pressão sofrida dia, a dia. O difícil, são as mudanças sem sentido, o agradável e conhecer pessoas divertidas."
good,"Good work culture, employee satisfaction is important, career planning for employee is good.  Management is good and focuses on employee relations. Great place to work."
good,Most days were your typical multitask 8-5 moments. Working here you have to be a whiz at keeping on top of your different assignments. The hardest part would probably be the monthly/quarterly/yearly end closings but it is the nature of the beast working for this company.
good,"I'm hardworking,  good listener and a team player."
good,Call center environment. Very easy place to work at.. Love the hours that I work needed the experience... Great experience
good,Meeting and interacting with associates. Having fun on fridays. Pursuing creative ideas within the team. Driving quality initiatives
good,I have good things to say about this company. I have been employed here for almost six years. Great benefits and compensation.
good,Good place to learn and grow. Lot of opportunity to grow. Good work life balance and management is good. Training is provided.
good,"It is a wonderful organization to work with diverse culture and background."
good,Senior Staff and across the management had favorites although as long as you were focused and goal oriented tenure was possible.
good,"Good company to work for. Great people, great pay, but lots of work. You can spend the bulk of your day putting out fires and you work at night to get your actual work done."
good,"Local e ambiente de trabalho bons."
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"•	Relational database management skills on Oracle, SQL and MYSQL DB are which includes stored procedures, functions, triggers, Oracle Advanced Queuing and dynamic SQL Queries."
good,"Joined as a fresher. "
good,"Daily activities include collecting the requirements from clients and managing my team of 6 members."
good,"ADP is a great company.  Some managers adhere to ADP policies and procedures more than others."
good,"Too much value placed on popularity and not enough on work ethic, They are prone to terminating good workers for the sake of retaining people that are willing to sabotage others careers."
good,"Have enjoyed working with the company for the past 26 years. Feel that I have reached a crossroads in my life where I need a career change."
good,"Enjoying good team work and learning new thing by resolving issues"
good,"Empresa onde se aprende muito. Aprende a negociar com clientes internos e externos, folha de pagamento e gerenciar projetos."
good,A good place to work. My co-workers were of great support to me. Management is of great support. The hardest part of the job is criticality.
good,"I actually enjoyed a majority of my time at ADP. However, constantly being monitored if you are on the phone or not is not for me. Breaks aren't frowned upon, but when you are away from the phone you are producing numbers that they want. You become a numbers producing employee. They want you to take care of the customers in a timely matter but that is not always the case. They want client retention and producing a high call turnover rate. As a consumer, I do not want to be just someone's number. I want them to take the time to assist me with my needs. "
good,Great company with room to grow. I enjoyed working for the company but not a fan of the product. The hardest part was transitioning from a home office to an onsite office. The most enjoyable part of the job is acquiring new business and helping clients grow their organization.
good,"I've the freedom to learn whatever I want, but I'm completely on my own, isolated from other teams. Hours are completely flexible, telecommuting is the norm, I love the benefits.However its also normal to report to people who have no background or knowledge about what you're doing. For example, non technical managers who don't don't the difference between java, c#  and python are direct reports over development teams."
good,"I started working in ADP 20 years ago. They were more professional and the environment, though high pressure was pleasant to work in years ago."
good,"I worked here for over 15 years.  I enjoyed most of my time here. I learned a ton while working here about many different things.  I learned about all the different state and local tax filings, how payroll works, and so many other things along the way."
good,ADP overall is a good company.  The opportunity for advancement is different depending upon what business unit you work in and the location you work in.  It is dedicated to employee development and making their employees better.  I would still be with the company if it were not for them offshoring a lot of the business we handled.
good,"ADP is the largest payroll processor in the world offering human resource management solution. ADP, a Fortune 200 company, provides paychecks to 1 in 6 Americans. As ADP’s corporate marketing executive, I design and execute the company’s B2B digital marketing and lead generation strategy. I work with directly with a Google team and Ad Agency to craft their power messaging and optimize it for social distribution, SEM, display, mobile and tablet campaigns, and on www.adp.com. I have learned a great deal at ADP and they offer a lot to their employees."
good,"typical days were January  endings"
good,"Competitive, Consumer Driven, High Paced, Energetic, Diverse"
good,"Empresa familiar, no segmento automotivo."
good,"My typical day on the job entail a great deal of administrative duty as well deploying resolution for end users that are utilyzing our day to day applications. I conduct one to one to stay in the loop of our clients and employee to determine an accuarate climate for their accounts. "
good,This job got me a taste and introduction into sales in the newspaper industry
good,"Supportive team and can do attitudes help the daily ""putting out fires"" activities."
good,"Most recently I have been providing services as Implementation Specialist II where my duties covered all aspects of project planning, project management, payroll setup, client training, client support and administrative."
good,"Some good days, some bad.  Much of the management team doesn't seem to understand digital marketing or partnering with clients to determine client need.  The term ""ROI"" is a dirty word with sales and development and sales drives product development."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of resolving daily production problems, writing technical documents, attending design and development meetings, consulting with management and clients. The rest of the time would be spent working on projects. One of my major responsibilities included the measuring the performance of production systems, producing daily performance statistics and then offering suggestions on how to resolve the issues. And then resolving the issues. "
good,Great company very tough interview process was only contracted not a permanent employee was let go after decrease in calls
good,Family orientated and a great place to work.  Job security with company was never a concern
good,"- Very much a sales culture"
good,"• Work on some java coding – SCIM, RESTFUL, BATCH utilities."
good,A typical day for me was running my weekly payroll I was responsible for. Had been in payroll only 6 months and it was all new to me. I already knew SAP from my previous position. In payroll I added ADP under my belt. I learned ADP by training with my peers for a couple of weeks. Management could have been better. My co-workers were a joy to be around daily. The hardest part of the job would be the lack of understanding when personal/family had to come first. The most enjoyable part of my job was the experience to learn something completely new. I am always eager and willing to learn.
good,"A typical day is very structured and micro-managed. Co-workers are helpful, supportive and reliable in completing any given task. However, advancement within the company is slow and one dimensional (not much lateral movement). If you are assigned to a poor manager work will go not be completed as quickly. Good experience and would recommend the company if the job description interests you."
good,I have worked here over 14 years ago so I am not sure how the company is managed these days
good,"The job was tough dealing with payroll and taxes all day, however the compensation was worth the hassle."
good,ADP prides itself of assisting its associates on helping them to attain greater professional growth and development. They offer a lot of assistance that makes it impossible to fail when it come to this area.
good,"I started in 1990. Worked with and for great people. Due to outsourcing to offices in India, many of the jobs, including mine were eliminated. There are still many good people who work for ADP, however the management within my area has MUCH to be desired. Not to lump or put down people who do not posess a college degree, but none of the managers had one (Even the VP did not)."
good,"Outside Sales 101, great place to work, plenty of resources available"
good,ADP does a lot for their associates. I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,An aggressive sales culture. Huge upside for sales commissions but back room is lagging
good,"Excellent territory-sales environment. You produce and you will be recognized and move quickly in the company. Associates are willing to help other associates as much as possible. Upbeat, and fast-paced environment."
good,"Executed direct B2B sales encompassing all aspects of the sales experience; customer prospecting, thorough demonstrations, contractual and closing negotiations"
good,Dynamic challenging work. Compensation is commesurate with experience. Benefits are similar to other large companies. Some folks are allowed to work from home. Certain departments maybe slow in promoting people.
good,ADP is a great family culture that creates great relationships with the co-workers. The issues can be the message from management is not always clear and concise. Leaving up to us to inturpret.
good,"A typical day is working with clients on billing issues, accounts payable, accounts receivables, requesting check requests, collections, credit balances, bankruptcy, audits, starts, month end entries and working with other department regarding clients accounts or accounts payable. I have learned many skills from working at ADP. I have learned regarding month end entries, collections, credit balances. I have also learned so much with being in charge of our employee engagement project. My co-workers are great to work with. However the communication is not the best. So there are some issues with that. We as a team can make decisions on everyday items just among us. The hardest part of my job was when I got a promotion to accounts payable. The associate that had the position had been fired. I have worked for the department for 4 months when I got the promotion. None of our processes were documented and the supervisor did not know all of the duties that she did. I have worked very hard to be able to figure how the task needed to get done and through the years I have made the processes more efficient and gives more time to work on other duties that need to be done. I think that the most enjoyable part of the job is that we are not micro manage. Our supervisor knows that we all know what has to be done and the deadlines they are. So we do not have a lot of supervisor watching what needs to be done. She excepts it to be done and they are done on time. I also like working with the clients on accounts and the accounts payable and accounts receivables."
good,Full disclosure: I was laid off right when the economy started going south. My department was eliminated in El Paso within 6 months of my release.
good,I have enjoyed every day comimg to work in ADP. Achieved a lot in the company like got project awards.
good,Overall I would say that ADP is a good solid company to work for and I had many happy years there.
good,"a great place to work, great people to work with. Great inner community and plenty of training to advance your future. Great benefits and stick options."
good,"I learned a lot in a short of amount of time. At the same time, there were things that I didn't know about and was held accountable for. I enjoyed my co-workers."
good,Je ne regrette pas le travail sur les chantier ADP.
good,The job I work at ADP is high stress and doesnt come with much rewards. It really pushes you to the edge and then when you're at your breaking point management will break you.
good,"In Time and Attendance, you will sit and take calls all day. If you are not familiar with payroll and time and attendance - you will learn so be ready to work hard. Its call center work and you have a workflow planner that oversee's your time in, breaks and time out. There is really no time to socialize because calls continue to come in and you have to pick up the phones and help resolve time and payroll issues. The excitement comes from all the learning and fun events throughout the year. Be ready to be mentored hard and not take things personal - it can be overwhelming but if you put your pride aside - you too can become an ADP Time expert like I did in less than 18 months."
good,Overall good place to work with many associate benefits.  Several areas for advancement as long as you are willing to dedicated the appropriate amount of time and effort into your craft.
good,"Many Business Resource Groups to join"
good,"Competitive, challenging, exhausting, rewarding, amazing awards presidents clubs trips, fair bonus structure, fair pay, nice friends, flexible hours, company car"
good,"At ADP I enjoyed my team and appreciated the flexibility offered to work from home some days. There are also some great benefits like tuition reimbursement and opportunities for advancement. However, in the later years that I was there, opportunities to advance (for me at least) seemed to diminish. And the fear of the next round of lay-offs was ever-present. "
good,"Very stressful job environment.  Good pay and good people, but clients are very high strung and most calls/emails are urgent.  If you are smart you will move up."
good,"The overall experience of working in ADP is really not bad!"
good,"At the moment, all i can say is they developed my skills. push me to be a better person at work. provided good benefits and a good working environment"
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, apesar de ter dias estressantes."
good,The management is really friendly. But there are some negative influences in the company that pull everything down. The pay is on time and there are managers who are considerate. It depends on which department and place you are in and who are your clients.
good,Nothing to say about this job. It was a very long time ago and I dont remember much.was there for s very short time. Money was decent. Took care of me .
good,"All, in all a worthwhile company to consider working for.  More people realize that payroll is really about finance, audit and other typical functions a person finds in a bank.  But they are more agile, have the latest technology and there's a reason why they are the industry leader.  They are still the industry leader after decades.  How many other software companies can make that claim."
good,"Opportunity to be in many different groups however not much time to be involved with the workload."
good,Working for ADP was cool no major complaints. The only issue I had was the uncertainty of being included in the quarterly layoffs. It's hard to plan a future with a company when you could be let go due to company issues.
good,This is a great place to work if you need payroll  and tax knowledge. Though there are different products I can only relate to what I experienced. It is a good training ground.
good,"I really enjoyed the culture working at ADP, the advancement and compensation was a great part of working their apart of the benefits. Wish the same opportunity was available here."
good,"Company has Employee friendly policies like WFH options and free transport, work culture is also good. Flexible shift timings but it depends on project also. Very difficult to get Onsite opportunity."
good,This was a great place to work with many opportunities for advancement.  The company was ever-changing (one department I worked in my manager changed five times - all due to re-orgs - in 6 yrs).  Compensation and benefits were good.  Annual reviews with raises based on performance.  Recommend.
good,"ADP is shifting culture to a more of a streamlined focus on pure productivity with an emphasis on the client instead of the employees. Though good to start off, this entry level position is not for everyone."
good,Great balance between personal and work in some departments there is room for advancement. Has great programs to help build and increase knowledge skill set.
good,"ADP is a great place to gain lots of experience once out of school. There are many opportunities once in to find an area you love. "
good,"It is a fun place to work at first. But at some point depending on the position, the perks no longer become worth the stress you have to deal with on a daily basis. They will tell you a lie to get you into the position and then once you are there you have to remain there for 12-18 months for something else to open up or you quit and go work somewhere else."
good,I worked at ADP for a 6 months. Great place to work but they have a lot of contractors but not enough jobs. I really like the culture of the organization.........
good,ADP tried to ensure there were 40 hours of learning opportunities per year for every employee. A typical 9 hour day had flexible start and end times. Jobs can get cut due to restructuring as they can with any company to save costs.
good,"Benefits could be better, very expensive with little to no coverage. Alot of employees comes with high school drama. But you can learn alot just come straight to work and home."
good,"It's a wonderful place to work. They offer a good work/ life balance, and the benefits that they offer apart from the salary are really amazing. They do offer a bit of a slow growth opportunity."
good,I am closely aligned with the company's values and commitment to ethics.  Over the years it has grown significantly.  I do miss the small company feel; but it is still a great option for someone starting out.
good,"Fun place to work. Great people. You can make a lot of money if you work hard, set goals and follow the process that ADP teaches you. Make sure to work with your partners"
good,"ADP was a great place to work. Busy environment, offered a lot of training and was ever boring.  The environment was also very energetic and offered growth opportunities. The COBRA product was sold to another company so I moved to a new company. I was not happy about that as I wanted to retire from ADP."
good,Company was extremely progressive which allowed the work culture to be very modern and exciting. There were many training opportunities that allowed employees to maximize efficiencies and increase their skillset. Main issue with the company is a lack of awareness on work life balance. Working 60+ hours every week while salaried doesn't position well for long tenure.
good,"Somewhat flexible work schedule. Most training was on-line. Company is constantly working to improve product so that it is better for clients as well as employees. Travel on occasion to meet with clients. For the most part, I was not micro managed.  I managed my work as needed with the use of tools provided by ADP.  Helping clients to resolve payroll related issues and learning the system was by far the highlight to my day.  Also assisting co-workers to better do there job was also a positive!"
good,It's a good company but i think they could pay better and managers like to micro manage. The work environment can get very stressful especially at year end.
good,Quality local management and employees. Good opportunity for initial advancement but easy to bottleneck in your career. Quality people and Management.
good,"I have learned a lot being and working in a big company, the culture and the values are really important, which I recommend without any hesitation. Good luck to all."
good,"When I worked for ADP, the training was quite through and they supported us in getting our FPC. In general, I do not like the nature of call center work, but I did enjoy helping our client solve problems and the level of support that was provided for our position. In general I felt the managers I encountered understood what work-life balance meant. There were generally ample opportunities for overtime if you wished to participate, never forced. It was a stressful job, as you are dealing with business owners and their payroll/taxes, but you are paid fairly well compared to other call center jobs."
good,Great place to work for.  ADP is behind in technology and they are very proactive in identifying what needs to be worked on in order to be in the competitive workforce.
good,Every 3 years a new leader from the United States comes in and makes drastic changes.  The culture changes with the leader.  Very high turnover and always infighting.
good,working for ADP was amazing. I loved the leadership and day to day work. I have learned many skilling including to grown my knowledge of SQL. The hardest part of my job was remembering to stop.
good,"The company is great. It offers great pay with a solid work-life balance. However, there is a culture mismatch between myself and the company. I am a young single male in a company filled with family oriented people. I have trouble connecting."
good,Love the culture and that this company gives back.  They are big on associate development.  Work life balance can be nonexistent.  A lot of the day is spent in meetings then you have to find time to do your actual day to day tasks which can lead to working late hours or logging on from home to catch up.
good,"ADP is a great place to work. The workplace is friendly, and the benefits are great. ADP takes care in educating its employees. I would recommend ADP to anyone."
good,Great company to work for and move up in if you are into new business development or sales career. Decent team atmosphere and culture. In life however it’s how you utilize your skills. Can be cut throat and is based on purely performance.
good,ADP is a good company to work for. Good compensation and work life balance. The Leadership Team does a good job at communicating the company's vision to the staff. Associates are very friendly and collaborative
good,"Like any company, it all depends on your direct manager. Great environment, stable company, lots of internal movement and opportunity. Hard to get time off for holidays and most jobs are a call center environment."
good,ADP is truly built on a strong and solid workforce.  Their commitment to the tasks at hand is unmatched.  Leadership needs to embrace the change culture and place more of the focus on their workforce instead of adding more layers of management.
good,Great company to work for. But It depends on the department and management of course.  Manager and supervisor in payroll department was horrible. Compensation and Benefits are great.
good,ADP is moving to maga centers and terminating all small offices and home shored employees no matter how experienced they are.  ADP also off shores work.
good,Good company going through some restructuring.  Growth opportunities take 18 months to advance to new role.  Very team driven and good support from management.
good,ADP has created a great culture within all of the different offices and put a big emphasis on helping each other out. They also have an extensive training program that includes having a mentor.
good,The culture is fantastic in the office and the training that you will undergo is more than enough to set you up for success. This is a great place to start a career in sales.
good,"I worked with retired people who were friendly and helpful."
good,Overall. ADP has been a great place to work.  I worked with many fabulous people and have made great friends for life.  Long hours can be exhausting at times.
good,"Work life balance, and benefits are great.  Managers are great  There are high demands to produce at times.  ADP overall is a good company to work for."
good,"Overall, good place to work if you’re up for challenging work. Depending on the role, the tasks can be many, daunting, repetitive and manual. The people and the culture make it a good place to work."
good,"The position became overwhelming and required more of me than I could physically do in an 8 hour day. I managed 14 large client's accounts and was also required to keep detailed tracking of each client's accounts, notating all phone calls, emails, updates, inquiries and updates. There was no opportunity for overtime, which was much needed."
good,Very good place to start career. Had no complaints other than hard to advance career. You are stuck in a role for longer than most people would like to be.
good,The people at ADP are very dedicated to their craft. My last manager left the department I was at but was the best Manager I had at the company. My experience was pleasant due to the people I worked with.
good,I really enjoyed working at ADP and my manager was the best I've experienced in my career. The hours could be extremely difficult but the people treated me well and work was very satisfying.
good,"nice place to work, work home life balance and the VP of Major sales was a great manager and treated everyone fair. I was overall happy with the time I spent with ADP"
good,Decent company. Great benefits. Management does suffer from a disconnect with associate level employees. Not a bad place to work and there are plenty of opportunities.
good,"Good place to work. i worked in office and from home. Unfortunately I got laid off due to relocation of ADP. ADP did offer severance."
good,"""Great Company with excellent work/life balance"""
good,Great up and coming company. Plenty of advancement opportunities. Has onsite cafe. Staff was very knowledgeable about material. Overall great experience.
good,Worked at ADP for 20+ years and took the generous voluntary retirement package. Fabulous people and a strong culture that the client experience is priority 1.
good,"Good work but expectation more than the time limit, flexi timings, cilleges are good, freshers can reach them but experiance person should avoid this."
good,Great place to work...have been in some really good roles with this organization.  Great training and development for the associates.  The organization believes in community projects.
good,"une siciéte structurée  et évolutive en matière de travail et évolution."
good,"Good place to work, a great place to work, Stock options, purchase plan.  some areas have co cars.  Pension offered as well as stock awarded programs."
good,One of the best companies which cares about associates and creates a true comfort zone for work force. Associates are given a chance to adapt and grow.
good,"ADP provided me with opportunity to learn new applications, as well as gain understanding to the inter workings of Third Party Administrators (TPA) organization."
good,"Working for ADP has its pros and cons.  It is very demanding in terms of the work, especially during crunch time (start of the year and middle of the year)."
good,"Positive atmosphere and great people.  Management can be an issue anywhere, but this place had a revolving door for managers.  It was our location that really had this issue because I didn't notice it as much at other offices in our region.  Overall, I would recommend this as a great place to work!"
good,"Mostly positive"
good,"Fast-paced, role depends on team placement, relaxed environment, good benefits but expensive insurance, 8 weeks paid maternity leave, not much room for advancement"
good,"ADP provided me with the best possible training for how to be a competitive, driven, successful employee. With that training came long hours, stress, and struggles with work/life balance."
good,"ADP was in the past a company that if you chose to work there for years and advance you could. That culture no longer exists . I was a 20 year EE for ADP and was laid off . Many other tenured EEs with the knowledge  and experience required for the back end technical payroll / tax work are being cut . This is an unfortunate cycle with ADP I have seen in it in the past and this time I was impacted . "
good,Great teammates. Great pay. Felt fulfilled at the end of the day. Work variety is good. Healthy atmosphere. Good work life balance. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Management was not treating all employees equally and they did not praise you or gave you opportunities for advancement. It seems because it is a large company they did not care. Management fired me instead of working with me after a motor vehicle accident, where I was not at fault, and suffered injuries that prevented me to perform temporarily in a restrictive manner."
good,"They are good at organizing engagement activities. The benefits are good. They offer a very helpful HMO package and retirement plan. However, workload is too much. Training process can still be improved."
good,The culture at ADP was friendly and collaborative. Some managers lacked the skills it took to manage and develop their teams. Feedback to team members tended to be more subjective and based on hearsay.
good,"Good company dealing with change, not moving fast enough and with pockets of culture that are not great.  Can have lots of fiefdoms and managers protecting their domains which can impact speed.  Also has a lots of great people trying to do the right thing."
good,ADP good place to work. Slow paced. Plenty of folks with over 20 yrs exp. Tough to adapt to change.Not very open to change. Decebt worklife balance....
good,"Ever changing structure and processes, makes it an interesting place to work.  One is often is being reactive versus proactive.  Management sincerely cares about their employees and tries to help them balance work/life home, but due to workload this can be hard to achieve"
good,"my day begins at 6:30am - I check the sales order email box for emails from sales for incomplete orders submitted - to complete and assign out to be set up for payroll - also then begin to pull and distribute the new orders that come in to start payroll - for that day or other dates as assigned by sales."
good,Great place to work if you find the right position. The commute can be an issue depending on where you live.  There is the New Norhside and Alpharetta location.  There are some positions that are home-shored.  I really enjoyed the people and working with the clients.
good,"Was managed well but as usual with other places, favoritism and politics reigned. Very corporate driven and governed - removed freedom of creativity from the regional offices."
good,"Una empresa que durante muchos años ha tenido un gran clima laboral, desgraciadamente esto ha cambiado por la presión a los resultados y falta de estrategias adecuadas."
good,It was a Federal contract job that was short term. Management was very supportive and willing to train. Most employees were retired Officer Vets . They were enjoyable to work with.
good,I joined ADP less a little less than 2 years back. ADP is a great company. The work environment and support of work from home provides for a needed work life balance.
good,"- Very good job work/life balance"
good,As part of a PMO that had mixed technology and security related ADP was a great place to work. Nice people good environment fantastic management and smart co-workers.
good,"The compensation and benefits were good.  The work environment was very collaborative, and the people there were very easy to work with.  I would still be there had my position not been moved to another state as part of their ADP-One (consolidation) strategy."
good,"Love ADP! I think it's a great company, I think the sales territories are a little unbalanced, and not disbursed correctly."
good,ADP purchased our small software as a service company. The transition to ADP was great and they were committed to incorporating our company into a strong new line of business.
good,"Reviewed / researched multiple aspects of payroll products. Deadline driven and fast paced. Prepared reports for quarter and year end tax returns.  Often collaborated with multiple business partners, clients, banks, and government agencies. Very friendly family like atmosphere.  High level of focus on security.  Occasional business fun - Holiday, year end parties and annual summer picnics."
good,Great organization to work with decent work-life balance. Provides ample opportunities to learn new things and Lot of interesting things happen all over the year that keeps you involved and motivated.
good,"sometimes work/life balance was out of synch"
good,ADP is a good company to work with and for the most part stable. That is not t say that we will suddenly loose a project or department to business needs and have to find another job which is currently my case. I would recommend ADP to anyone especially in EL Paso since it is one of our biggest employers. The only downfall seems to be the bureaucracy involved with management and how the management culture seems to assimilate all managers to the same ADP style. I have seen great managers turn into mediocre to horrible managers because of this style change.
good,Great place to learn about corporate culture.  Excellent opportunities to practice and train.  Managers took time you knew what was expected of you when you were talking on the phones.
good,I love working for ADP but need to broaden my horizons. ADP is an amazing place to work but salary can be lower than other companies depending on your background.
good,The day started by logging in and taking calls and consisted of that until the end of the shift. I learned many things in this workplace that I hadn't handled in other call centers. It was a good environment within the coworkers and teams. Very stressful job due to not having the availability to the systems required to complete our job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to bring resolutions to employee's escalated cases.
good,Extremely fast paced and challenging for the offered salaries.  As soon as you are able to get a hang of one thing another task is put onto your plate.  Work extra hours just to be able to leave at a reasonable time only to have more thrown at you.  Team was fun and youthful but all feel the same pain.  Many who have left understand that they can make same money doing way less at another job.  Yearly raises don't always occur and when they do they are very minimal.
good,"Manage a semi technical team which acts as a technical bridge connecting all the processes and covering the overall product performance."
good,"Day to Day is fine, just do you work and go home, great place to be in a technology role, but only a few are available on the west coast, every once in a while, they will cut people, in big waves, regardless of years of service."
good,Good experience and good culture as a first job. Inside sales is underpaid (salary and comp) in comparison to other similar positions. Good overall benefits. Limited career advancement.
good,Productivity is given the highest priority. It is a great place to begin one's career as we can learn so much from the day-to-day tacks. Hardest part is that few months the workload will be huge and the other months it will be less.
good,As a team lead at ADP you are on standby 24/7 and must be able to adapt to product/application changes on a regular basis.  You are expected to act quickly to resolve client issues and provide a quick resolution to ensure client satisfaction.
good,"While ADP as a whole has great values and embraces people of all walks of life, each BU has it's own culture.  It is important to understand the vision and leadership of each BU."
good,A Typical Day at work for me at ADP. Was saftey first. Always make sure u had on all your proper saftey equipment. Then after that go check your forklift machine and make sure it meet all the proper guidelines to operate.Then i would load the trailers with air conditons. Then sometimes i would have to get off my lift and cut out sheetmetal for when people dont show up for work. i was doing everything. from Loading /Unloading inspection. Then i would have to go to shipping and reciveing and help in that department. But basically saftey was our main focus.
good,"Automatic Data Processing is a great company.  The workplace culture is very relaxed.  There are several divisions within ADP which are Insurance, Retirement Services and Payroll.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the individuals."
good,"ADP had many ups and downs. They have a very structured environment and hands-on training which is great for any new-comers to the sales industry. "
good,"ADP is a great company overall. They have good benefits, and you can get paid really well. I would say for certain roles there is a lot of work expected from you and you easily work 50+ hours a week. They will let you work from home which is great but the amount of work you do and how they sometimes are not prepared if employees leave can make the job stressful."
good,I have no opinion about working at ADP  my experience was different than most and I recognize that.  it depends on your management team and where you are located
good,"Typically your day would be on a strict schedule with little ability to change. You are speaking with clients all day with a very short interlude between calls, if any. Since there is almost no time away from the phone there is very little office or team building outside of a rare team meeting."
good,"Met plezier naar je werk gaan."
good,The business unit I worked for was acquired by ADP and later spun off so i don't have a lot of experience with ADP management but others told me the goal was mediocrity.
good,"I enjoy working for ADP.   There are struggles with politics at times, but that can be said for any company. The only negative that i can think of is that there is so much focus on being a part of extracurricular activities.  Sometimes it feels that being a part of these ""groups"" outweighs hard work.  Some departments even evaluate employees on how many business resource groups they are a part of.  There are times when the ""social butterflies"" advance while the people who are busting their rears get passed over."
good,A little stressful at times but overall excellent work life balance.  Not sure if this is true for all departments.  Not a lot of room for advancement but did work with a great group of people.
good,One of the best companies to work and individual importance is given. It has multiple Procces so you don't have to worry of changing your company and look for change.
good,"ADP is a good company to startup as IT Professional. Depends on the stream which candidate is gng to get, work pressure depends. Will have growth based on stream"
good,"A cultura da empresa é bem legal, o RH costuma desenvolver diversas ações para engajar os funcionários como festa junina, frutas frescas a tarde etc. A maioria das pessoas lá sempre está disposta a ajudar e isso ajuda muito no ambiente de trabalho."
good,In my position I was given many chances to grow and develop by my manager. My manager gave me many important tasks which allowed me to make great contributions within the company. I cannot say how it would have been if I had a different manager.
good,Warm Leads to call. Great atmosphere. Very good compensation and bonus structure. One of the only companies i know that has a good salary plus comissions
good,"Great place to work. Good work culture, there is no strict hours or micro management. Once you are assigned with work, you will be trusted and no one will rush until the deadline."
good,"A typical day would be data entry"
good,"ADP is a good company with well intentioned people. It is trying to evolve itself into a technical company, with mixed success. A very silo'd org structure, and disjointed project communication leave many resources underutilized, and conversely, many projects redundant. It is a political environment, and this is further driven by being a bit top heavy, with upper management busy but underutilized. An old company trying to refresh itself."
good,"Ample learning opportunities"
good,ADP has been a good company to work with. It gives opportunity to learn and grow. It also provides the flexibility to work. I enjoyed working with this company.
good,"At ADP i worked as an assistant. A typical day would be making hundreds of phone calls to either cold or warm leads. As well as contacting current clients asking if theres anyway we can improve our services. On days that i was out on the field i would walk from business to business intruding myself and ADP. I would sett up meetings for my mentor and observer the way he conducted his pitch. The workplace culture was very professional, but also personal. Everybody truly cared for each others success. The hardest part of my job was not being able to do things on my own. i felt like i was ready to take on more, but i did not get the chance to d o it."
good,"Very fun place to work, great support but no the easiest thing to sell "
good,"ADP company is good  and the benefits provided by the company are good."
good,ADP is an industry leader and is very profitable.  I worked there for 11 years and always felt secure.  In the last several years outsourcing to other countries has started the process of eliminating long time employees.  Forcing early retirements and laying off entire departments has become the norm.  They encourage constant learning and development and the compensation is a bit above average.  Overall I am disappointed about how the employees stopped mattering.  I do appreciate all I learned though.
good,"Room for advancement easy to understand."
good,"The ADP company is good place to work at for recent IT and Network technologies. Global Network Services Engineers deal with multiple network engineering issues during regular hours, afterhours during maintenance window and on-call rotation. I have learned many new technologies related with latest IT/Network hardware/software solution. Training and certification courses were available."
good,"Company is good to learn for new comers also good scope for hardwork, good environment, modern culture, MNC atmosphere"
good,good working culture and very good co ordination by the team members which helps in career growth and maintain stability in job roles and very good training provided for the startups
good,Ward hard; Play hard; It is a sales organization first and one receives excellent training.  You are expected to meet your sales quota before moving on to other opportunities
good,The Company gives good opportunities to learn & use new technologies. Great place for people who have the urge to learn and earn.
good,Work from home- handle high volume of client calls and emails- follow up and resolve open items.   Provide bi-weekly and monthly status calls with clients.   24 years with ADP and everyday I learned something new-  I like this. I worked hard at building internal relationships as well as external relationships- My co-workers were great to work with.   Hardest part of the job was escalations as I had to depend on other departments within the company to resolve issues for my clients.  My clients for sure were the most enjoyable part of my job- I had long working relationships with my clients and we knew each other well- they were all a pleasure to work with.
good,"Initially when I joined ADP, it was very tough for me as ADP was a multinational company and I was working for a domestic company. The culture differed and I did have some challenges initially, however my skill to adapt to any situation was the key to my success."
good,Love the people I worked with.  Solid company.  Associate engagement a priority.  Feedback always welcomed and encouraged.  Very intense environment and some silo issues but overall excellent place to work.
good,"Prepared amended returns to previously filed taxes to ensure accounts were in compliance with state, local and federal tax laws.  Researched various state and local laws."
good,I would recommend this company anywhere i go. I am seeking for other opportunites because i would like to work at daytime and be able to sleep at night like a regular employee and as much as possible for a back office account.
good,ADP is a nice place to work.  You are allowed to provide input on day to day activities that directly effects the position.  The co-workers are a pleasure to work with.  The most difficult of  position is the ever changing system information.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping others achieve their goals.
good,Every day was always a new adventure interfacing with internal & external clients troubleshooting and/or setting up their data transmission method.
good,"If one is looking to expand their career in sales within the technology realm of the media and trade show environment, CMP Media would be a great place to work.  The company has a wide range of resources to connect technology companies and their potential customers under one roof.  I was able to learn quite a bit about the mechanics of ISP's and the Broadband Wireless industry during my tenure at the company."
good,"A Recruiter for ADP RPO is responsible for supporting client business needs. Primary responsibilities for a Recruiter include, recruiting and mining activities, reviewing candidates to determine the best match for open roles, using Boolean search techniques, documenting interactions, developing recruiting strategies and techniques and responding to candidate inquiries."
good,Fast paced and team oriented. Nice place to work. Highly recommend for anyone looking to jump start a career. Training and support is top notch.
good,"Unfortunately the job didn't involve financial statement analysis"
good,Currently the company is understaffed and pushing for greater productivity.  The entire company feels like it's pushing to hard.
good,"A day at ADP office is never been so stressful, rather encouraging and enthusiastic. The environment is employee friendly with nicely cooperating co workers. The work done is recognized and rewarded by the upper management and the entire hierarchy is so transparent that you can converse easily with people at any management level."
good,Good place to start your career and opportunity for development.  Co-workers are engaged and partner well.  Goals are expected to be set high and can sometimes be overwhelming.
good,"My co-workers were really good,they used to work well together solve each others issues if needed,used to have weekend parties,used to go for outings and it was really fun working with them"
good,"-Erreichung der vorgegebenen Umsatzziele"
good,"This job was almost perfect i loved the people, and management were really focused on helping the employees. the only thing is the job was seasonal"
good,"When I started ADP, they were new to Augusta.  I had the pleasure of many new beginnings.  At that time the management and co-workers were very enthused with working there and so was I."
good,it was repetitive and got boring after doing for so long. People are great and friendly. Management is outstanding. Great company to work with.
good,"always a busy day from doing onsite job fairs, college career fairs and etc. A very large company with 7 other facilities in other states."
good,"Middle Management are aware of internal problems but not able to address them or implement solutions."
good,"ADP will give you a chance even with minimal experience. Much of the training is lean on your own. There isn't much guidance initially but later there is support available. As far as community my location did not have alot of culture and employee events , however there are other locations that do ."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Fun place to work, with supportive team members, great for a well balanced diverse culture environment. Great Work Life balance, a few con's such as job security, not based on my experience but others."
good,"Fast pace work environment, I learned a lot their it was a wonderful place to work were I met a lot of good, intelligent people. I went to work every day knowing I would learn something new."

good,Structured place of work with a strict adherence policy.  Room to grow within the company if hard work and dedication is present.
good,"This ADP division has great benefits, and really great associates.  Although this division is going through its third reorganization in less than 1 year I have learned some key steps to continue to succeed.  The most important part of my working day is followup.  In order to succeed it is imperative to insure both internal, and external customer satisfaction."
good,"Opportunity to work with people across the company, and get involved in projects across the board. If you like to stay busy, there's always something to work on. Management is down to earth."
good,"My co-workers are awesome people.  They are a real team.  "
good,I loved working for ADP. Never a dull moment working there. I worked at the company for 28 years and can say I learned something new every day. Co-workers and management were great though you didn't get to talk to anyone but clients between 8:30 and 5:00.
good,"Under good management, job could be a dream job. Job has definite advancement possibilities. Work is extremely fun to work on and people and colleagues are great."
good,A place with many lateral opportunities throughout the organization. Flexible job schedules. Job security is a concern with the possibility of out sourcing being very imminent.
good,A day of work is very fast and efficient. I have learned teamwork & prioritizing my projects. Management is understanding and cunning. My co-workers are a great team to work with. The hardest part of my job is handling the mail from 2 different companies. what I enjoy about this job its a great environment and learned about customer service.
good,ADP keep it employees always informed of their growth and how well the company is improving on the market.  Several options for training on new and old products tools available.  Classes were always on-going to keep assoicates trained on all products that ADP offers its clients.
good,I owned full cycle recruiting for all payroll functions at the location. I was also provided the opportunity to help with process improvement in other areas. An example is that the new hire process was broken due to a layoff where part of the process was handled by a position that no existed. I was able to meet with different groups and work through the political process to automate the process with a low price add on to the IT ticketing system

good,A typical day at work consisted of helping others sort mail for processing.
good,"Monitoring and managing a small but busy billing team to ensure the efficient and accurate billing of in excess of GBP6m on a monthly basis over 6 separate billing platforms and providing monthly reporting for management,"
good,"This job is in the Retirement Services (RS) division of ADP.  This group is relatively small compared to the rest of the company, but the clients that do elect the Retirement Services product are very invested in it.  If something goes wrong between the payroll side and the retirement side, this can affect the entire relationship with the client."
good,"Oversee and manage district manager teams; learned to very detailed oriented and organized; management team works hard for coworkers and is very flexible with work/family responsibilities;  coworkers are awesome to work with and socialize with;  the hardest part of the day is being micro managed and instructed what to do when you have to meet deadlines; being told that you need to perform other tasks that take time away from closing deals that are in your pipeline or you are already working can be frustrating at times because there are not enough hours in the day to get it all done; the business model is constantly changed to suit what the company want the results to look like but really are not showing; the most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid a salary with benefits, days off, and receiving a commission check on top of this at the end of each and every month in addition to quarterly bonus checks."

good,"Taking inbound calls assisting callers with their employers benefits. Explaining the differences between different medical plan available to them and their dependents and the different rates they will be charged."

good,Very good place to work with a competitive benifits package.
good,Has a great campus environment.  There is alot of opportunity for growth with this company.
good,I am seeing ADP move away from it core values. Need to upgrade the Leadership.
good,I learned the ins and outs of benefits enrollment and some payroll.
good,"Being part of agile team with team located offshore, a typical day would start with scrum ceremonies. "
good,"I found myself working arounf college graduates which was odd at first. A typical day at work always had to do with troubleshoooting a benefit resolution as to why someone did not get compensated after turning in all the necessary paper work,alot of research involved. Listening to a person who is very upset early in the morning, then letting them calm down. I love this kind of work. I guess that is the investigator in me."
good,I usually go to work an hour before my main shift. I hate being late so I prep myself ahead of time. My typical day starts in answering calls and preparing the payroll sheet. I learned that everything is important especially when working on the salary on an employee because this will make sure that the individual gets paid on a timely manner and this helps him sustain his daily living. The management on he other hand sees to it that every employee deserves every single benefit I as an employee receives because I work in the night shift. The hardest part of my job is when an employer calls in and has insufficient funds in the bank and may not be able to pay his employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is when an employer calls back and give feedback and gives you a satisfaction rating because what I did was not just outstanding but it is spectacular customer service experience.
good,"I work an inbound resloution team that assists clients in the processing of payroll using ADP Payexpert/Portal and PC Payroll for Windows.  Daily resolutions will also include troubleshooting calculations for taxes, voluntary/statutory deductions, as well as benefit accruals.  "
good,"•	Oversee all businesses needs for human resource services (payroll, tax filing, worker’s compensation, electronic time and attendance, and compliance services)."
good,"Overall, good company to work for.  Helpful local coworkers.  However, the company made heavy use of overseas based contractual workers, which affected the final products quality.  Often at the end of contractual development the local staff was left with poor quality and hard to maintain software."
good,ADP was a learning experience and a stepping stone. I learned so many things while employed at ADP. A typical day is answering client concerns via email or phone. Another important task is to pull assigned cases from the database management tool. Co workers are responsible and helpful. Competition for jobs is very strong. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have helped a client by resolving their issue.
good,A great place to work. Great Location and nice building. Monday thru Friday with some holidays off. Nice pay scale and benefits.
good,A good company to work for if you are interested in payroll. Co-workers are a lot of fun and helpful.
good,An industry leader in payroll. The small business services division is not much different than it's competetiors though
good,"A typical work day is to make 50-70 outbound calls to prospects, banks, accountants, etc. Their is a lot of follow up and everything is done over the phone, fax or email. My co-workers are the best part about working at ADP. They make the work day go quickly and always challenge you. The absolute hardest part about inside sales is getting paperwork back from clients. You have to trust solely on their availability and urgency to get the necessary paperwork and documents back to you in a timely manner. There is a lot of chasing involved with over the phone sales."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to enteract with so many different people on a daily basis. Knowing just by being knowledgeable about the product I am able to help them thru the what seems to them a difficult task. This is what put a smile on my face.
good,Lot of things you can learn at this company. You can improve your managerial skills and team building skills.
good,Productive and fun limited growth opportunities
good,I am a Jave Developer . Enjoyed working there with very good Challenges and Its good place to work
good,"Amazing culture, but lacks opportunities for advancement"
good,ADP is the Employer of Choice and offers much growth. It is discouraging however to see that in some departments Managers are never hired from within which means certain positions do not afford the associates the opportunity to work their way up.
good,No real complaints after 13 years of working there.  Management almost always promoted from within meant knowing your boss knew what it took to do your job.
good,This job is specifically made for intrinsically motivated people. I learned a ton and was challenged daily but the service side and dealing with implementation as well as difficult leaders has caused some issues.
good,I like ADP as a company but not too happy in my current role. ADP is a good company with many opportunities. ADP takes into account their associates' needs and has many opportunities
good,ADP is a good company to work for overall. Fast paced environment and decent pay. Benefits are adequate. It's a wonderful place to learn due to the internal support.
good,I started with ADP right out of college with little experience and I have to say it was the best decision. Working in their sales organization has allowed me to grow into a young and upcoming professional! My only complaint currently is the shift in culture. I don’t see much of a work ethic like I used to and we keep too many under performers too long for a sales organization.
good,"Learnt a lot about payroll compensation, reimbursement, and client interaction. Good environment to work and work culture is good. Can give more employee benefits."
good,"Its great place to work for women and working mothers. As for Professionals to excel in HR, Payroll."
good,Great place to work. There was lots of trainings. It was a very stressful place to work. ADP always made you feel like you was at home. Great place to work...
good,"I love the ambience of the company. Lots of perks. HR Manager was an american, so benefits were okay. They have open door policy. Our salary was a bit low compared to the new hires but thats okay since we have high meal and transpo allowance and night diff."
good,Not a bad place to work. Overall the management is easy to work with. The cafe they have is great. But they charge by the ounce of food. That can get expensive.
good,"The flexibility in working from home and the hours has been amazing. "
good,"ADP is an overall great company to work for, they are truly a community within a community. Only negative side is that you are chained to a desk and are not able to move around. It is an inbound call center so they are solely looking at how to continue to hit the mark. Atmosphere can sometimes reflect that of a high school setting."
good,Great company. love the atmosphere. Job security and advancement. Great location and open door policy is a real thing here. Couldn't ask for a better company to work for.
good,"Nice people, inclusive culture, dedicated management; ADP is a large organization that can be slow to address client needs, but they do have a strategy to address technology needs."
good,"A good and reliable place to work. Advancement is a bit slow but otherwise great."
good,"ADP hired me as a temp and then brought me on as an employee 1 month later."
good,"ADP gives you and opportunity to work on different technology , it supports you to grow supports you to learning skills, ADP provides friendly environment"
good,It’s a great company to learn from however advancing doesn’t come easy. The work load starts easy however becomes too much to bear and complete in an 8hr day.
good,"The potential to advance here and have a career is awesome! However, the atmosphere is soo competitive that coworkers can get a little catty if they see you succeed. It is definitely a good place to work but keep your head down and don't let the noise get to you."
good,"In my opinion, it is not a company where I would start off my career with , but depends on team and assigned project,good work life balance and location"
good,"Work place is great, depending on department. Was on hired on permanent in 2014-2016. Due to leadership I resigned. But came back later as a contractor in 2019 and loved my new position and department."
good,"I enjoyed my time at ADP, until I didn't. And now, I'm looking for a new organization and a role that better matches my skills and experience. Although I'm a good project manager, I want more responsibilities in my day to day work activities."
good,People are really friendly and helpful. Compensation is good and bonuses. Great management in some departments but the work life balance is lacking overall.
good,Quality of RPO work experience is dependent on client team assignment. ADP as an employer is far superior to the RPO business segment in terms of professionalism and fairness.
good,"ADP is a great company. It not only promotes work life balance they walk the talk. The work is challenging but offers the opportunity to learn and grow. "
good,"10 week Training was great because I had the ability to have a learning specialist on site for 3 weeks. "
good,Great place to work.  Your career is in your own hands with opportunity for advancement at every turn.  Decent work life balance with understanding management.
good,Automatic Data Processing has a good culture with decent pay. Payroll is a grind that can become tiring but they setup milestones that keep you engaged.
good,I'd rather not give a review but I'll say that it was stressful and competitive.  They would post everyone's daily stats for everyone else to see and there was a lot of whispering about who did the most and who did the least.  If an account was lost - who was to blame.  So on and so forth.
good,ADP it's a great place to work pays well good benefits work schedules can be challenging mandatory overtime job metrics can be hard to meet also a lot of pressure to meet company deadlines
good,"I loved the people I worked with while at ADP.  The culture was very poor at the time, but I've heard it's been completely turned around with new management which is great to hear!"
good,"Its good place to learn new things and implement "
good,Would still be there if my job hadn't been relocated. ADP took care of the employees that were let go with ample notification and a good severance package.
good,Ideal job for those just out of college. Very slow road to get to a management position. Base pay is lower than most sales positions in the area. Good work culture.
good,"clima agradável, facilidade de comunicação, aprendizado."
good,"Large business invested in employees and development. Definition of what a good leader is shifting. Not just about managing people out but also managing them up. If hard working and promoted through organization, likely underpaid.Extremely political - 1 detractor can cave your entire brand."
good,"We don't usually has busy days but if the busy days came be prepared commit stretched hours. Management usually values work ethics, they appreciate team efforts."
good,"Good place to work with opportunities to expand knowledge and skills within recruitment process outsourcing. The culture is customer focused and friendly. Decent pay, work hours, and benefits."
good,This is a great place to work and you have to be highly adaptable. The work performance gets easier as you learn the culture and understand the expected goals.
good,"ADP provides excellent initial training. Can be difficult to move up the corporate ladder. Relaxed environment, but high demand. They definitely feed you. Expect to eat and work at your desk during peak times. Or work from home with permission"
good,You need to take initiative to be valued.  Good place to work but implementation to start something new or enhanced takes too long. Too many meetings to just talk when we could of did more work in the meeting time.
good,"You gain a lot of knowledge, team leads and tier 2 are willing to help you and share knowledge, company tries hard to make the environment seem like a happy one."
good,"The training for ADP was very good. You are well trained when you start and are supported all throughout."
good,Excellent benefits and employee programs.  Work from home is a great perk.  ADP values all employees.  Generally great management staff.  Consistently seeks opportunities to improve training.
good,ADP was overall a good place to work.  I enjoyed the ability to work from a home office and schedule my own days.  The ability to promote from within exists with this company.  A team approach is encouraged and I found that I enjoyed working with some great co-workers.
good,"Health Insurance is poor and too much work daily basis. Benefits are good overall, wich includes gym onsite, medical office on site, great payrates. This job is not for everyone it’s rutinary and very sensitive."
good,Cultura e Ambiente de trabalho agradável.Boa Direção e Gerencia.
good,"If you are looking to further your career ADP is a great place to do that.  There is so many opportunities for career advancement, they even have programs to train associates for leadership positions.   There is so many different departments within the company and if your move to another department its like a whole new company."
good,Role model changed for the worst in the 16 years that I had worked there. Management didn't seem to care as much for succeding in the position.  I also had a manager who was less knowledgeable of a product and would lie to clients and propose solutions that would never occour or didn't exist.  The manager also had asked me to wrie a leter to one client giving a dishonest event that had happened.
good,My position got eliminated but while I was working there it got crazy but management was very good.  Great company to work for.  Would go back if the was a position open
good,"ADP offers career opportunities, fast paced environment and long hours.  Continuous senior leadership turnover and low sales can make job security an issue."
good,"A Company with exceptional people."
good,"O dia a dia de trabalho sempre foi muito intenso, com oportunidade de interação com todas as áreas da empresa. "
good,ADP was a great place to work and still is if you live near one of the centers that you can drive to. I enjoyed most of my 27 years there. I would highly recommend working for ADP if you live near one of the service centers.
good,"Fair company with good benefits and competitive salaries. Talented workforce many of whom have been with ADP for many years. Great location in downtown Portland, OR."
good,"A typical work day for me begins with an early arrival into the office to make sure, I log onto my network, load all the necessary software tools, have time to check my emails in case I had received an email from my clients overnight. Of course, I have to get my coffee, start on time and be ready for our clients by providing  all technical assistance. This includes troubleshooting issues to start payroll, create payroll batches,run reports to check their numbers and submit the payroll, confirm that submitted files are received on ADP's mainframe for a successful processing. Regularly remote connection is established onto clients' desktop, laptop, tablets to resolve issues that could arise from the spectrum of Operating systems, Network Securities, and changing web browsers."
good,"Sorry but I prefer not to comment ADP is more than a payroll co they do many many things.  They cover payroll, benefits , leave time, 401k   They are a world wide company."
good,Overall good place to work good job security provides long hours and paid lunch keeps you learning everyday and very challenging for your mind which I look at as a plus.
good,"The work environment was very professional, not as relaxed as some companies.  There are a many employees there that have been with the company for many years and carry a lot of payroll knowledge so it's always good to make friends."
good,Company offers good benefits and they like getting the employees involved with charity events.  ADP likes to promote from within vs. hiring outside.  In some cases you are able to work from home
good,For a large company ADP is decent to work at.  There are certain times of the year that are extremely busy and stressful and it can be difficult to get time off.  Overall the people are friendly.
good,Was at their best when they empowered their employees to do what is right and ethical.  Too many controls and rules reduced productivity and cost the company some of its entrepreneurial spirit.
good,ADP is a fast paced organization to work.  You have to be able to multi-task and perform under pressure.  During a typical day at work you will work with many different clients and internal business partners.
good,I love the job. I was an EMI worker so I would not get all the benefits offered unless I was hired in. The shift I was on which was 5am to 5pm Friday-Sunday was ok I just wish we had more than two breaks.
good,"ADP is huge, so I'm sure your experience will differ greatly from location to location. The corporate culture is nice and they give you all of the tools you will need to succeed. Upper management makes sound decisions. Overall, the average salary is competitive with the rest of the job market."
good,"gave me great work experience, was a temp position for open enrollment only. Great people and the job was easy enough. Managers were mostly helpful. great work environment"
good,"Overall it is a pretty good place to work, however it can be difficult and stressful. On the good side, they do offer great benefit packages and the pay is fair and you receive continuous  on the job training and education that ultimately will increase your marketability as you move forward in your career. Some of the draw backs, are heavy work loads, constant changes in the management, teams, processes and technology. If you like a challenging position this may be ideal for you as there is never a dull moment."
good,"A member of Sales & Use Tax Notices Research process team,  responsible for providing resolution to the clients, State and Local agencies for the notices issued by the US State and Local agency."
good,"Work is challenging, collaborate with many levels of the organization. Pay is above average for individuals with no college education. Time off and benefits are outstanding. Physician, cafeteria and fitness facility on site."
good,I enjoy ADP work and the people are excellent to work with.  You can learn a lot from there.   You can make a lot of good helpful friends at ADP.  Great company to work for.
good,"When I started with ADP, the culture and environment was very different than what it is today.  It felt like a family; there was a strong sense of community. We had faith and total trust in our Senior Leadership. You respected who you worked for and you worked hard everyday not for anything but their approval and praise.  Today, it's a fast paced environment where you barely connect with your peers or Senior leadership. You do your job because of fear of job security, not for anything previously mentioned."
good,"ADP is a great company because of their benefits. However, you need to ensure you don't get stuck in a dead end position. It has 100's of departments and they all don't pay great or have the best management. It's really the luck of the draw."
good,"ADP sells itself to candidates/employees with a Win as One attitude. While that is a noble goal, company history is a strong headwind to that philosophy’s successful implementation."
good,"Its been many years i left ADP we used have strong work ethic which boosted my confidence.It was my first job i worked for payroll,i learned how payroll works ."
good,"ADP is great if you are not tenured and need conventional management. the teams and support are wonderful, there was always a fear of being laid off, unfortunate because it affects your productivity"
good,"fast paced, but does have some downtime I liked that you did not have to share a desk with anyone so you could decorate the area to match your own personality"
good,"Très bonne expérience"
good,The company is adamant about collaboration and career advancement.  The company focuses on diversity and inclusion as well.  Company has good morale.  Family oriented organization.
good,"Would have kept working there, company closed Washington Office and moved jobs to Tempe Arizona, had the opportunity to relocate but did not was to move to Arizona as I have always lived in Washington."
good,"Assisted Midwest Benefits Administration Executives with project work, travel, events. As part of Administrative team, worked front desk security as scheduled and needed. Position no longer exists due to corporate downsizing."
good,"My years with ADP were rewarding and full of growth.  Everyday I felt like I learned something new.  The stress of the job was very high and constant pressure to take on more.  Rewarded with a good salary and good managment."
good,"Every day was something different, I was always learning new things. I enjoyed working with the team on how to make things more efficient. I learned a lot about problem solving and critical thinking. The workplace culture was directed to the employees, they had multiple social committees and employee groups to be apart of."
good,"Depending on your business unit, the workload varies on the time of year. During the Summer months,  the workload can be slower and more relaxed. While during the year-end months, the workload can be more strenuous. "
good,"Hard work for not much money, but good training and benefits. Lots of time on the road, and lots of pressure from managers to hit numbers since that's how they get paid."
good,"Not an easy place to work at, but you do learn a lot.  High multi-tasking is a must along with working multiple projects at a time.  Expectations are high and with good reason.  I loved working at ADP.  You meet lots of people, and in our building is a medical office to see the doctor, indoor cafe, where you can purchase meals at a discounted rate, a gym with locker room and showers."
good,Had a distributed team of experts working on IVR solutions. The team had good support from the management to be able to deliver solutions using latest technology.
good,Management was cut throat but fair. I found that working here was challenging but doable if you just put the work in. You are given a lot of free reign so attack your day.
good,If you get in at the right position at the right time you can make a good amount of money. If you get a bad manager it can make it challenging to overcome obstacles
good,"ADP has created an environment that allows you to take your career wherever you want.  If you do well then you are rewarded handsomely with compensation, incentive trips, and stock options.  You can advance your career in the same division, or if you want to diversify, you can get more experience in a different business unit."
good,"Customers and manager difficult to work with, Very demanding. Training was good but expected to everything you and apply it like a pro with 24 hours!!"
good,"A very stable job (other than the office closure) and good access to education and resources to do your job.  Nationwide locations and dynamic business needs that kept things interesting.  "
good,"Great company to work for, but be prepared to sacrifice your personal life. In lieu of having a personal life, ADP does offer many great employee perks."
good,"Fun work place and team"
good,Plenty of opportunity to move throughout the company when successful.Sales is very difficult but rewarding if you put in the time and effort on a daily/weekly basis.
good,"New to the role so hard to evaluate fully"
good,Have been worked with ADP more than an year due to location constraints I have moved out bit I am enjoyed to go to work every and have gained tremendous product knowledge.

good,"very nice company, i learned how to managed my time properly. appreciated my clients a lot. the management is good and i really love my workplace especially my own station."
good,"Lots of quick relationship building.  Churn and burn type sales.  Fast paced.  Management judges you on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis.  Great training but high turn over due to burn out or not being able to adapt to the opportunity you have been given."
good,I sold human capital management recources to companies and managed accounts already sold.  It was a very competitive work place that thrived on high volume sales.
good,"The company give you a lot of perks. The base pay is okay but the benefits, stock options, car allowance, phone allowance can make up for the lack of base salary"
good,"Great company to start a career. It has great benefits and perks. However, it can be extremely difficult to advance in career as internal candidates have to go thru the same process as external candidates. There's always a constant management changes."
good,"Room for growth, pay and benefits are good. A lot of people, big company, but it feels like you're a big family. I was laid off, and although life goes on. I miss working for ADP."
good,ADP was a fun atmosphere and I learned a lot.  I will say that the SBS division is more of a stepping stone and the advancement opportunities outside of SBS aren't talked about enough in order to retain good reps.
good,Training is all virtual and not all people do well w/virtual training. I would prefer more on the job training and a mentor to refer to. They want you to know all aspects of the business and training is very fast paced.
good,ADP did a great job of making sure you had plenty to do. Consistently deploying new technology to accommodate the business need and  above all else a commitment to keeping their customers and clients data safe.
good,"ADP is good company to work with. Working with this company gives immense pleasure as you are free and independent to share your thoughts ."
good,"The atmosphere is very fast paced with a large number of changes continually in play due to the type of industry (HCM technology).  The best part of ADP is the people, very hard working dedicated staff."
good,"This is a fast paced environment and you will need to keep up. Flexibility depends on your department and manager. They create a fun workplace environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fun atmosphere. The most enjoyable is when something really serious happens, I do not feel like ADP truly cares about us or our families in those situations. They care more about the business having to continue since the business would not stop."
good,"ADP was a good company to work for as per most people who have spent time with this company. However, like most companies, a large part of the experience depends on your immediate management, and I do not have much good to say about that."
good,"ok place to work. large company. Departmentalized. Good culture. In my experience, i received good experience until they went to the ITIL format. This is when it became departmentalized. Luckily I received my experience before it got departmentalized."
good,"the job was stressful, not much support from manager,  training was great, the culture was my favorite.  lots of tools to use to be successful. sometimes implementation was an issue"
good,Empresa com grandes oportunidades de adquirir conhecimentos.   Salários compatíveis com mercado. Os benefícios não são atrativos.
good,"A typical day at work includes cold calls, follow ups, meetings, presentation prep, tech prep, and reporting of your pipeline status."
good,"Systems and technology are outdated.  Though some of the technology will be updated, the systems and processes will not be and those are where ADP fails for customers.  Culture needs work.  Managers are too busy to do any proactive work with their employees."
good,ADP was a great first job out of college. They have an amazing training program and I was able to learn a lot about sales techniques and people skills.
good,Good people and strong sales training / culture.  Earnings are limited compared to other companies.. stock options and car allowance are nice perks.  I would recommend for entry level sales..
good,"adp is employee eccentric organisation. employees get best treatment, you can have both family and work life cool there will be no pressure on you. it is the best place to work"

good,Sold payroll and tax filing services to small business with under 50 employees. Required to sell a certain dollar amount each month to meet quotas set by company.
good,The culture at ADP is quite unique and special. The employees get a good sense of the organization's vision and also connect with it. The hiring approach is professional and so is the induction program. The company's vision is shared in several forums so each employee feels empowered. The senior leadership strives to instill the core values of the company in all the employees.
good,"- Traveled to clients and prospects for on site meetings to review their human capitol management and business resource portfolios. Met with bankers, CPA's, and additional business partners to review clients to assist and sell ADP services to. Constantly on the go, handling service issues for clients while searching to generate new business through, prospecting, cold calling and partnership meetings."

good,ADP is like home away from home. Its a great place to work for all culture of people. ADP treats all associates equally to the management. ADP encourages talent and innovation
good,Company should focus more on development of exiting people rather than hiring from outside. The environment was great to start with but not anymore as company's focus and priority has changed
good,"Responsible for advanced configurations requests from clients by conducting an in depth analysis of the requirements and determine the appropriate course of action to fit the needs of the client."
good,"In the Year ending we have typical time, I have learned about Excel well advanced for having good management. Friendly workplace culture, sometimes we have to stretch beyond the shift timings and of course i enjoy each and every task will be enjoyable."

good,"It is good working qith adp."
good,they find multiple ways to keep you engaged. Promised commission is unlikely. work life balnce is great as you are never rewuired to work OT. Base salary for DM is set at 39k and is nonnegotiable and commission is not capped but 1k per month is to be expected if your on top of things.

good,"I have learned a lot from ADP and made some good lifetime connections within the company."

good,"My experience was good. It was a good place to work, except that the department was being restructured and no management at that time so it was a stressful time. But a lot of great benefits."
good,This is a great company to work from the training and job opportunities to the benefits and people that work there. I have been here nearly 2 years and would recommend it to anyone inerested in payroll. This is a great starting point for a career.
good,"ADP was a great place for me to start my sales career, Coming from a career in education, the sales training at ADP and mentor program helped me transition nicely and helped me succeed quickly."
good,"Each day, I ran that day's reports and completed them, answered co-worker's questions and updated information in the system.  The hardest part of the job was being given a new task and having little to no training.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to resolve a customer's issue."
good,not a bad place to work   changed over the years  outsourcing but people were good to work for   had recognition with awards when i went above and beyond
good,"Overall, the work environment was great and I had the opportunity to learn new things and challenge myself every day during my 18+ years at ADP. I also worked with many caring, smart, and dedicated professionals - many of whom I am still friends with. The only issue I had was that there was very limited growth potential beyond a certain point. In fact, I was one of 3000+ tenured associates who was in essence ""forced"" into accepting ""voluntary"" early retirement as part of the go-forward strategy for ADP required that they reduce payroll which meant that the 3000+ of us who left ""voluntarily"" were being replaced by young workers fresh out of college in most cases. So, although I realize it was not a personal decision on ADP's part to severe 300+ of us, it still meant that we were (sadly) shown the door (which obviously limited any future growth potential). Had this not occured, I would stayed under normal retirement age as I loved the company, the CEO (Carlos Rodriguez) and the many ADP associates across various departments company-wide that I had the good fortune to work with over the years."
good,Seguridad corporativa con altos estándares de trabajo

good,"Only after leaving ADP have I gained an appreciation for what it offered as an employer. In my experience, managers and leaders were interested in your professional and career development. I was not micro-managed. I was trusted to do the job and ask for help or guidance when needed. Benefits were pretty standard."
good,It’s is a great place to work. The company often held activities and monthly lunches to help boost moral within the workplace. Acknowledgement of employees were great. The company also offered great benefits.

good,"ADP was a good place to work. People were easy to get along with.  They wanted people who were willing to work and do it their way. They had rules in place to follow on phone calls, how to answer the phone and ask questions as to what the caller needed."
good,"Relationship based selling through various channels. Such as banks, CPA's, and existing clients."

good,Explore new technologies and understand the benefit of using those technologies for the growth of the organization. Like to take the challenges and provide the best solution.

good,"Good experience at the company, had lots of success and learned a lot. Great team and teamwork ; lots of exposure to HR, Payrolls and Benefit programs."
good,Demanding and rewarding. Strong training and internal support for success. Opportunity to work within different internal verticals. Best place in the world to work when above plan.
good,"The typical work day was great. The clients was the best ever. They showed me respect. Management always said thank you and pat you on the back for a great job. The hardest part of the job was the vendors. They would always switch vendors out the blue, I never got a chance to build a relationship with vendors. The best part of my job is that I had different things to do, never the same thing day in, day out."
good,ADP is a good pace to work.  They have good benefits.  They have to much communication.  Volumes of information sent to you daiyl.. Hard to keep up;Overall i enjoy working at ADP.  I am taking an early retirement from ADP.. That is why I am leaving.
good,"I worked for ADP for 13 years, and would have continued to work there a while longer. "
good,Great place to work.  Talented associates.  Diverse jobs.  Exceptional offices.  Centrally located.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people!  I highly recommend ADP as an employer.
good,ADP is a great place to get sales training right out of school. They have a great fun company culture but put a good deal of pressure on reps to preform week in and week out.
good,"Typical office job if you work in fulfillment of delivery. Customer service is more akin to a call center. Good people, but is either stressful or boring. No in between."
good,"A typical day was constant telephone contact with new clients assist with set up of employees on ADP's payroll processing system. At times the work  place could be hectic depending upon the number of clients assigned to the Implementation Specialists and the difficulty in getting the client up and running with processing payroll. I was able to learn more technical skills than I had prior to joining ADP. Work environment was very pleasant, we always found time to laugh."
good,There is a good work-life balance which makes work so much more enjoyable. Most enjoyable part of work is meeting the Clients needs and having them satisfied.
good,I was able to work independently and able to complete my required work each day.  I would come in each day and run reports for my sales teams and keep track of all sales throughout the day using Excel.  I would also assist the sales reps in completing Wizards which were payroll totals from a clients previous payroll provider.  I would complete roll call adjustments for the sales reps to correct commission errors.  I would take care of the monthly roll call decks to go over our success using Power Point.  Other clerical responsibilities upon request.  Unfortunately my position as a Sales Order Expeditor was eliminated as of 6/29/18 due to some of my manual reports being automated and I'm seeking employment once again.
good,"ADP has very nice work spaces in a semi quite environment."
good,ADP pushes its associates to succeed. The company provides training and resources at your fingertips to assist you in your role.  ADP rewards performance and accomplishments.
good,"It's a very large company and that took considerable time for me to acclimate in terms of meetings and lethargic decision-making processes but otherwise it's a very solid, stable company and the people (overall) are fantastic."
good,ADP accepts diversity and has a lot of people working their from Military backgrounds and families like my self. ADP is a very good company to work for.

good,"Every little thing about ADO is excellent."
good,"I can't complain, I had a long career but times are changing.  A Wall Street hedge fund guy is putting pressure on leadership for higher and higher profits.   Unclear where things will go in the future but still a great company."
good,"Great company to work for, really had no intentions of leaving but inherited a manager that just did not make life pleasant for anyone.  Lots of change, but depending on your personality that can be good or bad.  This is a company with great growth potential and offers solid benefits.  They are innovative and an industry leader but that also means being flexible and learning new things quickly. The work environment is fast paced and you will require the ability to solve problems , training is basic so this company is great for self-starters and people who do not need a great deal of hand holding.  Critical thinking is a must as well as the desire to provide the customer a great experience."
good,"Días laborales activos, mejore mis capacidades y perfil profesional, la gerencia es optima, la cultura laboral es buena, en términos generales el trabajo es ameno."
good,"I enjoy working at ADP, strong desire to make everyone happy with a good work / life balance.  I think they try too hard to accommodate millennials.  They sometimes can't see past getting everyone involved in the extra activities.... that the really strong skilled workers get overlooked and they end up leaving for a better job."
good,Many things to learn and if you are a fast learner its supper easy. Many people willing to help and many people just trying to make you fail. you must have thick skin because there are many roomers you have to ignore and work closely with other people
good,"ADP looks to compensate their employees fairly well. They make sure that training is top notch and the management breeds a culture of inclusion. "
good,The key to success is to find a role and division where you can do your best. Do not be afraid to take lateral positions as they can be the key to open the door for future moves.
good,I am an active employee and do not feel this appropriate at this time. Once I leave ADP and have another job elsewhere I will be happy to compete this
good,A typical worked day was spent in virtual meetings with team members across the country and sometimes from other countries and doing project work. I had great work-life balance and commute and that would've been enough were I not interested in career advancement. There were no opportunities for career advancement in the role that I was in.
good,"come ready to work"
good,Good workplace. Provides coffee and great food in cafeteria. The job is very informative and you learn a lot about different health care plans and how to communicate with different clients.
good,"Constant interaction with outside clients, requires lots of knowledge and patience. Plenty of room for advancement but competition for those positions is stiff.  Company offers the ability to grow in the organization."
good,"Overall a great place to work with some of the best benefits I've seen. "
good,My experience with ADP is very good. They invest time and energy with training and the benefits are good. My manager was very involved and the culture was excellent however there seemed to be some awkward situations regarding tenured reps getting to keep old relationships from previous territories and lack of clarity on territories.
good,"ADP is a good place to work. The company cares about its clients and employees by making changes to policies and procedures, and following through on actions needed to correct issues."
good,"Good place to work for women due to work life balance, Respectable environment & equal opportunity for people of color. Salary is not on par for colored women vs whites.Too hectic work life but opportunities for growth are many.Ideas are welcomed by mgt most of the time.People are fun to work with here."
good,"Good culture, good work-life balance. All thr They are a little tight with the wallet, though.  Your initial negotiated salary is what you will be stuck with unless you change roles."
good,"My coworkers were enjoyable and the manager was pretty understanding and easy-going, not to say he was a pushover."
good,"This company will all depend on who you work with. The salary for admin isn't the greatest but the work/life balance makes up for it. Competitive environment for the salesmen, but not for the admin support."
good,"ADP is a great company to work for, however, finding a work/life balance is dependent upon the department you work in. The client Support Account Manager role was recently implemented. I don't think it was well thoroughly thought out, as the AM's workload is extremely stressful. You have 41 assigned clients ( each client may have 15+ accounts within ADP in which you are responsible for managing all), in addition to your back ups 41 clients and random clients who get routed to you because they're unable to get through to their AM."
good,"I have no complaints about working at ADP. I worked there for over 20 years. Most people would find something to complain about after being laid off, I don't."
good,"They had a lot of employee-centered activities throughout year to motivate participation and involvement."

good,Great company with very nice people to work with! Limited advancement except if you can relocate. Working virtually requires a great deal of discipline and acceptance of having limited relationships.
good,"Great Place to work at. Great place to start your career in. Advancement is available, but you can get stuck in some areas of work. "
good,"I had the perfect job . . .  worked from home, manager treated me with respect and trusted my judgment on development efforts.  This is not so with many managers in this department. "
good,"Great company to work for. Great life balance for working moms. Supportive team work and understanding management teams. "
good,"There's a lot of room for advancement at ADP given that the company is located all over the world and has its hands in many areas of business.  "
good,A typical day at work in inside sales is dialing your face off to create enough opportunity to make your monthly quota. Lots of emails to be answered on a daily basis. You must be a hard worker in order to be successful in this position. A typical 8:30-5:00 shift probably isn't going to cut it if you want to make big bonus checks!
good,ADP is a wonderful place to work.  I have been with the company for over 15 years.  Management is great and the benefits are great. There are also plenty of opportunities and room for growth.
good,"If you're looking for a fast growing company and location, ADP will fit the mold and keep you busy with career development as well as a good culture fit for most."
good,Every day has a lot of work so you're not bored.  Great management that is willing to help. Must stay focused and be willing to learn new and evolving processes.
good,"ADP provides great opportunities to management interns to meet with leadership team, understand work culture and learn. They provide good training and equip interns to provide results in the short duration they are there."

good,Management is good at listening to your concerns. It is very team oriented and everyone supports each other and encourages each other. The office is usually very quiet as I work in the Sales Dept except when there are team meetings then it gets loud and fun.

good,"Adp is awesome place to work..it depends on how you take challenges..self growth is important."

good,very fast paced position.  lot's of travel and many states to cover.  can be very stressful.  it's technically a great place to work.  lots of jobs to choose from

good,"A great company to spend your valuable time with. Provides good work-life balance, great benefits, competitive salary, good management and other perks."
good,"I loved working at ADP. Unfortunately, my position was impacted by corporate location and I was laid off, They are closing offices across the United States, and opening and hiring new associates in 4 strategic locations."
good,The work is very challenging. It feels like everyday is always a new day. The job is not for people with a faint heart because each call should be dealt with differently. It is sometimes just answering simple questions to troubleshooting their payroll system.
good,"Great job to start a career in. The culture is great, and the management really seem to care about your development as a sales rep. Pay is competitive within it's industry, but still not as great as it should be. Promotions tend to be tied with success and connections within the company. So if you want to promote, network as fast as possible. This means doing things with co workers constantly after hours."
good,The day is a typical day and employees are allowed to get their work done without much interruptions.  The managers are very relax and understand the work life balance.
good,"It's a great experience to work with ADP."
good,"They let people pursue their passions"

good,Great company to work at opportunities for advancement and knowledge base learning along with working with internal and direct client contact.  I've learned a great deal as and employee of ADP over the years.
good,This job has a wonderful culture and training program.  Sales is not for everyone but I recommend everyone trying it once.  It truly gives you skills that is versatile in any industry.
good,I like to work with good team spirit. Like to take challenges and good with multitasking. Most enjoyable part of job when my hard work gets recognized
good,"Good company which very employee centric. People who are looking to make their career can look at ADP towards long term goals."
good,Accepted an entry level position just to get foot in the door. I later found I had to wait 12-18 months to transfer to a different role. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and people but I was only working part time and it was very far from home making it a time loss to commute. I enjoyed every moment of my experience at ADP just wish they would have been proactive to find me a more suitable role to compensate for my experience.
good,Great people and great product. Typical day consisted of working with partnering bankers and CPA's in order to find potential clients to sell ADP's products to. Cold Calling and Foot Prospecting.

good,"ADP est une société où il est bon d'y travailler. Les sujets de travail proposés dans le cadre de mon poste sont très souvent enrichissants. j'apprécie énormément le contexte international qui permet de découvrir les méthodes de travail et des cultures différentes."
good,"Everyday is an entirely brand new day to deal with the people around me but I can say that I do enjoy each day that passes by. I love interacting and communicating to people. It brings me a different kind of happiness knowing that I was able to satisfy someone with his / her request. Day in , day out I learn new things and new ways of making each interaction a lot better than it was yesterday. The management guides us in doing the right things and supports us as we make decisions. There are instances that the situation may be hard since there are requests that are really impossible to attain but with the right attitude and words it can be relayed to the clients which they would surely understand."
good,"ADP was a great place to work with good people and very flexible with work schedule and work from home opportunities."
good,This was a contract position.  They were installing a new WFM system and I was brought in to help them with the set up an development of that system.  The Workforce manager had an excellent grasp of the task that needed to be completed and how she wanted them done.
good,"For an older company, they are surprisingly comfortable with employees telecommuting.  I currently work full-time from home.  This makes for great work/life balance.  The size of the company (55,000 employees) can be both a blessing and a curse.  On one hand it should mean that there are many opportunities, but I've found that it can be isolating in that you can feel like everyone is in their own silos (though some of that could also be attributable to me working from home).  It can also be difficult to know what opportunities exist within the ADP universe.  I definitely enjoy the people I work with and have noticed that people tend to stay here once they start."
good,I really enjoyed working there it was hard to be laid off cause for 10yrs that company was all i know and the people made it even harder cause we became family

good,ADP has a somewhat laid back work atmosphere. You sit at a desk for 8+ hours and make phone calls all day. Your fellow co-workers are very understanding because they do the same thing. There is a lot of pressure in the sales aspect. Depending of what manger you get it is hit or miss.
good,"I learned in this job the multitasking to be able to meet the tight deadlines specially in task of forecasting."
good,"My typical day was to put out fires that may have been escalated by the client, employee or the payroll team. Assist with providing a resolution per the clients SLA. I truly enjoyed my job as a research analyst assisting our internal and external partners. ADP provides excellent training and leadership support for all co workers"
good,"I loved the job but had to leave because, the job was dangerous at times and the management refused to have two guards at a time and refused to allow us to keep a firearm or some form of protection on us due to not wanting to spend money. My supervisor was a helpful man and went out his way to look out for us due to this inconvenience by monitering on his off time to make sure no one sneaked on the property as well as kept checking on us to ensure we were safe and did not need anything. If they fixed those and a few other problems, I would honestly go back."
good,"It provides learning opportunities, with fun at work. the clients were very supportive, helpful and provided proper guidance."
good,"ADP was a great company to develop me into the strong sales person and manager I have become.  They helped me with amazing traning to realize my full potential and to exceed expectations i had set for myself."

good,It's hard work and right now everyone in the company is feeling overworked but the people are great- at least in the RI office! All about the numbers but the numbers aren't all that hard to meet. There are growing pains right now as the company changes it's focus from Payroll to Human Capital Management but if you can get in you'll get to stay and move around.
good,"I had an opportunity to interact with both World Vision staff drawn from the Region office and also the 25 countries in Africa where we were working. I also got an opportunity to work with the University of South Africa (UNISA) lecturers and heads of departments. We had good time learning from each other and coming up with suitable training curriculum for Program Managers and Development facilitators who were our target. I felt proud to witness evidence of impact of our training where the trained staff stood out in their  countries and got promoted to senior positions both within and outside World Visions. The hard part of the job was work life balance especially then as i had an under five years baby girl who needed my attention yet my job involved a lot of international travelling.  My manager and supervisor had passion to grow his staff. He coached me, mentored me and gave me challenging assignment.  The job opportunity molded me and prepared me to be the Program Quality Assurance Director i am today."

good,"Its a must to come to work about 15 minutes early to log into everything you will need for the day.  It is imperative to be logged in to the phones and be ready to start your shift at your scheduled time. Schedules are strictly adhered to.  Lunch times are assigned, however, break times are at your own discretion.  The people you work with are more like family than coworkers and are happy to help if you need it.  The hardest part of the job is the transition between calls, there isn't much time between calls and must be ready to ""switch gears"" in a heartbeat.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with coworkers, an amazing camaraderie.  Sharing thoughts and ideas with each other, and the eagerness to help one another."
good,"When I interviewed I was told the position would be, ""the hardest job you've ever had"".  I can say that was the truth. But it was extremely rewarding, and there was always so much to learn.  My role was heavily client facing. I was constantly interacting with other internal departments as well. Upper management is determined to make sure  that associates are focusing on the overall business objectives. Most of my co-workers were really helpful, but like anywhere there may always be 1 or 2 bad apples. The most difficult part of the job was managing the volume of work that needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was the reward of knowing that you made a difference to your clients. If you enjoy dealing with and interacting with clients and various personalities, and you have the willingness and capacity to learn in a constantly changing environment this is a great company in which you can build a career ."

good,There are many opportunities with ADP. It's a large company with facilities all over the country.
good,"The TotalSource division was a bit different from the rest of ADP. I wont exactly say we were the stepchild, but we were different for sure. The PEO sale is more delicate than the payroll sale and therefore, the type of people and business varied. We were looked down upon by those in SBS and Majors. With the political environment and the book of business in the medical arena inside TotalSource, it was just too much red tape inside the Big Red Machine to get work done and make money."
good,There are numerous opportunities within the company between Employer Services and Dealer Services. ADP offers a wealth of self paced training programs.
good,"Good place to work, diversified environment, lots of products and services, well balanced work/life , good benefits"

good,If you enjoying working with numbers then this is the perfect fit for you.
good,ADP TotalSource was a great company to work for. It was a sales environment and everyone worked very well as a team. The company had great benefits and took care of their people.

good,"Great place to work , management pushes each employee to grow in knowledge of ADP applications to enhance employees to move up within company structure."
good,"Very good experience during the interview process. Great facility with lots of amenities (on site Doctor, gym, cafeteria). Good culture and very accepting of all lifestyles, ""relaxed"" business casual dress code. There are some opportunities to move up but it takes much longer than communicated in interview process and some positions in upper management can leave the building and be filled in another city that has the same Business Unit. Also the pay depends if you work in Small Business Services or Major Accounts. You can have basically the same job function in SBS but considerably less than someone in Major accounts."
good,"Empresa com boa estrutura, oportunidades, localização boa, bom relacionamento com os colaboradores."
good,I loved working for AdP.  Many opportunities. Great management.   I only left because I moved out of state.  A lot od training to improve you in your poaition.
good,"Great Compensation and one of the best Benefits I have ever received. Its all about the department you work at that makes a real difference, I was personally in National Accounts which is one of the largest and the management did need improvement; always changing goals and ways to approach clients as risk. Experienced recycle of employees with new products and sales, however I know some other departments have better management and career advancement opportunities. Overall really good experience best advice I can provide is to make your goals clear on where you want to go with your manager and be proactive about your career advancement."

I enjoyed and am still grateful for the opportunity that I had to work there. The only down side to this was in this organization if you are good at something they like to keep you in those positions. The opportunity for advancement and movement within the company is touted as one of their strongest qualities and something that I was drawn to, however due to the restructuring of the mission statement and the recent release of most of the more seasoned workforce has left them without the requisite infrastructure to adequately advance those deserving. There were no exit plans for those that decided to retire early which would have helped the company retain it's intellectual property while allowing promotion of those that were just coming into the organization."

Come to find out, the reason I did not get the position had nothing to do with how my interview process went at all, but because of a manager's personal bias. The actual reason I was told I did not get an offer for the position was because I am ""social."" This was never brought up during any of the interviews or even to my attention until AFTER I was not extended the offer. Many fellow manager and ADP employees told us to network and that's exactly what I did.....and that was the reason I didn't get a permanent offer? Shady to say the least."

This company gave me the knowledge in the civilian sector I was missing in the Human Resources field after the military increasing my marketability."
good,"I enjoy working in a job that utilizes my writing skills and creativity. The people here are generally professional, supportive and fantastic to work with."
good,"It was a great place to work upon my employment there I learned several other jobs like operating a auto brazier machine, lacing, and building air-conditioning coils on a assembly line."

good,I was hired on a temp to perm basis.  The General Manager offered me the job after 2 months.  I enjoyed working for ADP and was challenged by the work.  This kept me interested and happy.
good,"Everyone I worked with was awesome from my managers to my peers. There were expectations to preform and exceed goals, but all achievable. a lot over communication over phone with clients, sometimes that have  been reached out to by 5+ different reps already."
good,"Enjoyed working at ADP.  "
good,Excellent organization and industry leader. A very good company to work at if you're serious about being successful. ADP's culture is oriented for people who are committed to doing what it takes to be a  consistent top-notch producer. You will be held accountable and have the support of excellent leadership to assist you as you pursue your goals.
good,ADP is a good place to work. I learned to answer incoming calls and resolve them in a timely manner. Management is knowledgeable of procedures and guidelines. The place is very comfortable and nice atmosphere. the hardest part of the job is getting a park in the parking lot.The enjoyable part of the job is getting the training needed to be the best customer service representative.
good,"Your job is always on the line. It is very competitive. The distribution of leads is unfair. On the upside it is salary plus commission so there is possibilty to make a very comfortable living. My salary was 32,000 plus commission. After commission I was making about $58,000."
good,"Hello Reader,"
good,"Work life balance"
good,"Really enjoyed being part of ADP R&D teams to deliver and support the platforms for financial & compliances processing services required to meet business and client needs."
good,I have actually worked here more than ten years.  Has gone downhill the past three years or so. No longer fun and it has become a very stressful environment for everyone from top down.
good,ADP is on of the best jobs I have ever had in terms of balancing work with fun.  The managers are all readily available to answer any questions you may have and any senior member on your team is always happy to help with any questions or concerns!
good,"excellent management teams, "
good,"Not a lot of room for independent thinking. Large company, very cutting edge for technology. Stiff competition, they encourage networking, but the qutoas are tough to reach."
good,"Working with ADP gives a pleasure, where we have N number of Opportunities and Challenges also there is a security for our Job."
good,"Being a part of ADP , you always make a family and home."
good,ADP has an awesome work/life balance but it truly depends on the manager.  The compensation and benefits are great.  However they have recently signed individuals up for more work without the increase in pay....this has greatly affected morale.
good,It's a great company. Has good work life balance. Fun loving environment. You'll never feel away from home when you're at work. Definitely a company to work for.
good,"Ramp up quotas are easy, but eventually the well runs dry and its a grind to keep building your pipeline, eventually the grind gets old unless you are in a very solid referring partnership."
good,"Great place to work, outstanding benefits and great culture - There's never a dull moment working in this firm as you are constantly engaged with the new and technical processes at the same time the company allows you to have a work-life balance. You are well compensated for the amount of work that you do and the company culture just makes you feel like you're just waking up to go to your second home. Great place to work at!"
good,"I worked here for nearly a decade and have few complaints.  I only left because I wanted to deal with something besides payroll software and other changes in life caused me to go a different direction."
good,"APD is Good company. As we can learn many thing over the years. "
good,"Worked with ADP for about 5 and a half years out of their Pittsburgh inside sales office. Its a massive company so can be slow to change and react sometimes but generally does right by their employees and clients. Provided very competitive base wages and benefits were pretty good, overall would recommend to anyone looking to start out in sales with a lot of options to grow into if you stick with it. Our particular office had some problems with management turnover for awhile but that seems to be getting better."
good,"Every day was visiting partners, clients and new prospects. "
good,ADP is a great company to work for. They really look out for you career development and reward hard work. There is unlimited room for growth in such a large company. And they focus on keeping an upbeat and involved culture.
good,Working for ADP for nine years was a great opportunity. I learned a great deal about working both independently and as a team to accomplish our goals. I enjoyed the relationships I built with my coworkers and clients and I very much enjoyed the work.
good,"This is a good company with nice compesations and very professional teams."
good,I was able to learn about the payroll process and learn their proprietary software and being able to assist and support users from the US and Puerto Rico.
good,"This is a good place to launch your career , with almost 90 out of fortune 100 and 80% of fortune 500 as clients ADP manages to provide a large scale experience in a short time."
good,I have a pretty typical day. I have a certain amount of time to do my work. I love my co workers. I have learned Microsoft and data entry. My most enjoyable part of my day is talking to my clients.
good,"I truly enjoy working at ADP. The culture is great. There are plenty of young people working here. The benefits are good; Health, PTO, and 401k match. "
good,"I worked with a fun and incredibly knowledgeable team of people that had worked for ADP for decades.   Working with the team was the best part of the job.  The only drawback to my position was the lack of training on important processes, which, in my opinion, did not adequately prepare me to support the clients I was assigned to support.  Having been a payroll processor for years, I was excited for the potential to learn all of the 'behind the scenes' functioning of ADP, but their one-month of training focused mainly on concepts I already understood.  For the remainder of my training, it seemed that ADP expected me to 'learn by trial and error'.  It was common for me to have to ask my experienced team members how they would solve the problem for a client, as ADP's extensive 'knowledge database' to which I had access never seemed to provide a solution.   Going to my more experienced team members would always provide me several completely different solutions, some adequate, some not, but would invariably interrupt THEIR incredibly overloaded work day.  I would have liked working for ADP more if I had been given a broader range of structured training."
good,"Good place to work.  Never boring day because,  there was always work to be done. Management was always communicating with employees."
good,"The best part of the ADP is the work culture and the people.. Very supportive and even the Management is very good. I have learned that i can work independently and if i really need any one's help then my people and my company is always with me.."
good,"I Enjoyed my time there but the lack of training i got in the department i started in was the only negative thing about it ."
good,"Great place to work and to build a career, I have learned a huge amount of insight as to how companies outsource their human resource needs and how helpful that is. The harder part of the job is towards the end of the quarter and the fiscal year where our clients and new clients are in need to use the expertise of ADP for filing purposes. The most enjoyable part of my job is the learning experience and the great atmosphere of employment."
good,"ADP Philipppines Inc. is a stable company."
good,"A typical day at ADP consisted of a training session followed by team huddles where we would go over our focus for the week. After team huddles we would go out into our territories and meet with prospects, clients, bankers and accountants with the goal of generating revenue. The most enjoyable part of the job is truly the company culture. A great group of people with a great atmosphere."
good,Long work days. Have to have a hungry mentality to last. lots of favoritism in this company. co-workers are clicky but its sales. enjoyable part of the job is if you work hard you'll see good money and results.
good,"ADP is  know for its best work culture , Management is supportive and friendly . Associate will surely experience home away from home at ADP."
good,"As a beginner, it gave a platform to build my career and this work experience has helped me personally and professionally."
good,"A lot of time is spent on the phones and navigating through a lot of different systems and information."
good,Good starter company. Great learning experience but pay is too low to live on. Quotas make it difficult to receive bonus due to a restricted market provided to you.
good,"I have always enjoyed working for ADP, the people are wonderful, the managers are great and the pay is the best as well as the benefits.  I regret having to relocate to NJ but for family reasons I had to do so."
good,This being my First job I am very excited to still be part of it.We learn everyday something new.We have lot of fun activities along with professional growth.
good,"I enjoy working at ADP, however the ambiguity involved with such a large company can be frustrated. I also enjoy my role and the professional interactions with those I work with closely."
good,"Ich habe hier die Arbeit als Teamleiter. "
good,Answer calls about employees health insurance. Writing notes on computer about what said to employee. Do 60 to 80 calls per day.
good,"Outside sales position managing current clients along with partnering with CPA's and Banks. I enjoy trhe flexibility and freedom with no micro managing. As a responsible adult I conduct myself to a higher standard and expect myself to succeed in any work environment. Not much interaction with co workers during the week, most my time is spent in the field."
good,"ADP is very good for any associate to work, its culture and employee life is awesome. Work life balance is satisified in ADP."
good,"The people I worked with were very good; the company adheres to excellent documentation ethics and a formal software development structure, with formal project specifications.  All stakeholders were on-site for meetings, etc., relative to the software development efforts being worked on (systems analysts, business analysts, programming staff, QA staff, business unit)."
good,"For me, a typical day at work would start at 7:00 EST where my first order of business would be to get organized and prioritize my tasks for the day.  I am a team player and likes to feel that I have made external, as well as, internal clients jobs a little bit easier.  I m very comfortable in a support position and take pride in everything that I do."
good,"I truly enjoyed my time with ADP as contract recruiter, I would highly recommend anyone looking to take their career to the next level to consider ACP"

good,Adp is a good starting company with an overall balance between work and home life.
good,"Employee-friendly management, paid sick and vacation leaves, retirement benefits"
good,"The management team allow you to work at your own pace and they allowed me to sorrower. I learned the ins and outs about working with clients and third party vendors in regards to retirement benefits: Health and Welfare, Defined Benefits, and Defined Contributions. I am thankful for the people I met at ADP."
good,"Recruiting is an important piece of hiring the right talent. We have such a wide variety of ways to search for candidates and are trained well through AIRS certifications. Cold calling and networking with individuals both passive and actively looking for opportunities, helps my team get a better understanding for the clients for whom we work. "
good,"ADP is the gateway for many payroll/hr opportunities. No two questions are ever the same. We handle tax inquiries, payroll inquiries, etc"
good,"the most changing job in this project is communication between team and random change requests. WFN ADP has 5 global teams in different countries, almost 300 people working on one project, 60 QA team working on project."
good,"Each day is challenge and treat. I cold call companies to identify potential prospects that need to migrate to Accounts Payables Automation and outsource their Business Payments.  "
good,"It s a great place work"
good,"•	Over eight years of Oracle Production DBA experience with ORACLE 11gR1, 11gR2,10g, 9i, 8i  on UNIX/Red Hat Linux/Sun Solaris/AIX "
good,"This job included lots of travel, but professional well trained team members met to strategize, promote and present solutions to clients in a well rehearsed manner. The hardest part of the job was the travel, but the most enjoyable was the benefits, vehicle and expense account."
good,Great experience gained in the insurance sales industry.  Fast paced and rewarding compensation
good,"I began at ADP in the Teledata/Data Entry department taking all aspects of payroll input for clients with employees in multiple states."
good,"I have gained several experieces at ADP. My experience encompasses strategic planning, resource utilization, retention efforts as well as associate development to name a few. All teams were very engaged and interactive with various departments."
good,"Used to complete my given assigment in given time,would take extra work to help my peer's complete their work too."
good,"Its indeed a second home to associate who work where you not only do your professional job but also you have a home like feeling accompanied by such wonderful people and the leadership team have a complete focus on associate comfort."
good,ADP is one of the fastest growing fortune 500 company with good projects and team support
good,"Agradável;"
good,ADP main moto is making enjoy of employees and I was enjoyed lot with my work and other things. Learnt lot of things at ADP to grow myself in the industry.
good,"9 AM start time, but there at 8:50 for short meeting on what is the goal for the day. Get equipment ready and wait on trucks to start delivering if you were receiving clerk. While waiting you are scanning items to be put away or sent to the shipping department. I learned how to perform inventory counts and properly inputting data, storage, receiving and shipping functions along with the usage of 4k sit down forklift. Management was short on workers so only one supervisor was on floor most of the time. Coworkers were great and we had a good bond. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with supply and demand due to lack of man power and equipment. What i enjoyed most of this job was the cohesiveness of the workers and how work was finished by the close of business no matter what.Everyone did their part and didn't slack off.Overall a good enjoyable place, but hard to move up and progress."
good,A great entry level company for people right out of college!
good,Great place to work with opportunities. Enjoyed my time here.
good,I have learnt so many things at ADP. I would say ADP has developed me in to thorough Proffessional.
good,"Structured work place. Learned an extensive amount about the high tech world of computer, networks, databases, operations and business. Management was mostly available for assistance when asked. Co-workers were always willing to assist if they could. The hardest part of my jobs at the company was the ever shifitng of priorities in any given situation, but that made the job more interesting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility to balance work and home."
good,Productive place yet fun to work with.
good,"ADP is not your typical 9-5 job. I typically get to the office at 7:30 to take care of a few administrative tasks and by about 8:00 I head to my territory. My day consists of appointments with clients and prospects as well as visits to my referral partners (banks, CPA's, ect). Throughout the day I will also make several cold calls to prospects to set new appointments for the following days. I learned a lot of information while working for ADP and to tell you the truth that was one of my favorite parts about the job. Information in the tax and HR world are always changing. Every week we have a new training to either teach us something that has changed or to teach us different ways to get in the door with a new prospect. My co-workers are great! Everyone that works with ADP is high energy and money motivated, just like me. To work for a sales company you have to be extremely personable and get along with everyone who makes it easy to fit in and get comfortable. The hardest part of the job is the fast pace and the constant drive by your managers to find your next deal. It is a constant battle to stay on top of your A game. There are several things I like about ADP but the culture and the people make everything that much more enjoyable and help you keep moving forward."
good,"If you want to learn how to be a successful sales person, work at ADP!"
good,I worked in the Print Production department; it was very exhausting at times but time went by fast and I enjoyed my work and had great coworkers. The company values their employees and the compensation is above average. I would definitely work here again.
good,ADP is a very good place to work with very good benefits and an open-door policy. This company really listens to their employees and ideas. Their new hire training is extensive and very well planned.
good,"Would recomend to anyone. Great management, with some hard work you can advance pretty quick."
good,"Likes"
good,They motivate you to work hard by paying well and giving you lots of trips. The first year is amazing if you do well. The second year is brutal. If you do well the first year your quota goes up so high you cant hit your goals. You stop getting to go on trips. Managers get on your case. If you miss your goal for a few months they fire you.
good,Good place to work. Committee to home. Very flexible if you need time off. Always the to help if you have questions. Comfortable environment enjoyed working there. It was a temp assignment
good,I really enjoyed working at ADP. They have a lot of good perks and they are a very stable and secure place to work. The culture is very easy going and I would consider working there again.
good,"It was one of the best companies I have ever had the chance to work with. Due to personal circumstances I had to let go of the job, but if It was up to me, I would go back to work in the company."
good,"i was working as a payroll specialist,for us client it really difficult and interesting to deal with different state taxes and deduction.but management support you and help you to make it easy."
good,"Flexible timings good hikes. A full range of payroll and HR solutions, from basic payroll to HR management, tax and compliance, outsourcing, HRIS and more."
good,"It was interesting and challenging work in the Tax Compliance area, but I was just on a temporary assignment for 3 months and the contract was not renewed."
good,Has a really great team culture and managers are there to help you throughout the day. Only con is that it takes a while to get promoted to a different role.
good,"I enjoyed working for ADP. It is a great environment, easy going and fun place to work. They also offer great benefits. They only bad thing I have to say is the waiting period to either change departments or apply for different position is too long of a waiting period."
good,ADP is a great place to work and start your Payroll career. There are a lot of perks that come with working with ADP both inside the company and outside.
good,"It was a pleasure to work in ADP. My manager and the team were very engaged and colaborative to reach our goals. "
good,"What I like most by working at ADP, when I come to work I know what I am required to do daily. I like that I am trained on my workflow that I am doing each day.  I like that it is family oriented and it's like a family within the team."
good,"The team is the single most important aspect, good team means productive work day without the stress. Always numerous new opportunities, growth potential."
good,"ADP’s biggest asset is its people and culture. The company is pushing forward to be a technology company and it’s an exciting time to work here. "
good,"If you enjoy a high-pressure job, you will enjoy this position. Great company culture and amazing coworkers. Expected to meet goals on a weekly and monthly basis, compensation is not worth the stress."
good,i had a great manager who enabled team to become their best.  Position provided opportunities to use skills.  Many opportunities to make make worthwhile contribution.
good,"At ADP, you are expected to be at your desk and ready to go at your start time with minimal unplanned absences.  The work is fast paced and challenging, but you are provided with all the tools, in terms of skill sets and technological capabilities, to make your production goals achievable.  Managers actively engage with employees to gain insight to the challenges of the job and implement changes to make the work easier and to better serve customers.  The work force is generally young and diverse, but older employees like myself are welcomed and allowed to compete on a level playing field. The hardest part of the job for me (as an older employee) was probably the constant change in processes ,procedures, and knowledge base, but that was also the most enjoyable, in that it is rewarding to overcome challenges and realize the benefit of your efforts."
good,"Incredible training programs that prepair you for any sales position. Great direct management, a lot of arguing between divisions and fighting over sales."
good,"Every business unit is different and there are many at ADP.  I feel that I started in the wrong one but I don't hate the company.  It's a relaxed environment with a relaxed dress code which makes work easier.  I was originally told that I wouldn't be working in a call center but this is exactly what this position is.  The buzz around the building is that other business units are less busy and therefore less demanding.  There are people that LOVE working here.  I left a higher paying job hoping for quick advancement to make up for it but they are very strict with the 12 month waiting period though this BU holds hard to 18 if you are looking outside of the business unit for a promotion.  I have a Masters degree and make within a couple dollars of others without any college education.  Though I haven't been able to move up, I  have witnessed others be able to and love their move.  Networking and building your individual brand is very important here if you want to move up as well."
good,"Good place to learn. You can learn new technologies."
good,Work is exciting but their is to much work and no employees to complete the work. Has a nice cafeteria. Had onsite doctor. Not a lot of options for advancement.
good,"My role at ADP offers a great deal of flexibility and autonomy. Management is very understanding of employees having family needs and requirements and as long as you get your job done they let you be flexible with how and when you do it. Benefits are pretty good and parental leave is great, but compensation isn't quite comparable with the area and ADP should look into more frequent cost of living evaluations and adjustments. Additionally, there are limits on how much of a rate increase you can earn with a promotion which can further pay inequity if someone wasn't paid at the same level as their non-minority colleagues upon first starting at ADP."
good,"Rythme de travail soutenu"
good,"Entreprise stable"
good,Bonne expérience professionnel. M'a permis d'améliorer mon anglais scolaire.
good,Typical day involves client meetings (sometimes several a day) as well as actively working on client issues. The culture and management structure is enjoyable and structured. The hardest part of the job was finding the time to troubleshoot client issues and balance it with client meetings to advise them on our progress. Meetings would take a disproportionately longer time to complete.
good,I really enjoyed my time at ADP. Had the opportunity to expand my scope of responsibility which included learning new products and services. I built some great relationships with my peers and had the opportunity to work on several transformational projects. I would consider working for ADP again in the future and would recommend people to the company.
good,"collection calls, advertising calls, prepare taxes, verify and solve issues with irs. i learned how to deal with clients, social settings, i was the owner. Hardest part of the job is when the client didnt get refund as expected date"
good,I enjoyed working for ADP. It is a stressful environment but loved the culture. ADP compensates their employees very well.  Ability to win different trips throughout the year and nice sales contests.
good,"Launched my career and helped me learn the basics. A ton of job security and great people around you. Sometimes I wish I never left. "
good,"Even though ADP is a large, global company, they make you feel like a part of a greater goal. Employee benefits, training, work/life balance is the best I've had. Management wants to see their employees succeed which is very motivating to do your best."
good,Managers showed interest in your personal growth. There is alot of room for growth. The networking opportunities are endless. Team building activities.
good,I worked at ADP for 20 years.  I had a great experience working there.  My role was eliminated hence why I left.  I was very fortunate to have a wonderful boss.  My opinion mattered and were open to my ideas.  I was able to grow within the company over the years.
good,A great place to work if you like to work outside of the office. Normally Monday and Friday your are in the office calling and generating leads. Tuesday thru Thursday you are out prospecting and talking to business owners about ADP and how they can benefit from the services that ADP has to offer
good,You feel like you are working for your own organisation by the kind of work environment ADP provides. I have recommended a lot of people to work in ADP and would continue to do so further.
good,Working at ADP was really great. The people are nice and welcoming. Management is excellent they are a bunch of great people. I will really miss working with them.
good,"ADP is a fast-paced environment in which someone is always learning new things. Since it is fast-past, it can be really stressful because there are so many things to keep track of during the day. Client service and team collaboration are key to working for ADP. Overall the culture can be very enjoyable as the people are friendly and helpful."
good,"ADP offers a good stable working environment, with learning opportunities and great benefits. Job related course tuition reimbursement is available and in addition to yearly reviews; you can receive additional pay increases for certifications."
good,It was a pleasure working within the Corporate HRBP Department.  I was able to acquire the necessary fundamentals of Payroll/HR in order to successfully complete my daily tasks.
good,"Great organization, no qualms with working at ADP except it doesn't seem possible to escape the call center/sales roles once you're inside. Perfect place for self development to gather the tools and skills necessary to truly succeed elsewhere."
good,Bonne équipe et bon DRH. Entreprise concernée par le handicap
good,"Great opportunities for advancement, if you are committed to your career.  It is a busy work day, but great support from management.  401k, healthcare benefits start immediately."
good,"tenho orgulho em ter feito parte tantos anos desta empresa, pude me desenvolver profissionalmente e com muito espaço para aprender."
good,"I have started my career in ADP and a wonderful experience through out my 9 years career in ADP."
good,My role as a DM was to cold call ADP clients in an effort to educate about retirement services offered through payroll with the end goal of closing new package sales. The job is simple; call as many people as you can and close as much business and you can. The hours are very reasonable and with benefits and things like a ping pong table it is a low stress job as a whole. Personalities aren't always suited for the role so be aware of what you're going to be doing in the role. IF you don't like being on the phone this would not be the job for you and that will limit your success.
good,ADP is an ever expanding company that offers opportunity for employees to advance within the company but not within the department. Training is excellent and there is support for employees struggling to complete their job duties.
good,"Its  a very stressful and fast paced ADP challenges you teamwork is amazing and all training is beyond measure also you are encouraged too advance and learning all you can about ADP and products they offer to clients."
good,I loved the job. It was only repetition. I only left because it interfered with my school hours. My job was lacing. We only had a twenty minute break in between eight hours.
good,"Great way to begin a sales career and learn valuable lessons and master sales techniques. Low base with limited earning potential. Can get lucky in the first year, but typically 2nd year is when true potential in the position is achieved."
good,"IF you work for ADP you will learn some life skills.I loved working at ADP.The management is very approachable.Good PTO. "
good,"Low pay for inside sales, but good work/life balance. It depends on your department and manager whether or not you are micro managed. Decent benefits."
good,The culture here is amazing!  Management is good.  A typical day at work is come in and do your job but there are some positions that allow you to do extra things that you are passionate about.
good,"Excellent Company to work for, great benefits, great work culture, flexible on schedules, ADP prides on taking care of their employees and they live up to that promise"
good,"Great pay and benefits. No micromanaging."
good,"Stressful, constant change, sales has no accountability, everything falls on the back-end to fix. Not paid or valued the way you should be. "
good,Excellent training & culture. Management sets you up to be successful. As in most sales jobs quota's continue to rise year over year. Overall I had a very positive experience.
good,"Work/Life Balance"
good,"Contact my leader to find what is forecasted for the day. Perform any required duties without being asked. Take charge to be responsible for the company.  Always learning new tasks weather it be new software programs or taking online courses to build your career or reading books for self enrichment.  Management cares about you as an associate and will step in promptly to help when needed."
good,"Great company to experience, has tremendous potential but face the same challenges as any old company who's been there for 50+ years."
good,The company is great but there is not much culture here. The pace is a bit slower but the people here really make the place. If you want something that is fast pace like a huge tech company then you may want to look else where
good,ADP is great with promotions and job growth. ADP Promotes continued education and compensates accordingly. Work life balance is wonderful when eligible to work from home.
good,"The company has been so accommodating and feels like a family at times. Great work life balance, as I now have the option to work from home or in the office."
good,"Great Place for Payroll Experience "
good,"Very good company. Excellent benefits and good hours. The training program that they had was extensive.  There was a lot of product knowledge and they heavily stress their process.  I feel the that the training took to long and could have been done in half the time,"
good,"By far the most fun company to work for! You are given the tools to basically run your own company through ADP. The more you work the more you sell, the more you sell, the more money you make. The job is what you make it!"
good,"Strong Salary, great hours, strong position in industry"
good,"As an ADP district manager I worked with small and mid sized businesses to streamline their HR processes, lower employee turnover, and reduce business liability."
good,"Trabalhar na ADP foi maravilhoso, la aprendi muitas coisa, cresci muito como profissional. So tenho a agradecer a empresa ADP"
good,"Great flexibility to work remote in some roles. Management was really enjoyable to work with. Large company. Some divisions had some managers that was more political to navigate through. If in the right group, this is a great place for an HR career."
good,ADP is a great company to work for that offers great benefits.  The job can be stressful at times but very satisfying.  Management and coworkers are very encouraging and helpful in your career with ADP.
good,Leadership have a fabulous vision leading ADP Total Absence Management into the future with enhanced intuitive client-facing products.
good,"This company believed in rewarding you for your success in attendance, work ethics and customer commendations."
good,"My experience here was exceptional. Having being my first duty station, I was able to learn much about the ADP side of being a military IT and of operating and supervising a message center."
good,"The best thing about ADP is the constant competition and drive to overcome any sales impediment.  It is a company that directly rewards achievement and places focus on merit above all else."
good,"40 hour weeks, can be busy at certain times of the year.  All of the managers that I worked with were great, although there are some in the company that aren't so great.  Competitive salary and benefits.  Over 50,000 employees so it's easy to get lost in the shuffle and communication if difficult because of the sheer number of associates."
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed my years at ADP.  I am now looking for possibly fewer hours and a somewhat flexible schedule.
good,Awesome place to work! Good benefits. Lots of advancement within the company. Great networking opportunities
good,The process is well-streamline and well developed. There  is always help for growth either personally and professionally.
good,"Everyday I go into work and log in to my phone and immediately start taking calls. I have learned a lot about insurance policies during my employment with ADP. My management team stays hidden for the most part, but they are there when you need something from them. My coworkers are very friendly and all love to help each other out if questions are asked. The hardest part of my jobs would be changing the SR owners, considering our computers are fairly slow and it takes a while and causes dead air on calls. The most enjoyable part of my day is when I get a caller who compliments my service. It really gives me a boost and lets me know that I am doing a great job."
good,I liked that ADP stood behind there word to there customers and there employees. I learned a LOT from ADP and would like very much to return to them one day.
good,I get to work from home. It is a casual way to work and the benefits of working from home is awesome.
good,"ADP is  Excellent company to work. it is very cultural orientedcompany. job security, each person counts."
good,I have been working in ADP for past 2yrs as senior member technical. with incident management team and coordinating with the support level team to resolve the incident. 
good,"night shifts"
good,Making phone calls to prospects or partners and setting appointments. Meeting with business owners daily and selling them our array of services. Meeting with current clients and up selling them. Meeting with banks and accounting partners for referrals.
good,Productive and fun place to work. Excellent coworkers.. Great job
good,Many smart people. Lots of empowerment. access to management made easy. learned a lot about dealing with internal politics. learned the ropes of direct marketing and client services
good,At the BC Center of Excellence we have a wonderful culture of support not only through professional means. Everyone genuinely cares about their coworkers.
good,It's a wonderful place to work and every employee is given equal opportunities. Management is very supportive and the workplace culture is just amazing
good,I made a lot of friends and connections. Enjoyed working there for the most part. Can be stressful and they will ask for a lot of overtime. Black out dates during holidays suck. There can be a lot of corporate politics.
good,It was a very good experience working at ADP. Management is really good. Work is divided and planned very well. Work place is also very good. Cab facilities are there for everyone.
good,Great place for women to balance work n home. Get paid fairly for work. No much perks but yes a lot of activities all throughout the year to enjoy work too.
good,This was a great first job out of college.  I had great managers that really invested their time in me. Customer service was lacking at the time.  I have heard they have worked on fixing that since.
good,"Great company to work at!"
good,If you prove yourself in Small Business Services advancement is up to you. Usually after a year of proven sales you can transfer to another department or business unit.
good,The best employee centric company its amazing to work with ADP with an awesome work culture and great I would reecommened everyone to work with adp and its an amazing brand
good,"It was nice working at ADP."
good,"Worked for the company for over 10years. Had to leave as I was laid off. Awesome company to work for. Different departments, felt as though I was part of the team."
good,The employees and everyone are enjoyable and very inviting. They are helpful when they are able. Some days are fast passes and some days are slow. They are willing to try and help work with you.
good,"Work life balance is something ADP is known for.  I was a remote/homeshored employee, I missed the day to day collaberation of working with coworkers."
good,Its a very nice place to work at. People are friendly nice courteous. You will a diffrent boss based on your project there. Not cut throat but very real. If you think thats cut throat. 2 each us own. I love the realness a s just the company ADP IS AWSOME
good,"Was an Configuration Analyst.  . During the last economic boom, business was great. Lots of customers coming in, too much for our team to handle. Didn't add head count fast enough to cover the workload. Went from an 8 hour day to 12 hours just to keep your head above water. Less resources, yet 2x the workload. Awesome idea. People resigning left and right, some transferred to corporate division, newhires going back to their previous job within 3 months of being hired at ADP. All during an economic boom when money is pouring in."
good,The 8 hour shift would fly by with not enough time in a day.  Between office events and time allotted to complete back log while off the phone was minimal.  The most enjoyable part of my day was meeting the client's expectation.  The hardest part of the day was needing more 30 minutes to resolve and complete escalations along w/back log.
good,Productive and fun workplace where employees are valued. There are great opportunities for career advancement also. It's a great company to work for. I am also reapplying for employment with ADP.
good,"Work hard and play hard is the motto here.  Full of young, alpha characters, yet not cut throat at all since everyone has their own sales territory.  Everyone pushes eachother to do better and succeed"
good,"Overall ADP is a very excellent company to work at. Fast paced, fun. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and improvement, however, the location I worked at was outdated & lacked amenities ."
good,I did not like the repetitive sales meetings and aspect of begging and harassing our partner channels for deals. It was a great experience but I wish to indulge in higher level sales with a different product. I wanted to work towards my future.e
good,"It's an awesome company to work with. Provides and promotes multi directional growth."
good,"Only worked there for a short time, not a bad place to work. Very good culture and support. I worked in sales and there was a lot of motivation and room for promotion."
good,"Great Management, Great culture, work life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job. great Security . Its been 6 yrs 6 months working with ADP. Proud to say that."
good,"Sales company that knows what they are doing when it comes to sales training. Great entry level position to get some real hard knock sales experience. You will knock on doors, you will cold call, you will be told no a lot."
good,The culture at ADP is great in Tucson. They have a very young and hungry culture that takes the approach with sales that is unlike many other companies.
good,"ADP is great for work/life balance. You set your schedule, it is your responsibility to set appointments and actually show up to them. It is also your responsibility to stay on top of latest industry changes. Co-workers are all pretty outgoing, overall great morale, and management keeps open door policy for the most part. Rewards include commission, company trips,and events including dinners and happy hours. There is A LOT of autonomy, so if you're not a self starter or self motivated, it is not for you. Also if in small business division, the role is a hunter role. You will be cold calling, and prospecting door to door. There are partners you can work with for referrals such as business bankers and insurance brokers, but you really won't make money if most of your leads aren't self-generated."
good,"I get in and answer all voicemails and e-mails I was unable to respond to the night prior.  Following that I would plan what businesses/ Banks, Accountants I wanted to go to as well as what information/ topics I wanted to provide them with.  This is in order to either generate or close sales.  The hardest part of the job creating your own leads, however through effective relationship building the opportunities begin opening more frequently.  This is accomplished though a close knit group of co-workers as well as support from management throughout the process.  The most enjoyable aspect of this position is the ability to input effective solutions and see how beneficial they can be to the business."
good,The possibility of being a temporary working for over a year doesn't encourage temporary workers. Temporary workers that had been there for a year were training temporary workers that had been there for a couple of weeks. It just didn't help morale.
good,"enjoy working here most employers can have a laugh fun place to work."
good,"Awesome place to work, but not the best place for freshers."
good,"ADP overall is a great company to work in. It gave me knowledge and the ability to learn to work in groups and with both internal and external clients. Its a leading Payroll and HR company where you feel like its a second home.  I have made my best friends working for the past 8 years in ADP."
good,"A typical day at work included a collaboration of management and coworkers to ensure any new procedural updates were communicated to all across the board. "
good,"This is a great place to be if one is looking for a good work-life balance, flexible hours and decent pay."
good,"•	Responsible for selling HR solutions, such as payroll and health benefits administration, human resource compliance, retirement planning and worker's compensation insurance, within a designated geographic territory to small and medium sized businesses through direct marketing campaigns and executive consultations."
good,"ADP is a great place to work. We enjoy coming to work everyday."
good,Fantastic place to work. Compensation is a function of effort put in to work.
good,"A typical day at work was a constant flow of inbound and outbound customer calls.  I learned a lot about  mastering these calls effectively and efficiently in a complex, fast paced and challenging call center environment.  My co-workers and myself worked very well together as a team.  The hardest part of the job was at year end and when management would surprise us with new things and we would be ill prepared but because we were such a strong team we would always pull through and become a stronger team.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the team I worked with, clients I also made relationships with and I miss all of them greatly."
good,Every day is need learning and challenging as well..Adp is a very good and stable company.
good,Managing each assigned client projects.  Managing the project team both internal and external for the project. Setting up several conference calls/webinars both daily and weekly to ensure a successful project execution. I enjoyed bringing the calm to the storm.
good,There is a lot of scope to learn and explore new things. I personally was benefitted by the up to date methods of technology that is used there.
good,ADP was the best and most enjoyable job i ever had. What a great group of people to work with and for. I would recommend ADP to everyone!
good,"I was a long term associate at ADP. I worked with many different people in many departments. We all worked together to accomplish the same goals. My co-workers were all friendly towards each other, which made for a good environment. I was part of the management team and we all worked closely together and respected each other. The hardest part of the job was making our constant deadlines every day. The deadline times were very tight, and occasionally changed. The enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers. We all got along so well and worked together so well."
good,"ADP was actually a really great stepping stone for me. I knew there would be no opportunity to move up unless I moved, but regardless, it was a great company to learn from. I definitely learned how to cold call, knock on doors, network, and build relationships with this company. They made you work hard but rewarded you when you performed well. My only complaint was that there was a lot of work outside of work (lots of late evenings) on very small miscellaneous items. We would have to put together excel spreadsheets that would take hours to compile, and all of the information would already be in the order that we completed - however, it made the implementation team have less work. In other regions this was not a requirement, so it was something that the NW had adapted unfortunately and it just never ended. So the ADP District Managers work very hard for the sales, from beginning to end. I would say that there could definitely be a better process so that the sales rep does not have to do so much legwork after the initial sale. The compensation was definitely not as competitive as other companies as well. The most enjoyable part of being with ADP was meeting all the wonderful co-workers, managers, accountants, bankers, etc. You definitely learn to leverage your relationships with your business partners in order to gain respect and gain business."
good,Outstanding management team who really know how to treat their employees with respect.
good,"Awesome benefits, professional working environment. Everyone is working towards the same goal. Work/life balance for those who decide to take time off but you almost don't want to cause you'll miss out on all the fun."
good,"One of the best company for women associates with best management and great work environment."
good,"Provided support to the Vice President, Senior Staff in Nationals, Solution Center and Implementation Department with a total of 200 members.  Was promoted to Administrative Assistant II. Completed Tax Service projects as well"
good,"Work schedule is relatively flexible, good sales training, highly sales driven organization. Good benefits and incentives to sell more. Highly competitive and high pressure sales environment."
good,Management showed interest in professional development and provided feedback. Positive and challenging environment. Overall a good company with excellent benefits.
good,Great company with great benefits and pay structure. It is a difficult job procuring new accounts and cold-calling. You will deal with a lot of rejection. Must have tough skin to make it in this job.
good,"Great team and atmosphere with a great work life balance! Great training and on boarding with lots of people ready to help, train and mentor. Would be open to going back and highly recommend the experience."
good,"-No one day is the same. You will work on multiple projects simultaneously. To excel at ADP you must be organized and be able managed multiple projects."
good,"Everyday at work is a new learning."
good,"Call centers have strong metrics to meet. They are wait time focused on one call resolution. The building has a gym, café, doctor on site and provides large break areas."
good,"Received Best performace award from TATA Consultancy Services and Super WOW award from ADP Pvt Ltd (which is my present company)."
good,Job life/life balance is the best you can find. You are responsible for hitting your goals/quota and if you are able to do this you have as much freedom as any job will allow.  Management is great!
good,"real simple easy work environment.everyone is friendly and that calls yeah their would be a lot of them it was easy work,"
good,Nice place to work just looking for the change for the better carreer opportunities.
good,Assisting Federal employees in managing their Flexible Spending Accounts. Friendly co-workers and hard working staff. Plenty overtime available upon request.
good,I worked with a great group of people the place was very motivational. I learned so much from so many people at ADP. ADP is huge but everyone knows your name and although it is a corporation it felt like family.
good,"Good Support from management "
good,"This job is good but salary is very less."
good,"I enjoyed my sales team and management staff very much. My job consisted of prospecting a geographic territory for potential clients and handling all steps of the sales process once access was gained. The hardest part of the job is consistently keeping your pipeline of prospects full due to the long sales process and difficulty of the sale. The most enjoyable part was the freedom of ""running your own business"" and the lack of micro-managing."
good,People were very pleasant. I was able to travel around the world and meet new people. I would do webinars and power point presentations. I had national and international clients.
good,ADP is a great company to work for. The opportunities for advancement are endless!!!!! I would recommend anyone to apply for  job at this company. The benefits are great. The pay is great and the environment is wonderful. Overall its just a great place to work.
good,Extremely hard work to be successful here but you will be properly compensated and recognized for success.  Outstanding sales training
good,There is a clear goal for the organization. Very supportive community with lots of great resources for sales people. Training is top of its class.
good,• Customer Service Representative
good,Great work expierence and professional enviroment. Leadership from managment was helpful in my growth at ADP.
good,"I would love to have an opportunity to work for this company"
good,The balance between work to family life is very poor.  Management constantly changed procedures and the lack of management to support was extremely poor in the Billing/AR department.  Unnecessary overtime.
good,"I started out as a contractor here and wish a position had been open as a full time role in that area. The department I moved to is a hugely different environment and I would NOT recommend it. Management is bait and switch - they will milk you for all that you do (including additional projects, going above and beyond your normal workflow), and will say you're getting a promotion, and then it never comes into fruition."
good,"promotion will not get soon & we have write exam which it is so difficult."
good,"I loved what I did on a daily basis but, the transportation for me was unreliable and there was some miscommunication about the hours I would work."
good,Very good workplace and very good facilities. They have proper venues for proper events. They provide great training for payroll. Trainers flew from the US and are very knowledgeable.
good,"great place to grow and develop if your desire, great benefits, high stress and demanding job, most colleagues on edge no room for error, learned the basics of payroll"
good,"ADP was definitely the top in their training efforts! I cannot begin to describe how much I learned, and in such a short period of time, at this company. They did a great job of providing ALL of the tools that you need to succeed!"
good,"Overall it was a geat place to work , but alot of how you move up in the company or whether or not you keep your job is based on favoritism instead of job performance."
good,Love and miss everyone I worked with. My company genuinely cares about the people who use our services and the staff who work hard to achieve great care and want the best experience for both.
good,"There are truly many benefits for working at ADP. It's name carries value in your resume and this company its a well oiled machine - no doubt. However; it's quotas are unrealistic and often you find employees complaining about how long they've lasted in their position. Although there are people that have been here for a long time, this is not the norm. "
good,Not enough pay for the time you put in.  Great opp for advancement and career.  Promotions are internal which makes for good management (most of the time).
good,"A great company, great place to work. Various levels of support each with their own informative information to add to your current level of experience and learning."
good,I worked with the staff at ADP. Some of the time was great. Some was not. Being an outsider I was not included in too many things.
good,Changed jobs to benefit myself and enhance my career. There was no advancement available.
good,"Processo seletivo acurado, mas longo. Salario pago não foi o esperado, ainda mais para alguém que já havia trabalhado la e sabia quanto a primeira equipe entrou, a qual fazia parte, ganhava. Então foi bastante frustante na segunda vez que entrei receber um salário 30% menos que quando havia saido. Fiquei 1 ano atendendo clientes grandes (Implantação da Unilever) e mesmo assim não houve movimentação para ajustar a minha taxa. Quando avisei que iria sair, o meu gerente resolveu fazer uma contra proposta. Infelizmente ja havia me comprometido com a outra empresa e fora que foram vario pedidos para que meu salario fosse revisto. Enfim, fui embora e o antigo gerente fala mal de mim até hoje como se eu fosse o culpado o empregado ingrato!"
good,"Demanding work, tight schedules, 24x7 work environment.  I was home-shored in California working with a team based in Arizona.  No comment on working environment."
good,ADP was an awesome organization to work for they did phenomenal in training their new hires and an excellent job and onboarding new employees. This company oftentimes gets a bad rap because it has a lackluster recruiting department there for recruiting employees that should otherwise be weeded out
good,ADP as a company is the best with a great package and with great work culture however coming to process its too much of work pressure and lots of tensions in the present role.
good,Dommage qu'il n y avais pas de bon manager pour prendre les nouveau en charge...!
good,ADP is a great company to work for and there is always a wealth of opportunity for those who have the energy and the passion to pursue it.  I worked for ADP for 18 years and I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,The work environment allow you work independently that will bring out your best of you and  to access all situation based on the product you handles. Allow you to do alot of training to better expand you knowledge and learned other area with the company. This company keep changes the system to better provide service with the clients.

good,ADP is a huge supporter of it's associates. They invest in your training so you are prepared for the job. Plus there is always support for any questions you may have after training. There are always opportunities to grow into as well.
good,"I was on graveyard shift as we are following US time. We do US payrolls, hr and explained clients about their taxes. Happy environment is always a must with my previous company."
good,The culture when I left ADP was very less concerned about certain gourds of people. When you had a great amount of experience with no degree they down sized to pay degreed employee less money. It was very stressful and less concerned about family balance. The black out period was more of a concern to them. All of the employees in the department I worked in they have released and they have had to find another job.
good,"J'ai eu a faire un stage de 5 semaines durant lesquelles nous avons pu mettre en pratique, ce que nous avions vu en formation. J'ai côtoyé une équipe agréable à laquelle j'ai pu poser des questions et qui venait compléter mon savoir dans le domaine de la paie et RH."
good,El trabajo era bueno sin embargo no me resulto lo suficientemente retador o no me gusto que no había tantos problemas complejos para resolver.
good,"Productive fun place to work and use my technical skills. Busy responding to client emails, and collaborated with other business units. Stayed busy on phone calls with executive committee members of 401(k) plans."
good,Great environment with helpful management that encourages a culture of hardwork but fun doing it. Lots of opportunity to move around within the company.

good,ADP is well manage and provide services to their clients very professionally. The management is very professional and cooperative. There is a huge opportunity to learn payroll. They always update for  any development required  such as  legislation change.  Very friendly environment and I enjoyed working at ADP.
good,"It is fun to work with ADP as it makes you grow to your full potential. The management is always there to give you support as well as your colleagues. This is where I learned a great deal of teamwork. Everyone's effort is well recognized. In every task, we keep in mind that every detail counts and contributes to the company's success or downfall. Also, there is always a room for improvement and guidance to every learning curve."
good,ADP has great management and really values their employee. They are open to employees who would also want to grow. I love the culture. Fun place to work in.

good,Superiors are understanding and they take good care of their people. They also offer great benefits compared to your typical call centers. Office environment. They offer free food during busy hours.

good,The management is very good and they make sure their employees are satisfied.
good,ADP is a great company to work for. There is always room for advancement and opportunities for growth.  Besides the standard benefits that are available they also will help with certifications within the industry.

good,ADP is a beautiful place and we worked on multiple country payrolls ;great place great culture great people great environment. Pay is bit low compared to market
good,Working for ADP was a pleasure and I was there for 14 years.   They take care of their employees and treat them like family.  Many times would even buy lunch especially of the call volume was higher on that day.  The hardest part of the job are escalations but as long as the client knows you are going to take care of them is a breeze.  The most enjoyable part is giving the client world class service that they deserve and expect.  Going above and beyond for the client to actually hear a smile on their face.
good,"Good exposure, Team work, Freedom to take self decision on product/process development. "
good,Love going to the office to see my coworkers and contribute to our client's success. They offer great benefits and I enjoyed the work life balance this job allowed me.

good,Empresa boa de se trabalhar com pessoas qualificadas
good,Everyone was friendly but also very focused and ready to work. Long days but good pay. Also hard on body if you're injured as you have to stand all day.
good,I do not wish to continue a sales job. I want to expand my career. ADP was a great place to get a foot in the door. I do not wish to go into management there.

good,"ADP gives companies of every size the tools to help their people thrive.  From payroll, benefits and regulatory compliance to talent management and analytics, ADP helps clients succeed. As one of the world’s largest and most experienced HR providers, ADP offers recruit-to-retire services and solutions that help build the team for now and the future."
good,ADP RPO is a great company to work for if you have a Bachelor's Degree or higher. I am a temporary/contract worker for this company and I am not able to advance in the company since my highest completed education is an Associate Degree. I love the environment with the company and all of my Managers and team members. My typical work day is reviewing applications and conducting phone interviews for 4 separate clients. What I have learned with this company is how to fluidly work in between 3 screens. I highly recommend this position to anyone that has a Bachelor's Degree or higher.
good,"this was a fun place to work, I started in the mail room and ended in the computer room running 2 large IBM mainframes, the company promoted from withing, but there was no growth in my division."

good,this job was just a temporary position . so I really have not much to say about this position . the company seems like a nice place to work for . one day I might reapply
good,Good people and great manager. Was a great experience. Great shift with a cafeteria on site. Close to movie theater and food amenities for those looking to eat on their lunches.
good,Great working environment and great company to work for.  They offer great incentives (stock purchase plan) and advancement in the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to travel and train new employees
good,Overall I was no please working with this company. They have a quick turnover mentality and are not prepared to train individuals to meet their target goals.
good,ADP is a employee friendly company whose main motto is to take care of its employees.I can say that i am lucky to have best team and best manager which helped me to learn lot of things about Planning and Analysis.

For example, we have some seasoned techs at my job who are fluent in Fortran and know what an AS400 is. Unfortunately, in the days for SQL, Java, and HTML5, most old time technology went the way of the typewriter or more recent the desktop computer. Keeping above the curve is and will always be a challenge but understanding technology and the client's needs always helps to move the right direction."

good,"Workpalce culture is good"
good,"HR and Payroll experience"
good,The learning experience is extremely motivating because you will learn while you participate in client experience activities.

good,"My team was responsible to pulling the clients enrollments into our system and supporting electronic enrollment files to insurance carriers."
good,A typical day at work was data entry. Data entry was about production and getting the workout with speed and accuracy. We got paid according to our ability to get the work completed and with accuracy. I was then promoted to Assistant Supervisor and it was my responsibility to close down the system each night and work with the computer room to make all data was secured. I learned be accurate was very important and being reliable. Management was was good. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the 2nd shift.

good,"I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot of financial information. Most of the management was great but as with any workplace, there are people who abuse power. My co-workers were all completely friendly and I miss that the most about ADP. The hardest part of this job was driving the long distance to and from work (around 1hr30min round trip) and the high demand for changes and strict rules. The most enjoyable part was having good pay, great benefits, a bank inside the building, the co-workers and the cafeteria was out of this world."
good,Work day went fast. Many different tasks to do during the day. Friendly co workers. Enjoyed the freedom to put tasks in order. Work flow could get busy at times but those days were a blur. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the relationship we all had there.
good,I enjoyed each and every day of my work a ADP.
good,Each day is very new and extremely independently-driven. Expect to be in the field every day hunting new relationships and business opportunities.

good,"I enjoyed working there. "

good,"Salary should be improved."
good,I loved the environment while working at ADP and i would not mind going back. The management was great and the experience taught me a lot about insurance and what people have to sacrifice to provide for their families!
good,Great benefits and opportunity to advance. Reimbursement for taking and passing CPP. Free study session to help to pass. The  hardest part of the job was adjusting to blackout  holidays not being able to make out of town visits.

good,Great place to work but management wasn't trustworthy. Benefits are nice also pay is decent. I enjoy my time employed there and learned a lot about payroll and customer service.
good,ADP gave me a great opportunity to control my schedule and to really drive my own results.  My only problem with them is the fact that the entire team other than a few people have turned over since I started.
good,"The division I worked for was built to help ADP expand from a domestic supplier of payroll and HR systems, to a Global supplier. As I came to ADP with extensive International experience, I was selected to lead their first few global initiatives, which were successful. It was a team oriented environment, and we were able to travel globally, which was exciting for me."
good,A safe workplace environment to work in. the company encourage community and charitable works. the people are welcoming and have the pen mindedness to collaborate and work with there colleagues.
good,"* Team environment"
good,"Great Company, Since they are mainly a payroll/HR company they have  most of the perks that other companies should have.   The work environment is  usually very steady and busy.  Reducing costs is the task of every employee there, and we all know it.   ADP is a company that allows work at home for special skills, but they are now pulling back on that and trying to place people in the ""strategic locations""  Like Atlanta, Halifax, New Jersey etc)   The idea is to enhance more team work and collaboration.   In the short time I was there they are making significant strides in updating technology and services. To that end, they have hired some very sharp technical people to advance the cause of Apps, Big Data, Automation etc. The upper mgt is remarkably connected to the worker bee level, and your voice will be heard. Overall it is a good place to work and spend some time working for"

good,"Great team to work with in the collects department. "

good,ADP is a great company to work for with great upper management. I have never worked anywhere else where they care so much about your personal development.  Highly recommend.
good,ADP is a company that gives you a chance to be very productive on the job . Once you start working only you can get yourself terminated. They truly are a equal employee kind of company.
good,ADP offered a great work environment to all it's employees.  All employees are working towards the best interest of the company.  This is a company I would recommend to a friend.
good,Gives you great autonomy. Offers various training programs. Employees work together as a team. The only negative is goals are hard to meet to get an advancement.
good,The majors account is one of the biggest payroll portfolio they have in the business. They have several trainings and openings for other position. The job itself is difficult but manageable.
good,"Uma empresa em constante mudança, bom para o aprendizado como profissional"
good,"GREAT Place to work, solid team environment."
good,"ADP does an incredible job attracting and retaining top talent. If you are fortunate enough to work for a 5 star leadership team like VP-Paul Erfle and DVP- Alex Quevedo you will experience a rewarding, winning culture. Team's will pull together to get the job done and the company will make sure you are well rewarded for your efforts. Presidents Club is an incredible experience and absolutely worth the chase. My only recommendation would be to ensure equal and fair territory distribution. It is important to provide equal and fair opportunity to everyone to identify true top talent. As we see a rise in Millennial management ADP may need to consider more flexibility in schedules as well as more lax in office policies. Overall, I would highly recommend working for ADP as they were a corner stone in my career development."
good,"Aprendi facilmente os processos, devido ao ambiente e a colaboração dos colegas de trabalho. Bons benefícios."

good,I enjoyed the work.  We always had training sessions. Always something new to learn.  The employees worked together.  We also participate in activities outside of the workplace and volunteered.
good,"ADP encourages its employees to pursue their studies. They also cover the cost for courses and allow time for exams to be completed during work hours. The culture and work environment are excellent here. However, employees are pushed to take on more and more accounts to generate more revenue. As a result, finishing at 5 on a regular basis can be difficult"
good,de modo geral uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar

It's the kind of company where you can work for 20+ years.  Because it is a large organization, navigating the complexity can be challenging and it takes time to move work through the layers."
good,"I had a great tie working for ADP. One of the best experiences of my life. Days went by so fast I was always busy but the job was fun almost felt like I wasn't working part of the time. My Managers were amazing smart hard working always helpful, and energetic."

good,ADP has a great culture. They do not pay top pay but they make up in benefits and a great place to work. Some say the pay isn't competitive.  If this is what you are looking for instead of a career. I would say for me it was the best decision i could of made. Because compensation is offered to those who are valued. So show your worth and the compensation will come.
good,I have been with ADP for 20 years and it's just like family. There are several events each year to for employee appreciation. The work can sometimes be overwhelming but the rewards are worth it.
good,"Things probably changed since I've worked there, and to my understanding the respective manager is no longer employed there. To summarize: it's a perfect corporate entry-mid-high level. If you're a go-getter overachiever this is it. The company will pay for relevant studies, the pay is not on par with living ""Vancouver"" expenses, but it's not super bad either. Plenty of opportunities of advancement."

good,"ADP provided a great opportunity that I didn't realize until after my office was closed and my position was eliminated. If you want great work/life balance and job security/advancement, you have to work in one of their strategic locations- the new offices in FL are probably your best bet.

good,"ADP offered excellent training for 8 weeks before you began offering customer service in their call center.  Complete focus on offering excellence through customer service. In a stressful position where you are rectifying payroll problems on a daily basis, it is nice to know that at least you have good collaboration with your peers and very good support from senior CSR's and team leaders/managers."

good,ADP is a great company to work for. Things have changed over the years. Not as many opportunities to grow as there used to be. There is a great work/life balance.
good,This was a great job to be in I worked remote for almost 8 years out of 13 before being laid off - I would have retired with this company. Opportunities were unlimited
good,I basically copied and paste sentences and questions into a data entry based system everyday which they mainly used to prepare paper work to be presented at meetings. It was a contract job. I was sent there by my temp agency to help out with a project which I've completed.
good,"Manager always available for any issues that I was unable to solve for my clients.  ADP is a company with great potential to grow within the company.  I always had support from management. "
good,It was the best company I ever worked for and I never would have left if I hadn't gotten laid off. I would go back in a heartbeat.The management was the best I've ever worked under. There was a very strong team environment which was important in order to handle the heavy work load. We were always learning new things and getting updated training. I loved ADP
good,"Great place to work. Hard work but rewarding if you put in effort."
good,Join ADP right out of college and working there gave me the necessary skills into HR and Payroll. The work force was very diverse and the management was not micro-manage except for a small few. Worked in the Client Services in the Arizona office.
good,"Great coworkers, supportive environment.   Managers are pretty flexible with your schedule depending on needs.  "
good,"This job gives a lot of opportunity to learn not only your specific role, but to engage with other business units to understand how the company functions with greater detail (and respect for other parts of the company). The opportunity to grow is there, and managers work with associates to make sure they are succeeding in order for them to grow in the workplace. What makes the job difficult is the department you go into and the training that is available. Some departments are significantly more detailed and complicated than other departments. When moving into new positions, you learn from the ground up - it's quite the multi-layered company! Very challenging environment, I would definitely recommend this job to anyone who loves structure, numbers, and research."

good,"Very friendly, training was great. Relaxing atmosphere. Catered to  their employees and included contract employees. A typical day at work, is breakfast in the mourning. Breaks, 15 minutes, enough time to do some walking.  Able to drink and snack at desk, while working. Management was not pushy or rude. As long as the work was done, they just let us work."
good,"ADP is a well run company and expects a lot from their employees. This is not a bad thing, but expect to be busy and have a full plate at all times. I’d work their again."
good,The days were very fast-paced.  Management was fair and office environment fun filled.  I could not do previous position there because I was not bi-lingual.  But liked the new position as it was still a teaching role.
good,"ADP was a wonderful company to work for. Working as an outside sales rep for ADP, my first true sales position after college, has molded me into the competitive and aggressive sales rep I am today. This company was the necessary stepping stone in starting my sales career. My experience with ADP taught me how be successful with cold calling, foot prospecting, cross-selling, territory management, and of course closing business. Selling to small businesses allowed for a shorter sales cycle, and a fast-paced environment. I developed a strong skill for cold calling and closing business on the first sales call with a prospect."
good,Very much enjoyed my time here - management really wants to see you succeed and will help you get there. Building has plenty of added bonuses like a cafe and doc office
good,The work life balance was great.  It was easy to work from home when needed. I found that my manager was easy to talk to as he made to very comfortable to speak with able any issues.
good,Working at Boston Market is good as a first job. It really isn't fast paced as it's quite relaxed and steady. The hardest is first starting but the people working there help you every step of the way.
good,Absolutely Great company to work for. I do not mention this because I am the current employee. The company truly has an employee first attitude. Which doesn't mean this attitude is withheld by all the managers but the overall goal of the company is to take care of their employees and continue their career growth and placement. The benefits are Excellent and the diverse group of people are Awesome.
good,"Help customers with payroll online or a/r questions."
good,"Some of the best people I've worked with. Very good at empowering each other. but growth is limited, hard to switch from one project to other. Work life balance is good but can't get desirable project according your skills"
good,"As a temp job, only working a few weeks, it was great place to make some money. The hiring managers were understanding and friendly. Although the work may seem tedious at times, you really felt like you were assisting them in their extremely busy time of the year."
good,"Great place to work, cared about their employees and their families.  Management team was great to work for.  Communication was most important and providing feedback to the various departments was extremely important to meet goals."

good,"Great place to work. "
good,"Great company. Great product. Great leadership from the CEO down to the Sales Executives (sales rep team managers). There are so many sales reps that it's easy to rise and then become stagnant and not have the opportunity to be coached and challengened to sell more because each sales manager may have as many as 10 sales reps right under them, in which seniority usually gets the most attention despite intense and superb training at the beginning. Overall, small business sales at ADP is an excellent if not the best ""entry-level"" sales position for those out there with a good education and solid work ethic."

good,"It requires over 400 cold calls a week "
good,I loved working at ADP.  It had the perfect atmosphere.  Too bad about the change in program platform and the entire easypay staff was let go.  Such a shame for all that long term knowledge to be eliminated.
good,"Worked for ADP for 27 years and had a balanced work/family life."
good,"I learned so much working at ADP over the years. The department that I worked in was very close knit. We were like family. It was very busy for us typically because we were in a production environment. As a manager, I generally handled escalated client issues the majority of the day while supporting my team. I would say that the hardest part of my job was not taking the time to invest in my personal development.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the people that I worked with and building relationships with other departments and outside business partners."
good,"typical day is kinda slow maybe 10-15 check-ins, i learned how to maneuver around fosse and marsha in this job. Co-workers are pretty fun, kinda sluggish though. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry guests. Most enjoyable part is creating a relationship with some of the guest."

I learned that not all people accept your personality but I enjoy being the person I am and I am very open to adapting to new and different environments. I do not have management skills but I am willing to learn and gain experience. Co-workers are friendly and very nice. The hardest part of my job is sprinting clothes I am a people person so this is hard for me to stay in one spot. The most enjoyable part at my job is the customers and their experiences.
good,Good company to work for.  Management is good and a typical day at work
good,"I worked from home so my typical day did not involve going into an office.  I did have to keep regular hours (8-5).  You still have to perform even if you do not come into an office.

good,"Great management and support from everyone. Good benefits, excellent training,  flexible schedule. Was given many opportunities to learn new aspects of the business."
good,"Great people and a warm welcoming inclusive culture!  Room to grow and develop!  Good work life balance and fair processes. My only question is around the  quality of middle management and a culture at that level which tends to reinforce selfish, dismissive and arrogant attitudes to lower ranked workers.  This is unfortunate and leads to quite High staff turnover which is both costly and a waste!"
good,"It has an environment for the well drive, motivated person of today. They set reasonable targets and build you up constantly. I loved my time here, I smashed my targets and count it as one of the best workplaces I had."

The people were always friendly and sweet. ADP always had something fun to do for all employees by week's end. They also recognized and awarded you for outstanding monthly employee.

I have friends from all over the world that include, Mexico, Wales, Canada, Morocco, and China. It truly was the best job I ever had!"
good,"I highly recommend ADP. They provide a significant amount of resources to develop their associates to excel in their role and overall career. I started at ADP after obtaining my bachelor’s degree and worked there for over 5 years. I would not be the person I am professionally or have had the professional opportunities I have, without the experience and support I received at ADP. My reasons for leaving the company were strictly personal, to be more available to my young children. I will say ADP is a great place for working mom to grow their career as well as support their family!!"
good,"En el poco tiempo que reemplace a la secretaria de Gerencia me adapte muy bien, el estar en esa empresa fue agradable, autónomo, y al tener claras las responsabilidades me fue fácil enfrentar un nuevo desafío,  no me quede ahí porque ya estaba elegida la asistente del Gerente General y venia trasladada desde Brasil ya estaba el puesto comprometido y yo solo estuve un mes."

good,I enjoyed my time at ADP and the people I worked with.  Management was solid and the product/sales training was extensive.  You spend your time working a territory and cold calling on businesses.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the ever changing laws and regulations.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the perks associated with winning and being a top rep.
good,Good place to work. Management is understanding of your needs. The only negative is having so many blackout dates for vacation. No Christmas vacation with family.

Pay raises were knowledge based and it was very rewarding. The hardest part of the job was hitting the plateau of getting to the point where I would need to physically move to advance any further in the company and, with a large family and small children in school, this was not an option for me.

There is great support from the managers, and they will generally be as hands on as you need.  Most salespeople in my office were young and made a generally great work environment both on and off the job.

As an intern a typical day for me was one of working on projects and I saw that  for all others it was helping customers over the phone. I got to put to practice what until this point had learned as theory, and was able to experience a corporate environment that I don't think I could have in many other places. Management tends to live ADP's philosophy of focusing on everyone and attempting to better them all. The culture at ADP is one unrivaled by any other, a culture of fun and a sense of family. My understanding of the hardest part of the job was the one that I heard from others, and that being the commute to work as ADP is in the far west side of town and some people living in the east and having to deal with very heavy traffic.

The reason that I rate management a 4 instead of a 5 is because when I gave my resignation on the first week I had a car accident, which I reported to my manager at that time.  She told her boss that I have been calling sick since my resignation, which the manager had no reason not to believe her, because she was the department's manager.  Her manager called me in her office then she asked me, do I still want the job? If so she liked to offer it again to me, but my answer was still the same, because the commute was not working for me, because I had a new baby.  To my ignorance, I did not know my supervisor told her boss that I have been calling sick; so therefore, I was paid the rest of my resignation period then asked to leave.  "
