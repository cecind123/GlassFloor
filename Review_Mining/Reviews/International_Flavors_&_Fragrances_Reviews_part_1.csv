rating,review
bad,Really one of the worst companies I had ever worked and it had changed my whole life and my family life. I felt so sorry for their employee working there. People are complaining but nobody will listen. Not worth of a day working there
bad,Terrible work experience from day one and I have been a successful executive manager for 3 decades.  My former employers provided a comfortable and learning environment which this company has not yet figured out how to do.  Very much a Peyton Place.
bad,typical qc lab. i was sold exciting work with each day being different.  at the end of the day you test the same stuff over and over.  all that's expected is get your work done and don't use your brain or come up with better ways of doing things.
bad,"The environment at this warehouse is bad. I would not tell anyone to work at this place. I never wanted to be there, so I couldn't wait until I found a new job--that is when I quit this place.I would never recommend anyone to work at this place."
bad,its a give your life up and work all the time or else your not going anywhere. Yearly pay raise are low if there is one at all and being told from employees who worked there 30+ years to get a new job because no one is ever safe for any reason.
bad,"Aucune présentation du personnel"
bad,"military type of management, disrespect for the personal life of people, unprofessional management, absence of payment for overtime hours (and days) for supervisors"
bad,"worst lay layoff company and policy ."
bad,"It's overly demanding.  They have these workers working so much overtime.  They don't even get recognized for their efforts.  They have mandatory overtime on the weekends.  It is a cut throat place to work.  Management is horrible, they don't just let you do your job.  They micro manage everthing."
bad,"Very tough culture. Pay is good but that is the only good thing about working there.  "
bad,IFF is an international company that created a new (at the time) position to liaise between the business side and IT. I enjoyed taking responsibility and initiative to use IT solutions to enhance business needs
bad,From the plant manager down no one has any respect for their employees they do not treat them  well they don't know how to talk to people. It was way better before the plant manager got his position in the maintenance manager got his position.
bad,IFF ha sido una gran empresa que en la Argentina pareciera que no ha logrado ponerse al día con los cambios del negocio.
bad,"New Management team is horrible, they hire ex military with no production, or business experience to be bosses, most workers are friendly, but there is a lot of nepotism, and favortism, and  some charity cases, (people who just show up for a pay check, and bring nothing to the table, as others are forced to work harder to pick up the slack) Humanless resource department. A lot of tattle tales. Alot of brown nosers."
bad,"They hire x military, and immediately make them supervisors, and managers. Most have no business or operations experience, have no clue, and rely on senior people there to show them the ropes. Have a useless personell department, who also are clueless, snobby, and no personality, definitely no help when you have questions, or concerns."
bad,• Work closely with Board of Directors
bad,"Big organization going through growing pains with recent acquisitions. "
good,IFF is great place to work if you are interested in Flavor and Fragrance development. Working here gives you a lot of insight into what goes on in the product development side.

good,"Ma First job so got an idea about this industry. New innovative skills to promote the product, Then learn smelling skills , Co employees were too helpful and always ready to teach new things"
good,"I can not feel the enthusiasm of the people who work here. Although the working style or requirement really depends on different groups and the managers, most workers just do their job slowly and don't have much space to develop their own strengths.  Even within the group, I don't have the chance to involve the things I would love to learn."
good,Pocas posbilidades de promocion. Entre los trabajadores hay buen ambiente laboral. Los técnicos de laboratorio no cobran las horas extras. Los jefes delegan toda la responsabilidad sobre los técnicos de procesos y no asumen errores.
good,As with all companies there are positives and negatives to working here. Many of the employees are difficult to please and the HR guidelines are only loosely followed which makes situations difficult to manager.
good,"- good work/life balance. Everyone is in early but leaves at a reasonable hour. "
good,Filing Paperwork and organizing thins. answering phone calls and running errands . power points as well as cleaning up for meetings and things of that nature
good,I worked in the Union Beach location.  People are not very friendly.  The team I worked with was in it for themselves.  Very secretive within their own team.
