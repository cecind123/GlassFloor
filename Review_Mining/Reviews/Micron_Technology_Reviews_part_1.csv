rating,review
bad,They don't care about you at all. they will use you until you are a wasted husk. A typical day is working like a slave for nothing. Management are idiots. Its awful.
bad,"You have to have a submissive personality and put up with managers that have no idea how to manage. Much of the workforce works out of fear. Great people here and there, but overall a very toxic environment"
bad,"Micron is a hard company to work for.  They have periodic lay-offs, so there is absolutely no job security."
bad,"Micromanagement client, who doesnt care about your skills or knowledge but only focus for your email writing and timings and being online. No welcoming nature for newest member of the team. Talks something in front of you and something in back of you."
bad,Job was good.  How employees treated very bad.  Management and supervision worked on buddy system and looked out for themselves. Shipped jobs overseas
bad,"Depreciative leadership and management, stressful work load, low pay scale, connections needed for promotion and racial preferences. Lowest job security enviroment."
bad,Micron was an absolutely terrible company to work for due to the biased management. There was extreme favoritism and it was to an a ridiculous amount.
bad,Its been a while since I have worked there and I'm not sure of current events. I just really didn't like this place mainly the people. Its more about how much you will suck up to management if they will like you never really about your work.
bad,"If you love being bullied to think you'll never amount to anything anywhere other than Micron, mandatory overtime with no compensation for it, managers staring at your badge in/out reports instead of the quality of your work, supporting a product line sure to be outmoded any day, wondering about a leveraged buyout from Samsung or some other competitor, and your CEO making racist jokes in front of a very diverse audience, then this is the place for you."
bad,"Best place to work with great work environment, cooperative team members, and supportive bosses."
bad,"Some of the worst management on the planet. The worst management on the planet. They find the absolutely worst, arrogant, abusive, incompetent, politically vicious, executives, and promote them to the highest levels. Never want to work there again. They will tell you this is an outlier review. I am one of thousands of employees with this experience."
bad,Micron can be a good place to work for if you get into the right job.  For such a large company too much of your advancement and compensation depends on who your manager is and your department.
bad,While working in the photo department the trainer would not train me on other equipment because she stated that since I worked for Infineon I should know everything
bad,"Micron bases their yearly reviews off a bell curve system that promotes silos and destroys collaboration. No one is helpful because if you succeed they can get a lower rating so everyone is against everyone. Ratings are based off the bell curve so it doesnt matter how you do all year round it's based off how you compare to your coworkers. Also, the yearly reviews are based off the bell curve and every year right before Thanksgiving they fire the low performers to prevent paying bonuses."
bad,"From the first day I knew something was up. I was so excited to start this contract, but from the first day there was this sense that I wasn't needed. There was poor communication between my direct manager and myself. My emails would go unanswered and his interactions with me were very brief and terse. This caused me great anxiety from the start, because I had just come from a large successful project where I was the lead and knew the entire system inside and out. So I went from being in charge of a large important project to feeling like I was silo-ed and shut out. My manager couldn't careless. He was either too busy or just didn't care. "
bad,"I was excited to work for Micron and thought I'd be able to retire there. No such luck. I was forced out about 2 years ago. They are outsourcing every position that they can. Jobs are going to China, Mexico, Malaysia, India, etc. They are recruiting fresh college graduate students for cheaper pay. Don't get fooled by working for this company. The Headquarters are based in Idaho, but Micron is hiring 1,000 in San Jose and 2,000 in India. I doubt they will be in Idaho for very much longer. Potential employees beware!"
bad,"Employer has no consideration for employees. They are much more interested in job titles than actual work done. They have no respect for those who hold degrees in science but are not ""engineers."" They instead pay them half for literally the exact same work. Incredibly arrogant and hierarchical. Will never work at this place for as long as I live."
bad,"If it was not for everything I have to deal with in my life right now. I would probably sue, and I do not care who reads this. All those years without provocation, without warning, and everything I did for that company! In a completely unfair circumstance ( and it was known). Calling HR for Micron and my contractor and nothing"
bad,The morale is terrible because of the rating system at Micron. No matter how hard you work you can be let go at anytime because Micron has to meet a % quota.
bad,"The employee review program requires that all the employees fall within a bell curve and are rated on a scale of 1 - 5 . The percentages of employees falling within certain points of the curve is mandated by upper management. Therefore, your rating is determined by this mandate rather than your performance. This creates a very competitive environment and low employee morale."
bad,"This company only cares about making money. That's it. Lower level employees are swept under the rug, and given impossible chances to move up. Unless of course, you're in the ""good ol` boys"" club. The wages are so terrible, the department I worked in had a higher turn over rate than a McDonalds. The only thing this company has going for it, is the benefits. I can't argue that they're top tier. The people I worked with were wonderful people, but the management was absolutely awful.If the last job on earth was at this company, I would not go back."
bad,Micron used to be a great US Idaho based company. It hardly has anything left here in the US. Just about everything at this point has been out sourced to other countries. Would not recommend if you want any job stability.
bad,"Long 12 hour days. Very stressful due to the lack of man power and management skills. A lot of favoritism is shown by upper management. They have a lack of training for all employees. There is no moral. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from all different parts of the world, and that is it."
bad,"Very top heavy. Can not make decisions at the top. Industry is very up and down. They cut people when it's down, then refill the same position 5 month later."
bad,"- direct supervisors are ridiculous"
bad,"The team I am working with works on custom flows which are not used in industry. Hence, my experience didn't gain much value in the market. I am planning to leave this job."
bad,"As a maintenance technician the work is non-stop. Often have to skip breaks. Little to no career advancement. Micron does NOT give annual raises. There was a lot of conflicts between shifts. There were a few good managers, but most of them were only focus on their careers and the appearance of a well run team."
bad,"If there is a way for the company to save a penny, even if it means moving jobs overseas to countries that have little to no experience they will do it. No one's job is ""safe"" anymore and having a ""career"" is impossible."
bad,"Management preaches that the people are important but practices the opposite. They set the workers up to cut each others throats with their new ""bell curve"" review rating system. They have no touch of reality."
bad,This place is not bad but I did not enjoy my time here spent. I did not like the environment and the people were too much drama. I think someone needs to take charge soon.
bad,Expect to pull double shifts every day due to the asia locations.  If you are not Mormon you will not make it here.  US location will disappear in a matter of t ime.
bad,"Was a great company.  New CEO has completely destroyed the Boise site.  He sold out on the last company (SanDisk) and took the money and ran.  I believe he will do the same to Micron. Stay away from Micon until him and his crew are out.  Once Micron goes into the red, the for sale signs will be up and it's only a matter of time."
bad,"Ended up with a really terrible Manager at the end of my career at Micron.  Really left a sour taste in my mouth about the company. I used to love working there, even got my wife a job there. Now she is dealing with the same thing. Micron really needs to eliminate the bad seeds that have wiggled their way into leadership roles. They give the company a bad reputation."
bad,"Place was cut throat, people would set each other up to get fired in order to get their job or to try to avoid being laid off.   Makes me laugh thinking of someone so desperate to make a dollar more an hour that they try to set someone else to get fired.  Its a buddy culture, unless your the right persons buddy at that place you will never get promoted."
bad,"No raises, excuses galore,sorry  supervision. People that got promoted should have never been. No leadership. This company does not want people that will work, they want politicians that BS and don't do a dam thing."
bad,This company is always making losses. Before I left I saw 4 rounds of layoffs in 3 years. Compensation is poor for visa holders. Average US counter parts make 20% more than smarter US educated visa holders.
bad,"They don't give out raises, add responsibilities (you basically do the work of 2 or 3 people), they make it hard for you to advance, they lie to you to try to keep you.  and morale is horrible.  I would suggest you work for a different company if you want to be in the semiconductor field."
bad,Did not start up very well. 9/11s aftermath hurt this company!
bad,"Most jobs in this company are stable primarily because the CEO does not like layoffs. Having a non-diversified commodity product means this is not a growing industry and is constantly under pressure to improve the bottom like by cost cutting measures. Most of the time technology comes to the rescue to cut the costs. Many people have been here for a long time and that means moving up is a game of chance. People who know how to navigate through can still find good career growth faster, but its more of an exception. Growth gets even harder if you are in a satellite office like San Jose."
bad,"The day to day work is enjoyable."
bad,Good place to start in semi but that is it.  Promotions are political or on buddy system.  Geared to move Senior Techs out the door.   Lack of knowledge of techs on shift makes hard to learn.
bad,"Management is clueless.  Will always put itself above all.  Profit before people."
bad,"The overriding theme at Micron is cheaper. "
bad,Micron is a global corporation with good benefits. The workplace is fast paced and has continuous training. The company will help with furthering education.
bad,"Nothing has been the same since Steve has been gone and the management is now horrible with the attitude that you are lucky to have a job and they have no clue about what is going on in the manufacturing areas."
bad,"Very Darwinian, high stress, mediocre pay, excellent benefits. For the most part good people to work with, indoor work, high tech."
bad,"I worked there for over 10 years, and had little to show for my labors when I was laid off."
bad,"Hard work, but rewarding and made a difference for many employees.  Peers were professional and quality focused.  Leadership, performance management and policies were inconsistent and unethical."
bad,The culture has degraded.  No longer a good place to work.  Downsizing and moving equipment and people to other sites that need it more than Utah does.
bad,"Flexible work hours but plan on being required to attend late night / early morning online meetings and be on call 24/7.  "
bad,Incredibly talented and awesome people I worked with in the trenches day in and day out - kept me going and motivated. Very sterile environment otherwise. I was able to earn my MBA while there for which I am grateful.
bad,Great Company until it got too big. Upper VP's are eliminating jobs in the U.S. Doubt the Boise site will be here in 5 yrs. Jobs will go overseas and IP will no longer be secured.
bad,"Constantly bombarded with email, phone and chat without the sufficient amount of people to delegate the tasks to. We all tried our best to keep up with the influx of incidents that would come in but it was clear that they were not interested in boosting company morale, or pay. They did not pay us for the level 2 work we provided. We were paid level 1 or even below."
bad,"Benefits are great but management is not the best.  They hire managers with no previous supervisory experience and do not know how to train them.  Therefore, the employee suffers for it."
bad,Beat head against wall and repeat. That is Micron over and over. Bad company that never learns from their mistakes.
bad,"Frequent turnover and forced reductions take a toll.  Senior leadership lacks direction and backbone to stand up for their teams.  Though culture is improving, continue to ask people to do more with less at the expense of home balance."
bad,"Nature of the work and the type of products I worked on were fine."
bad,"Typical day at work was reviewing ticket queue. I would frequently schedule appointments with the clients to review their tickets. Generally speaking, the clients were easy to work with."
bad,"Has been a great place to work for most of my time, many strong people and good friends.  Recent changes have seriously eroded the culture which makes it a difficult place to work."
bad,"Pretty decent place, good pay, nice learning environment, decent hours, and the cafeteria was awesome. Pretty good coworkers and a good place to work."
bad,"Doesn't matter if you been there for 30+ years, your just a number to upper management and could be cut to save the company a few cents. Good benefits and time off but never expect a raise."
bad,This job was very very stressful despite the well laid out buildings with great facilities. This place is well structured with great benefits. It was easy to get lost in the huge buildings.
bad,No career growth at all. The managers give false hopes on giving more exposure in different areas. But none fulfilled. Too much favoritism in the team. And less basic salary
bad,Benefits are attractive. Compensation is more than adequate. Shift schedule should in theory allow for 4 days off every other week but mandatory overtime was required very regularly. Often given the impression that employees were a burden to management not an asset. Employees are literally reduced to a number.
bad,Is hard working here but is a learning experience people are hard working and honest and polite the work people do with pride
bad,Work life balance not in the vocabulary. What have you done for me lately mentality.
bad,"Busy place"
bad,"20 Years ago Micron was a great company, new management wants to move everything overseas.  They are actively trying to outsource areas which I find vital not to outsource"
bad,"I've heard there are groups that are good to work in... I didn't see it."
bad,Used to be a great place to work.  New CEO has introduced a culture that is toxic and and places more importance on diversity than results.   Would no longer recommend Micron as a place to work.
bad,"Plant located in Manassas, VA. My  was in the inspection of chip wafers. Twelve hour shifts were to long and poor management."
bad,"Micron has very demanding expectations. They place an unreasonable burden on employees by consistently leaving the staff with less people than it requires to complete the work. While offering training courses, no one has the time to take them. On the job training is inconsistent and poorly coordinated."
bad,The memory industry is a hard career field. The industry has had it's ups and downs that lead to many layoffs over the years. You are always afraid of layoff or now positions moving over seas.
bad,"Unless you are from the Boise area or just need a job I would not recommend micron. Definately do not leave a job and move to work at Micron."
bad,Long hours and rotating shifts that switched from days to nights monthly.  Management cared more about product output than employee well being.  Work atmosphere was subdued with little humor or interaction.
bad,Layoffs poorly planned and rehires months and even weeks down the road.  Repeated efforts of culture shift but someone needs to tell the mid-managers.  Little to no accountability for behavior or poor decisions.
bad,"Stressful place to work.  No training opportunities.  Culture is adrift.  Management often latches onto the latest corporate fad, though often several years behind.  Layoffs regularly now, though under the radar and a trickle to not make it into the news.  And, managers who cause the issues in the first place are the ones making the decisions on who to let go so the cycle never changes and things don't improve.  Individual contributors' voices usually ignored.  If you don't tow the line you won't last long."
bad,"Micron is a good place to work, with lots of good benefits. The pay for MTs and operators is low. If you are an engineer or technician, your pay is better and may be a better place to work. The culture here is what bothers me the most. People can be demoted for not being liked or people can be promoted for just knowing someone. You are not judge by your work here only who you know. There are people in positions that they should not be in or may not be educated for. I do like the people I work with but I don't come to work to have fun, I come to work to make money and I need to make more soon."
bad,"There used to be a singular mission and a focus. Now the only thing they focus on is profits....which BTW, no longer flow down to the lower levels. It has become a very top-down organization which means it's really only as good as the top level, and quite frankly, the top isn't very talented. Micron has grown to the point they no longer know what they do best, much like many of the large tech companies, HP to wit. They are languishing and perpetually lagging their foreign competition. The desire to prevail against the competition WAS written on the hearts of every worker. Now, for most, it's just a paycheck. All of the spoils go to the top levels only. The incentive to invent and innovate is gone, beaten out of you by bureaucratic red tape and mid-management egos."
bad,No advancement opportunities. Management does not care about the advancement of engineers even after years of long hours at work and accomplishments.
bad,"Work-life balance is terrible, most managers prefer quantity of work over quality. Decision making is slow and often not based off the most important metric to the bottom line of the company, but volume of product manufactured."
bad,"This is an average company, with many layers of management.  The technical opportunities are good, but not enough direction on how to apply technical details to the everyday work environment."
bad,tribal knowledge driven. sink or swim attitude. good pay but you have to dedicate yourself to many long hours self learning. Zero idle time and full throttle high tech constantly.
bad,Maintained Process gas quality very well. Supported entire company with online gas system monitoring. Maintained highest quality incoming gasses and components.
bad,Wouldn't do it again if the begged and offered 200K. Code base was a joke. Management was a joke. Felt like a prisoner. What else can I say. Small cramped cubicles for engineers. Incompetent non-technical managers. No clear communication of company direction. I worked in the SDD development group.
bad,"The people at the facility I worked at were good to work with.  While I worked there, the company underwent three separate 'workforce reductions' during rough times.  Many very loyal, hard working employees were let go during these 'reductions.'  While I worked there, managers were always trying to 'encourage' salaried employees to come in on their off-days to work on improvement projects.  It was blatantly stated that if you weren't putting in an additional 5 - 10 hours per week on your off-days, then you wouldn't be eligible for promotion."
bad,"Cannot learn any good skills but repetitive work. Managers all appear superior but in fact just talkative. No any RnD. If some claimed they do, then be alerted on them as their faces will change very often and their mouths change also quickly. No class."
bad,"I feel over all it's a ok place to work, but I feel like they encourage a corporal punishment. When I was there Management rarely used positive reinforcement. However, once ever two weeks the have a supervisor ""one on one"" telling you to try harder and do better. Even if you had been exceeding expectations from the previous weeks. One day a I got a R&R (recognition and positive review) that same day the other manager had me in his office telling me my performance was lacking. So , I feel they can improve and be more productive with positive reinforcement. However, the management is trained and expected to limit positive reinforcement."
bad,"During my time at Micron, I noticed a few key Pros and Cons:"
bad,"A lot of bureaucracy to sort through, constant threat of bad performance reviews or layoff brings stress.  Late hours for meetings on a weekly basis.  A lot of emphasis on emails and presentations (managing your manager) instead of the actual work."
bad,"They enjoyed getting rid of people.  I saw many exited and ended up a casualty."
bad,"Being able to learn all I could about chips for computers and how they work, was the most exciting. Having a good leader to try and advance myself was very hard."
bad,"This is a company ok to work for. They used to require badge in and badge out, now they don't require badge out. New CEO promoted many Indians people."
bad,Laid back work culture. Limited opportunity to advance. Preference given to long time Micron employees for promotions. No generous in giving stock options and the Bonus plan is average.
bad,"Have learned a lot about a new system Ariba, have spent a lot of time on the errors that is caused and solutions on how to fix. trained Suppliers on a lot of the system."
bad,Working at micron was stressful. They were alway on us about not making rate when it wasn’t our fault. They would never get enough people in there to work to make it easier on any of us.
bad,"Confidential "
bad,Good place to learn about latest technologies. Technically sound engineers works here. Management is not very clear of the road maps and management styles.
bad,Ho effettuato lo stage per inserimento in azienda ma l'azienda non era disposta ad assumermi.
bad,Micron needs to take a longer view in approach to employee retention.  Frequent lay offs increase competition between employees and lowers collaboration and sharing of information.  Management should not conduct lay offs based on one quarters worth of less than expected earnings.
bad,"layoffs occur frequently and without warning. Lots to do on campus and there are two cafeterias with good food. Disk golf course, baseball diamond, soccer and frisbee, a complete gym with on staff chiropractor, and a health care center."
bad,Meh.  Can't really say good things about it.  People were friendly enough I guess.  The pay at the time was very poor.
bad,"While the benefits and pay were very generous and the people were great to work with, things at Micron were far from perfect. Upper management liked to put the success of the company on the shoulders of manufacturing through constant (sometimes nearly impossible) cost reduction initiatives."
bad,Loved working at Micron till CEO and management changes 2 years ago. Micron gave me 12 years of sales and operations experience that I hope to take to a new company. They also provided me the opportunity to go back to school to obtain my bachelor's degree.
good,"This is a really good company to work for and has great benefits. This industry will push your limits and you will develop many skills based on the work environment."
good,I have not recieved any training to do my work. What I've learned I've done on my own. Micron management doesn't support the employee when abnormal situations occur. The employee is on their own in meetings with hire level management
good,"Employee ratings are rigged for the sake of company profits. It's not how hard you work, what's your skill level is, or your potential but who you know. Favoritism and nepotism run rampid there."
good,"Typical technical writing environment. Tasks are routine, tech writing team is great, but engineers can be difficult to work with. Management is not very supportive."
good,"30 years of service. Didn't cross my T's and dot my I's to satisfy my middle,middle, middle, middle, middle, middle, middle manager.  Was a great place to work back in the day."
good,Volatile work environment. I had 7 managers in a span of a little over 2 years. I felt it was nearly impossible to move forward with my career as a cause of this. Constant change to management structure is typical. Co-workers were enjoyable and generally made the job acceptable. I was hired on to work day shift and after 1.5 years of dutiful employment I was forced to go to a night shift permanently. At the end of my tenure the company canceled pay increases.
good,After twelve years I can't say too much positive... because our plant is closing down! No job after december twelve of this year!
good,Lots of hard work with deadlines that are not flexible - poor job security due to forced ranking to meet 10% annual layoff quota  Supervisor was forced to change my review to meet department quota
good,"It was a pretty good company to work for, for most of my career there."
good,"An alright job if you would like to know about the industry and possibly a career, however you are initially hired through a temp agency and as such you have no benefits and are at the bottom of the food chain."
good,I like working at micron very much. It is a fantastic company to work for but the room for advancement isn't there. I work in the chemical warehouse with the worlds most dangerous chemicals and don't get compensated a fair rate for risking my life on a daily basis.
good,Micron was a great company to work for. They have been focusing so much on improving that they have been neglecting their workforce. They have cut pay and the constant threat of lay offs loom. The leadership has changed so much and they have no real leadership skills. MTV needs a revamp in order to maintain their workers. They have increased the workload while decreasing the amount of workers. These workers with less pay are now expected to perform the task that it use to take 3 times they amount of workers. Micron as a whole is a good company but the Manassas site is having issues.
good,"Equipment Engineer, work in the Dry Etch Department Responsible for monitoring, sustaining, and improving the tool equipment and processes. also I am required to assist with equipment installs, test systematic problem solving and troubleshooting. Maintenance performed on all tools check sheets and tracking of programs."
good,"I felt trapped in this job, always inside, stuffy, but liked to learn there."
good,"Highly stressful company.  Corp culture was nice, but non-exempt employees were expected to put in around 60 hours if they expected advancement.   I would not have let them move me to Boise, if I had know of their chronic lay-offs."
good,"Micron as a company is doing what ever it think it need to obtain profit. Lay-offs and replacement is prevalent and the shrinking of benefits are continuous. If you get a good leadership team above you, you are luckier then most. The current CEO likes to get recognized for profit but he will do it at the expense of the employee."
good,Coming in to work never knowing what was ahead of you was a great way to experience working here. Working with different departments was challenging. Work was always a process of thought and research. Each day was something new.
good,"High work load at times and very dynamic and challenging."
good,"i load an test memory chips, i work 12hrs a day, the company has poor communication, hardest part of job is loading ovens, i work with good people"
good,"My days start with looking what days(morning shifts) has left me to do and finishing it up,(night shifts) going through my emails and seeing if days miss anythings. i have learned at lot of new skills like driving the forklift, understanding how to be a material handler and knowing how to use the system/programs they use."
good,Not very much advancement opportunities available for newer employees. When then more experienced techs wouldn't advance they would force them to move to another department.
good,"Micron is an excellent company in its product production. However,"
good,"Political strife, perpetual cost cutting and downsizing, and poor management riddled my experience at Micron."
good,"Because of the dynamics of memory sales and the inability of the company to extend its product line, be prepared for layoffs!"
good,"Okay"
good,Management provides very little support to their direct reports in the IT department. Other departments are well managed but the IT department is not well respected or managed.
good,"In IT domain, most manager has no domain knowledge or engineering mindset but has great power for decision like hiring."
good,Work environment and compensation/benefits used to make Micron one of the best employers in the valley.  Sad to say that is no longer the case.  Oh they will hire you and make you feel important but the second they can figure out a way to do your job Taiwan or China on the cheap you're history.
good,"good place to work, just too much going on with the way they are rating and having to meet the bell curve. They are setting people up for failure without even noticing"
good,"There are depts and managers at Micron that are successful and performing at high levels...then there is manufacturing which is comprised mostly of bad management that have been moved from one dept to another leaving a wake of failure behind them, yet continue to spread their bad moral and negative mindsets throughout the company.  They remain because they are part of the ""buddy system""  This management has driven most of the good employees away from the Assembly mfg group.  This entire Dept will officially be transferred to Taiwan in the Fall of 2018.   "
good,"Some improvement over years, however culture is deep rooted into requiring employees to dedicate a large amount of time taking up space throughout the week rather than just saying if tasks are complete then no need to be present at site."
good,"12 hr production shifts with job duties that are constantly changing "
good,"A good place to work and learn skills. However semiconductor is a very volatile industry, you can experience ""feast or famine"". Micron is no exception."
good,"I worked as a process engineer so my review is based on my job function only. I believe that other job positions in the company are more enjoyable and I tried to change departments but it's easier said than done. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant notifications in the email inbox. As the machine was measuring component dimensions continuously, there were frequent errors. So finding out whether the fault was with the component or the machine settings was always a challenge. Co-workers were amazing and they were the reason why I was able to continue in the job for so long."
good,I spent most days in my cubicle at my computer running simulations for new parts. Occasionally I went to the lab to get data for other new parts using the aging equipment that rarely cooperated. Most of the skills I used were ones I learned as a freshman in college and powerpoint.
good,"As an Intern at Micron Technology one can learn a lot. Working there has opened my eyes of how much effort goes into making micro chips for the everyday technology we use i.e. Laptops, Smart phones, Vehicles and Tablets. Working there was a fantastic learning experience, its just too bad that the micro management was not worth my sanity. I worked for the department of Photolithography and while it was great while it lasted you truly feel as though you are being criticized behind your back way too much. The company is great depending on what department you work for but please be cautious for there are no cameras in the facility due to confidentiality sake. Ergo the people talking behind your back becomes a game of telephone all the way to your manager."
good,"Meetings after meetings, Long hours, plenty of data mining, data analyzing and decision making. Steep learning curve with never ending learning opportunities. Friendly and helpful co-workers only if they are free. Celebrations after celebrations and recognition after recognition could get in the way of work at times."
good,"There are game rooms."
good,Micron is a company full of many great team members that are a lot of fun to work with. The working conditions at Micron have become challenging with uncertain and changing expectations being set by leadership.
good,"good pay and advancement if you are a hard worker, but you will continue to be pushed until you are burned out. not ideal place for someone with family bc you will never see them."
good,"With the idea that people don't work for companies, they work for managers; Micron has some room to grow. Management here is stuffy and work can be very silo'd."
good,is a fantastic organization to work for! Colleagues quickly become family and the culture makes you feel right at home! The work/life balance standard they have created with unlimited PTO is hard to find or even know of these days.
good,"The company is alright to work for but there is zero reliability.  There will be layoff every 18 to 24 months and sometimes for no reason.  The company does not reward based on work or productivity but is driven solely by college degree.  Don't start unless you have a BA, don't plan on advancing unless you have masters or better."
good,"I've really liked working for Micron, but am leaving because I do not want to travel as much as my position requires. Most of the people are great and if you are a self motivator you can do well."
good,"Micron has a pretty good compensation/benefits package (decent wages, bonuses, medical, dental, eye insurance, 401k matching, on-site gym and health services center), but you are expected to work a minimum of 45-50 hours/week, and be on-call 24/7 (even when on vacation), so the work/life balance is not desirable. If you have a chance to work in a manufacturing role, don't!"
good,"If you've been there long enough, you've seen Micron go through multiple cycles.  When the DRAM market is up, they've got extra cash and decide that they must diversify into other products - there have been dozens of them.  Then when the market dries up, they decide that they have to focus on their core competency, DRAMS, and all those 'extra' programs have to go - and the people with them."
good,Micron is a nice diverse place to work but growth and advancements seems to be rare.  the most enjoyable part of work to to have to interact with different people from different places
good,"12 hour night shifts, 3 or 4 days a week. A typical night went filling a pick and place with reels of capacitors or resistances."
good,"Working at the same company for 8 yrs gives one some perspective."
good,"Within each work areas, Micron is very 'silo'd' and there's not a lot of cross business unit collaboration as each has their own culture.  Some areas are better at providing opportunities vs. others.  Generally, it's easier to move ahead if you come in from the outside.  It's quite challenging and political to move ahead from within the company, although there are some good people that work at Micron.  Some of the outsiders that come in struggle to recognize that and tend to hire their buddies from outside into lead positions despite not understanding the products or culture."
good,Similar to other places of the same size.  Poor compensation due to captive audience (Micron is only semiconductor facility in state).
good,Lots of opportunities and some very good people.  Environment can be high demand at times.  There is a cultural perception that if you are not in your cubicle working you must not be working.  Could be friendlier to remote work.
good,Be warned that while this is an ok company they can be influenced by the ups and downs of the semiconductor market. They have no problem cutting people to make the end profit if needed.
good,"Micron employees are a good group to work with. The management is not realistic in their expectations. Some training is given, but often not until deadlines are delinquent. There is an undercurrent of age discrimination that is felt especially if you are white male."
good,"Attractive salary but high-pressure working environment. Competitive among colleagues, the opportunity of growth is low. Staff benefits are good, facilities such as gym, studio, small table tennis court are available."
good,It was a great contract gig - but i am not sure how regular full-time employees are treated.  It was a dynamic work environment - and It was great to work in a place that tried to stay culturally relevant
good,"There wasnt much if an interview process for them,  I started working after the staffing agency placed me .  The work overall isnt a lot, it is repetative.  The staff"
good,"New CEO changed the way people worked, made people compete against each other for their jobs.  Moved jobs over seas and doesn't just views the people there as a tool."
good,This is a challenging place to work. There's more focus on getting as much as possible done and less consideration on how to develop leadership and collaboration.
good,"The company states that it values it's employees and their contributions, but the actual practices do not show this. The compensation is slightly above average for the industry but the workload is beyond intense. The work-life balance at Micron is 90 work - 10 life if you want to have any job security. Their new focus is on automating most of the support positions and those that cannot be automated are being out-sourced. If you are not an engineer or designer I recommend looking elsewhere."
good,"Day: 12 hours of troubleshooting. Expect each day to be different and demand different skills."
good,"Working on projects for managers, "
good,"When I started at Micron in 1997, that was the place to be.  It was fast paced and busy, with good pay and benefits.  I'm sure the shareholders are making good money now but it's no longer a good place for employment unless that's all you can get.  There is the constant fear of another layoff consistently looming over your head."
good,"I work in IT and I happen to work on a project that is very demanding and there is a lot of pressure to meet deadlines.  I don't see this as typical, but it is not uncommon either.  As a contract worker, I get paid overtime, which is fine, but I see a lot of colleagues who work very long hours on this project and they are salaried and I ask myself, why would they do it?"
good,"Good place to grow your Semiconductor knowledge , opportunity to upgrade your skills. Gym facility available. Team building. IPP incentives if meet every 6 months."
good,"After giving 18 years to the company I was laid off mostly because I was a non degreed (BS) engineer.  Performing the same job functions as the degreed engineers for over 10 years.  My job was recently posted for a degreed engineer. "
good,Good place to develop technical skills. Easy to move between internal jobs across sites. Low pay compared to other tech companies. Almost no increment.
good,"I am currently a contractor at Micron and have been treated very well.  I have found many opportunities for advancement.  The workplace culture, however, leaves something to be desired."
good,"Typical day at work is gowning up to a cleanroom environment and monitoring tools and wafer production. I quickly learned that every day is not the same and that developing strong troubleshooting skills is a must to determine root causes. This industry is a constantly fluctuating field, as such, being able to overcome changing work hours and management is a must. Co-workers are easy to get along with and I certainly feel like part of a team. The hardest part of the job is (arguably) working night shift, however, this may be the most enjoyable part of the job as it allows for less interruption during the work day."
good,"Processed chip wafers using various process equipment .Was in the lead operator program and filled in when needed. I had good supervisors  and bad "
good,"The company is one of the top memory companies in the world.  My typical day would involve communicating with design engineers and fellow team members in the verification group.  In addition, checking work status of my sub group is also a part of the daily routine.  My co-workers are friendly and intelligent.  All in all, it's a great place to work."
good,Micron is a wonderful place to work.  I have been a longtime employee of Micron in several different areas and they have provided me with every opportunity to expand my professional/management career.
good,"The biggest issue with Micron is the management.  It seems like very few managers know how to actually manage, and because of this a very bottom-up structure has developed.  Do not expect any manager to be an expert in the field, they are simply there to make reports for those further up the food chain.  Because of this structure, entirely ineffective people can be employed there indefinitely, while someone who is well-qualified but does something upper management doesn't like will be fired."
good,Good workplace lots of jobs.  12 hour shifts 3 days on 4 off 4 days on 3 off.  Good vacation time and benefits
good,"Micron is a good place to work, since co-workers are professional and friendly, you can learn a lot of technical skills. Management is not really able to provide a good carrier opportunity, neither challenging with broad responsabilities"
good,"Good company with some high ambitions, I enjoyed my job responsibilities."
good,Micron Technology is in the semiconductor industry.  They are in a global industry that is very competitive and their corporate culture has been shaped by this reality.  They reward individuals that can impact the bottom line.
good,There are a number of departments that have to be learned in order to perform the job efficiently.
good,Micron for operators is no more than a job. Because when you work at the main site Micron you will always work in fear of loosing your job for one reason or another. Espeially in Spectek when Micron has relaxed in keeping their procedures updated. And yet operators are getting written up for not following procedures.
good,Good Benefits that keeps employees decently happy. Lots of things happening at a corporate level that low level employees never see or get explanations for.
good,Micron has a diverse workforce and is a challenging and rewarding place to work. Movement within the company is only limited by a person's desire and ability.
good,"Micron is a good place to work in general but it is a high stress, fast paced place to work.  You will be expected to do your job and then some. If you work in a clean room environment leave the makeup and heals at home.  It is difficult to get hired to do other jobs from within.  Micron expects the best of the best.  Holiday pay, great benefits, Paid time off, holiday meals and great place to make lasting friendships.  There is endless amounts of overtime available for those who want it."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Micron, I enjoyed it enough that I went back after being laid off and would go back again if the opportunity presented itself.  Work life balance was good even though a technical role required 12 hour shifts, 3 on 4 off and 4 on 3 off."
good,"Micron in general is a great place to work. They try to hire the best technical people and are at the top of the game in the semiconductor business. My particular experience is probably outside of the norm, since I was hired to work on essentially a skunkworks project, but I found that the management is too much ""by the book"" and does not foster an environment of creativity and innovative. Instead, they have resorted to a ""management by spreadsheet"" mentality, which works for a manufacturing-oriented organization, but not a world-class engineering organization. All of that said, I would likely give Micron another shot if the right opportunity came along."
good,"Micron was a good place to work. Great people to work with. team environment."
good,Micron used to be known as a family oriented business.  Now they squeeze every possible hour of work from their salaried employees while continuing to reduce the workforce instead of increase it.
good,"technical capabilities"
good,"Micron is a good place to work.  With a lot of global opportunities.  But the work / life balance is challenging.  With long hours, travel, and evening conference calls."
good,It's a job. Do the job and avoid the drama. There's a lot of drama at the company and with the managers. It's important to stay focused on the work and avoid the petty turf wars.
good,"Micron has been a great place to work, but significant changes in the last 2 years with new leadership.  Rank and file people are great to work with, and the best part about working at Micron."
good,Meh.  I have worked in better places and worse.  People are for the most part very good to work with.  Some of the things I was told at hire never came to fruition as the processes were constantly in flux.
good,"Nice people, etc.  But the culture expects a LOT of overtime.  People are trying to take vacation per a mandate, but have to work even more overtime than the 50 - 70 they do already-- just to be able to take their vacation.  Not good or right at this or any other company."
good,"I was able to develop and acquire new skills during my time with Micron. Leadership was very approachable and personable. However, there are few if any opportunities to move up the ladder"
good,"Great company to work for, and lots of fantastic people. College opportunities available. Micron discounts throughout Boise for merchandise at local businesses."
good,I would still be working at Micron if they would not have moved overseas. The shifts you were given to work allowed great family time. The vacation pay and bonuses were great.
good,Start with pass down then collect proper paper work start with daily routine which continues though out the day until we prepare for the next shift pass down.
good,"Blessed to have worked with some of the most intelligent, supportive, intuitive, and helpful people in the industry for over 17 years. Company supported continuing education, but unfortunately career placement or opportunities for advancement were very undermanaged. Work was fast-paced and challenging, but that's what drives the ""doers"". Losing a lot of great people due to manufacturing transfers to Asia."
good,Micron is a fun and innovative place of employment.  The people are great and the culture is diverse.  I appreciate the flexible work environment and having the ability to manage work/home life.
good,"Compensation at Micron was good, but the days would be boring at times. It was my first internship and there also weren't many interns with me. Most of the employees were older so it was hard to relate to them."
good,I worked a twelve hour day 3 days a week then the next week was 4 days.  It was a production job in a very clean environment due to the nature of the product being made.
good,"I have been working at Micron Technology full-time (More than 10 years)"
good,"worked my butt off, and they laid me off for an outsourcer in India. stupid. They brought the jobs back after 2 years, but did not hire anyone back. started over with newbies and small salaries."
good,Management needs improvement. Good health insurance and paid time off. They could do better on their salary as other companies in the same industry pay more
good,A decent company to work with decent benefits. Would be great if the company is more generous with stock options and offer ESPP program like most other companies.
good,Swing shift with 12 hour shifts take a toll on the body and mind.  Shifts rotated days to nights every month so you could never adjust to a sleep schedule.
good,Not the right person to review as it was only a part-time job for me. No OT pay for fulltimers. Good pay for part timers and understanding and supportive management.
good,"Micron was a good place to work in the beginning.Once I was there for about 3-4 years, I had found out first hand what the company was all about.The management and the line leaders would talk down to their employee and belittle them. The morale there was low. You would not get the recognition for doing a good job."
good,"Steady paycheck. Good discounts. Good people. Company lacked a definitive way forward. New CEO seems like he is on the right track. Hopefully, they can male the leap."
good,Good company to work for with the exception of rotating 12 hour shifts. When working 7pm to 7am you don't have much of a life. Immediate management was good.
good,"There was little room for advancement. The benefits were good. The hours were good while you were on day shift, but night shift hours tend to destroy your personal life. Non-transparent upper management... You are likely to get outsourced or lose your job for no reason at any moment."
good,Worked on the Administering Tableau Server as well as created dashboards related to Tableau Admin views. Good place. Work life balance is not that great.
good,I started working at Micron in 2004 to the major lay-off of it's workforce in 2009. The teams I worked with for the first five years I was there was really something. I felt that I belonged and that most everyone worked as a team. I was able to advance and there was a sense of accomplishment on the classes and advancements I received. Even during this time lay-offs always seemed to appear at least every year or two and that part of the job was stressful. I resumed working for Micron's Joint venture Transform Solar in 2011 then transferred to Fab 4 (R&D) once Transform Solar went under. Micron helped me get my degree and had good benefits but the prior team work wasn't there like it used to be. I felt unfulfilled and unchallenged as a Manufacturing Tech at Micron. Nothhing against the company but I wanted to venture out and co start a business with an associate in the travel industry.
good,The part of Micron that I worked for was sold off and 90% of the staff let go.  The microdisplay technology developed in Longmont was interesting but never found a large market.
good,good company. All different countries  of people working here. Good benefit. Very good environment. Different cultures people working here. priorities on safety .
good,"I started in the internship program and was brought in after nine months, once my degree was complete. The internship opportunity was a much needed start to my career in Electronics Engineering Technology. When working in a fast paced manufacturing environment, you learn the importance of efficient troubleshooting and collaborative skills."
good,"A solid company, with established guidelines, excellent compensation  (both monetary and otherwise) and clear expectations about workload."
good,The shifts are what made me love work. The 12hr shifts felt like nothing. Days off were always 3-4 days and being away from work that long felt like a vacation... every week.
good,"Micron is a strong company. As with any job, the satisfaction depends largely on the manager. Most are good at Micron. If new to the semiconductor field, Micron is the place to be and the Boise area is outstanding."
good,"I hear that it is a fast paced environment.  Commodity business which has ups and downs.  Good benefits, and energetic work environment. Good people to work with."
good,"Building memory, SRAM cards"
good,"Worked their 30 years, until replaced by temporary employess with no benefits. Right after recieving my 30 year service award. They are  a profit motivated group. Good luck to them."
good,"High turnover, benefits are little. work is never ending, management are trying to survive themselves. Nice environment though. steep learning curve for new hires"
good,Loved working here. Unfortunately it was working there during a downturn in the economy and was let go along with thousands of other employees.
good,There is a lot of technology and job skills that you can learn.   The management is not so strict.   The most difficult thing is to deal with a co-worker who does not to put in a fair share of work load.
good,"Felt like just ordinary working environment, not good or not bad."
good,average company to work for.  will let you go at their convenience.  will definitely make up reasons to get rid of you when they know that layoffs are coming.
good,There are some very talented people in the marketing and engineering teams at Micron.    Some significant competitors keep this market very challenging.
good,I spent a lot of my youth with this company. Some departments are ran better than others. I got to developed a wide range of skills and every day was a challenge.
good,"There is a huge disconnect between upper level management and the workers.  Lots of good ideas, but they don't truly get implemented.  My boss liked to just kind of ignore me as well."
good,"Very busy palce to work."
good,I like technically challenging projects with all the spotlight on me.
good,"There needs to be more internal promotions to satisfy enthusiasm among the employees, especially those that have been loyal for some time."
good,I got to work in different areas and I was able to see the new automation overhead system
good,"As it turned out, my time here was limited at this facility.  I worked in the implant and CVD/PVD group.  Repaired and assisted in the repair of several types of Equipment types of different manufacturers.  Learned different types of equipment and had to learn different types of manufacturing processes to keep up with the effects on the equipment. This was an R&D fab and was very interesting and fun.  Co-workers were fun to work with and engineering was very accommodating with cause and effect troubleshooting. This was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Micron has a competitive and fast paced workplace environment. There will never be a day where you don't learn something new, which can be very exciting, but you'll have to work hard."
good,"analisi costi"
good,met some nice friends. work was interesting. fixing things always gave us a sense of accomplishment. I did not share the same after work socializing or hobbies of my co workers which kept me at a distance. We learned organizational skills. Participated in  improvement projects. Difficulties were trust issues across different departments. Bonuses and group activities were the most enjoyable.
good,Eight to Five in the middle of a cube farm is not for everyone.
good,"*Because Micron is in a location where there is little to no competition there can be an attitude of the employees being treated as hostages"
good,"The hardest part of my job with Micron was that I spent 12 hours doing the same thing over and over again.  There was not life there, no one telling you good job, or any incentives."
good,"In the beginning it was a work house. I started as a temp-to-hire, that was brushed under the rug for a period of time. I watched people off the street becoming full time as they entered the door. I after an extended period of time became a full time worker, missing the big bonus as I was not qualified for it  due to a 90 day grace period. Just the beginning . I did learn that running computer aided machines is not the easiest thing in the world...they all have a mind of their own. My co-workers were great as long as you didn't do half of their work and then have to do all of your own. The hardest part of the job would have either been the 12 hour shifts or the machine malfunctioning . The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time."
good,Employees experience will vary depending on where they work. There are long work days for some. They will enjoy one or two extra days off. But they also will need to work overtime to have a decent income. Others enjoy fast paced cutting edge technology as the semiconductor industry is at the forefront of advances.
good,Joined Micron in 2006 found the Engineering team to be highly skilled. Daily activities were changing and rewarding
good,Very busy clean room environment. Co workers easy to get along with. Ran product through variety of tools and equipment. Tracked the product availability on computer software
good,An interesting place to work they still need to learn that some peoples religion is the culture and way of life. and I was told many time behind closed door to spend more time at work and less time home if I wanted to advance in the company.
good,Worked 12 hour night shifts and no room for advancement unless college educated.
good,Team work is essential to goal
good,"Working in a clean-room processing semi-conductors for manufacturing of SRAM/DRAM/Flash microchips. The people were great, the working conditions were difficult. The night shift wasn't for me."
good,"Production operator working prob, burn in, and other departments inside company"
good,"Nice campus, benefits, and opportunities for individual growth.  Onsite training and resources to help you maximize your potential.  Two cafeterias and two gyms."
good,"I liked my jobs there. The compensation is very good. The management planning lacks foresight so job security is unknown. "
good,"Good place to work for benefits, great people, and learned something new almost daily.  Learned to work with various people and groups, whether it be problem solving or working to move product along in timely manner.  My team members were amazing and fun to work with.  Hardest part of job was worrying about job being outsourced."
good,I worked at Micron for 23 + years. It started of great and slowly changed over time to be the same as any other Global company. There is fair compensation and great benefits.
good,"Good pay, 12 hour shifts are tough but doable, rotating from days to nights every 4 months was extremely hard on the body and mind. Always on your feet. My manager was not good but others are."
good,"Responsibility     :"
good,"This environment was high energy and very quick-paced due to the demands of creating wafers (computer chips). The work was 24 hours/day, so you needed to always be ready to act."
good,More and more is expected from fewer and fewer people. The headcount has been reduced but the workload and responsibilities have not. Employee moral is at a low.
good,"Excellent benefits and compensation however most end up working 60+ hours per week consistently.  Limited growth potential in Manassas VA, have to move to Boise Idaho or Singapore headquarters for growth."
good,"Micron is a great place to work. Great work environment but little room for career growth. It's a great job if you have tenure, meaning in the same position forever."
good,A very volatile work environment with all of the ups and downs of the electronics industry. It creates for a very competitive work environment within the company.
good,"I really used to love working here, but the Manassas site came under new management and the focus shifted away from the people, causing morale to plummet. I provided direct actionable feedback that was met with ""this is how we are doing things now."""
good,testing product constantly under stressful condition to make sure it will perform up to standards. running testing equipment all the time
good,Micron is learning how to be a big company.  Improving efforts to align and get everyone on the same page.  Recent focus has been on execution on previous R&D Efforts.
good,"Good pay"
good,"worked the grave yard shift. management was great. always had positive thing to say to all.And always helpful."
good,"Repair and maintain semi conductor equipment. Software hardware electrical, motors, controllers,  gasses, relays, water and air pressures. every tools different and usually most failures are routine in nature. On occasion there are some hard downs tha make the work a little more challenging."
good,I like to work at Micron with good working and safe environment. People are friendly and cooperative. Great team work here.
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Typical employees work 12 hour shifts 3-4 day alternating work weeks, which provides plenty of regularly scheduled time off."
good,People I did meet were very nice. But team leaders would leave for long time. some very rude
good,"The people are nice and easy going. Good work and life balance. No dinner on-site which means most people go home for dinner for the normal shift. But this is the only company in the area so cutural wise this place is a little poor. However, if you want a secured job and a place to raise a family, this is the place. BTW, the cafeteria kinda sucks, but cheap enough though."
good,"The management team is not the greatest.. It is all about the buddy system.. if your in your in.. if your not your not.. They make advancement so far out of reach it is pitiful. good luck getting a raise cause they don't give them.. they do market adjustments.. there are no companies around to compare what you should be making so how can you compare. so they give you nothing.. it's a joke.. people i know were making the same amount of money for years while new people coming in were making a lot more. Guess who was training them, the people making a lot less that had the experience.."
good,The semiconductor market is extremely competitive and requires Micron to continually change so don't expect job security. You will find creative people with strong work ethics who are generally enjoyable to work with and the opportunity to advance your education and career.
good,Working at Micron was a great experience I learned how to do a lot of hard task and accomplish many goals it was a very fun job atmosphere a lot of people there to help
good,"My experience with Micron was very good as a long time employee.  This was a company that started in Boise, Idaho and expanded world-wide.  It was a good company to work for, but involved a strong commitment from it's people.  I do not have any information on the current state of Micron after the change in upper management around 2017."
good,"MIcron provided my family good stability while helping us to maintain a good work/life balance. The benefits were good, my only issue is with the volatility of the semiconductor industry. The 6 years that I worked there. I saw 4 lay offs and the most recent pushed me out due to moving 4 entire department over to Taiwan."
good,this company has great benefits and pay is good.  But it is highly stressful.  supervisors are always on your back trying giving you more and more work on top of work.
good,Very relaxed working environment with a very diverse work force.  Long 12 hour shift with only 2-3 breaks per shift.  Basically just standing in one spot for 12 hours at a time.   Good pay and benefits.  Mediocre management.
good,Working as an Engineer in Micron typically would be quite stressful and challenging. Most of the time the job would require doing frequent overtime which may suggest that the work life balance is very difficult to maintain
good,The position was never repetitive and allowed me to work on many different projects at the same time. My direct supervisor did not micro-mange my time which gave me the freedom to utilize my resources and research the issues at hand. The hardest part of the job was organizing meetings between department managers to agree upon process changes. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing the research to find solutions on how to improve process while keeping high quality and low cost.
good,"overall its a great place to work, and everyone is friendly. I would recommend anyone to work there its a great place to work! :)"
good,"Great place, work life balance is great."
good,"Leadership is milking the company before they ride off into the sunset.  I would not recommend this job to a new engineer.  The advancement opportunities are and the pay is stagnant.  What you get hired at is what you're going to get for a long, long time."
good,"I really enjoyed the technology, day-to-day work and people at Micron. However the management is very hierarchical and secretive which leads to a culture that was often demoralizing. The pay is very competitive  for the area, as are the benefits and time off so I would consider working there again."
good,The company has a unique culture linked to local environment.
good,"If you are in the US, there is a risk that your job will be moved to Asia. "
good,"Micron is a glorified sweatshop. You are not a name you are a number. I want to be part of a team, not part of the herd. I was promoted twice, however ended up working for someone I went to high school with, and we didn't get along. I moved on."
good,A typical day fast pace and very productive. My position consisted of a large range of responsibilities and communicating with most of the employees. I enjoyed interfacing with the employees.
good,Upper management is great to work with and they understand the difficulties and complexities that procurement endures on a day to day basis.  My co-workers are great and help support me in any way possible.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people from all over the world.  I believe we have people from over 35 different countries.
good,Daily moving the wafers through the fab. Second largest wafer company. Management and employees communicated well.
good,"A typical day at work included the ability to work without being micromanaged, multitask during critical and non-critical situations, research and analyze in decision making process and cbt trainings. I had the opportunity to learn the business process of a facilities and took classes at GMU toward a Facility Management Certificate. "
good,"Typical day was overly busy and energetic.  Never bored; always work to be done. Hardest part of the job was doing work that was not explained and out of my department."
good,As an Account Analyst working with multi million dollar accounts on a daily basis.  Worked with several department resolving customer RMA's and deduction on accounts.  Created daily reconciliations of chargebacks and notifed sales of disputes as needed. Contact customer and resolved disputes. I enjoyed working with customers and the challenge of resolving problems for them.
good,Good company to work for. Great work life balance. Management could be little old school but lot of potential to grow.Friendly environment with stress free work culture
good,"Was a good place to work but they have layoffs about every 3 years. Job security was unsure. Excellent place to work, some of the management was ok, Hardest part of the job stress. High demands. Enjoyable part was the perks. Family barbecues, free ice cream for a good job.  You just did not know if it was your time to get laid off. Took 8 years and the reduction in force got me."
good,Great environment to learn and grow.  Management needed work in order to improve in certain areas but was an overall great learning experience and growth opportunity.
good,"The Micron culture of work ethic is amazing . For example the people you get to work with in your team are focused on quality and fast execution of the product. As far as human relations go there has been something very special about the workers at Micron. Everyone is positive and always looking to help each other out. The supervisors most of the time go to bat for their team members. "
good,Micron promotes from with in and developed great talent. They train their employees.
good,"Good people to work with. Great supervisor's, Advancement was hard to get. Job security bad, The most enjoyable put of my job was working with fellow tech's, engineer's and supervisor's."
good,I enjoyed building and working with electronics at this company as I get great satisfaction out of repairing an item and I did a lot of this. I work in a fabrication area which had a 100% cleanroom environment.
good,"Continuous analysis work"
good,"	Excellent organizational, interpersonal, and communication skills with the flexibility and experience required to adjust to rapidly changing schedules and shifting priorities"
good,It takes a very strong work ethic to work for Micron Technology. for United States locations and global positions expect evening hours for calls with sites in Taiwan Japan and Singapore.
good,"It's impossible to cover a typical day based on the wide variety of jobs. It's possible to learn a great deal at Micron, but it's not always easy as time is closely monitored."
good,As Micron continues to push more operations off shore the sites in the US are viewed as unnecessary. This is having a negative effect on moral here in Boise.
good,"On production side in low pay, someone can come in after you have been there 3 or more years and they will be make the same as you within a year......"
good,"For an engineer, it is a good place to work however due to certain VPs direction, many programs, with wrong technologies, were cancelled after many months of working on them; creating a lot of frustration and mistrust of new programs. Many management changes, some of the new upper level managers brought their own people creating more churn."
good,Micron was a good place to work for until management became dishonest.  They tell you they are expanding then lay everyone off the next week  Lot of good old boy culture there as well.  If you are a drinking buddy or friend you get to stay.
good,It’s really very top heavy in management and the fab support technicians are so full of drama other than that good place to work. Easy to work harder than others but hard to stay away from toxic people.
good,"The work at this large company depends on the department you work in."
good,"There is a ""good ol' boy"" attitude among management. It makes it difficult to succeed. Lots of opportunities for personal growth. Don't expect raises."
good,They always tried to work with you on work and family life. had flexible shifts. were willing to work with you on special needs. Bonuses were not always punctual always changing .
good,"It Good If Tou Like To Work Hands On "
good,"I have enjoyed my time working for Micron. I have learned a lot and gained a variety of experience."
good,Very diversed automated equipment in top of the line automated test equipment for IC handling equipment and tester equipment on the test floor . Very challenging in the beginning to be able to work on so many different types of automated equipment.
good,I worked at micron for 18 years and got laid off.  was completely unexpected.  I enjoy the work I did there. so great place to work if you  can hand on.
good,Okay place to work at. Wants people to do more with less. More work keeps adding even though they say do essential work only.
good,Being on call 24/7 was very stressful and not really rewarding.  But when i wasn't being paged on off hours the typical day was pretty good.  get into work clean up messes from the previous night talk and work with italian coworkers.  Get lunch and then work on projects which included expanding software solutions and making things generally better for everyone.
good,Good place with lots of lay offs. there is still jobs there with some opportunities. i learned to stay busy here. There is also something about working here that gives you a since of security.
good,"The good: large company that is doing very well. Good place to be for job security."
good,"I had a good run there, but that's life in the semiconductor industry, no? After almost 9 years working there, not a single call from anyone to ask, ""Everything ok?"" or ""Sorry to hear about what happened"". This speaks to the culture, I think-Everyone is used to it."
good,Great management with excellent opportunities for growth. Good workplace with a perfect work life balance.  A lot of opportunities to learn and grow in your field.
good,"Constant organizational changes, no clear and concise method on being super successful day-to-day. Focusing too much on money instead of quality will unfortunately be the ultimate downfall. Great experiences with the people but the management has been very tough to stomach sometimes. Thankful my supervisor was great but the other departments have caused many issues because of personal outside issues. This is definitely a family business and they hire they relatives to come in who don't deserve the position. Brings down the moral of the team and departments this way."
good,"Some management could use some better training on workload management, but the benefits and pay are overall great. Your paid what your worth even if sometimes your being to job of several people due to lack of hiring replacement personnel."
good,"Micron does not hire direct, but through contractors, so if and when they have a downturn, it is easier to cut staff. "
good,"Conducive environment for both working and learning. People are really knowledgeable and also help you to understand the concepts well, in case you are in doubt."
good,"The above states the meat and potatoes of what an employee needs. "
good,Landed at Micron after from an acquisition.  Integration was slow and current employees were not very welcoming.  Communication styles were very different.   Overall was an OK experience.
good,"During a typical day, you are given what you need to complete and are on your way. You are given 2 breaks, 1 before lunch and 1 after. The day typically goes by quickly, as you are occupied by work. Not too much down time."
good,Great educational opportunities. Could take as many company provided classes as you want at no cost. Was a very good place to work for the area. Excellent pay and benefits.
good,"lots of opportunities to advance and move around the company. great pay and benefits. "
good,You get to be on the edge of technology. Unfortunately that comes with having your job be subject to the next market adjustment. It has its perks and its pull backs but is overall a great organization.
good,Had a good crew for the most part so that made work fun. Lazy people never had any consequences so that got old. People trying to constantly get out of work and apathetic supervisors and poor management led me to not value that job as much as I could have.
good,"-very tiring although working shift [2week Day, 2week Night]"
good,"Would continue working, but the division was sold to a Japanese company.   Provided excellent support to projects. Was able to do extensive travel to China."
good,"Good working environment "
good,Nineteen years of experience in the Manufacturing job has taught me how to adapt to different management style and focus. It has also taught me how to deal with people from all levels and get the best out of them based on their strengths and weaknesses.
good,"Exciting cutting edge technology."
good,Friendly working colleague. Good and enjoyable experience. Small working area. Good teaching seniors. Well maintain safety of machine and workers. Very clean environments
good,Decent benefits and average compensation. Job security and advancement opportunities are limited. The people that work there are great. They are very helpful and friendly.
good,"Every day was a day of change, you was not doing the same thing over. Plenty of time off with pay, 401K with matching employer contributions. Employee stock plan if you want. very good Medical, Dental and vision."
good,"There's no politics in Micron and most of colleagues are friendly. It is well managed and cares about every team member's feeling. But similar to other semiconductor companies, the workload is heavy to some degree."
good,"Overall a good place to work."
good,"Good work life flexibility."
good,"There are a lot of pros working for Micron Technology. They have great career opportunities, a never ending supply of interesting work, competitive compensation, wonderful benefits, great people, wonderful training programs, a tremendous number of brilliant professionals in their fields ready to help, and great core values."
good,Most people that work at Micron like work at Micron. It is good place to work. The benefits are great and we have a few game rooms too. The downside is that the pay is not competitive. Most of the people stay highly underpaid.
good,The  environment  which  i  have  been   there  was  really  a  good  one  the  co  worker  are  very  supportive  and  very  much  cooperative.
good,"This is a good company over-all. They have a drive for innovation and believe they desire to create a satisfying workplace. Their problem is that each new idea comes in the form of an unfunded mandate which is the buzzword, until somebody is bored with it, or it is proven to be no better than the last innovate thing they tried, for a little while."
good,Good job with amazing benefits and flexibility. Lots of opportunities to grow and improve in Career. I would highly recommend people to join this company and enjoy a great career
good,I was responsible for piping for tools. Had a crew that was cooperative and full of team players. Management were very superb.
good,"Working environment is good, people are kind to answer your questions and willing to teach you all the time."
good,"Micron has a unique business - micronization.  The provide size reduction milling services along with the particle sizing analysis, along with a wide range of analytical services predominantly for the developmental drugs.  It is owned by Colorcon, Inc.  which is a great company in itself - very unique concept and expertise."
good,Working with a team that provided 24 hour support to production systems in a fab.
good,"This is a fast pace dynamic company, they pursue their goals aggressively and reward and promote hard working individuals."
good,I worked at Micron for 7 years in the fabrication(clean room) area and also in the Quality Control lab.
good,Good team work within the team and also within different department.
good,"Micron is trying to evolve into a systems company rather than a producer of DRAMs, flash, SSDs (ie from a component supplier). "
good,Great place to play with new innovative products; exciting new co-workers that matured into long-term personal friendships
good,"Great place to work, but due to the fact that they are shipping all the jobs to Hyderbad, I am not able to get hired on as a full employee. I would love to work here."
good,"Not a place where you can learn and develop. This is the reason I left. They hire the skills they need externally.   A lot of companies these day do this so not picking on Micron. Again, some amazingly talented people to work with. Some great managers also."
good,There's always going to be positive and negative things with a large company. Great work and great co-workers. If I had more to say I would say it. As it is there is nothing else to say.
good,Micron is one of the largest company in semiconductor industry. The benefits here are good. But the work-life balance for some departments is not very good. OT payment is provided.
good,"Most days were different depending on the state of the many equipment in the dept, My typical day would with a passdown from the previous shift technician since Micron Technology is a 24/7 manufacturing company, I will then work on any equipment that are in need of repairs and then proceeded with performing PMs on equipment that required it. Management for the most part will leave alone as long as I am keeping myself busy.The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with my co-workers."
good,"Micron Is a fast paced, highly collaborative environment to work in but recently has moved to a cut throat environment under the new CEO’s direction. If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen is what he likes to say when asked about the new environment. The benefits and compensation are very good, but with this new culture, the job security aspect has taken a big hit, and in an area like Boise where there are few jobs that have comparable compensation, it puts employees with families at risk of having to move every review period. So if you are single or comfortable with that type of work culture, then Micron is a pretty good place to work."
good,Good company.  Allot of training.  Good benefits.  Competitive salary.  Opportunity to improve and build career.  A very diverse company.  With jobs all over the world.
good,Fun workplace with good people. Too much training of non job related subjects and not enough training of work related tasks. Lots of paid vacation with average benefits.
good,"Some of the Best Managers and some of the WORST."
good,Micron is a large company with a diversified team member demographic.  Micron is large enough to allow movement from one career to the next if you get bored!
good,co-workers are wonderful and the new upgrades they are doing will really benefit the company. It is sad that so many people are losing there job however they are upgrading.
good,"Plenty of opportunities to prove yourself and work on cutting edge technology.  Some groups are more demanding than others.  Due to the nature of this worldwide company, many meetings outside of typical work hours."
good,"A typical day is full of variety, fast-paced, and sometimes bound by tight deadlines and lean resources. People who fit with the culture don't mind working in this kind of environment."
good,Hard but satisfying work. Required specialized clothing that could be prohibitive. Would have considered maintaining employment if compensation would have been acceptable.
good,"Micron is a good place to work as an intern. The company puts a lot of effort into matching interns with the best group for their skills and interests. Work is usually interesting and of importance, but they don't push the interns too hard. They also provide intern activities outside of work."
good,"I tested memory modules on various motherboards for compatibility. Some trouble-shooting of motherboards, data collection. As a night shift worker, a lot of autonomy. "
good,Micron is a global corporation with good benefits. The workplace is fast paced and has continuous training. The company will help with furthering education.
good,"Among semiconductor manufacturing company in Singapore, Micron is in the lead position of work environment."
good,I've been working from Monday to Friday from 0800 hours to 1700 hours and Saturday from 0800 hours to 1200 hours. I've learned a lot of new things here. It was a great experience for me and the culture here was just nice. Sometimes I have to do a lot of inspection and reports due to QC and Clients request but that's was ok for me and I enjoyed that things.
good,"The work/life balance at Micron and benefits are great. But if you're not in one of the main office branches, you can't expect any personal development or growth opportunities. "
good,Fun to be a part of it. Wehas a very productive environment with very good coordination. All the team are well known about there task and and happy to accept the mistakes when occured.
good,"The team environment is rewarding and fun. The work is challenging and cutting edge, as long you are part of the better engineering departments."
good,It's a great place to work. Great benefit. But its a competitive industry so you have to be pro-active. Work shift are 12 hours if you are working in the fabrication floor. You also have to wear full body smock to work on the floor.
good,Difficult and stressful but overall well run company. Company is growing quite rapidly and so there is a lot of change going on. There has been a tendency to build bureaucratic systems that do not seem well served.
good,"Great place to work. "
good,Semiconductor industry is a cyclical industrial with may ups and downs.  The downs trends have tendency to eliminate the weaker players.  From the peak to now there were 40-50 memory chip makers now we are down to about 4.  There not much more to cut and the future of manufacturing in the US will be difficult.
good,"The work at Micron is wonderful, I enjoy what I do and the experience I am gaining. I yearn for more responsibility, however. Micron seems to have every intention of keeping me, but unfortunately I have grown restless."
good,Great job.  Lots of time off.  Pay is low.  Only worked half the year and had tons of vacation.  As a technician your skills aren't challenged enough.
good,"It is a great place to work with huge opportunity of learning especailly for new graduates. I learnt a great deal of project management as well as in depth technical knowledge in Process Control as well as Quality Management"
good,"The Semiconductor manufacturing is a fast pace and demanding industry.  The production loading plans changes according to market demands which affected the tools installation & tools conversion schedule in which I am responsible.  With changes, I will have to re-assess the master control schedule, material availability, contractors manpower resource capability, risk assessment impact review to meet the change."
good,"At Micron its work hard from badge swipe to badge swipe. I learned quite a bit in Fab support. Its a unique environment as you interact with every module so you learn a little about all fab processes from implant to CMP which gives you a leading edge over a Fab tech who only learns their respective module. The management team while I was in the team was rather dynamic as it was during a ramp, it changed often and restructured often, all together it wasn't bad still. Not much room for advancement at the time as it is a small group. Hardest part, chemicals, it's a dangerous job, abatement in itself is hazardous but it makes the job exciting, but at the end of the day you always get to leave with the feeling of I fixed something."
good,Micron Technology was a great company to work for. Tough to grow with the company with limited opportunities.
good,Micron has a very good overall compensation package. The greatest part of working at MICRON was the people and the challenging work.  The compressed workweek allows for 4 days off a week to spend time with your family.
good,at time they didn't have good training department . co workers where great got along with them all . the hardest was long hours. the most was just having a job .
good,"Worked at Micron as an equipment technician. If you like to tinker with and fix things, it is an enjoyable job. Because it is a high volume fab, sometimes the pressure you are under can suck the fun out of a successful repair. I was fortunate enough that most of my peers were folks with good character and a generally good work ethic. I was also able to learn from seasoned technicians who were eager to pass along their knowledge. There is a bit of micro-management going on, but because of the nature of a high volume factory, it goes with the territory. The only real beef with the place I personally have is that promotion can be tough and sometimes you can get stuck where you are at for long time. The 12 hour shifts can be rough and you can lose time with family and friends, but if you're used to it, you almost don't notice it."
good,Excellent Engineering activities.
good,"12 hour Shift working rotation 2 weeks morning day shift 3days follows off 4days, then 2nd week 4 days morning shift following off 3 days. "
good,Had a good experience with Micron.  My coworkers were great and supportive.  Only left because I had a long commute from Richmond.  Would had stayed there for a long time
good,Micron is a very busy and interesting place to work. The management is very supportive and promotion opportunities are endless. Micron is always striving to become a better place to work is always taking steps and measurements to keep the company profitable.
good,"Working as a process Engineer nothing was the same day to day. Always had challenging tasks, training personnel and continuous learning opportunities."
good,"I have learnt to work under stress and able to multi task."
good,"Micron offers good pay, benefits and bonuses and opportunity to grow and advance; depending on your department."
good,"I worked here just over a year. The overall culture of the company was positive, but it did seem to lack that ""family"" atmosphere that I had at a previous semiconductor company. The cost of living in Manassas is fairly steep and the salary was not enough for me to be able to move there. I tried to make the commute, but it proved to be unsustainable."
good,I would have never left Micron if I didn't have to. Unfortunately my job was transferred to Taiwan so my entire department was forced to find new jobs or take a severance package. I loved working for Micron although the job security was tough. In my almost 4 years of working there I witnessed 6 layoff periods and then the department transfer. It was tough to constantly go through or be nervous if you would have a job or not during the next layoff.
good,My role as an technician was to perform my daily duties and complete reports for engineers and provide accurate data so they can make informed decisions.
good,"This is a typical old school large MNC - very stable, good work-life balance, but your pay may be crawling a bit. Of course depending where you are in the company things can be very different."
good,Good place to work with good people. We worked on rotating shifts and are busy constantly. The management is caring and supportive of the people that work there.
good,"fun work place, clean , good management, time paid of , a lot of hours if you need more hours its a good place for micron employees but not good and safe for contractors"
good,"Great place to work, high tech with opportunity for advancement and professional development. Appreciated the opportunity to work in my specialty in the Semi conductor business, however, 4hour one way commute challenging to work life balance."
good,Great co-workers and supervisor.  Workplace culture was fairly typical for semi-conductor company. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the actual work. The work was constantly evolving with each process node which kept the work interesting.
good,NIce place to work as of work culture. Enjoyed working in the company. It is better to improve on pay schemes and work life balance aspect. Enjoyed the working
good,"I enjoyed working at Micron because no two days were the same!  I never knew what I would need to do each day and I looked forward to learning something new about the equipment I worked on each day."
good,"I enjoyed my job, I was sorry that it ended and was shipped over sea's.  I would like to have finished my career there.  The work was stressful at times, but over all I enjoyed it."
good,"Typical day as a QC tech was hectic, long (12 hours), and fast paced.  Weekends were great:  3 to 4 days.  All in all, it was a great job.  Hardest part was dealing with people who made the same mistakes over and over.  Good part of the job was you didn't know exactly what the shift would bring you and it kept you guessing."
good,"trabalhar na empresa micron foi satisfatorio, aprimorei minhas habilidades em relação a computação. possui uma boa equipe de profissionais."
good,"A typical day would be coming into work and taking passdown from previous shift. Check for any incoming product and priority lots. Work with a bunch of different people from different cultures. Training people on all sorts of equipment. Read e-mails, answer phones, and instant messages. Take required classes for department. Read procedures and look for any changes that might be needed. Most enjoyable part of job is working with a bunch of diverse people. Learning new tools. Hardest part of the job is working 12 hrs."
good,"Great place to further your education. Depends on your education                         24/7                       operation.                         Long shift,                  great people to work                with!"
good,"Good company to work for"
good,The semiconductor business is a highly competitive due to the tremendous requirements for quality while keeping productivity as efficient as possible.  Tremendous competition from global companies forces the to apply constant improvement pressures on the employees and production equipment.  Due to these factors it is a high stress business which can be rewarding to those who are willing to make the sacrifice of time and leisure.
good,"Still a great company in the valley and likely unmatched wrt salary ranges in Boise.  Success is less driven by the corporate development efforts and more left to individual drive...if you are driven, you can succeed.  Very department specific wrt leadership style and culture....many acquisitions, long time managers and lack of corporate discipline here create the variance...that said, everything is what you make of it."
good,Co-workers were professional and great people to work with.  Work was challenging.  Not much opportunity for promotion within a team.  Saw most people change teams in order to advance.
good,"Daily duties included overseeing, training, tracking, visual inspection, testing and packaging on the night shift. I learned many computer applications, product detail and testing product.The hardest part of the job was keeping my team productive when the work flow was slow. This was usually resolved by working closely with other areas to find work they could assist with. I enjoyed both the interaction with co-workers and the problem solving to improve or clarify processes."
good,"Learned to collaborate as well as drive change, as was needed in our group to bring two different Quality organizations into one in a new company. Learning the methods used on the other technologies, questioning and then determining how and what of these to use on NOR Flash was a learning experience."
good,"After having an experience of more than 10 years in the industry, i have seen lots of ups and downs and the most important thing this has taught me is to have a positive attitude at all times and never shy away from a challenge. I had the fortune of working with some highly motivated and smart people and am sure that it has made me wiser with time."
good,"Very busy and don't find time for personal life. Job security is guaranteed but career advancement is slow. Benefit is so so because of the industry environment, only good thing is OT pay."
good,"From what I remember it was a good place to work. It was a friendly, caring place to work. It was just to far to drive every day."
good,"This is what I would describe as a relaxed, high pressure work environment.  It is very much about the numbers.  The challenges handed to you are difficult, rewarding, and exciting.  The pace is fast.  In the proper department, the teamwork contributions are very rewarding."
good,It was a great opportunity to learn new technology and develop my skills.  I learned a lot while working there throughout my career
good,Good company to work for good pay and advancement opportunities. Rotating shifts for Technicians was less than desirable and industry is cyclical which results in layoffs unfortunately.  
good,Interesting and challenging place to work; daily interactions with machines kept you on top of your skills. New challenges with said machines to inspire troubleshooting and problem solving. 12 hour work days with on site cafeteria provided and quiet rooms to relax in. Management was always helpful and looked for your best interest and let you know what it took to advance in the company. This was the only real experience I had in my electrical engineering field and i enjoyed it very much.
good,I liked working at Micron Technology for the summer internship. The teams are good and collaborative. There is good work-life balance and I would love to return back for Full-Time.
good,"employees are empowered to make decision, good leadership, and productive work culture. Fast pace work environment and tones of exposure. Full of training programs."
good,"Shipping department is repetitive. I worked as a temp for 10 months, hoping to be hired by Micron. I learned everything i could, only to be told we are closing our doors at the warehouse to move the shipping department to mexico."
good,"Micron was a great place to work, with great people and many benefits for it's employees. I learned a lot while I worked there and Micron encouraged my personal development. Towards the end, there were some policies that were implemented that seemed to be directed at creating turnover rather than rewarding loyalty. I still think it is a great company for a career minded individual."
good,I enjoyed the learning curve/ the people and when I finally worked a day shift position the hrs worked out better for family. The benefits were good and gave stock options to people in leadership.
good,"Friendly, productive, good benefits.  I have learned a lots from this company.  The directive managers were good.  Only one bad thing with me was seeing co workers/friends being walked out time by times last few years.(And then me at last!)"
good,"I worked at Micron for 19 yrs. Grateful for the job. Made it through numerous layoffs, except this one. Looking for work after 19 yrs. "
good,Micron is a good company for the area. They pay well and have a good paid time off program. They have good management in most areas and work with personal schedules well. They pay for going back to college if industry related and you maintain a passing grade of C or better. All in a not a bad company to work for but limited growth if you don't have a BS degree.
good,"Good organization, but outsourcing more and more jobs. Great for those withing the engineering field. Still lots of potential in the R&D sector. Good benefits."
good,Depending on which group you hire with this is a good place to work with good co-workers. I have worked for good and bad managers it just depends on the area.
good,I genuinely liked going to work.  It was filled with many intelligent and hard working people from all corners of the earth.  I enjoyed it and I would do it again.
good,"Quite a bit of ""politics"" there. If you were not close with someone up high, your chances of getting a better job position definitely decreases. Benefits and pay were good though."
good,"Monitor tool performance, preventative maintenance on assigned tool sets"
good,"It is my first Job here in US and learned the new working culture."
good,good place to work enjoyed my duties and my job. liked the challenges that were presented to me im my position and achieving the challenges. made sure all customers were taken care of and all of their needs were met.
good,"This was a great job, but I am getting laid off, It was a great career. Lots of opportunity for training to better your chance of advancement. Good benefits and Great people. Unfortunately most of the jobs are being sent overseas."
good,"The working environment is great. The company promote healthy working and living. We had gym on site, walking path, baseball, basketball field and play ground for kids. We were encouraged to do exercise daily. It makes the day going fast."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people. The camaraderie in the workplace is above the norm. The collaborative spirit runs high in the culture at Micron.
good,"Micron's Fab is a High pace work area with reasonable management and a plethora of learning involved. Plenty of overtime opportunities; however, the pay at Micron is somewhat lacking and without working overtime the income isn't quite there."
good,"Liked working as a documentation specialist since it was related with my field of study (computer science) and worked coding with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Also learned and worked with electronic record keeping, record retention, documentation and ISO 9001 auditor experience. Good company, great experience."
good,"Very good company"
good,"I worked in that company on few positions at the beginning I packed USB and other parts to computer, after moved me on the machine which packed modules memory card. I think about company that working goods but is to many polish people and to many false people   ."
good,Good salary and Good hours.  Learned a lot of troubleshooting and amintainace
good,"Arrivo nella struttura con turni mattutini/pomeridiani. "
good,"There are plenty of opportunities for advancement but that may vary by department or location. Working in R&D is great and you are forefront of the most advanced semiconductor processing. I truly enjoy my job, coworkers, and managers. They promote a good work/life balance and do not expect you to work extremely long hours. They also offer ample training and seminars which is a definite bonus."
good,"To do well you have to accept and be part of the culture, and work hard and be willing to learn"
good,I start the day with a pass down with the night shift. Then will check all my tools and get ready for the day. Need to have everythin in order by 7am to have a quick meeting with the engineering team to make sure we are on the same page. Then just run my tools thur out the day.
good,"I worked a 12 hr. shift where I was the engineering lead for PECVD,Implant, PVD, and LPCVD. I learned both the process and the quipment side of those areas along with managing the people maintaing the areas. I also interacted with production with their needs and priorities, The hardest part was the balancing act with what production needed at the time and finding/providing the resources to meet their needs. I had a great feeling when all our monthly goals were met."
good,Good team of co-workers and some of the management staff is supportive. Long days or nights some opportunity for growth. Benefits were good.
good,They were a good company to work for and I enjoyed dthe job. I did not like living in Boise
good,"Great place to work with a great culture. Innovative ideas are always welcomed. When working holidays, meals are provided for both the day and night shifts."
good,"Good environment and management who encourages to do innovative work."
good,"While working with various groups, processing international and domestic shipments I learned how to implement problem solving "
good,"Typical work day is rarely typical, constantly changing and shifting priorities often within the same day. The hardest part is shifting from night shift to day shift every 4 months."
good,I loved my time there and all of my coworkers were nice. I learned a lot about software design but I had no struggled to understand the layout of the building. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,I saw many changes at Micron in my 31 years there. Some for the best and some I didn't agree with. Overall it is a good place to work and they have provided me with the skills I possess today.
good,"Micron was an awesome place to work!  I worked as a contractor, so there was no job security :(.  I gave my job 110% at all times so that if a position opened up, they would see my job performance and hopefully pick me as the new candidate!  I loved what I did!  I performed the security of visitors and/or employee access when badges were forgotten.  I helped onboard new employees by using E-Verify and assisted with new employee orientation.  I was the front office ""face"" greeting the public, employees, visitors and vendors.  I handled all shipping/receiving utilizing ShipDoc and ShipOut including complex international shipping.  I assisted upper management with calendar events, and completing expense reports as needed.  I utilized MS Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint daily!  I had many different responsibilities, but I loved it and it kept me busy at ALL times!  The days just flew by when I worked there!  I would love to work for a company with a cool culture and a lot of work to do!"
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Micron as a Production Operator. I was employed there twice, and was able to grow my career the first time I worked there by becoming a Trainer and a Lead Operator. It seems, though, that the company cares more about the bottom line than about its employees. I was laid off from my first position with the company, due to shutting down a portion of the production line rather than upgrading their machines, and the second time the company again shut down the area I worked in, opting to send it overseas for cheaper labor."
good,I really enjoyed my time here at Micron. If they didn't lay us off I wanted to make a career out of it. My department was laid back they trusted us with breaks & lunches ( ex. 60 I could take it all at once of 6 10 min breaks). I would recommend this job even with the layoffs. I will always cherish my time at Micron.
good,Micron was a pretty decent place to work.  I was required to work seven days over a two week period and they were pretty lenient with authorizing their employees wishes to work additional overtime.  The only drawback to working there was how they performed their promotions.
good,My experience at Micron has been a productive fast paced environment with plenty of opportunities to learn about new technology if you are willing to put in the extra time.
good,"The work was rewarding, but the fear of termination is not a fun part of the work environment.  With the new CEO there is less communication from top management and it is less predictable what will happen."
good,Third shift worked 4 10s. Was a good gig until the company sold and new management was horrible. They will tell you there is room for advancement but there is none.
good,"The job was a little changing but very rewarding, it definitely has everyday applications to it and teaches you useful skills. the shifts are perfect in my opinion 12 hours 3 days on 4 off flips every week to 4 days on 3 off. I enjoyed and wish I would have been able to stay."
good,"Strenuous, physically demanding work.  You will be provided feedback on your performance.  Advancement is extremely limited.  Do not expect scheduled breaks.

Last position as Production Supervisor allowed me to experience at first hand both, the responsibility for an entire shift's performance and goals and also the great feeling of building a team that felt appreciated for their job while making real connection with the team members that last to this day even though the company closed on our country.  In other words, it was a journey which sadly ended but it contributed greatly to my growth as a professional and human being."

good,"El trabajo se desarrolla en horario corrido de lunes a viernes, lo que resulta beneficioso."
good,"Micron was a growing company with many challenges and opportunities for advancement.  As technicians there we were forced to think outside of the box and constantly pushing the envelope to develop or modify equipment to do things they weren't originally designed to do.  The shift was 12 hours long with a 30 minute lunch break and the day started with a pass down from the outgoing shift to bring up to speed with what was going on.  The supervisor then discussed the priorities and every one started working.  When a piece of equipment was repaired it was put through a series of quality tests and the results were reviewed by a second technician.  It it passed all of the test the part was bagged, tagged and placed in inventory.  If it failed it was torn down to discover the reason it failed and reworked.  For me the toughest part of the job was getting adjusted to night shift because we rotated shifts every four months. The first week of shift change was particularly challenging because of the change in sleep habits.The best part of the job was the feeling of satisfaction you got when you repaired a subassembly and it went into the production area and did not come out until it was pulled because of regularly scheduled maintenance."
good,"I'm a technician my principal duties are attend process and mechanical problems in the SMT area and give support too in the test area diagnostic product fails and test machinery and do PM. I support engineer in machine programming, NPI and help to identify process improvement. Order parts for equipment down or need some future replacement. My experience in Micron and my 20 years working as technician gives me a lot of learn by outside training and in house situation. That I learn capability me so personal working with people customer satisfaction, like technical knowledge to understand machinery schematic, functionally and feel comfortable with new equipment when the situation is presented. "

good,The work environment here is very self motivated. You will have a mentor to teach you for how the process work. After that you would need to use your knowledge to show your ability to work on your own. You need to ask senior to fill your ability to perform your job.
good,It is an extremely great and fun place to work if you can get into a safe area to work. Layoffs are a common thing and so you need to keep that in mind.
good,Overall good company ethics. Challenging work and opportunity to move around departments. Not great chances of advancement. Promotions may be over looked. Chain of command is not always the best. Good work environment.

good,"12 hours shifts make for a long day but a great weekend with 3 to 4 days off. I learned much about both the industrialized world, and corporate America. However, management can get involved with processes that tend to interfere with the bottom line: doing the best you can at your job, while striving to make profit for the company in the most efficient manner possible. The workplace culture is great, very team oriented and friendly. I still have friends from Micron, and that was almost ten years ago. The hardest part of the job was the hours and some of the positions had grueling physical demands. My favorite part of the job was the fact that there was always something to learn - all you have to do is ask."
good,"i learnt a lot in Micron. I joined micron right after I graduated from university. My colleges there are helpful and I made friend with them there. My daily job is mainly to maintain the product quality during production. Hard part of the job is that when there are a lot of things on hand, I will need to allocate my time and settle them with very short of time as in semicon industry the manufacturing speed is very fast. If a problem cannot be resolved asap, then it will be huge loss to the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the working environment is very easy going, people there are really quite nice to me."

good,"I really enjoyed working at Micron, the only issue was with my young family and the schedule. It seemed that working a compressed work week would be fantastic but in the end I spent my entire ""weekend"" catching up from things that couldn't be done after work on a typical workday. With a family it was tough, I'd leave before my daughter wakes up and come home and she would be in bed. When working night shift, the extra pay was nice, but was difficult to transition back and forth in the same week to spend time with the family."
good,"I learned a lot of new things about SSD Memories and new technologies."

good,Micron will challenge you on a daily basis. The high paced manufacturing and qualification of new products is very important. The management will push you to create goals and set you up for success. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the ever changing environment and product line.

Working and standing during long shifts (12 hours) can be tiring both day or night shift, but 3 day 4 day schedule lets you have time to enjoy family. Only required to work some overtime during high volume times. Nature of the business very unsteady. Several layoffs in a 4 year time."

Micron gave me the opportunity to work overtime.It was an amazing work experience that I miss. I wish the company had not left Puerto Rico.

Then there is emails and machine running statistics that need checked for trending problems.

The 12 hour shifts actually stay busy most of the shift."
